  abstract     = {The advent of location information platforms based on global positioning systems has led to a proliferation of spatiotemporal trajectory data, which has, in turn, made the analysis of such data available to a broad range of applications, including traffic prediction, route planning, and trajectory similarity computation. Traditional methods for calculating trajectory similarity often suffer from high computational costs due to quadratic time complexity, particularly when dealing with large datasets. To this end, deep learning-based approaches to trajectory similarity learning have been proposed, with a view to offering enhanced efficiency and adaptability in comparison with traditional methods. However, these methods primarily focus on spatial trajectory similarity and fail to capture important temporal periodicity. Moreover, most of them directly use recurrent neural networks to obtain trajectory representations, while ignoring the spatial proximity information between neighboring regions. To address these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced spatiotemporal trajectory network, named GST, which integrates both spatial and temporal information to effectively learn trajectory similarity. Specifically, our model incorporates a graph neural network to capture the spatial proximity relationships and a time-embedding module to model the temporal periodicity information, thereby providing a more comprehensive spatiotemporal trajectory representation learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on 2 real-life datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy. In addition, ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed spatiotemporal learning mechanism.},

  abstract     = {From smart cities to healthcare, the internet of things (IoT) has transformed numerous industries. However, this expansion has raised security concerns, particularly cyberattacks. Traditional IoT intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have high false-positive rates and low detection accuracy due to IoT devices and traffic patterns. To overcome these challenges, this research proposes an intelligent-computing-based time series IDS that utilizes sophisticated data augmentation, signal transformation, and deep learning methods. The system begins by augmenting minority-class samples using conditional generative adversarial networks to handle class imbalance. The augmented dataset is then transformed into signal representations based on mel frequency cepstral coefficients, allowing the model to capture both the frequency and temporal characteristics of network traffic. Finally, a hybrid convolutional-neural-network–long-short-term-memory (CNN–LSTM) architecture is trained to identify anomalous behaviors with enhanced accuracy and lower false-positive rates. The proposed model utilizes the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity CICIoT2023 dataset, which is widely used for network security experiments. The results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional deep learning models in terms of accuracy, precision, and false-positive rate. Specifically, the proposed system improves accuracy by 5% to 10% across different attack types while reducing false-positive rates considerably. The research presents a detailed exploration of the advantages of signal transformation and explains how the CNN and LSTM models complement each other in detecting anomalies. This framework addresses the pressing need for intelligent time series analysis in cybersecurity through the introduction of a scalable and interpretable IDS solution specifically designed for IoT environments.},

Up to 30% of commercial pasteurized milk tested contained viral genome copies. The impact of residual viral remnants on host immunity is unknown. Orally ingested proteins can stimulate gut-associated lymphoid tissues, potentially inducing tolerance and altering responses to later infection. We found that milk pasteurization fully inactivated pandemic H1N1 and bovine H5N1 influenza viruses yet preserved hemagglutinin (HA) protein integrity. In mice, repeated oral exposure to inactivated virus did not alter mortality after H5N1 virus challenge. Preliminary data showed that naïve mice exposed to improperly pasteurized milk containing live H5N1 virus developed lethal infection, whereas prior H1N1 infection conferred protection. Mice with preexisting H1N1 immunity remained protected when challenged with bovine H5N1 virus after exposure to H5N1 pasteurized in milk.

We present a plug-and-play fiber-to-PIC solution using female multifiber termination push-on cables, with alignment counterparts additively fabricated on the chip via two-photon polymerization. We develop 3D out-of-plane couplers achieving −0.41-decibel peak transmission and broadband performance with losses below 0.55 decibels in the 1500-to 1600-nanometer range. Integration with the plug-and-play interface adds only 0.37 ± 0.12 decibels, yielding a record-low 0.78-decibel loss for passive out-of-plane packaging. Reproducibility is demonstrated by interfacing a 17-port photonic circuit for incoherent photonic computing, coupling the full 100-nanometer spectrum of a superluminescent LED to enable low-noise operation at 17.6 gigabaud. This passive, multiport, and reconfigurable approach delivers high performance, reliability, and versatility, advancing photonic packaging toward the scalability of electronic chip integration.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of fluidic vortex rings have long captivated researchers because of their complex behavior despite simple structure. Photonic toroidal vortices constitute a family of three-dimensional, spacetime nonseparable structured light fields carrying transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). However, as solutions to the dispersive Maxwells’ equations, these wave packets do not survive nondispersive propagation, and their dynamics remain elusive. In this article, the dynamics of photonic toroidal vortices under various dispersion regimes, mediated by transverse and longitudinal OAM, are investigated through simulations and experiments. The results reveal that the motion of a toroidal vortex is strongly affected by longitudinal OAM. The swirling flow destabilizes the toroidal structure under dispersion and induces topological transformations of vortex lines, characterized by annihilation and subsequent reformation in vacuum. The renascent toroidal vortex exhibits robust propagation in vacuum while maintaining its structure. These findings are supported by experimental validation and highlight the potential of photonic toroidal vortices as controllable channels for directional energy and information transfer.},

Geometric shapes, including basic forms of straight lines, sharp turns and circles, and complex patterns, were fabricated with exceptional fidelity to design specifications. We propose two heat-driven hydrodynamic locomotion mechanisms, fin-like bending and leg-like buckling. By harnessing these principles, we engineered two walkable devices—HydroFlexor and HydroBuckler—and demonstrated robust on-water locomotion.

The origins of these episodic movements and their relation to final instability remain unclear. We propose a novel “endo-exo” theory capturing the interplay between exogenous stressors such as rainfall and endogenous damage-healing processes. We predict four types of episodic dynamics, defined by the disturbance source (endogenous or exogenous) and criticality level (subcritical or critical), each with distinct power law exponent but all governed by a single parameter ϑ . These predictions are tested on the Preonzo landslide, whose sporadic activities align with the classification with ϑ ≈ 0.45 ± 0.1 . We find that its final collapse is preceded by an increased frequency of medium-to-large velocities over 1 to 2 months, signaling the transition into a catastrophic regime. Our research suggests that landslides may not permanently operate at a critical state, with major implications for forecasting catastrophic failures.},

Here, we integrate new seismic images with regional seismicity to investigate an actively fragmenting subduction system at northern Cascadia’s ridge-trench-fault triple junction where subduction termination is imminent. Our analyses reveal a broad shear-zone initiated at ~4 Ma by exploiting ridge-parallel fabrics of nascent oceanic lithosphere and progressively localized into a mature trench-perpendicular transform boundary. This process severed an oceanic microplate and enabled its diminished subduction relative to adjacent subducting lithosphere. Downdip, we image trench-parallel slab tears offset by the transform, suggesting lateral tear propagation was intersected by the transform boundary, facilitating efficient decoupling of the microplate while allowing adjacent subduction to continue. We propose a 4D model where transform boundaries drive laterally diachronous slab fragmentation and subduction termination.},

This multipass configuration also reduces the lasing threshold by nearly 70%, facilitates spectral broadening of pump pulses, and compresses the pulse duration of N 2 + lasing. Capitalizing on these combined effects, we developed a single-beam coherent Raman spectroscopy, which enables simultaneous detection of multiple species and exhibits high sensitivity at the parts-per-million level.

These MiNVs could bind natural IgG on their surface, enabling FcRn-mediated transcytosis by evading the lysosomal degradation pathway. Upon reaching the liver, MiNVs responded to the elevated levels of biothiols in the hepatic microenvironment, triggering site-specific insulin release. In type 1 diabetic rats, the oral bioavailability reached 20.4%, which is about 20-fold higher than that of free insulin. Notably, MiNVs showed effective glycemic control over long-term treatment in type 1 diabetic rat and minipig models.

The evolutionarily conserved polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C) plays multiple roles in transcription. Here, we show that PAF1C regulates the growth-defense tradeoff by repressing defense genes expression in Arabidopsis . Loss of PAF1C leads to increased expression of defense genes, enhanced disease resistance, but compromised growth. Mechanistically, PAF1C binds to defense genes, where it interacts with histone deacetylases, such as HDA6, to promote histone deacetylation, thereby repressing defense genes expression. The plant immune hormone salicylic acid (SA) promotes the interaction between PAF1 and the SA receptor NPR1, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate the polyubiquitination and degradation of PAF1. Genetically, loss of PAF1 suppresses the immune defects of the npr1 mutant, supporting the notion that PAF1 functions downstream of NPR1. Collectively, this study identifies the NPR1-PAF1C-HDA6 module that regulates the growth-defense tradeoff.},

  abstract     = {Mental health conditions like depression are associated with an elevated risk of cardiometabolic disorders, yet the mechanisms underlying this comorbidity remain poorly understood. Is metabolic dysfunction a cause of depression, a downstream consequence, or do both stem from shared underlying processes? We argue that neurocognitive mechanisms, particularly those involved in reward and effort processing, interact with metabolic physiology to shape each of these causal pathways. Metabolic signals do not act on the brain in isolation; they are embedded within a broader interoceptive system through which the brain detects and interprets bodily states. This system supports allostasis, the brain’s predictive regulation of internal physiological demands. We propose a framework of interoceptive energy allostasis in which disruptions to these predictive processes contribute to the bidirectional relationship between depression and metabolic dysfunction. By integrating perspectives from metabolic and computational psychiatry, this framework offers a theoretical lens to explain the multidirectional comorbidity between mental and metabolic ill-health.},

However, microobject transportation tasks require synergistic handling and movement, which poses a challenge for solely acoustically powered microrobots. These systems often require additional actuation mechanisms, such as magnetic control, for assistance. To address this challenge, we developed an acoustically powered micro-clampbot capable of clamping objects using claws actuated by acoustically induced secondary Bjerknes forces and moving via flagella that oscillate under acoustic input. The robot’s actions are governed by distinct acoustic frequencies, enabling precise and independent control of clamping and locomotion. The micro-clampbot can pick a single particle from a cluster and navigate delicately through narrow channels, with narrow necks (~2.1 times the width of the micro-clampbot). This system facilitates the targeted transportation of microscale objects, including live cells, without causing damage. This versatile design highlights the potential of solely acoustically powered microrobots for advanced clinical therapies and microscale operations.},

We present results from 10 independent studies with a total of 648 participants and provide clear evidence of both retroactive and proactive enhancements in weak memories, directly addressing ongoing debates about the existence of these effects. Notably, stronger salience learning facilitates proactive, but not retroactive, memory enhancement, challenging prevailing theories about salience’s role in these processes. Instead, retroactive enhancement depends on the proximity between incidentally encoded and conditioned stimuli in a high-level feature embedding extracted from a convolutional neural network, revealing a graded prioritization mechanism.

While increasing channel thickness enhances its capacitance and thereby amplifies transconductance, it simultaneously impedes ion transport kinetics, leading to slower switching speeds. Here, we present a three-dimensional electrolyte-surrounded OECT architecture that redefines ion transport dynamics by enabling multidirectional ion doping to the channel for efficient and rapid switching. Our proposed approach achieves a remarkable enhancement in the operational bandwidth of OECTs, reaching 26 kHz while preserving their high transconductance, notably using a commercially available conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate). This is enabled by micro/nanostructured channel design that enhances ion accessibility and minimizes parasitic effects. This advancement allows for continuous, wide-frequency neural signal recording from peripheral nerves. This work offers a robust strategy for achieving both high transconductance and fast switching in OECTs, establishing a foundation for the development of next-generation, high-speed bioelectronic interfaces.},

Our findings indicate that a topological transition occurs in response to modulation frequency increases, producing anomalous edge states with chirality within Floquet harmonic bandgaps. The open nature of the metasurface facilitates harmonic generation via Floquet edge states. Experimentally, we confirm the existence of Floquet harmonic bands and the robust unidirectional propagation of these edge states. In addition, we propose a large-scale coding scheme to dynamically reconfigure propagation paths through programmable binary states of the meta-units.

Expression of the closely related LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) also requires TOC1 but is independent of TOC1 phosphorylation, suggesting different TOC1-dependent gene repression mechanisms. We additionally show that TOC1 phosphorylation–dependent interactions at specific clock gene promoters selectively regulate these circadian system components more acutely than nonrhythmic genes. Our genome-wide analysis demonstrates that the TOC1 phosphostate is important for optimal chromatin presence and robust rhythmic gene expression.},

Here, we show that interfacial microstructure and mechanics, regulated by spontaneous or ventilator-induced sighs, play a critical role. Using interfacial rheometry and structural analysis, including in situ neutron reflectometry and Raman-based techniques, we find that sighs enrich the air-liquid interface with saturated lipids, triggering structural rearrangements. This periodic “reset” transforms the layer into a mechanically robust, DPPC-rich film, where compressional hardening counteracts tension. These findings highlight the nonequilibrium dynamics of surfactant layers and underscore the importance of interfacial compressive stresses, not just tension, in governing lung mechanics. This mechanism helps sustain low interfacial stress and high compliance, offering mechanistic insight to guide protective ventilation strategies upon lung trauma and possibilities to optimize surfactant-enabled pulmonary treatment.},

Through integrative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we identified STK11 as a key transcriptional and metabolic regulator during M2 polarization. STK11 deficiency enhanced the expression of M2-associated markers and promoted glutamine metabolism in IL-4–stimulated macrophages. Mechanistically, STK11 deficiency led to increased FOXO1 activation, thereby promoting M2 polarization. Pharmacological inhibition of FOXO1 or glutamine metabolism effectively reversed the enhanced M2 polarization. In an orthotopic model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, myeloid-specific deletion of STK11 resulted in increased accumulation of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages, impaired antitumor immunity, and accelerated tumor progression. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for STK11 in modulating M2 macrophage polarization, offering mechanistic insights that may inform the development of immunometabolic therapies for pancreatic cancer.},

  abstract     = {Dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) offers a promising alternative to invasive blood tests and opportunities for skin diagnostics. Progress in both the understanding and adoption of ISF tests is hindered by sampling challenges, including lengthy collection times, non-negligible failure rates, variable collection volumes, and inconsistent bioanalyte levels. The causes of many of these issues are not well understood. We demonstrate a microneedle device that is several times faster than state of the art, collecting an average of 15.5 mg of ISF in 5 minutes in humans with near-zero failure rate. This improvement was achieved by designing the spatial pressure gradient driving ISF flow. The influence of penetration depth, collection time, pressure, and age on ISF collection was elucidated, with Darcy’s law explaining multiple observations. A data-driven acceptance criterion of <1% blood contamination for ISF is proposed. The device and findings presented will empower researchers to better conduct robust studies in the development of ISF diagnostics.},

  abstract     = {Canonical N -methyl- d -aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels with critical roles in the development and function of the nervous system. The excitatory currents they produce reflect stochastic transitions between multiple agonist-bound closed- and open-pore states. We leveraged the intrinsically high open probability ( P o ) of NMDARs composed of GluN1 and GluN2A subunits, together with judiciously chosen mutants and ligands, to achieve conditions in which receptors had a P o near unity. Using single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we captured three activated receptor states, each with distinct conformations of the gate-forming M3 helices. Separately, we carried out single-channel electrophysiology, together with statistical modeling, to relate the cryo-EM structures to the gating reaction. NMDAR channel opening involves bending of the pore-forming M3 helices to produce a transient open-channel conformation, subsequently stabilized by new interactions between the D2-M3 linkers with the pre-M1 helices and the pre-M4 loops, to yield the stable open channel.},

Here, we describe the engineering of aggregated CiliaBots (AggreBots) to augment control over CiliaBot structural parameters and, consequently, motility patterns through guided, modular aggregation of human airway epithelial spheroids [referred to as CiliaBot building blocks (CBBs)]. Multi-CBB aggregation generated rod-, triangle-, and diamond-shaped AggreBots, altering tissue geometry without sacrificing surface cilia density or inter-CBB boundary fidelity. The further introduction of CCDC39 -mutated CBBs as cilia-inactive modules enabled the generation of hybrid AggreBots with precision modulation of active cilia distribution, further empowering alterations to motility patterns. Our results demonstrate the potential of AggreBots as living tissue propellers with morphological “levers” by which modifications to tissue motility can be theoretically planned and experimentally verified.},

NLRP3 protein expression is tightly controlled by the ubiquitin system. In particular, NLRP3 protein degradation has been extensively studied. In contrast, the mechanisms to stabilize NLRP3 protein are much less known. Here, we demonstrated the critical role of ubiquitin-specific protease 13 (USP13) in regulating NLRP3 protein stability and inflammasome activation independently of its deubiquitinating enzyme activity. USP13 competes with E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM31 to interact with NLRP3 and prevents TRIM31-mediated NLRP3 ubiquitination at K192 and K496 sites, thereby inhibiting proteasomal degradation of NLRP3. USP13 deficiency reduces NLRP3 protein expression in both human and mouse macrophages, which consequently inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. Accordingly, deficiency of USP13 attenuates monosodium urate crystal–induced mouse peritonitis. Overall, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism of NLRP3 stability by USP13 and provide a potential therapeutic target for NLRP3-driven diseases.},

However, the therapeutic potential of liver-targeted ceramide lowering remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that elevated ceramide levels in MASH patients and mouse models are closely associated with the activation of hepatic de novo ceramide synthesis. The analysis of human hepatic single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data revealed predominant up-regulation of SPTLC2 , which encodes a subunit of the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo ceramide synthesis pathway, in hepatocytes. By targeted inhibition of SPTLC2 with lipid nanoparticle–mediated siRNA delivery to hepatocytes, we reduced both hepatic and circulating ceramide levels. This intervention suppressed hepatic lipid uptake and lipogenesis, thereby alleviating MASH progression. Therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated in an 8-week methionine-choline–deficient diet-induced MASH model and validated in a 1-year choline-deficient high-fat diet–induced MASH model. Our findings highlight hepatocyte Sptlc2 as a promising therapeutic target for MASH.},

Two affected siblings presented with a range of clinical features including impaired motor coordination, muscle atrophy, foot deformities, and positive Babinski sign. Using different preparations including recombinant human and mouse NAMPT proteins, patient fibroblasts, and mouse model, we showed that the p.P158A mutation decreased NAMPT enzyme activity, leading to disrupted cellular bioenergetics, metabolic derangements, and increased oxidative stress. Moreover, the p.P158A mutation could cause synaptic dysfunction and motor neuron degeneration in the mouse model.

  abstract     = {Structural plasticity of dendritic spines is a fundamental mechanism of learning and memory. It depends on the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). However, to bind TrkB, BDNF requires proteolytic cleavage to its mature form. Here, we demonstrate that MMP-9, an extracellular protease essential for neuronal function, plays a key role in this process. We show that, like BDNF, MMP-9 is rapidly released in response to synaptic stimulation, and its proteolytic activity, restricted to the activated spine, can be detected as early as 2 min after stimulation. Using two-photon microscopy and single-spine stimulation by glutamate uncaging, we demonstrate that MMP-9 action is important for TrkB activation and is required for structural plasticity. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a direct cleavage of proBDNF into mature BDNF by MMP-9. Our findings reveal a critical interaction between MMP-9 and BDNF through their autocrine regulation of TrkB activation and dendritic spine structural changes.},

This restriction can be bypassed by instead measuring commuting modular observables, which are counterparts to the naturally incompatible observables. Here, we measure modular observables to estimate small changes in position and momentum with a single-mode multiparameter sensor. We deterministically prepare grid states in the mechanical motion of a trapped ion and demonstrate uncertainties in position and momentum below the standard quantum limit (SQL). Further, we examine another pair of incompatible observables—number and phase. We prepare a different resource—number-phase states—and demonstrate a metrological gain over the SQL.

Deep learning enables ultrafast reconstruction but is limited to spectra of up to three dimensions and cannot provide faithful reconstruction under unseen acceleration factors. Extending deep learning to handle higher-dimensional spectra and varying acceleration factors is desirable. However, scalability requires complex networks and more data, seriously hindering applications. To address this, we designed a network to learn data in one dimension (1D). First, time-domain signals were modeled as the outer product of 1D exponentials. Then, each 1D exponential was approximated with a rank-one Hankel matrix. Last, reconstruction error was corrected with a neural network. Here, we demonstrate robust 3D NMR reconstruction across acceleration factors (2 to 33) using one trained network. In addition, we find that reconstruction of 4D NMR is possible with artificial intelligence. This work opens an avenue for accelerating arbitrarily high-dimensional NMR.},

Here, we investigate changes in immune cell glycocalyx with age and find that α2,6-linked sialic acid, a glycan epitope associated with inhibitory signaling, is down-regulated in T cells from old animals. This reduction is tightly correlated with age-associated accumulation of effector T cells, which have little to no α2,6-linked sialic acid. To understand how α2,6-linked sialic acid affects T cell physiology, we generated a mouse model with T cell–specific deletion of sialyltransferase gene St6gal1 . The lack of α2,6-linked sialic acid leads to reduced responsiveness in naïve T cells, leading to impaired T cell responses against Listeria monocytogenes infection and tumor growth. PD-1 pathway blockade partially restores St6gal1 -deficient T cells’ ability to control tumor growth. These findings suggest that α2,6-linked sialic acid is critical for maintaining long-term T cell responsiveness, and its loss may contribute to decreased T cell function with age.},

  abstract     = {To increase reproductive success, many species synchronize reproductive behavior with a particular phase of the lunar cycle. The human menstrual cycle has also a period close to that of the lunar cycle, and recent studies suggest a temporary synchrony between menstrual and lunar cycles. Nevertheless, lunar influence on human reproductive behavior remains controversial. Here, we analyzed long-term menstrual records of individual women from the past 24 years and compared them with records from the past century. We show that women’s menstrual cycles recorded before the introduction of light-emitting diodes in 2010 and the extensive use of smart phones significantly synchronized with the Moon, while those after 2010 coupled to the Moon mostly in January. We hypothesize that the high gravimetric forces between the Moon, Sun, and Earth every January are sufficient for this coupling, while the increasing exposure to artificial light at night impinges on synchrony at other times.},

The foregut and hindgut circuits of the C. elegans enteric nervous system (ENS) control feeding and defecation behavior, respectively. Here, we show that epithelial cells in the midgut integrate feeding state information to control these behavioral outputs by releasing distinct neuropeptidergic signals. In favorable conditions, insulin and noninsulin peptides released from midgut epithelia activate foregut and hindgut enteric neurons, respectively, to sustain normal feeding and defecation behavior. During food scarcity, altered insulin signaling from sensory neurons activates the transcription factor DAF-16/FoxO in midgut epithelia, which blocks both peptidergic signaling axes to the ENS by transcriptionally shutting down the intestinal neuropeptide secretion machinery. Our findings demonstrate that midgut epithelial cells act as integrators relaying internal state information to distinct parts of the ENS to control animal behavior.},

We generated life-course embeddings using unsupervised machine learning on data from 2.2 million individuals born from 1980 to 2015. We used this landscape to identify neighboring factors of sleep problems. We observed a substantial increase in self-reported sleep problems among individuals aged 15 to 45, from 34 to 49% between 2010 and 2021, and a 10-fold increase in melatonin use. We also found relevant clusters of sleep-related prescriptions, diagnoses, and procedures with age-specific incidence patterns. Specific childhood adversities, such as sibling psychiatric illness, foster care, and parental divorce, were shared factors across multiple sleep disorders such as insomnia and nightmares. These findings underscore the complex interplay between medical and psychosocial factors in sleep.},

The sensor enables direct probing of the amide I band in sub-10-nanometer proteins. By using s-CFW to amplify target spectral features, the developed physics-informed CNN achieves a mean relative error of less than 0.1 in predicting secondary structure percentages, more than twice as accurate as a pristine CNN. This method enables in situ and real-time quantification of subtle conformational changes during protein assembly, thereby addressing the issue of data scarcity that now hinders the development of advanced deep learning models for predicting protein dynamics and interactions in physiological environments.},

The artificial olfactory neuron module is developed by connecting a GeSe-based ovonic threshold switch and a micro–light-emitting diode (μLED) platform–based semiconductor metal oxide gas sensor in series. The use of μLED gas sensors enables ultralow-power operation, resulting in substantially decreased power consumption. The artificial olfactory neuron module generates spike signals with low operation voltage, demonstrating energy efficiency and advanced performance.

PreTfr are expandable in vitro while retaining suppressive capacity. They are transcriptionally similar to naïve T regs (nT regs ) ex vivo, but after stimulation, they gain increased expression of Tfr-related suppressive molecules such as IL-1RA, suggesting that they are primed for full differentiation into mature Tfr. Further, we demonstrate that preTfr but not nT reg are significantly reduced in the blood of patients with COVID-19 and patients with sepsis and that this loss is correlated with increased anti–interferon-γ antibodies and activated atypical B cells. Together, these data suggest that Tfr are disrupted at the earliest stage of their formation during severe disease and may be an important therapeutic target in future vaccine developments.},

Here, we analyze this trade-off and show a sublinear scaling relationship between toolkit richness and tool part richness in ethnographic societies. This result indicates diminishing returns where each additional part contributes less to overall toolkit diversity. This scaling holds across diverse ecological and cultural contexts, suggesting a general principle of optimization in tool design. Ethnographic toolkits achieve their adaptability by reusing a core set of versatile parts and selectively incorporating more specialized parts. However, increasing richness also increases complexity, and complexity is costly. We formalize these dynamics within a combinatorial optimization framework and discuss the implications.},

The molecular characteristics of infiltrating GBM cells and their interactions with brain cells remain poorly understood, partly due to limited spatial tools for distinguishing tumor cells from those in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we introduce Spatially-resolved Chimeric AnalyzeR (SCAR), a computational tool for dissecting tumor-TME gene expression in spatial transcriptomics of human-mouse chimeric cancer models. SCAR reveals spatially distinct characteristics of GBM and their interactions with TME, identifying that infiltrative GBM up-regulates creatine kinase brain type (CKB) at the astrocyte-enriched leading edge compared to the tumor core. Mechanistically, GBM-secreted CKB catalyzes the extracellular conversion of astrocyte-supplied adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine into phosphocreatine, providing metabolic support for infiltrative tumor growth, which can be blocked by cyclocreatine. These results provide proof-of-concept validation of SCAR and demonstrate spatial context–dependent metabolic rewiring of GBM cells, with implications for therapies targeting infiltrative GBM.},

Here, we introduce high–molecular-weight poly(thioglycolic acid) (PTGA) that exhibits not only closed-loop recyclability but also i PP-like thermal properties, even superior mechanical and barrier properties, and processability well suited for common processing techniques such as blow molding into bottles. To circumvent long-standing challenges of extensive transthioesterification side reactions in the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of thioglycolide, which typically yielded only oligomers, we developed the interfacial chain-growth ROP occurring at the interface between the semicrystalline polymer surface and the monomer–organocatalyst solution phase, enabling the synthesis of high–molecular-weight PTGA. Overall, we show that PTGA is a scalable circular polymer that provides i PP-like properties and that the interfacial ROP method solves the challenges in typical solution-phase polymerization.},

Here, we report that barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) infection activates metacaspase 4 (MC4) to cleave the RNA binding protein lupus autoantigen 1 (La1) behind residue arginine-448. The cleaved La1 1-448 version relocates to the cytoplasm and promotes the R-motif–mediated cap-independent defense mRNA translation. Moreover, MC4 overexpression restricts BSMV infection in tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ), whereas knockout of MC4 and knockdown of La1 are more susceptible to diverse plant virus infection. To counteract plant defense, the BSMV γb protein directly interacts with and inhibits the self-processing of MC4 and subsequent La1 cleavage, thereby impairing La1-mediated immune responses. Collectively, our findings unveil a hitherto unknown defense mechanism whereby the MC4-La1 cleavage module inhibits virus infection by coordinating R-motif–mediated defense mRNA translation.},

  abstract     = {Spatiotemporal gene expression is the fundamental feature of cellular differentiation, including neuron differentiation. The epigenetic mechanism underlying spatiotemporal gene regulation during in vivo neuron differentiation remains largely unknown. Granule cells (GCs) constitute the vast majority of neurons in the cerebellum, which contains most of neurons in the brain. Here, we show that Atoh1-Cre –mediated knockout (ACKO) of Kmt2d encoding the lysine methyltransferase KMT2D (MLL4) in cerebellar GC lineage inhibits the transition of GC progenitors to GCs while cell non-autonomously affecting other cerebellar cells. Kmt2d ACKO impaired cerebellum-associated behaviors and caused facial peculiarity, microcephaly, and reduced body size in mice. KMT2D temporally activated neuronal differentiation programs in cerebellar GCs. KMT2D-mediated activation of the key neuronal transcription factor genes En2 , Pax6 , and Myt1l via super-enhancer/enhancer programming was critical for GC differentiation. These findings reveal a unique epigenetic mechanism in which KMT2D temporally orchestrates gene expression required for cerebellar GC differentiation by programming neuronal enhancers.},

  abstract     = {Lipid droplets (LDs) are organelles with a neutral lipid core surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer, which is continuous with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). LD function depends on a highly dynamic LD surface proteome. Key proteins continuously exchange between the ER and LDs; however, the mechanisms governing the interorganelle movement and accumulation on the LD surface remain poorly understood. Here, we developed an ex cellulo tool introducing a classification of ER-derived proteins based on their different affinity for LDs. We find that proteins with higher LD affinity can effectively displace those with lower affinity from the LD surface, identifying steric hindrance as a key mechanism in regulating ER-to-LD protein transfer. Consistent with this model, we show that, during adipocyte differentiation Plin1—an adipocyte-specific high-affinity LD protein—reduces the recruitment of ER proteins with lower affinity by displacing them from the LD surface. These findings highlight lateral protein-protein exclusion as a fundamental mechanism in shaping the LD proteome.},

The thermotropic LDIPP provides encoded DNA information with high density loading, thermoplasticity, antimicrobial, and anti-enzymatic properties. Notably, DNA information was nondestructively recovered by manipulating the assembly structure using specific salt solutions and bioamplified through microbial fermentation. By mineralizing inorganic crystals on LDIPP, the preservation lifetime is expected to be increased by nearly an order of magnitude at −20°C. The LDIPP platform offers enhanced DNA data loading, nondestructive recovery, and customizable macroscopic features, making it a promising option for long-term information preservation in the rapidly advancing field of DNA storage.},

The monolithic probes demonstrate high mechanical bending endurance, stable impedance, and improved biocompatibility, resulting in a lower inflammatory response compared to conventional systems.

Here, we define the endogenous LRRC8 subunits localized to a subset of lysosomes in differentiated myotubes.

We showed that potential trimethoprim-resistance dihydrofolate reductase ( dfrA ) genes enriched in lytic phages could confer trimethoprim resistance to Escherichia coli . Sequence analysis revealed that lytic phages rarely transfer these potential dfrA genes into their bacterial hosts. Functional studies showed that these dfrA genes not only enhance phage reproduction in the presence of trimethoprim but also promote bacterial growth during phage infection. These results highlight that abundant functional ARGs were selected in evolution to improve lytic phage reproduction by promoting bacterial growth during infection, suggesting that dfrA genes play important roles in evolutionary mutualism between lytic phages and their hosts.},

RNA interference experiments showed that 85.7% (66 of 77) of the candidate genes with nonlethal knockdown effects influenced starvation resistance. Of these, 49 had sex-dependent effects, including 12 with sexually antagonistic effects—all increasing resistance in females but decreasing it in males. These patterns were not explained by sex-biased expression or knockdown efficiency. Analysis of the Lnk gene revealed that both nonsynonymous mutations and expression changes had sex-dependent effects.

Within 1 week of treatment, AT MΦs decreased and became lipid laden, while extracellular vesicles secreted from AT decreased and reduced in lipid content. Within 2 weeks, glucose tolerance returned to levels of lean controls, followed by weight loss and reduced food intake. After 4 weeks, AT browning and amelioration of hepatic steatosis were evident. The physiological shifts were reproducible in three rodent models of obesity, spanning sexes and gonadal status.

Whether a myelination-independent function of OPCs is involved in brain aging remains unknown. In this study, we herein report a myelination-independent role of OPCs in exaggerating cognitive decline in the aging brain via suppressing neuronal plasticity. Our results demonstrate that macroautophagic flux declines in aged OPCs. Inactivation of autophagy promotes the senescence of OPCs, which activates C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3)/CCL5–C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 signaling. Through this, autophagy-defective OPCs impair glutamatergic transmission, neuronal excitability, and long-term potentiation, exaggerating the cognitive decline in the aging brain.

In this study, we develop a method for the instantaneous and continuous synthesis of EMHCs in evaporating microdroplets. Compared to traditional wet impregnation methods, the reaction time of the microdroplet-assisted method is shortened from days to seconds, achieving a space-time yield increase by two to five orders of magnitude.

Here, we tackled this challenge using mouse embryonic axis segmentation as an experimental model. First, we found that energetically subminimal amounts of glucose can support ongoing segmentation clock activity, providing evidence that glycolysis exerts a signaling function. Using a dynamical systems approach based on entrainment, we identified fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) as the potential signaling metabolite. Functionally, we demonstrated that glycolytic flux/FBP control the segmentation clock period and Wnt signaling in an anticorrelated manner. Critically, we showed that the slow segmentation clock phenotype caused by elevated glycolysis is mediated by Wnt signaling rather than cellular bioenergetic and biosynthetic state. Combined, our results demonstrate a modular organization of metabolic functions, revealing a signaling module of glycolysis that can be decoupled from its canonical metabolic functions.},

In silico modeling replicated these experimental characteristics and suggested that properties of the inhibitory currents rather than motoneuron size are responsible for net functional inhibition. Our results show that HDsEMG can highlight distinct control strategies across circuits and motor pools, revealing participant-specific properties of inhibitory spinal microcircuits.},

  abstract     = {The initial photoproduct of the natural photoenzyme fatty acid photodecarboxylase involves the flavin anion radical flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD •– ). Using spectrally resolved ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, we demonstrate that FAD •– photoexcitation in the absence of substrate leads to the formation of the oxidized flavin FAD ox (the resting state in the catalytic cycle) within 100 femtoseconds. While this feature is similar to that occurring in flavoprotein oxidases, the ensuing photocycle is more complex. Upon excitation at the lowest-energy transition, the ejected electron is initially captured as a hydrated electron ( e – H ) before transferring to a secondary acceptor in 2.5 picoseconds and returning to the flavin in 37 picoseconds. This implies that e – H can be generated within a protein environment, an unprecedented finding. This assessment is supported by molecular dynamics simulations showing an expansion of the flavin-binding pocket without substrate, allowing water molecules to fill the void. Our results may pave the way to developing unconventional photocatalytic processes.},

  abstract     = {Natural environments typically contain a blend of simultaneous sounds. A substantial challenge in neuroscience is identifying specific neural signals corresponding to each sound and analyzing them separately. Combining frequency tagging and machine learning, we achieved high-precision separation of neural responses to mixed melodies, classifying them by selective attention toward specific melodies. Across two magnetoencephalography datasets, individual musicality and task performance heavily influenced the attentional recruitment of cortical regions, correlating positively with top-down attention in the left parietal cortex but negatively with bottom-up attention in the right. In prefrontal areas, neural responses indicating higher sustained selective attention reflected better performance and musicality. These results suggest that musical training enhances neural mechanisms in the frontoparietal regions, boosting performance via improving top-down attention, reducing bottom-up distractions, and maintaining selective attention over time. This work establishes the effectiveness of combining frequency tagging with machine learning to capture cognitive and behavioral effects with stimulus precision, applicable to other studies involving simultaneous stimuli.},

Despite 40 years of active development, attaining general purpose chemical accuracy is still elusive with existing functionals. We present a data-driven pathway to learn the XC functional by using the exact density, XC energy, and XC potential. While the exact densities are obtained from accurate configuration interaction (CI), the exact XC energies and XC potentials are obtained via inverse DFT calculations on the CI densities. We demonstrate how simple neural network (NN)–based local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA), trained on just five atoms and two molecules, provide remarkable improvement in total energies and densities. Particularly, the NN-based GGA functional attains similar accuracy as the higher rung SCAN meta-GGA on various thermochemistry datasets. These results underscore the promise of using the XC potential in modeling XC functionals and can pave the way for systematic learning of increasingly accurate XC functionals.},

Recent findings support an α cell–to–β cell axis that is mediated by paracrine signaling through the glucagon receptor and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor in β cells. To address which proglucagon peptides stimulate insulin secretion, we developed an assay to quantify levels of GLP-1(7–36)NH 2 . We also generated three transgenic mouse lines that allow α cell-specific, inducible deletion of the genes for the two prohormone convertase enzymes that process proglucagon . Our studies reveal that both mouse and human islets contain GLP-1(7–36)NH2, but glucagon mediates α cell–to–β cell communication in mice. However, in the absence of normal production of glucagon, α cells up-regulate prohormone convertase 1 (PC1/3) to generate GLP-1 and enhance glucose tolerance. Human islets have substantially higher levels of GLP-1 than mice, which positively correlate with rates of insulin secretion.

Using multiscale [40 to 2500 astronomical units (au)] observations of an MDC hosting an HMYSO, we identify a coherent dynamical structure analogous to barred spiral galaxies: three ~20,000 au spiral arms feed a ~7500 au central bar, which channels gas to a ~2000 au pseudodisk. Further accretion proceeds through the inner structures, including a Keplerian disk and an inner disk (~100 au), which are thought to be driving a collimated bipolar outflow. These multiscale structures (spiral arms, bar, streamers, envelope, disk, and outflow) have been simultaneously observed as a physically coherent structure within an MDC. Our discovery suggests that well-organized hierarchical structures play a crucial role during the gas accretion and angular momentum buildup of a massive disk.},

We investigate how slow shear and stick-slip transition depend on the roughness alignment between contacting surfaces. By rotating one surface with respect to the other, we precisely control roughness matching, enabling nearly an order-of-magnitude variation in the maximum static friction coefficient. Both the variation amplitude and the angular range over which the frictional strength varies are governed by roughness alignment. Universal statistical patterns emerge in micromechanical quantities, including the microcontact area, orientation, deformation, and their evolutions under shear, following generalized extreme value distributions. To quantify asperity interactions, we introduce the contact fabric tensor, whose anisotropy provides a unified measure of roughness matching and a predictor for frictional strength and sliding onset. These findings advance our understanding of friction at rough interfaces and inform the design of mechanical systems, adhesives, and fault models.},

GM1 and other complex gangliosides enhance EV secretion, while disruption of ganglioside synthesis impairs it. GM1 supplementation restores EV secretion in Huntington’s disease (HD) fibroblasts and cell models with ganglioside deficiency, including models of neurodegenerative diseases caused by a genetic block of ganglioside synthesis. Notably, GM1 enhances EV-mediated secretion of pathogenic misfolded proteins, including mutant huntingtin (mHTT), α-synuclein, and tau, reducing intracellular burden and providing mechanistic insight into the mHTT-lowering effects of GM1 in HD models.

Applying a periodically modulated laser light to optomechanical oscillators allows for stable and precise control of oscillator couplings. This enables us to not only explore the physics of quantized integer and fractional phase slips but also synthesize multioctave synchronizations of mechanical oscillators that exhibit tailorable multistability. Furthermore, the dynamically manipulated synchronizations lead to an exotic phase-space trajectory, which has a nontrivial winding number and giant nonreciprocity.

This leads to a shift in photoluminescence peaks from red to blue with increasing defect density. Furthermore, the Raman signal is amplified by localized electromagnetic fields around the nanopores and carefully chosen resonance laser wavelengths. This combination allows blue-shifted WS 2 to achieve single-molecule SERS detection, with a sensitivity limit reaching 1 × 10 −20 M for R6G. Using SERS mapping, we visualize adsorption sites, confirming the nanopores’ role as active sites.

This transient shift was accompanied by increased quantal size and suprathreshold excitability in CTs, with minimal changes in ETs. In vivo, CTs exhibited persistent elevation in sound intensity thresholds, while ETs showed a transient shift in frequency tuning and reduced high-frequency responsiveness that recovered within a week. These findings reveal distinct, cell type–specific plasticity mechanisms in deep-layer ACtx neurons following peripheral damage and highlight potential targets for treating hearing loss–related disorders such as tinnitus and hyperacusis.},

  abstract     = {An Oropouche virus (OROV) outbreak occurred in South America in 2024. The pathogenic potential and host immunological response of this emerging virus are largely unknown, as animal models have been poorly explored. We infected nonhuman primate (NHP) species with OROV and followed viral replication dynamics and subsequent innate and adaptive immunological responses. OROV efficiently replicated in pigtail macaques, rhesus macaques, and vervet African green monkeys. OROV also replicated in sabeus African green monkey, albeit at lower levels than other hosts. OROV RNA was detected in plasma and nasal swabs and infection-induced high levels of innate inflammation, type I interferon gene signatures, immunoglobulin M–positive B cell expansion, high titers of neutralizing antibodies, and detectable frequencies of OROV-specific T cells. Prior infection was protective against reinfection up to 524 days post–initial infection, demonstrating possible protective immunity induction against OROV infection. These data suggest that multiple NHP species are appropriate models for OROV infection and the development of therapeutics and vaccinations.},

In this work, we propose a capacitance signal–based imaging strategy that uses an alternating current (AC) bias to suppress ion migration and eliminate nonlinear responses. A quantitative correlation between capacitance changes and x-ray dose rate is established, enabling stable, high-resolution imaging. Using this method, we achieve three-dimensional internal structure reconstruction with a simple single-pixel detector. This approach overcomes intrinsic material limitations and enhances signal reliability, providing a promising pathway toward the commercialization of low-cost, high-performance perovskite-based x-ray imaging and computed tomography systems.},

The mass-independent fractionation of even mercury isotopes (even-MIF, denoted as Δ 200 Hg) is widely used to trace atmospheric Hg sources and fluxes. However, the chemical processes inducing even-MIF remain largely unknown. Here, we develop a three-dimensional atmospheric Hg isotope model linking Hg redox processes with even-MIF. The results show that the previous hypothesis of even-MIF occurring exclusively at the tropopause may not fully explain the global Δ 200 Hg patterns. We speculate OH-initiated reactions and photoreduction of Hg II (p) as likely dominant drivers. Simulations show that even-MIF primarily originates in the free troposphere and propagates downward to surface air. Our results reveal distinct spatial Δ 200 Hg variations that were previously unaccounted for in tracing Hg sources. This study provides critical insights into even-MIF drivers and serves as a reference for using Δ 200 Hg to trace atmospheric Hg sources.},

By combining operando x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) with fixed-energy x-ray absorption voltammetry (FEXRAV) at semiconductor/cocatalyst interfaces, we provide an element-selective probe of Co oxidation states under dark and illuminated conditions. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized interfacial Co state, highlighting interface structure’s role in tuning catalytic activity. We observe light-induced reduction in oxidation state and cathodic shift in Co redox potentials, offering insights into hole transfer and catalytic behavior. Identification of a specific photocatalytic cycle, distinct from dark-state electrocatalysis, advances understanding of how light modulates rate-determining steps in OER. These findings underscore the power of operando x-ray techniques in elucidating interfacial charge transfer and guiding design of more efficient photoelectrochemical systems.},

Here, we advance the holography concept by transitioning it from a space-only, homodyne, and single-tone approach to a spatiotemporal, heterodyne, and multifrequency methodology. We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a space-time holographic metasurface antenna (HMA) capable of encoding and reconstructing the full amplitude, phase, and frequency contents of object waves. We demonstrate the HMA for frequency conversion and holographic beamforming in the far field, as well as multifrequency two-dimensional (2D) and 3D holographic imaging in the near field.

Here, we implement a polarization vortex thermal emitter (PVTE) based on BICs in a photonic crystal slab (PCS), allowing for the generation of various polarization states simultaneously along different directions. Using a custom-designed polarized angle-resolved thermal emission spectrometer (PARTES), we experimentally confirm polarization vortices of thermal emission originating from BICs with different charges and types.

PIN-LIKES (PILS) are auxin transport facilitators at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that mediate nuclear auxin abundance and signaling. Although the posttranslational regulation of PILS is important for acclimating growth responses, the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. This study demonstrates that components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery regulate the proteasome-dependent degradation of functional PILS proteins under nonstressed conditions. We further reveal that both internal and external signals use the ERAD complex to differentially modulate the turnover rates of PILS proteins. Our findings uncover an additional physiological role of the ERAD complex in regulating PILS protein turnover. This finding uncovers the interplay between protein homeostasis at the ER and growth regulation, opening unexplored molecular avenues into how plants acclimate to internal and external cues.},

Unlike mice on conventional high-fat diet, KD-fed mice remain insulin sensitive and display low-insulin levels. Hyperglycemic clamp and ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assays revealed systemic and cell-intrinsic impairments in insulin secretion. Transcriptomic profiling of islets from KD-fed mice indicated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi stress and disrupted ER-Golgi protein trafficking, which were confirmed by electron microscopy showing a dilated Golgi network consistent with defective insulin granule trafficking and secretion. Together, these results suggest that long-term KD leads to multiple aberrations of metabolic parameters that caution their systematic use as a health-promoting dietary intervention.},

  abstract     = {Transmission and processing of information at the nanoscale using spin waves and their quanta—magnons—offer numerous advantages and opportunities that make it a promising next-generation technology for integrated electronics. The main challenges that still need to be addressed to ensure high competitiveness of magnonic devices include finding ways to efficiently amplify spin waves in nanostructures and developing nanocircuits that can operate without the need for an external bias magnetic field. Here, we demonstrate how these two challenges can be solved using nanowaveguides fabricated from a low-loss magnetic insulator. We show that using local parametric pumping with a power of only a few milliwatts, one can achieve coherent amplification of spin-wave pulses by more than two orders of magnitude at zero bias magnetic field. Our results provide a simple solution to problems that have long prevented the implementation of efficient integrated magnonic circuits.},

Conventional membranes are constrained to unidirectional transport of either cations or anions, severely limiting their versatility and performance. Inspired by the chloride voltage-gated channel 5 (ClC-5), we engineered a biomimetic Janus NP-MXene membrane featuring subnanochannels (~6.0 angstrom) and exceptional structural integrity, enabling controlled, simultaneous Na + /Cl − transport with unprecedented permselectivity. Under a 50-fold salinity gradient, the NP-MXene membrane achieved a record power density of 85.1 watts per square meter and an osmotic potential of 181.5 millivolts, the highest reported for a single device. Harnessing ion-specific signals from multi-ion transport, we further demonstrated an iontronic transistor capable of modulating ion flow by salinity gradients, eliminating the need for external gate voltage. This advance enables encoded signals and robotic control for advanced human-machine interfaces. The scalable fabrication of nanofluidic channels facilitates high-performance iontronics for efficient energy-information flow.},

Although the mechanisms of DDR activation have been extensively studied, how DDR is kept inactive is far less well understood, especially in plants. Here, we show that the plant-specific transcription factor SOG1, a master regulator of the plant DDR, interacts with PRL1, which functions as a substrate adaptor of the Cullin4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4 PRL1 to polyubiquitinate SOG1, promoting SOG1 degradation through 26 S proteasome. When DNA damage occurs, PRL1 is degraded and SOG1 is phosphorylated, both of which impair the polyubiquitination and degradation of SOG1. This study demonstrated that plants dynamically control DDR by regulating the phosphorylation and polyubiquitination of SOG1.},

Here, we report a hierarchical metal-organic framework (MOF)–based nanofluidic device of multiscale heterogeneous channel junctions to achieve unprecedented triode-like nonlinear proton transport, in contrast with diode-like rectifying transport for metal ions. Through experiments and theoretical simulations, we unveil the underlying mechanism for this unique nonlinear proton transport property, i.e., the gating effect from the built-in electric potential across the MOF phase junctions enabled by voltage bias above a threshold. As a proof-of-concept application demonstration, the nanofluidic device exhibits an ionic memory property as a nanofluidic memristor. This finding of proton-specific nonlinear resistive switching and memristive phenomenon can inspire future studies into nanofluidic iontronics and mass transport by rational design of coupled nanometric and angstrom-sized confinement.},

Here, we report an experimental strategy and theoretical design principles for patterned liquid surfaces (PaLS) that combine the controlled wettability from patterning with the ultrasmoothness of a lubricant-infused surface. In contrast to a solid, on PaLS, a droplet can be in 10 different wetting states. This richness arises from the adaptation of the liquid lubricants and can be harnessed to control the apparent contact angle of the droplet over the full range of wettability while removing contact-line pinning effects induced by the solid surface. In the limit of thin liquid films, we derive surface-averaged laws for the apparent contact angle for each wetting state, which capture both experimental and simulation data. Our results provide a distinct approach to surface patterning that exploits the interaction of fluids with lubricant-impregnated surfaces.},

To address these challenges, this study develops a nanofiber membrane system with synergistic structural and interfacial enhancement. Through nanofiber architecture and surface engineering, the membrane balances proton conductivity, mechanical strength and electrochemical performance. The sandwich-structure nanofiber membrane (SSNFM) achieves a peak power density of 942 mW cm −2 after 100-hour accelerated stress testing, substantially outperforming conventional commercial membranes (520 mW cm −2 ). Electrochemical characterization confirms enhanced proton conductivity for SSNFM (40.4 mS cm −1 ) compared to commercial membranes (17.5 mS cm −1 ). Multiscale analyses, including x-ray computed tomography and multiphase simulations, reveal improved membrane properties, catalyst layer stability, and triple-phase boundary formation, facilitating efficient charge and mass transport.

Single-cell analyses revealed purely tactile, purely acoustic, bimodal, and decision-mnemonic responses. Population analyses of the VPC network and a recurrent neural network trained on the BDT uncovered notably similar latent dynamics. In both networks, neural trajectories diverged sharply from rest along modality-specific directions during stimulus presentation, while remained at rest during stimulus-absent trials. Subsequently, trajectories rotated toward a mnemonic subspace, where perceptual decisions (acoustic, tactile, and absent) were maintained in three distinctly different stable attractors. Using low-dimensional modeling, we propose a universal mechanism for the transition from sensory processing to memory retention explaining both biological and artificial latent neural dynamics in a simple dynamical motif. These results show that VPC neurons encode bimodal information, can integrate competing sensory inputs, and maintain multimodal perceptual decisions.},

Relative photoionization delays between the four cation states are observed, with vibrational state–dependent delays, we analyze the evolution of the degenerate A 2 Π u state to the nondegenerate A ′ and A ″ states due to molecular bending.

We show that NiV-M–mediated virus-like particle (VLP) production depends on its interaction with host F-actin via its carboxyl-terminal domain. We demonstrate that F-actin retains NiV-M assembly sites at the PM by analyzing NiV-M assembly kinetics. Disrupting actin dynamics or NiV-M–actin interaction alters M nanoscale organization and reduces membrane retention, without affecting initial recruitment. We also show that the Arp2/3 complex, an actin-branching factor, promotes VLP production. Inhibiting Arp2/3 reduces NiV-M retention at the PM and impairs protrusion formation while leaving the assembly rate unchanged. These findings suggest that the host F-actin retains NiV assembly sites on the PM and promotes virus budding via Arp2/3-driven actin branching.},

Treatment with specific RGF peptides in the absence of hosts triggered prehaustoria and induced expression of PjYUC3 , a gene required for auxin biosynthesis and prehaustorium formation. CRISPR-mediated knockouts showed that PjRGFR1 and PjRGFR3, receptors activated by the haustorium-specific RGF peptides PjRGF2 and PjRGF5, are essential for prehaustorium formation, revealing functional redundancy. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that PjRGF2 is broadly conserved among Orobanchaceae, whereas PjRGF5 appears to have recently evolved through segmental tandem multiplication. Our findings establish RGF peptides and their corresponding receptors as critical components of haustorium developmental signaling and provide insights into the evolutionary trajectories that shape plant parasitism.},

  abstract     = {Adipocyte hypertrophy during obesity triggers chronic inflammation, leading to metabolic disorders. However, the role of adipocyte-specific inflammatory signaling in metabolic syndrome remains unclear. The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, LUBAC, is an E3-ligase that generates nondegradative linear ubiquitination (Lin-Ub). LUBAC regulates NF-κB/MAPK-driven inflammation and prevents cell death triggered by immune receptors like TNF receptor-1. Here, we show that mice lacking HOIP, the Lin-E3 ligase catalytic subunit of LUBAC, in adipocytes ( Hoip A-KO ) display lipodystrophy and heightened susceptibility to obesity-induced metabolic syndrome, particularly metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Mechanistically, loss of HOIP attenuates TNF-induced NF-κB activation and promotes cell death in human adipocytes. Inhibiting caspase-8–mediated cell death is sufficient to prevent lipodystrophy and MASLD in Hoip A-KO obese mice. HOIP expression in adipose tissue positively correlates with metabolic fitness in obese individuals. Overall, our findings reveal a fundamental developmental role for Lin-Ub in adipocytes by mitigating cell death–driven adipose tissue inflammation and protecting against obesity-related metabolic syndrome.},

  abstract     = {Human attraction to alcohol may derive from an evolutionary association between ethanol and fruits consumed by animals in nature. Fermentative yeasts are widespread in the terrestrial biosphere, and simple carbohydrates underpinning ethanol production are commonplace within fruits. We determined ethanol concentrations within fruits representing a substantial portion of the diet of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees. Ripe fruit pulp from 20 angiosperm species in Côte d’Ivoire and Uganda contained an average value of 0.31 (± 0.21 SD) and 0.32% (± 0.20) ethanol (weight/weight), respectively, as scaled by annual chimpanzee feeding time per species at each site. Chimpanzees typically eat ~4.5 kilograms of fruit per day, corresponding to an estimated ethanol ingestion of 14 grams (±9), or the equivalent of 1.4 (±0.9) standard drinks by international standards. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ethanol is widespread within tropical fruits and that modern predisposition to alcohol consumption derives from ancestral exposure to this psychoactive substance among frugivorous primates.},

Using exogenous molecular chaperone systems has the potential to stabilize native conformations and inhibit the aberrant aggregation of α-syn, yet inefficient blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and insufficient accumulation at PD sites limit their application. Herein, we developed chemotactic chaperone nanomotors (CNMs) that exploit the unique pathological microenvironment of PD lesions, characterized by elevated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels. The CNMs consist of a chemotactic-targeting module capable of sensing an iNOS concentration gradient, an α-syn–specific recognition module with conformation-sensitive binding domains, and a protein regulatory module with a hydrophobic microdomain that can stabilize α-syn and prevent misfolding. Results demonstrate that CNMs can achieve active chemotactic navigation across BBB and dual modulation of α-syn proteostasis through aggregate dissolution and prevention of misfolding. CNMs not only supplement exogenous chaperone activity but also restore endogenous protein stabilization mechanisms, concurrently reducing neuroinflammatory markers, promoting the application of nanochaperones for PD treatment.},

Integrated analyses across species identified diverse subtypes of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons that are highly conserved across primates. Compositional analyses revealed that subdivisions of the primate basolateral complex contain distinct classes of glutamatergic neurons and divergent gene expression profiles for parvalbumin and somatostatin GABAergic neurons. Referencing primate neuron types to transcriptomic atlases of the murine amygdala highlighted primate-specific specializations for glutamatergic neurons and identified which neuron types are conserved across mammals and amygdalar subdivisions.

To address this, we compared how cell identity and diversity unfolds in different conditions during neocortical development. Conditions were modified in vivo using genetically modified mouse models in which position or innervation is altered and in vitro using two-dimensional cultures. This approach revealed a molecular hierarchy in which cell class–distinguishing features emerge first, followed by subclass- and type-related characteristics. Acquisition of cellular identity and diversity remained stable across in vivo models. In contrast, in vitro glutamatergic neurons showed decreased expression of identity-defining genes, reduced diversity, and alterations in connectivity. Cellular identity and diversity were closest to in vivo values in organotypic cultures.

When a polymeric semiconductor was coated on the treated electrode, most of the ionized donors remained at the metal-semiconductor interface. The confined ionized donors with the ideal thickness enabled fabrication of a polymer diode with a forward current density of over 100 A cm −2 . Furthermore, a power conversion efficiency of 7.9% was observed for rectification at a microwave frequency of 920 MHz, which is orders of magnitude higher than that reported for organic diodes.

Localized electrokinetic fields at electrode wells form tunable attractive potential wells for bimolecular capture. By modulating the voltage bias waveform, the device allows precise control over confinement dynamics, enabling molecular capture, release, and exposure to periodic or stochastic confinement regimes. This flexibility facilitates the study of biomolecular behavior under dynamically adjustable conditions, including controlled confinement fluctuations. The device can manipulate diverse analytes such as double-stranded DNA, liposomes, and DNA nanotubes and facilitates introducing molecules into confined environments intact from bulk while providing enhanced tunability.

The accelerated eastward mode frequency is expected to rise by 15%, intensifying subseasonal precipitation whiplash worldwide and shortening disaster preparedness time. This acceleration results from an asymmetric pattern of boundary layer moisture convergence anomalies, driven by weakened Rossby wave westerlies and enhanced Kelvin wave response linked to warming-induced atmospheric stabilization and El Niño–like ocean surface warming pattern. Conversely, a projected weakening of easterly vertical shear over the northern Indian Ocean attenuates the Rossby wave response and favors more eastward expansion events.},

However, the uncontrolled crystallization dynamics of Br-rich species lead to reduced grain sizes and high defect densities in WBG perovskite films. Herein, a multifunctional additive 3,4,5-trifluorobenzamide (TFBZ) was introduced to enhance the crystallinity and passivate defects of the methylammonium (MA)–free WBG perovskite films. The TFBZ demonstrates superior passivation capability compared to benzamide, effectively mitigating both iodine vacancies and undercoordinated Pb 2+ defects via fluorine-enhanced interactions. In addition, the fluorine substituents in TFBZ could form N–H···F hydrogen bonds with formamidinium iodide to retard the crystallization rate of the perovskite. This proposed method is effective in defect passivation and crystal growth modulation for both 1.67– and 1.79–electron volt MA-free WBG perovskites, enabling the fabrication of MA-free all-perovskite TSCs with an encouraging power conversion efficiency of 29.01% (certified at 28.52%).},

These modes are closely correlated to charge ordering states, with both the fitted coupling strength and the universal screening length of interband transitions exhibiting pronounced anomalies at the transition temperature.

Using deep learning–based image analyses, including particle tracking, spatial distribution, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology analysis, we found that ER junctions facilitate stop-and-go motion switching and serve as platforms for endolysosome interactions. Within the ER network, endolysosomes exhibit three dynamic states: fast movement, local slow movement, and pausing. Pauses occur mainly at ER junctions, where transient endosome-lysosome interactions often coincide with organelle fission and are followed by departure. Disruption of ER junctions impairs lysosomal motility and maturation. We further show that actin condensation around endolysosomes mediates motion switching, involving VAP-STARD3 interaction and the actin regulator YWHAH. Other organelles, such as lipid droplets and peroxisomes, also pause near ER junctions. These findings highlight ER junctions as regulatory hubs that orchestrate organelle dynamics, contributing to the spatial coordination of organelle distribution and interactions within the cytoplasm.},

Currently available data assessing diatom responses focus on empirical comparisons between present-day and future conditions, rather than exploring the mechanisms driving these responses. Here, we conducted high-resolution growth experiments to map the fitness of diatoms across broad carbonate chemistry landscapes. Our results reveal species-specific carbonate chemistry niches, which can be used to predict ecological shifts between species under changing conditions driven by ocean acidification or ocean alkalinity enhancement. The results demonstrate that changes in diatom fitness are almost exclusively driven by carbon dioxide and proton concentrations, with bicarbonate exerting no discernible effect. Thus, current assumptions regarding the role of bicarbonate as a primary carbon source supporting diatom growth may be overestimated. This study presents a methodological and conceptual framework as a foundation for future studies to collate data capable of predicting species-specific responses and shifts in ecological niches driven by changes in marine carbonate chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Retinal neovascularization diseases cause vision impairment due to abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina. Current treatments, including repeated intraocular anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections, are invasive and often lead to discomfort and complicated hemorrhages. Here, we developed a noninvasive nanozyme eye drop capable of penetrating the fundus to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby inhibit neovascularization. The nanozyme eye drops consist of liposomes formed by fluorinated and arginine–glycine–aspartic acid–modified phospholipids, which enhance the penetration of ocular barriers. The encapsulated superoxide dismutase–catalase cascade nanozyme within these liposomes allows for efficient ROS scavenging. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that these nanozyme eye drops achieve deep retinal tissue penetration, alleviate oxidative stress, restore mitochondrial function, and suppress aberrant insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 signaling, thereby inhibiting pathological neovascularization. Enhanced ocular bioavailability and minimal toxicity further underscore its promise as a safe and effective noninvasive treatment for retinal neovascularization diseases.},

These unique observations provide high-resolution (18 meters per pixel) measurements of light scattered by aerosols in the atmosphere. The observations are characterized by subkilometer-scale layering, ±20% variations in color of the individual layers, and high radiance ( I / F > 1). Strong spatial (latitudinal) variability is also evident, suggesting highly inhomogeneous absorption and atmospheric heating. Models of the radiance, while likely to be degenerate, indicate good agreement with lower-resolution results inferred from other techniques. Mesospheric aerosol layers (strongly blue in CaSSIS color ratios) are also evident. The observed decrease in the CaSSIS RED/BLU color ratio with altitude is indicative of a decrease in particle radius.},

In this study, we examine more than 1.5 million minute-scale rain and snow particle attributes and collocated meteorological variables from seven global measurement sites over 9 years. Applying Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, we reduce the dataset’s dimensionality by 75%, identifying nine distinct precipitation groups and associated particle evolution pathways. UMAP effectively captures the global structure of precipitation phases such as rain, snow, and mixed-phase types, revealing clear patterns that linear methods struggle to resolve. The resulting UMAP manifold offers a unique perspective on precipitation phase and intensity, advancing our understanding of particle evolutionary processes and offering valuable insights for improving weather and climate models and remote sensing precipitation estimates.},

Postfire snow cover loss is more extreme in relatively low-elevation, warm environments compared to that in high-elevation, cold regions. Under +2°C of warming, 73% of the snow zone would experience more extreme earlier postfire snowmelt compared to historically average conditions. Regions with the largest shift earlier in postfire snowmelt timing under average climate conditions also have the largest shift earlier in postfire snowmelt under +2°C warming.

Here, we synthesized the response of growing season carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions to experimentally manipulated warming of ~2°C for permafrost in alpine and Arctic regions. Warming weakened the GHG sink of alpine permafrost, thereby increasing (13%) its global warming potential, but strengthened the GHG sink of Arctic permafrost and decreased (−10%) its global warming potential. When warming caused drying of alpine permafrost soils, the CO 2 sink weakened but the CH 4 sink increased. In contrast, warming of relatively wet Arctic permafrost increased the CO 2 sink and CH 4 source. Warming led to much stronger increases of the N 2 O source in alpine than Arctic permafrost. Although keeping additional warming below 2°C in permafrost regions can avoid the positive permafrost-climate feedback, measures are needed to maintain fragile carbon sink of alpine permafrost ecosystems.},

The ultrathin electrode is fabricated using gelatin hydrogels with temperature-controlled phase change properties reinforced by nanomesh while incorporating lithium chloride, and a binary solvent achieves antifreezing and antidehydration characteristics. The design minimizes flexural rigidity, resulting in high interfacial adhesion energy with human skin, and enhances gas (air, oxygen, and carbon dioxide) permeance and water vapor transmission rate. Consequently, the ultrathin hydrogel electrode exhibits high biocompatibility, superior wear comfort, and minimized motion and sweat artifacts, enabling reliable, uninterrupted, wireless health monitoring over eight consecutive days across various real-life activities and adaptation to cold environments.},

In the heterotaxy syndrome, abnormal left-right patterning leads to a spectrum of severe congenital heart defects, including ventricle malposition. A postulate anchored in the clinical nomenclature assumes that the looping direction of the embryonic heart tube determines ventricle position at birth. However, this has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here, we performed a unique longitudinal analysis of heterotaxy with right isomerism, using multimodality imaging of Nodal mouse mutants. Using direct correlations and advanced statistics, we dissected the contribution of heart looping variations to specific structural heart malformations, and uncovered unexpected plasticity of ventricle position after looping in 30% of revertant samples. Genetic tracing and topological associations show that plasticity involves a further step of heart remodeling at E13.5, rather than molecular reprogramming. Human patient scans are consistent with ventricle plasticity and suggest association with poorer prognosis. Our work reveals distinct asymmetric events shaping organs.},

After footshock and fear extinction, these mutants chronically develop occluded neuronal activation in the basal amygdala (BA) detectable at remote fear memory retrieval, which involves suppressed spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. Chemogenetic activation of mutant BA neurons during fear extinction improves fear memory extinction and remote fear memory responses without affecting anxiety- or social-related phenotypes. This rescue involves normalized spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability.

We previously reported that mutations in the viral nucleocapsid (NC) are selected in the presence of the INSTI dolutegravir (DTG). Here, we show that these NC mutations accelerate the kinetics of viral DNA integration, suggesting that they limit the window of time available for INSTIs to block viral DNA integration. We find that in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, HIV-1 acquires mutations in the viral envelope glycoprotein, NC, and occasionally IN during selection for INSTI resistance. Notably, the selected NC and IN mutations act in concert to reduce the susceptibility of the virus to INSTIs. These results provide insights into the mechanism by which HIV-1 escapes the inhibitory activity of INSTIs and underscore the importance of genotypic analysis outside IN in PWH experiencing VF on INSTI-containing drug regimens.},

The coating combines brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) conjugation and a lubricant-infused surface. This dual-functional design enables selective interaction with neurons and astrocytes while preventing nonspecific adhesion. Notably, high-quality single-unit neural signals were stably recorded for more than 12 months after implantation, demonstrating exceptional long-term recording performance.

We combine provider knowledge assessments and over 2000 anonymous standardized patient visits to providers in India to examine why they overprescribe antibiotics for pediatric diarrhea and figure out how to reduce overprescribing. Seventy percent of providers prescribed antibiotics without indication of bacterial infection. Knowledge gaps explain little: 62% of providers who knew antibiotics were inappropriate still prescribed them. Closing this “know-do gap” would reduce prescribing by 30 percentage points, versus only 6 points if all providers had perfect knowledge. Using randomized experiments, we revealed that the know-do gap stems from providers’ beliefs that patients want antibiotics, not from profit motives or lack of alternative treatments. Yet, a discrete choice experiment suggests patients do not prefer providers who give antibiotics. Our findings indicate that addressing provider misperceptions about patient preferences may be more effective than standard information-based interventions in reducing antibiotic overuse.},

  abstract     = {Narrow-linewidth lasers are essential for coherent optical applications, including communications, metrology, and sensing. Although compact semiconductor lasers with narrow linewidths have been demonstrated, achieving high spectral purity generally necessitates passive external cavities based on photonic integrated circuits. This study presents a theoretical and experimental demonstration of a monolithic optical injection locking topological interface state extended (MOIL-TISE) laser. By monolithically integrating a TISE laser with a micro-ring resonator on an AlGaInAs multiple quantum-well platform, the proposed device achieves efficient photon injection and linewidth narrowing. Experimental characterization indicates stable single-mode operation over a wide injection current range (65 to 300 milliamperes), exhibiting a side-mode suppression ratio exceeding 50 decibels. The laser’s Voigt linewidth was reduced from 2 megahertz to 4.2 kilohertz, with an intrinsic linewidth of 983 hertz extracted from power spectrum density, underscoring the MOIL-TISE laser’s promise for coherent communications and modulation-free quantum key distribution applications.},

  abstract     = {The kinetochore corona, a polymeric fibrous structure, facilitates chromosome biorientation and mitotic checkpoint signaling during mitosis. How its main building block, the ROD-Zwilch-ZW10 (RZZ) complex, assembles on the outer kinetochore remains poorly understood. Harnessing corona biochemical reconstitutions and cell biology, we reveal that the paralogous spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins BUB1 and BUBR1 promote nonredundant branches of corona assembly. MPS1 kinase–dependent kinetochore docking of BUB1 and subsequent recruitment of BUBR1 initiates assembly. Disrupting the first branch by depleting CENP-E, a kinesin that links BUBR1 to RZZ, uncovered a second assembly pathway mediated by a direct interaction between BUB1 and ROD. Discovery of a direct interaction with the RZZ explains how the SAC protein MAD1 fits this corona assembly scheme. Our findings solve the long-standing puzzle of corona assembly and demonstrate the intimate interweaving of chromosome biorientation and checkpoint signaling.},

Based on this, we developed a rigid tethered LAER roller (0.015 grams) that exhibited a rapid moving speed of ~210 body length per second on ceilings and a flexible tethered roller (10.600 grams) that had a load-to-weight ratio of ~121 moving on the ground. Liquid regulating modules were embedded into LAER structures to exhibit controlled moving. We also developed a single-wheeled and two-wheeled untethered LAER robots with onboard power supply. Furthermore, we demonstrate a LAER linear actuator and a camera equipped untethered LAER robot for preliminary environmental monitoring. The lightweight, scalable LAER structure is promising to bring fast electrostatic actuators, motors, and robots with superior load-to-weight ratios and multimodal locomotion capabilities such as turning, circular moving, and plane-to-plane transitioning.},

We demonstrate an analog in-memory computing chip based on a standard complementary metal-oxide semiconductor process, achieving the highest precision reported to date. Enhanced by the proposed weight remapping technique, the chip realizes ultrahigh computing accuracy with a root mean square error of only 0.101% across multiple parallel vector-by-matrix multiplication operations. Moreover, our analog in-memory computing chip maintains high precision, with an error of 0.155 and 0.130% under environmental temperatures of −78.5° and 180°C, respectively.

Here, we develop diverse fluorinated polyimide membranes featuring programmable polymer chain architectures for efficient hydrocarbon separation. By stoichiometry-controlled polycondensation, the chain packing and microporosity of synthesized polyimides are finely regulated, verified by molecular simulations. The corresponding asymmetrical membranes with defect-free thin layers of 100 to 250 nanometers are prepared via solution casting and thermal annealing steps. Such programmed membranes enable tunable permselectivity for hydrocarbons with less than 40 carbon atoms. The fractionation of kerosene-paraffin mixture in toluene is demonstrated through a two-stage process containing the optimized membranes. The cascade process remarkably enriches the C 10 -C 13 hydrocarbons from 50% up to 97%. The demonstrated polyimide membranes with on-demand molecular discrimination capability provide a potential candidate for the membrane-based hydrocarbon fractionation.},

We also propose a conceptual model positioning SA as a central integrator of temperature perception, immune regulation, and hormonal signaling. However, key questions remain: How do plants sense temperature shifts to regulate SA dynamics? How do temperature-induced epigenetic changes in SA pathways contribute to long-term adaptation? And how can these insights inform crop improvement? Addressing these gaps is essential for developing climate-resilient crops.},

One of the core bottlenecks in multidimensional manipulation is the lack of a systematic design methodology, which prevents the generation of an acoustic field that simultaneously meets the collaborative control requirements of multi-degree-of-freedom forces and torques, making it difficult to achieve precise control under conditions of stable suspension, high-frequency rotation, and complex spatial constraints. To address this challenge, we develop an end-to-end inverse design methodology for acoustic tweezers based on coding metasurfaces, establishing a dual-objective, dual-scale optimization paradigm. At the microscale, the phase modulation and transmission efficiency are co-optimized through coupled physical models. While at the mesoscale, the particle suspension and rotation dynamics are considered. Based on the inverse design framework constructed with a finite-bit element library, we successfully optimized the metasurface configuration with specific acoustic response characteristics and achieved noncontact, multi-degree-of-freedom customized manipulation of individual particles. This approach provides implementation pathways for adaptive multiscale strategies in precision engineering applications.},

Although the sterol biosynthetic pathway is considered well-characterized, we report the discovery of a plant-specific cytochrome b 5 –like protein, CB5LP, as a critical component of phytosterol biosynthesis. Loss of CB5LP in Arabidopsis causes embryonic defects, seedling lethality, and accumulation of 14α-methyl-sterols, with reduced levels of sitosterol and stigmasterol—indicating a defect in sterol 14α-demethylation. TurboID-based proximity labeling and in vitro assays show that CB5LP physically and functionally interacts with CYP51, a cytochrome P450 enzyme catalyzing this demethylation step. Unlike canonical cytochrome b 5 proteins, CB5LP has a reversed topology and is exclusive to plants, acting as an evolutionarily distinct electron donor. This discovery reveals an uncharacterized redox partnership essential for sterol biosynthesis and highlights a promising target for the development of selective herbicide.},

These architectures enable the topological solitons to propagate unidirectionally and overcome dispersive and dissipative effects through bistable-to-monostable state switching between adjacent units. The integration of electromagnetic resonators within the metamaterial units enables real-time detection of dynamic phase transitions, as soliton propagation or external loads induce resonance frequency shifts between distinct stable states. By arraying these mechanoreceptive units and the combination of the machine learning, it can encode information and compute programmatically. Furthermore, the mechanoreceptors hold promising applications in robotics.

The transcription factor OsbZIP35 represses COR1 expression, while COR1 interacts with OsTCP19, leading to its degradation. Knockout of either OsbZIP35 or OsTCP19 results in increased grain length, confirming their regulatory roles in grain development. The OsbZIP35-COR1-OsTCP19 module controls the expression of the cell cycle gene OsCycB1;4 , thereby modulating cell proliferation and ultimately determining grain size. Five haplotypes of COR1 were identified, with COR1 -Hap1 and COR1 -Hap3 being elite alleles associated with longer grains. Field plot trials demonstrated that the near-isogenic line NIL- COR1 SLG increased yield by ~6.6% compared to NIL- COR1 Nip . These findings elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying grain size regulation and offer promising strategies for improving rice yield.},

  abstract     = {Integrins bind ligands between their alpha (α) and beta (β) subunits and transmit signals through conformational changes. Early in chordate evolution, some α subunits acquired an “inserted” (I) domain that expanded integrin’s ligand-binding repertoire but obstructed the ancestral ligand pocket, seemingly blocking conventional integrin activation. Here, we compare cryo–electron microscopy structures of apo and ligand-bound states of the I domain–containing αEβ 7 integrin and the I domain–lacking α 4 β 7 integrin to illuminate how the I domain intrinsically mimics an extrinsic ligand to preserve integrin function. We trace the I domain’s evolutionary origin to an ancestral collagen-collagen interaction domain, identifying an ancient molecular exaptation that facilitated integrin activation immediately upon I domain insertion. Our analyses reveal the evolutionary and biochemical basis of expanded cellular communication in vertebrates.},

Here, we found that the rib structure of a cicada’s tymbal exhibits exceptional toughness and fatigue resistance, attributed to its unique architecture composed of alternating soft and stiff polymer layers. Inspired by this rib structure, we developed a robust artificial rib film (ARF) using a nanoconfined crystallization strategy that involves the deposition of soft polyethylene oxide and stiff phenol formaldehyde. The ARF demonstrates a toughness amplification factor twice that of the cicada’s tymbal rib and exhibits an exceptionally long fatigue life. The nanoconfined crystallization restricts molecular motion and disperses external forces within the crystalline structure, thereby enhancing its mechanical properties. These improvements enable the ARF to outperform commercial polymer films as an acoustic transducer, achieving 2.7 times increase in frequency response and 2.2 times increase in displacement amplitude.},

Depletion of Ptdss1 in tumor cells increased expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–regulated genes, including B2m , Cxcl9 , Cxcl10 , and Stat1 , even in the absence of IFN-γ stimulation in vitro. Loss of Ptdss1 in tumor cells also led to increased expression of MHC-I, enhanced cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells, and increased frequency of an iNOS + myeloid subset. A gene signature derived from the iNOS + myeloid cell subset correlated with clinical benefit in patients treated with anti–PD-1 therapy. Moreover, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of Ptdss1 in different tumor models improved anti–PD-1 therapy. Together, our results provide insights on a therapeutic strategy for overcoming immunosuppression by inhibiting PTDSS1 and provide rationale for development of a combination immunotherapy strategy composed of PTDSS1 inhibition plus PD-1 blockade.},

To investigate this hypothesis, we delivered DBS bursts during particularly fast and slow movements in 24 patients with PD. Our findings reveal that DBS during fast movements enhanced future movement speed more than DBS during slow movements, raising movement speed to the level of healthy controls. To understand which brain circuits mediate this neurophysiological mechanism, we investigated the behavioral effects using magnetic resonance imaging connectomics and motor cortex electrocorticography. Last, we demonstrate that machine learning–based brain signal decoding can be used to predict continuous movement speed for fully embedded state-dependent closed-loop algorithms.

Upon activation, immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet heightened demands for energy and biosynthesis, reshaping regulatory networks across epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic layers. Metabolite-derived posttranslational modifications (PTMs) serve as pivotal mechanisms integrating metabolic intermediates with immune signaling pathways. Beyond classical acetylation, diverse nonacetyl PTMs—including lactylation, succinylation, malonylation, palmitoylation, and myristoylation—modify histone and nonhistone proteins, regulating gene expression, protein stability, subcellular localization, enzymatic activity, and protein-protein interactions. Advances in mass spectrometry and bioinformatics now enable precise characterization of these PTMs, uncovering their broad roles in immune regulation. This review summarizes current progress in immunometabolism and explores future directions such as mechanistic studies, combination strategies, and clinical applications. Metabolite-driven PTMs critically connect metabolism to immune regulation, suggesting promising therapeutic approaches for cancer, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory diseases.},

Single-cell sequencing places Padi4 in both progenitor and differentiated hair lineage cells and indicates that PADI4 acts to repress transcription during hair follicle development. We establish PADI4 as a negative regulator of proliferation, acting on LEF1-positive hair shaft committed progenitor cells. Mechanistically, PADI4 citrullinates proteins associated with mRNA processing and ribosomal biogenesis, and lack of PADI4 promotes protein synthesis and ribosomal RNA transcription in vivo. Characterizing key translational effectors, we demonstrate that PADI4 citrullinates the translational repressor 4E-BP1 and reveal a cross-talk between PADI4 activity and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation.

Thanks to the cyclic shift symmetry in the discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) of bosonic modes, the DFT measurement outcomes can be used to deterministically project multiqubit states onto W states. Experimentally, we show that three-qubit W state discrimination can be achieved by detecting the cyclic shift symmetry with a three-mode DFT optical circuit, yielding a measurement discrimination fidelity of 0.871 ± 0.039.

Combined at low dose, this “triple M2e-mAb” confers robust prophylactic and therapeutic protection in mice challenged with diverse human and zoonotic IAV strains, including highly pathogenic variants.

  abstract     = {Acute sleep deprivation (SD) rapidly alleviates depression, addressing a critical gap in mood disorder treatment. Rapid eye movement SD (REM SD) modulates the excitability of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons, influencing the synaptic plasticity of pyramidal neurons. However, the precise mechanism remains undefined. To investigate this, we used a modified multiple platform method (MMPM) to induce 12 hours of REM SD, specifically targeting VIP neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Our results show that REM SD mitigated depression by suppressing VIP neurons activity, which directly increased the excitability of pyramidal neurons and, consequently, promoted synaptic plasticity recovery. In addition, the knockdown of VPAC2 on mPFC pyramidal neurons revealed that VPAC2-mediated AC/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in these neurons is essential for REM SD to mitigate depression-like behavior. These findings suggest that VIP neurons directly regulate pyramidal neurons and are crucial in alleviating depression by REM SD.},

Such agents are highly desirable for metabolic imaging with hyperpolarized tracers such as 15 N-pyridine, 1,4- 13 C 2 -succinate, and 1- 15 N-nicotinamide, where valuable polarization decays rapidly, especially at low fields during transfer between polarizer and scanner. Here, we report on a previously unrecognized effect in which the tracers’ longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates in aqueous solution are substantially reduced by adding nicotinamide, urea, glycerol, or dendrons. The impact on longitudinal relaxation is particularly pronounced at low magnetic fields and near the tracer’s p K a where T 1 can be tripled. This mitigates polarization loss during transfer, so hitherto unsuitable, fast-relaxing molecules can be used now. This way, we achieved the 15 N hyperpolarization of nearly 30% for 1- 15 N-nicotinamide. This chemically induced deceleration of nuclear spin relaxation (CIDER) was confirmed using magnetic field–cycling experiments and offers broad potential for hyperpolarized magnetic resonance and beyond.},

We identified two conserved mechanisms controlling particle mobility: Ribosome concentration, a known regulator of cytoplasmic crowding, works in concert with a previously unknown function for the giant KASH (Klarsicht/ANC-1/SYNE homology) protein ANC-1 in providing structural constraints through associating with the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings reveal mechanisms by which tissues establish and maintain distinct mesoscale properties, with implications for understanding cellular organization across species.},

Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 screen in an orthotopic xenograft model to explore PDAC dynamics. The RNA binding protein DEAD-box helicase 3X-linked (DDX3X) was identified as a pivotal oncogene and biomechanical checkpoint. Specifically, DDX3X up-regulation in PDAC promoted tumorigenesis and metastasis, primarily through the transcriptional repressor TLE family member 2 (TLE2). Dysregulation of DDX3X in the tumor destabilized TLE2 messenger RNA and therefore disrupted the interaction with KLF4 (KLF transcription factor 4), leading to increased expression of myosin light chain 9 (MYL9). This change remodeled F-actin, enhancing tumor cell traction forces and consequently facilitating tumor metastasis. Targeting the DDX3X-TLE2-MYL9 pathway considerably reduces PDAC progression. This research reveals a promising approach for treating PDAC by focusing on biomechanical cues.},

  abstract     = {Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the leading cause of inherited blindness, lacks therapies because of undefined photoreceptor degeneration mechanisms. While microglia/myeloid cells drive RP progression, their phenotype-regulating determinants remain unclear. Using rd10 mice, we reveal TREM2 as a biphasic RP regulator via STAT2–mediated microglial reprogramming. Early TREM2 loss amplifies neuroinflammation through STAT2 hyperactivation, while late deficiency triggers NF-κB/STAT2–driven microglial apoptosis, impairing phagocytosis yet preserving photoreceptors. We uncover a photoreceptor-microglia metabolic axis where apoptotic photoreceptors release arachidonic acid, salicylic acid, and creatinine to induce STAT2-dependent apoptosis in TREM2-deficient cells. Crucially, we identify intermicroglia PSAP/GPR37 signaling as a self-propagating apoptotic mechanism—the first evidence of apoptotic transmission in retinal degeneration. This study establishes three advances: (i) TREM2 exhibits stage-dependent neuroprotective/neurotoxic roles, (ii) photoreceptor metabolites dictate microglia/myeloid cell fate via STAT2, and (iii) microglial apoptosis spreads through membrane signaling complexes. Our findings redefine neuroimmune dynamics in retinal degeneration, propose chronotherapeutic TREM2 targeting, and extend to Alzheimer’s and other microglia-associated CNS disorders via metabolic-immune interplay.},

We hypothesized that this step could be facilitated by “bi-handed” chaperones that recognize two different subunits through distinct domains (hands). However, whether such chaperones exist remained unknown. Here, we identify AAGAB as a bona fide bi-handed chaperone. AAGAB uses its C-terminal domain (CTD) to bind the α subunit and its GTPase-like domain (GD) to bind the σ2 subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex, a central player in membrane trafficking. AAGAB first recruits α via its CTD; σ2 then joins through interaction with α, forming a conformationally immature α:σ2 hemicomplex at the CTD. This hemicomplex is subsequently transferred to the GD via a GD:σ2 binding interface, accompanied by conformational maturation. These findings establish AAGAB as the founding member of a bi-handed chaperone family and reveal an intramolecular handover mechanism that underlies their mode of action.},

We design a two-dimensional lattice of 261 coupled silicon nitride ring resonators that supports nested mode-locked states with fast ( ≈ 1 terahertz) single-ring and slow ( ≈ 3 gigahertz) topological super-ring timescales. We observe clear signatures of multi-timescale mode locking, including a quadratic distribution of pump noise across both azimuthal mode families, consistent with theory. These findings are supported by near-transform–limited repetition beats and the emergence of periodic temporal patterns on the slow timescale. The edge-confined states show distinct dynamics from bulk and single-ring modes, enabling clear identification. Our results establish topological frequency combs as a robust platform for independently tunable, lattice-scale synchronization, opening new directions for exploring the interplay of nonlinearity and topology in integrated photonics.},

Nanoparticles form conductive percolation under a precisely patterned magnetic field.

Here, we report the sequencing of a mitochondrial genome from a morphologically distinct Pacific mastodon, as well as from six eastern American mastodons with ages that range through the Middle and Late Pleistocene. We show that Pacific mastodons fall within a deeply divergent mitochondrial clade, extending the range of this species into western Canada and potentially Mexico. We also present evidence for at least three discrete expansion events into northeastern coastal regions and identify two new mastodon clades, which contain temporally distinct but geographically colocalized specimens. We integrate these findings with those of previous work into a comprehensive model of Mammut phylogeography.},

  abstract     = {Regulatory T reg cells are essential for immune homeostasis. While CD4 T reg cells are well characterized, CD8 T reg cells remain less understood and are primarily observed in pathological or experimental contexts. Here, we identify a naturally occurring CD8 regulatory precursor T rp cell at the steady state, defined by a CD8 + HLA-DR + CD27 + phenotype and a transcriptome resembling CD4 T reg cells. Multiomics analyses reveal activation of TCF7 and costimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules in CD8 T rp cells. CD8 T rp cells suppress T cell expansion in vitro and in vivo. In a humanized xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) model, they dampen T cell activation, alleviate GVHD pathology, and prolong survival without impairing antileukemia activity. Mechanistically, CD8 T rp cells promote immune regulation by inducing FOXP3 expression in both CD4 T reg cells and themselves. Their expansion also correlates with immune homeostasis restoration post–allogeneic stem cell transplantation. These findings establish CD8 T rp cells as a naturally occurring regulatory precursor population that promotes transplantation tolerance.},

The microscopic processes governing the formation of these states remain largely unknown, due to the inherent challenges in accessing the microscopic behavior of materials, which is strongly influenced by nuclear quantum effects. Here, we perform simulations of quantum nuclear dynamics in the nonequilibrium regime, extending beyond the current state of the art. By combining first-principles simulations with machine learning, we unveil the complex quantum dynamics of SrTiO 3 emerging after terahertz laser pumping. We disclose the microscopic origin of the phonon upconversion, observed experimentally but not fully understood, and quantify the lifetime of the out-of-equilibrium motion, which is beyond the reach of the state-of-the-art simplified models. Crucially, our simulations predict that terahertz pump pulses can generate persistent out-of-equilibrium stress capable of inducing polar order.

We developed deformation-resilient flexible batteries with enhanced performance under magnetic fields inherently present in magnetically actuated soft robots, with capacity retention after 200 cycles improved from 31.3 to 57.3%. These compliant batteries enable large-area deployment of 44.9% across the robot body, and their vertical integration with rationally designed flexible hybrid circuits minimizes additional stiffness while maintaining deformability. This actuator-battery-sensor vertical integration methodology maximizes functional area utilization in a manta ray–inspired soft robot, establishing an untethered platform with sensing, communication, and stable power supply.

Early-season westerly wind bursts (WWBs) have long been suggested to be important for ENSO evolution and diversity, with the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) among the main sources of WWBs. However, MJO’s contribution to ENSO evolution has been difficult to quantify. Here, using an ensemble hindcast approach specifically designed to isolate internal atmospheric variability, we evaluate the influences of March MJO on subsequent ENSO development. Our results show that the March MJO, under favorable background conditions, by itself has limited impacts on ENSO due to weak equatorial air-sea coupling in spring. In comparison, the North Pacific Oscillation–induced meridional mode exerts a more sustained influence on ENSO evolution. A cyclonic circulation anomaly over Hawaii, associated with the Pacific-North American pattern, also plays a role. These findings suggest that March MJO activity alone may not be a reliable predictor for ENSO evolution, but underscore the importance of North Pacific atmospheric variability.},

Our analysis of atmospheric energetics further reveals key mechanisms for magnitude uncertainty: aerosol radiative forcing drives, cloud radiative feedback amplifies, and ocean circulation damps the intermodel uncertainty in cross-equatorial atmospheric energy transport change and the meridional shift of tropical rain bands. This has important implications for understanding and reducing intermodel uncertainty in anthropogenic climate change.},

Here, we find a group of quasi-1D superconducting materials among hexagonal perovskite chalcogenides with face-sharing connectivity. Resistance and magnetization measurements demonstrate anisotropic superconductivity in compressed barium titanium trisulfide (BaTiS 3 ) at a low hole carrier concentration of (1.6 ± 0.1) × 10 21 per cubic centimeter, with the highest superconducting temperature ( T c ) reaching ~9.3 kelvin. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction indicates that the superconducting phase retains a hexagonal perovskite structure consisting of quasi-1D infinite titanium hexasulfide chains. Density functional theory calculations, combined with the observed decrease in the maximum T c from ~9.3 to ~6.2 kelvin upon substituting sulfur with selenium, suggest that electron-phonon interactions play a key role in the pairing mechanism of superconducting BaTiX 3 (X = sulfur and selenium).

This study establishes a Drosophila model for vomiting triggered by berberine ingestion. Our findings reveal that this response is mediated by the chemoreceptor TrpA1, which is indirectly activated by berberine via the mAChRs-PLC pathway. Berberine induces acetylcholine release from foregut epithelial cells, which triggers tachykinin secretion from intestinal tracheal cells. Tachykinins contract the visceral muscles, particularly the P4 pump of the foregut, and suppress myosuppressin release from pars intercerebralis neurons, thereby promoting crop motility. We further demonstrate the conservation of key genes involved in mammalian vomiting regulation. Overall, this study provides a molecular and cellular framework for understanding vomiting and introduces Drosophila as a genetic model for mechanistic studies.},

This provides an all-in-one solution for synchronized signal recording and substance release for physiological modulation.

The joint inversion of these geodetic data, template-matching seismicity, and repeating earthquakes, revealed the first two shallow slow slip events (SSEs) observed in Mexico. The first one migrated from the trench to the earthquake hypocenter before rupture, and the second one occurred following an M w 7.3 long-term SSE induced by the earthquake. Episodic near-trench oceanic-crust deformations (i.e., tilt transients) associated with shallow and deep synchronous decoupling of the plate interface reveal the occurrence of “slab-pull surges” before three regional earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater, including the Acapulco event, suggesting that they may serve as rupture precursors observable in subduction zones.},

Collectively, the results from single-cell sequencing of five diagnostic leukemia samples demonstrated that somatic mtDNA mutations can arise early in leukemogenesis and undergo positive selection during disease progression, achieving intermediate heteroplasmy—a “sweet spot” that balances mitochondrial dysfunction with cellular fitness. Network-based systems biology analyses link specific heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations to metabolic reprogramming and therapy resistance.

The skin cell–friendly nanosensor interface (SNI) enabled attomole-level detection of H 2 O 2 bursts in a two-dimensional keratinocyte model under natural ultraviolet exposure, revealing photoadaptation behavior. Distinct oxidative stress wave profiles were identified via nIR data and numerical modeling. Using SNI, we introduced the anti-ROS score to evaluate skin care antioxidants, providing insights into photoaging pathways and cosmetic advancements.},

  abstract     = {Insects, unlike vertebrates, use heteromeric complexes of odorant receptors and co-receptors for olfactory signal transduction. However, the secondary messengers involved in this process are largely unknown. Here, we use the olfactory signal transduction of the aggregation pheromone 4-vinylanisole (4VA) as a model to address this question. When locusts detect 4VA, the pheromone is transported by OBP10 and OBP13 to the OR35–Orco receptor complex, thereby activating downstream pathways in the antenna. A pivotal downstream molecule, the lipid-binding protein Clvs2, facilitates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate transportation across the cytolemma, providing more substrates for inositol trisphosphate (IP 3 ) production. PLCe1, a biosynthetic enzyme, boosts IP 3 levels in the antennal lobe of the brain. IP 3 is responsible for converting chemical signals from the antenna into neural signals, confirming IP 3 as a secondary messenger in olfaction perception instead of GPCR in locusts. These findings elucidate the universal function of IP 3 in olfactory signal perception, shedding light on the key nodes of insect olfactory signal transduction.},

The molecular catalysts with precise structures are unique platform to decipher the electrocatalytic mechanism, but they usually suffer from low performance. Herein, we report a strain-optimized dual copper complex immobilized in mesoporous carbon, which exhibits remarkable ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 49.9% along with a multicarbon (C 2+ ) product’s FE up to 65.2% at −1.19 volts versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Concurrently, the catalyst displays considerable stability for 15 hours at a full cell potential of −3.1 volts. The density functional theory calculation reveals that the strain effect imposed by mesoporous carbon regulates the neighboring dual copper sites in the electrocatalyst to decrease the energy barrier of rate-determining step (*COCO → *COCOH), thus significantly promoting ethylene production.},

Bulk RNA sequencing of milk fat globules (MFGs), milk cells, and breast tissue revealed that MFG-derived RNA closely mirrors luminal milk cells. Transcriptomic and single-cell RNA analyses identified changes in gene expression and cellular composition, highlighting key genes ( GLP1R , PLIN4 , and KLF10 ) and cell-type differences between low and high producers. Infant microbiome diversity was influenced by feeding type but not maternal milk production.

Parts of the 3D object can be individually reconstructed and combined. Our deep learning algorithm can reconstruct object volumes over 4 millimeters by 6 millimeters by 0.6 millimeters. We demonstrated substantial improvement in both reconstruction quality and speed compared to traditional methods for large-scale data.

Overall, the prevalence of low birthweight and term low birthweight were 45 to 100% higher than expected among women living in the affected communities whose late pregnancy overlapped with the blowout. The strongest effects were observed among women living directly south and southwest of the facility.

Here, we review evidence supporting this paradigm and quantify the differences in global and Northern Hemisphere estimates of the net land sink derived from atmospheric inversion and satellite-derived vegetation biomass time series. Our analysis, combined with additional synthesis, supports a hypothesis that the net land sink is substantially weaker than commonly reported. At a global scale, our estimate of the net land carbon sink is 0.8 ± 0.7 petagrams of carbon per year from 2000 through 2019, nearly a factor of two lower than the Global Carbon Project estimate. With concurrent adjustments to ocean (+8%) and fossil fuel (−6%) fluxes, we develop a budget that partially reconciles key constraints provided by vegetation carbon, the north-south CO 2 gradient, and O 2 trends. We further outline potential modifications to models to improve agreement with a weaker land sink and describe several approaches for testing the hypothesis.},

In metazoans, this involves adhesion proteins, signaling systems, and an elaborate extracellular matrix (ECM) that contributes to adhesion and signaling interactions. Innovations that enabled complex multicellularity occurred through new genes in these pathways, novel functions for existing genes, and regulatory changes. Gene regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) expanded with multicellularity. A single miRNA, miR-100, arose in the last common eumetazoan ancestor and is widely conserved across animals. We reveal the molecular function of its C. elegans homolog, the miR-51 family. This family acts in a dose-dependent manner to control morphogenesis by regulating several genes involved in cell signaling, adhesion, and migration, including ECM modifiers—specifically heparan sulfate sulfotransferases (HSTs). Some of these targets are also predicted to be conserved targets across vertebrates. Our work suggests that this miRNA provided an innovation in the regulation of cellular interactions early in metazoan evolution.},

The magnetothermoelectric responses in the quantum Hall regime agree with theoretical predictions if one considers the role of chiral edge states, which flow in opposite directions on either side of the Hall bar and establish an internal temperature gradient that is perpendicular to the externally applied thermal gradient. We show that the results are self-consistent within this picture under different measurement conditions.

Via imaging studies, using this electrofluorochromism, the apparent charge transfer diffusion coefficient D CT of the RAC was easily determined. The visualization of energy transport within suspensions of redox-active colloids was also demonstrated.

Despite extensive efforts to enhance performance through doping and composite engineering, the mechanisms underlying defect dipole coupling with phase structures remain poorly understood, impeding the advancement of defect-engineered symmetry modulation. Here, we report an abnormal pyroelectric phenomenon where the pyroelectric coefficient ( p ) increases notably when poling temperature exceeds the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition temperature ( T O-T ) in potassium sodium niobate ceramics. The p at 200°C ( p = 45.4 × 10 −4 C m −2 K −1 ) rises more than sevenfold compared to poling within the orthorhombic phase ( p = 6.5 × 10 −4 C m −2 K −1 ), representing the highest value reported to date and offering benefit for high-temperature thermal sensing. A dual mechanism is proposed, involving rigid-ion displacement and defect dipole alignment, which respectively contribute to increased displacement charge and space charge. Our findings establish a paradigm for optimizing high-temperature pyroelectrics through a simple, symmetry-confined thermal poling.},

  abstract     = {Stereotactic neurointervention is a common procedure for biopsy, injection, ablation, and implantation of electrodes for deep brain stimulation. Guided by preoperative imaging, conventional approaches are mostly performed manually, lacking operation stability and interactive feedback. The intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance enables both structural and functional assessment during operation, permitting interactive adaptation to tissue deformation and avoidance of critical anatomical regions. Here, we report an MRI-guided robotic system for stereotactic neurointervention. A macro-micro hybrid pneumatic-hydraulic actuated stereotactic robot with a large range of motion and high precision is developed. This is coupled with a compact bioinspired soft actuator for target intervention. A global-focal MRI sequence is proposed for interactive navigation, closed-loop control, and precise targeting. Validation is performed with phantom, cadaveric, and in vivo animal studies, showing positional accuracies of 0.39, 0.68, and 0.14 millimeters, respectively, demonstrating superior performance compared to the current state of the art in robotic-assisted stereotactic neurointervention.},

Previous global analyses described increased yield volatility from warming, but it has become increasingly clear that changes in water availability are also a key determinant of yields. Here, we provide the first global quantification of climate change impacts on maize, soybean, and sorghum yield variance due to changes in temperature and soil moisture. Pairing an empirical crop model with CMIP6 simulations indicates that changes in temperature and soil moisture increase interannual weather-induced yield variance by 7 to 19 % ° C across crops. This increase is driven roughly equally by previously quantified increased temperature stress variance, as well as by increased covariance between temperature and soil moisture stresses. Results using a simple land surface model are consistent with those using CMIP6 simulations in indicating that this increased covariance is driven by warmer air more quickly drying soils and by dry soils promoting greater warming.},

Current apheresis systems require large blood volumes and are primarily designed for adults, making them unsuitable for children and small animals. These systems often indiscriminately remove both harmful and protective antibodies, increasing the risk of complications such as life-threatening infections. To address this critical need, we developed acoustofluidic-based system for targeted antibody removal in transplantation (A-START). A-START is engineered to handle small blood volumes and has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical small animal trials. In a sensitized rodent skin transplantation model, A-START only demands 240 microliters of blood, selectively removing donor-specific alloantibodies (DSAs) while preserving protective antibodies, such as tetanus antibodies. A-START retains ~95% of beneficial antibodies and achieves a 60% improvement in DSA removal compared to conventional methods. These findings highlight the transformative potential of A-START as a promising, reliable, scalable solution for improving outcomes in pediatric transplantation and treating antibody-mediated diseases.},

Here, we computationally predict and experimentally validate a vectorial hierarchy of folding resolved at the atomistic level, where early intermediates are stabilized through non-native hydrophobic interactions before rearranging into the native-like fold. Disrupting these interactions destabilizes intermediates and impairs folding. The chaperone trigger factor alters the cotranslational folding pathway by keeping the nascent peptide dynamic until the full domain emerges.

However, a practical strategy that merges bench-stable glycosyl donors with styrenes—a ubiquitous class of synthetic building blocks—remains elusive. Herein, we report a simple and general approach for synthesizing ketonyl C -glycosides. The transformation uses designed glycosyl sulfides as air- and moisture-stable precursors to glycosyl radicals, styrenes as aglycone sources, and dimethyl sulfoxide as both an oxidant and solvent, proceeding under photoredox catalysis. Glycosyl radicals are generated from glycosyl sulfides via efficient unimolecular homolytic substitution. This approach obviates harsh conditions for donor activation and the use of activated aglycone precursors, accommodating extensive functional groups and heterocycles. The reaction also exhibits high stereoselectivity across various glycosyl units. Demonstrating synthetic versatility, this method enables efficient access to diverse drug-sugar conjugates and complex C -glycopeptidomimetics. Mechanistic studies reveal key intermediates, suggesting a radical-polar crossover pathway. This study offers a broadly applicable approach to valuable sugar-containing structures.},

In this work, we accurately replicate the anatomical features and the ganglia adjustments of OSNCEs using lensed plastic optical fibers as artificial ommatidia. As the core part of this work, we implement a spatial approach alongside a temporal approach derived from both hardware and algorithms to accommodate lighting variations of up to 1000 times while still maintaining high image quality such as 180° field of view, minimal distortion, nearly infinite depth of field, and ultrafast motion detection. These adaptive biomimetic features make the OSACE very promising for surveillance, virtual reality, and unmanned aerial vehicles.},

Here, we unveil that the TaCEP15 peptide interacts with the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase TaCEPRL. Knockout of TaCEP15 or TaCEPRL increases primary root length and enhances drought tolerance in wheat. TaCEPRL interacts with and phosphorylates TaSnRK1α, leading to the degradation of TaSnRK1α. The presence of TaCEP15 intensifies the phosphorylation and degradation of TaSnRK1α. Consistently, overexpressing TaSnRK1 α boosts primary root elongation and augments drought tolerance. In addition, we identify the transcription factor TabZIP9, which binds to the TaCEP15 promoter and suppresses its transcription. A-to-T substitution in the TaCEP15 promoter decreases the binding affinity of TabZIP9. As expected, transgenic plants with TabZIP9 knockout or overexpression exhibit noteworthy changes in primary root length and drought tolerance. Our findings shed light on the importance of the peptide signaling pathway in regulating primary root length and responding to drought stress in wheat.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is hallmarked by phenotypic transitions enabling abnormal cell proliferation and invasion. The stress-protective transcription factor heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) is associated with cancer, but its function in breast carcinogenesis remains poorly understood. Analysis of human breast tumor samples and mouse in vivo xenografts uncovered that HSF2 expression and activity undergo dynamic changes as a function of tumor progression. HSF2 expression, nuclear localization, and coexpression with the proliferation marker Ki67 are increased in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), suggesting that HSF2 designates hyperplastic cells underlying tumor expansion. In mouse xenografts, HSF2 localization switches from nuclear to cytoplasmic upon DCIS-to-invasive transition. Using cell-based models, we identify canonical transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) signaling as the molecular mechanism regulating HSF2. TGF-β–mediated down-regulation of HSF2 allowed acquisition of an invasive cell phenotype, which was counteracted by ectopic HSF2. Together, we propose that HSF2 acts as a stage-specific switch between proliferation and invasion in breast cancer.},

To materialize this mapper, we developed an automated, in situ synthesis platform that facilitates the self-acting fabrication of robust, solid-state, chiral optical spin constrained assemblies. Our mappers, formed by randomized arrays of discrete assemblies, demonstrate near-theoretical performance in uniformity (0.4917), uniqueness (0.4968), and reliability (0.9355).

Theoretical and experimental investigations on phantom materials and tissues spanning a wide range of Young’s modulus (in kilopascals to megapascals) demonstrate the capability of the device to rapidly and robustly evaluate the stiffness at depths up to several centimeters.

Using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, we directly map polar displacements in BaTiO 3 across the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition, providing atomistic insights into an order-disorder mechanism. Atomic tracking reveals finite polar Ti displacements in the paraelectric phase where they manifest as random polar nanoregions.

Observations of lattice distortion, bandgap modulation at E F , and STM contrast inversion at low temperatures indicate a charge ordering origin.

  abstract     = {Age-related deterioration in bone strength among Western humans has been linked with sedentary lifestyles, but the effect remains debatable. We evaluated aging of diaphyseal strength and cortical bone loss in a European Holocene sample of 1881 adult humeri, femora, and tibiae. Diaphyseal aging did not differ between Early and Late Holocene adults, despite their differences in physical activity. Adult diaphyseal aging was accompanied by the disproportionate rate between a faster increase in the medullary area and an absent or marginal increase in the total area. This indicates that subperiosteal apposition did not fully biomechanically compensate for the medullary expansion. Diaphyseal strength remained unchanged through age in female femora and male diaphyses but declined in female humeri and tibiae. We highlight the importance of postnatal growth to compensate for adult medullary expansion. Diaphyseal aging is critical for the upper limbs, as humeri are more sensitive to aging than femora and tibiae.},

Using a flow cytometry–based screening, we profiled 332 surface receptors on HIV-1–infected primary CD4 + T cells and identified 23 down-regulated receptors, including known targets such as CD4, MHCI, CCR7, and CD62L. CD96, an inhibitory natural killer (NK) cell receptor poorly studied in human CD4 + T cells, was markedly down-regulated. This modulation, mediated by the viral proteins Nef and Vpu, surpassed that of other NK-associated receptors such as CD155 and NTB-A and is conserved across lentiviruses. CD96 Hi CD4 + T cells exhibited a proinflammatory T H 1/T H 17 phenotype characterized by IFN-γ and IL-17 secretion and displayed impaired migration in vivo. Furthermore, CD96 ligation enhanced IFN-γ release upon viral peptide stimulation and promoted the secretion of T H 1/T H 17-associated cytokines. Our findings suggest that CD96 regulates antiviral immune responses and maintains proinflammatory properties in CD4 + T cells. Thus, its down-regulation represents a previously unknown HIV-1 immune evasion strategy, with implications for exploiting CD96 as immunotherapeutic target.},

  abstract     = {ADP-ribosylation can occur as mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) or be extended into poly-ADP-ribose (PAR). Tankyrase, a PAR transferase, adds PAR to itself and other proteins targeting them for proteasomal degradation via the PAR-binding E3 ligase RNF146. This degradation can be counteracted by RING-UIM E3 ligases RNF114 and RNF166, although the process is unclear. Here, we identify a mechanism that can regulate the balance between MAR and PAR on tankyrase to control degradation. We show that Deltex E3 ligases DTX2 and DTX3 catalyze monoubiquitylation of tankyrase in cells. This ubiquitylation occurs, not on a (canonical) lysine, but rather on MAR, creating a monoubiquitin-MAR hybrid mark. RNF114 and RNF166 recognize this mark using a unique hybrid reader domain and further diubiquitylate it. This ubiquitylation of MAR, which occurs near the ADP-ribose addition site, prevents PAR formation, antagonizing the action of the PAR-binding E3 ligase RNF146 and stabilizing tankyrase. These findings reveal an interplay between ubiquitin, ADP-ribose, and E3 ligases in cellular signaling.},

Although many elaborate experiments have been performed using, for example, matter wave interferometry or even quantum entanglement, none are within six orders of magnitude of the sensitivity and stability required to achieve such a measurement. We report on the operation of a free space ring laser gyroscope over a period of 250 days under an ambient pressure stabilizing vessel continuously in an unperturbed underground laboratory. Because we measure relative to local inertial space, the precession and nutation motion of Earth’s axis are intrinsically contained in the observations. It is demonstrated that optical interferometry, using an ultrastable cavity, yields an accuracy limit for rotation sensing of 48 parts per billion (i.e., picoradians per second), less than an order of magnitude away from the regime in which relativistic effects can be measured.},

Here, we overcome this bottleneck by demonstrating surface-emitting quasi-BIC lasers fabricated with a bottom-up, etching-free process. We epitaxially grow arrays of crystal phase–engineered InP nanosheets with atomically smooth sidewalls as both the laser active medium and a symmetry-broken quasi-BIC cavity, strategically optimizing coupling between spontaneous emission and the lasing mode. Furthermore, we leverage the dipole selection rule associated with the wurtzite crystal structure of the nanosheets for side mode suppression, achieving single-mode lasing at room temperature with lasing threshold as low as 14 μJ cm −2 pulse −1 . Optimal light-cavity coupling is evidenced by spontaneous emission factors as high as 0.8, showcasing the potential of bottom-up BIC lasers in realizing near-thresholdless lasing at room temperature.},

This weakening of correlations persists for hundreds of picoseconds and exhibits a recovery time independent of photodoping density across two orders of magnitude. A broadening of the charge-transfer gap is also observed, consistent with dynamical screening. The high degree of control achieved over both the energy and temporal dynamics of electronic correlations offers a promising avenue to a full optical control of correlated systems and the Mott transition.},

More than 800 short-duration seismic events were detected within 28 days along a 150-kilometer profile, indicating widespread ongoing explosive gas release. We suggest that billions of tons of hydrogen gas were produced through serpentinization associated with fluid infiltration via fractures formed by bending of the oceanic plate. Hydrogen was retained in fractures sealed by mud and carbonate. However, hydrogen alone cannot produce the explosive capacity responsible for the formation of pipes. Oxygen released from circulating seawater can be concentrated at crustal depths and then mixed with mantle-derived hydrogen. Explosion of the gas mixture releases large amounts of heat that triggers further explosions of compressed hydrogen gas and results in the formation of hydrothermal pipes.},

However, the brain is extensively interconnected, and the neurons comprising those connections may themselves be particularly susceptible to neurostimulation. Here, we test this hypothesis by identifying long-range projections in single-unit recordings from nonhuman primates receiving transcranial alternating current stimulation. We find that putative long-range projections are more strongly affected by stimulation than other cells. Specifically, they are both more entrained on average and account for occurrences of extremely strong entrainment. Given that stimulation appears to target the edges, rather than nodes, of neural networks, it may be necessary to rethink how neurostimulation strategies are designed.},

Using ultrafast force-clamp spectroscopy, we show that single Ndc80 complexes, the primary microtubule-binding kinetochore component, exhibit processive, bidirectional sliding. Plus end–directed forces induce a mobile catch bond in Ndc80, increasing frictional resistance and restricting sliding toward the tip. Conversely, forces pulling Ndc80 away from the plus end trigger mobile slip-bond behavior, facilitating sliding. This dual behavior arises from force-dependent modulation of the Nuf2 calponin-homology domain’s microtubule binding, identifying this subunit as a friction regulator. We propose that Ndc80’s ability to modulate sliding friction provides the mechanistic basis for the kinetochore’s end coupling, enabling its slip-clutch behavior.},

Using fluorescent-labeled AGs and flow cytometry, we quantified differential uptake. To enhance AG efficacy, we screened 198 carbon sources for their ability to induce transporter expression using a cmtA - gfp fusion. Uridine emerged as a strong inducer of cmtA and 12 additional AG-importing transporters. Coadministration of uridine considerably improved AG efficacy against clinical and resistant E. coli strains by enhancing drug uptake. This combination also improved outcomes in human blood ex vivo and in a murine urinary tract infection model.

  abstract     = {Topological superconductors are one of the intriguing material groups from the viewpoint of not only condensed matter physics but also industrial applications such as quantum computers based on Majorana fermion. For real applications, developments of thin-film topological superconductors are highly desirable. Bi/Ni bilayer is a possible candidate for thin-film chiral superconductors where the time-reversal symmetry is broken. Here we report the phase shift of resistance oscillations by half flux quantum in a ring-shaped device of epitaxial Bi/Ni bilayer induced by a small magnetic field through the ring. The half quantum fluxoid can be decisive evidence for unconventional superconductors where the superconducting order parameter has an internal degree of freedom. The present result provides a functional operating principle for quantum devices where the phase of the supercurrent can be shifted by π with a small magnetic field, based on the internal degree of freedom had by topological superconductivity.},

  abstract     = {Path integration, the ability to track one’s position using self-motion cues, is critically dependent on the grid cell network in the entorhinal cortex, a region vulnerable to early Alzheimer’s disease pathology. In this study, we examined path integration performance in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a group at increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease, and healthy controls using an immersive virtual reality task. We developed a Bayesian computational model to decompose path integration errors into distinct components. SCD participants exhibited significantly higher path integration error, primarily driven by increased memory leak, while other modeling-derived error sources, such as velocity gain, sensory, and reporting noise, remained comparable across groups. Our findings suggest that path integration deficits, specifically memory leak, may serve as an early marker of neurodegeneration in SCD and highlight the potential of self-motion–based navigation tasks for detecting presymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease–related cognitive changes.},

Here, we present a bioinspired twist-hyperbolic metamaterial (THM) integrated with a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) for simultaneously impact buffering and self-powered sensing. The THM-TENG protector exhibits tunable stiffness (40 to 4300 newtons per millimeter), ~70% impact energy absorption, and achieves a specific energy absorption of ~0.25 joules per gram at a weight of only 10 grams. Through triboelectrification, the protector converts mechanical energy into electrical signals, enabling real-time monitoring of impact loads up to 1000 newtons (≤5 hertz). Integrated with a microcontroller unit, wireless transmission, and alarm systems, THM-TENG demonstrates dual functionality in UAVs: mitigating vibration while providing real-time force monitoring, positioning, and early warning, all without external power sources. This work establishes a transformative framework for lightweight, multifunctional protective systems with applications in aerospace, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.},

Using thallium (Tl) isotope ratios in deep-marine mudrocks, we reconstruct the history of deep marine oxygenation from ~485 to 380 million years ago. Thallium isotopes can track bottom water oxygenation indirectly through their sensitivity to seafloor Mn oxide burial. We apply Tl isotopes to a global set of mudrocks, placing a particular focus on the Road River Group of Yukon, Canada. Our data reveal an oscillatory pattern in seawater Tl isotope ratios and, in turn, a dynamic ocean ventilation history. A long-lived deep ocean oxygenation episode is identified between ~405 and 386 million years ago. These short-term dynamics are superimposed on a muted positive ocean oxygenation trend over the entire Early and Middle Paleozoic. Sustained O 2 accumulation in global marine bottom waters occurred sometime after ~380 million years ago according to our dataset.},

In the Drosophila circadian clock network, the small ventral lateral neurons (sLN v s) serve as critical pacemakers. Peptidergic communication mediated by the neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF), released by sLN v s, has been well characterized. In contrast, little is known about the role of the synaptic connections that sLN v s form with downstream neurons. Connectomic analyses revealed that the sLN v s form strong synaptic connections with previously uncharacterized neurons called superior lateral protocerebrum 316 (SLP316). Here, we show that silencing the synaptic output from the SLP316 neurons via tetanus toxin expression shortened the free-running period, whereas hyperexciting them by expressing the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel resulted in period lengthening. Under light-dark cycles, silencing SLP316 neurons caused lower daytime activity and higher daytime sleep. Our results reveal that the main postsynaptic partners of key Drosophila pacemaker neurons are a nonclock neuronal cell type that regulates the timing of sleep and activity.},

Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of long-term/low-dose Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) supplementation in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)–infected, ART-treated rhesus macaques (RMs). THC significantly increased plasma/jejunum serotonin and indole-3-propionate, enhancing gut-brain communication through up-regulation of serotonin receptors (HTR4/HTR7) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) signaling via a cannabinoid receptor (CBR)-2–mediated mechanism. Furthermore, THC enriched cholesterol-metabolizing Oscillibacter and reduced plasma cholesterol and toxic secondary bile acids (SBAs), thus improving cholesterol and SBA homeostasis. Furthermore, THC increased β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels via a CBR1-mediated mechanism, suggesting enhanced hepatic fatty acid oxidation for metabolic and cardiovascular health. THC restored ART/SIV-induced elevation of pro-inflammatory and cardiotoxic long-chain acylcholines to preinfection levels. THC-treated RMs maintained viral suppression despite reduced plasma ART levels, suggesting diminished ART-related toxicity. Our findings demonstrate phytocannabinoids to be a safe adjunct therapy alongside ART to mitigate chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction in PWH.},

  abstract     = {Wheat production is limited by the rapid expansion of salinized arable land worldwide. Identification of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the salt stress response is of great importance. Here, we uncovered the NAC-type transcription factor, TaVOZ1, as a positive regulator of wheat salt tolerance. Its overexpression could enhance yield and biomass production under salt stress, while TaVOZ1 knockdown attenuates salt tolerance. TaVOZ1 transcriptionally activates stress-responsive genes, especially HKT1 -family transporters, decreasing shoot Na + accumulation. However, the RING-type E3 ligase, TaGW2, directly interacts with and ubiquitinates TaVOZ1, promoting its ubiquitin/26 S proteasomal degradation. TaGW2 overexpression reduces salt tolerance, while its knockdown or knockout enhances wheat response to salt stress. Moreover, we found a moonlight function of TaGW2 wherein it binds the same DNA motifs as TaVOZ1 to block its up-regulation of HKT1 -family genes while coordinately governing both the salt tolerance and grain yield. This study highlights the functional versatility of TaGW2 and defines an antagonistic TaGW2-TaVOZ1 regulatory module in wheat salt tolerance.},

A long-sought-after goal is to achieve complementary absorption enhancement through energy transfer (ET) to break this limit. However, it is found challenging due to the competing charge transfer (CT) process and lack of resonance in exciton states. Here, we report highly efficient ET in a 2D hybrid organic-inorganic heterostructure (HOIST) of Me-PTCDI/WS 2 . Resonant ET is observed leading to enhanced WS 2 photoluminescence (PL) by 124 times. We identify Dexter exchange between the Frenkel state in donor and an excited 2 s state in acceptor as the main ET mechanism, as supported by density functional theory calculations. We further demonstrate ET-enhanced phototransistor devices with enhanced responsivity by nearly 1000 times without sacrificing the response time.

Archaeozoological analysis of identifiable domestic equid remains from two contexts associated with the initial occupation of Jamestown demonstrates intense processing and consumption of the first Jamestown horses during the “Starving Time” winter of 1609. Osteological and biomolecular study of these equid remains demonstrates their successful reproduction at the colony and use in transport activities and identifies an adult domestic donkey with mixed European and West African ancestry, possibly supplied through undocumented exchange during a transatlantic stopover.

  abstract     = {Protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) is encoded by a gene strongly associated with lupus and other autoimmune diseases. PTPN22 regulates T cell receptor (TCR) signaling through dephosphorylation of the kinases lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) and zeta-chain–associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70). The regulation of PTPN22 remains poorly understood. Here, we identify PTPN22 Ser 449 as a protein kinase A phosphorylation site, which is triggered by TCR engagement and is hyperphosphorylated in lupus peripheral blood cells. PTPN22 Ser 449 phosphorylation selectively lowered the affinity of PTPN22 for ZAP70 versus LCK but also indirectly suppressed inhibitory LCK Tyr 192 phosphorylation through a ZAP70-CD45 signaling axis. The resulting dephosphorylation of LCK Tyr 192 not only enhanced TCR signaling but also modulated pathway activation downstream the TCR. In vivo loss of PTPN22 Ser 449 phosphorylation reduced T cell responses and suppressed experimental lupus nephritis. These results suggest that PTPN22 Ser 449 phosphorylation promotes a CD45-mediated retrograde ZAP70-LCK feedback loop that enhances T cell responses and promotes autoimmunity.},

  abstract     = {Resolving timing of the invasion of nonindigenous species is difficult in estuarine settings, due to their pervasive history of anthropogenic disturbance. Many non-native marine taxa are not documented until after they have become invasive, leaving questions about invasion timing (first introduction and lag period), geographic origin, vectors and pathways, and cause(s) of success. Foraminifera, unicellular, calcareous-shelled eukaryotes, offer a unique way of analyzing past ecosystem structure because their fossilized shells provide a window into the past, and small size and abundance enable us to document distribution over time in core samples. We use records of Foraminifera to document the timing and history of establishment of an invasive species ( Ammonia confertitesta ) in Long Island Sound, east of New York City (USA). A. confertitesta was rare from the mid-19th century but did not proliferate until the mid-1970s. We hypothesize that increasing propagule pressure from the rapid increase in global ship traffic and ballast water was the main factor for its success.},

  abstract     = {Intercellular cross-talk is essential for the adaptation capabilities of populations of cells. While direct diffusion-driven cell-to-cell exchanges are difficult to map, current nanotechnology enables one to probe single-cell exchanges with the medium. We introduce a mathematical method to reconstruct the dynamic unfolding of intercellular exchange networks from these data, applying it to an experimental coculture system. The exchange network, initially dense, progressively fragments into small disconnected clusters. To explain these dynamics, we develop a maximum-entropy multicellular metabolic model with diffusion-driven exchanges. The model predicts a transition from a dense network to a sparse one as nutrient consumption shifts. We characterize this crossover both numerically, revealing a power-law decay in the cluster-size distribution, and analytically, by connecting to percolation theory. Comparison with data suggests that populations evolve toward the sparse phase by remaining near the crossover. These findings offer insights into the collective organization driving the adaptive dynamics of cell populations.},

However, adverse events (e.g., chorioretinal atrophy) have been reported in many patients receiving subretinal injection of Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) and experimental gene therapies. Subretinal injection confines transduction to the treated area. To address this, we manufactured high-concentration fibrin hydrogels encapsulating AAV2–green fluorescent protein (AAV2- GFP ). Gels had homogeneous AAV distribution, desired mechanical properties, and retained infectivity. Epiretinal placement of fibrin–AAV2- GFP ( n = 11) was compared to subretinal ( n = 5) and intravitreal AAV2- GFP injection ( n = 3). The subretinal group exhibited inconsistent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) transduction restricted to the injection region with severe atrophy in two cases. The intravitreal group had weak transduction and inflammation. In contrast, epiretinal hydrogels degraded within days and led to broad transduction of RPE without atrophy or inflammation. This technology could advance gene therapy for retinal degenerations and other ocular or systemic disorders.},

To address this puzzle, the COSINE-100 collaboration conducted a model-independent test using sodium iodide crystal detectors, the same target material as DAMA/LIBRA. Analyzing data collected over 6.4 years by the effective mass of 61.3 kilograms, with improved energy calibration and time-dependent background modeling, we found no evidence of an annual modulation signal, challenging the DAMA/LIBRA result with a confidence level greater than 3σ. This finding represents a substantial step toward resolving the long-standing debate surrounding DAMA/LIBRA’s dark matter claim, indicating that the observed modulation is unlikely to be caused by dark matter interactions.},

BAETA shows strong chemisorption featuring high selectivity for CO 2 capture from flue gas (5 to 20% CO 2 ) and ambient air (~400 parts per million CO 2 ) under humid conditions. Our thermally stable material (>250°C) enables CO 2 capture at high temperatures (up to 170°C) for multiple cycles. Scalability of the material production was demonstrated by performing aminolysis of untreated consumer waste PET of 1 kilogram.

Using an integrative approach, we identify a fundamental role of MI in avian metabolism. We show that MI transporters are highly conserved across birds and that dietary MI reduces fat accumulation in Anna’s hummingbirds. MI consumption by hummingbirds varies with seasonal changes in body mass, consistent with a regulatory role. Furthermore, MI enhances fatty acid oxidation in avian cells, via effects on pyruvate-dehydrogenase complexes, indicating a role in mitochondrial fuel selection. Our findings underscore the importance of MI in avian metabolism, offering insights into their evolutionary adaptations in the context of insulin insensitivity.},

Here, we explore this question using a coupled climate model. We show that the existence of the North American continent is critical for the intensity of the Asian summer monsoon. The mechanism involves North America acting as an additional heating center, resulting in the strengthening and extension of oceanic advection toward the monsoon region. This is achieved via the Rodwell-Hoskins mechanism that strengthens the North Pacific subtropical high and through a widespread Northern Hemisphere heating that shifts the Hadly circulation subsidence center poleward. This teleconnection is independent of the presence of the Tibetan Plateau, and its impact on East Asian summer precipitation is found to be smaller but comparable to that of Tibet. The individual role of other continents outside Afro-Eurasia is found to be less important.},

Ca 2+ ions stabilize both the SdrD complex and the mechanically robust SdrD B-domains, which exhibit unprecedented folding strength. In the context of atopic dermatitis (AD), disrupted calcium gradients amplify SdrD interactions, which could potentially intensify S. aureus virulence. Furthermore, abnormal DSG-1 distribution on AD-affected skin enhances bacterial adhesion.

Initially, a concentrated subset of AI-assisted creators contributes more novel artifacts in absolute terms through increased output—the productivity effect—although the average rate of contributing novel artifacts decreases because of a dilution effect. This reflects a shift toward high-volume, incremental exploration, ultimately yielding a greater aggregate of novel artifacts by AI-assisted creators. We observe no evidence of a human-AI effect above and beyond the productivity effect. The release of open-source Stable Diffusion accelerates novel contributions across a more diverse group, suggesting that text-to-image tools facilitate exploration at scale, initially enabling persistent breakthroughs by select “masterminds,” driven by increased volume, and subsequently enabling widespread novel contributions from a “hive mind.”},

In chordoma cells, T-DARPins reduced cell cycle progression, spheroid formation, and tumor growth in mice and induced signs of senescence and differentiation. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identified gene networks involved in cell cycle regulation, embryonic cell identity, and interferon response and revealed features of regulome components, such as susceptibility to pharmacologic inhibition and the fine-tuning of TBXT downstream effectors through IGFBP3. Finally, we found high interferon signaling in chordoma cell lines and patient tumors, which was promoted by TBXT and associated with sensitivity to JAK2 inhibitors.

Cardiomyocytes sense the mechanical properties of their environment, leading to phenotypic remodeling. A critical component of the ECM mechanosensing machinery, including the protein talin, is organized at the cardiomyocyte costamere. Our previous work indicated a different talin tension, depending on the ECM stiffness, but the effects on downstream signaling remained elusive. Here, we identify that the talin interacting proteins DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1), RIAM (Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule), and paxillin each preferentially bind to talin at a specific ECM stiffness, this interaction is preserved in the absence of tension, and the interaction is regulated through focal adhesion kinase signaling. Moreover, DLC1 regulates cardiomyocyte RhoA activity in a stiffness-dependent way, whereby the loss of DLC1 results in myofibrillar disarray. Together, this study demonstrates a mechanism of imprinting mechanical information into the talin interactome to fine-tune RhoA activity, with impacts on cardiac health and disease.},

Gal-3 blockade disrupts ABP and alters the distribution of junctional proteins in hESC-derived neural rosettes and is rescued by addition of recombinant Gal-3. Transcriptomics analysis shows that blocking Gal-3 regulates expression of genes responsible for nervous system development and cell junction assembly, among others. Last, Gal-3 blockade during embryonic development in vivo reduces horizontal cell divisions, disturbs cortical layering of neural progenitors, and induces gyrification.

  abstract     = {Potent and selective binders of the key proapoptotic proteins BAK and BAX have not been described. We use computational protein design to generate high affinity binders of BAK and BAX with greater than 100-fold specificity for their target. Both binders activate their targets when at low concentration, driving pore formation, but inhibit membrane permeabilization when in excess. Crystallography shows that the BAK binder induces BAK unfolding, exposing the α6 helix and BH3 domain. Together, these data suggest that upon binding, BAK or BAX unfold; at high binder concentrations, self-association of the partially folded BAK or BAX proteins is blocked and the membrane remains intact, whereas at low concentrations, dimers form, and the membrane ruptures. Our designed binders modulate apoptosis via direct, specific interactions with BAK and BAX and reveal that for therapeutic strategies targeting BAK and BAX, inhibition requires saturating binder concentrations at the site of action.},

  abstract     = {Movement is executed through balanced excitation-inhibition in spinal motor circuits. Short-term perturbations in one type of neurotransmission are homeostatically counteracted by the opposing type, but prolonged excitation-inhibition imbalance causes dysfunction at both single neuron and circuit levels. However, whether dysfunction in one or both types of neurotransmission leads to pathogenicity in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by select synaptic deficits is not known. Here, we used functional, morphological, and viral-mediated approaches to uncover the pathogenic contribution of unbalanced excitation-inhibition in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We show that vulnerable SMA motor circuits fail to respond homeostatically to reduced excitation and instead increase inhibition. This imposes an excessive burden on motor neurons and further restricts their recruitment. Reducing inhibition genetically or pharmacologically improves neuronal function and motor behavior in SMA mice. Thus, the disruption of excitation-inhibition homeostasis is a major maladaptive mechanism that diminishes the capacity of premotor commands to recruit motor neurons and elicit muscle contractions in SMA.},

Here, we confirm a fission event in one zokor species through multiple-omics and functional analyses. We traced this event to a mutation in a splicing enhancer of the DNA repair gene Aplf in the fission-bearing species, which caused exon skipping and produced a truncated protein that disrupted DNA repair. An intronic deletion in Dna2 , known to facilitate neo-telomere formation when knocked out, reduced gene activity. These variants collectively drove chromosomal fission in this zokor species. The newly formed chromosome became fixed due to carrying essential genes and strong selective pressure. While geographic isolation likely initiated the divergence of this species and the sister one, the fission event and associated decline at the chromosome level in gene flow probably exacerbated the speciation process. Our work elucidates the genetic basis of chromosomal fission and underscores its role in speciation dynamics.},

Using satellite data, we characterized how PSMA has affected high seas vessel behavior and identify opportunities to strengthen its impact. PSMA adoption has increased travel distances to the nearest ports in States not Party to PSMA and channeled more fishing effort to domestic and PSMA Party ports. However, domestic fishing fleets need greater attention because they constituted 66% of port visits in 2021. Among reflagged vessels, we also found a 30% increase in visits to PSMA ports by vessels shifting to domestic flags after PSMA entered into force, allowing them to avoid PSMA requirements for foreign vessels.

However, these processes were not fully integrated in past sulfur cycling models because of complexity from the gas-melt interactions in chemically and dynamically evolving magmatic systems with multicomponent volatiles. Here, we incorporate these processes to simulate how sulfur, carbon, and hydrogen degas from martian melts. We find that reduced sulfur species, H 2 S and S 2 , are dominantly emitted through degassing at crustal to surficial pressures. These sulfur species could condense as sulfide and elemental sulfur, potentially yielding the sulfate deposits observed on the martian surface through secondary oxidation. Our models also show that evolved magmas reach graphite and sulfide saturation at crustal pressures and thus may establish sulfur and carbon reservoirs in the martian crust. The degassed H 2 S and S 2 may form a hazy atmosphere with SF 6 , a potent greenhouse gas, to shape the paleoclimate of Mars.},

Differentiation therapy, aiming to mature CSCs and MDSCs, shows great promise. However, its efficacy is hindered by limited accessibility in hypoxic deep tumor regions. Inspired by the apoptotic body (ApoBD)–mediated deep tumor penetration, we design a pulsatile sequential drug release system with a core-shell structure. The reversible acid-responsive shell protonates and swells in lysosomes to release doxorubicin, inducing lysosomal escape and cell apoptosis. In ApoBDs, it deprotonates and contracts to prevent excessive drug release. After deep penetration via ApoBDs, the hypoxia-responsive core releases all-trans retinoic acid to reverse CSCs and MDSCs, overcoming chemoresistance and modulating the immuno-microenvironment. This strategy targets the heterogeneous distribution of CSCs and MDSCs in solid tumors, enhancing chemo-intervention and immune checkpoint blockade therapy while presenting encouraging potential for cascade deep tumor penetration and differentiation therapy.},

Shao et al . found that the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal domain was not required for recruiting splicing factors during co-transcriptional splicing. Instead, the Pol II subunit RPB9 directly interacted with the splicing factor U2AF1, whereas U2AF2 operated independently. There is thus a dynamic “U2AF cycle” that separates splicing into two phases: an early Pol II–dependent phase and a later Pol II–independent phase. These findings reshape our understanding of how splicing is regulated during transcription, with implications for gene expression and disease mechanisms. —Di Jiang Distinguishing functional splice sites from abundant cryptic sites in precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) represents a fundamental challenge in decoding mammalian genomes. We demonstrate that the specific RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit RPB9 directly interacts with the 3′ AG dinucleotide binding factor U2AF1 to initiate 3′ splice site recognition. Combined with recent structural insights into Pol II–mediated 5′ splice site selection, these findings support a cotranscriptional mechanism to recognize paired 3′ and 5′ splice sites across individual exons. These initial exon definition events facilitate the recruitment of U2AF2 to heterodimerize with U2AF1, which also triggers U2AF1 release from elongating Pol II. Collectively, these results reveal dynamic U2AF cycling that partitions Pol II subunit–facilitated splice site recognition and subsequent Pol II–independent spliceosome assembly steps during cotranscriptional splicing.},

The juxtaposition of these conditions might help to explain the origins of past “snowball” climates such as those seen in the Neoproterozoic. —Jesse Smith Negative feedback between climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), mediated by the weathering of silicate minerals on land, is thought to provide the primary regulation of Earth’s climate on geological timescales. By contrast, we found that faster feedbacks involving organic matter are not only critical to Earth system recovery but can also create unexpected instability. Our Earth system model experiments show how sedimentary organic carbon burial, amplified by redox-sensitive phosphorus regeneration, can outweigh silicate weathering and paradoxically drive climate overcooling in response to massive CO 2 release. This instability depends on the initial balance between silicate weathering and organic carbon burial in addition to the state of global phosphorus cycling. It is most strongly expressed at intermediate ocean redox states, which may help us understand the timing of past ice ages.},

  abstract     = {Like leafcutter ants, fungus-farming termites ( Odontotermes obesus ) form a symbiotic relationship with a fungus ( Termitomyces ) that serves as a stable food source. An unknown feature of this relationship is how the termites prevent the nutritional “combs” they produce from being overtaken by other fungi such as filamentous Pseudoxylaria , which have been observed to overtake combs when termites are experimentally removed. Panchal et al . observed termites removing Pseudoxylaria and covering them with soil boluses, and fully encasing Pseudoxylaria successfully prevented its infection of combs (see the Perspective by Goes and Adams). Further experiments showed that soil boluses are effective because of the fungistatic properties of bacteria associated with the termites, which the termites selectively apply to the “weedy,” but not the crop, fungus. —Bianca Lopez The symbiotic agriculture of fungus-farming termites can collapse if they fail to prevent invading weeds. Previous studies suggest a role for symbiotic fungistatic microbes in bringing about weed control. However, how termites employ these microbes to suppress fungal weeds without affecting the fungal cultivar remains unknown. We show that the fungus-farming termite Odontotermes obesus uses specific behaviors to remove, isolate, and suppress the growth of the fungal weed Pseudoxylaria , primarily by encasing it with soil boluses containing fungistatic microbes. These behaviors efficiently suppress the weed without affecting the crop. This integration of specific behaviors with termite-derived microbes appears to be the proximate mechanism of how microbes are topically used by termites to confine the weed while keeping the crop unaffected.},

  abstract     = {For earthquake warnings, each second counts toward characterizing a fault’s rupture. Ruptures from large earthquakes, particularly those offshore, may have varying speed profiles that can only be resolved by dense arrays. In 2022, Atterholt et al . deployed a distributed acoustic sensing array along a 15-kilometer-long coastal telecommunications fiber with channels every 5 meters (see the Perspective by Brodsky and Ruiz). The array provided a second-by-second recording of the 2024 moment magnitude 7 earthquake offshore of Mendocino, California. Beam-forming analysis of P-wave arrivals showed that 8 seconds after the earthquake, the rupture slowed when it encountered the Mendocino Triple Junction and then jumped to supershear velocity before moving onshore. —Angela Hessler Fault structure and rupture physics are deeply intertwined, and observations of this coupling are critical for understanding earthquake behavior. Rupture propagation is observable at fine scales using dense seismic networks. Fiber-optic sensing allows for long-term deployments of ultradense arrays that enable high-resolution measurements of infrequent, large earthquakes. We recorded the 2024 moment magnitude ( M w ) 7 Mendocino Fault earthquake with a nearby fiber-optic array and imaged its behavior with seismic beamforming. The rupture propagated to the east at subshear velocity; stagnated near the Mendocino Triple Junction, a zone of structural complexity; and subsequently transitioned to supershear velocity. The correlation between source physics and structure shows how lithospheric heterogeneity affects first-order characteristics of earthquake ruptures. Our results also demonstrate the potential for fiber-optic sensing to improve real-time estimation of key parameters for early warning.},

  abstract     = {In some model organisms, starvation is known to induce epigenetic changes that extend the life span of progeny of the hungry parent. Zhang et al . investigated the mechanism of these effects in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans (see the Perspective by Bohnert). Their studies implicated an enzyme, lysosomal lipase-like 4 (LIPL-4), in the process. From there, the authors pieced together parts of a pathway in which increased activity of LIPL-4 activated signaling in intestinal lysosomes led to increased transcription and production of a variant of histone H3.3. Protein-tagging experiments indicated that the histone could be transferred to the germline, where it was modified by a methyltransferase and transmitted to progeny, thus extending their life span. —L. Bryan Ray The epigenome is sensitive to metabolic inputs and is crucial for aging. Lysosomes act as a signaling hub to sense metabolic cues and regulate longevity. We found that lysosomal metabolic pathways signal through the epigenome to regulate transgenerational longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans . Activation of lysosomal lipid signaling and lysosomal adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) or reduction of lysosomal mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling increased the expression of a histone H3.3 variant and increased its methylation on K79, leading to life-span extension across multiple generations. This transgenerational prolongevity effect required intestine-to-germline transportation of histone H3.3 and a germline-specific H3K79 methyltransferase and was recapitulated by overexpressing H3.3 or the H3K79 methyltransferase. Thus, signals from a lysosome affect the epigenome and link the soma and germ line to mediate transgenerational inheritance of longevity.},

Queuine and other 7-deazapurine nucleobase analogs are commonly incorporated into tRNA and are nucleic acid modifications required for the regulation of cellular gene expression. Wassarman et al . discovered that bacterial antiphage defense enzymes can also attach 7-deazapurines to proteins, generating an N-terminal 7-amido-7-deazaguanine (NDG) modification through a conjugation reaction. Structures of the enzymes involved in this process reveal homology to canonical queuine biosynthetic enzymes and explain how NDG is attached to proteins to control immune activation. —Di Jiang 7-Deazapurines are nucleobase analogs essential for nucleic acid modifications in nearly all cellular life. In this study, we discovered a role for 7-deazapurines in protein modification within type IV cyclic oligonucleotide–based antiviral signaling system (CBASS) antiphage defense and defined functions for CBASS ancillary proteins Cap9 and Cap10 in nucleobase-protein conjugation. A structure of Cap10 revealed a transfer RNA transglycosylase family enzyme remodeled to bind a partner cGAS/DncV–like nucleotidyltransferase that is modified with an N-terminal 7-amido-7-deazaguanine (NDG) nucleobase. A structure of Cap9 explained how this QueC-like enzyme co-opts a 7-deazapurine biosynthetic reaction to install NDG. We show that Cap9, Cap10, and protein deazaguanylation are essential for host defense against phage infection. Our results define a 7-deazapurine protein modification and explain how nucleobase biosynthetic machinery has been repurposed for antiviral immunity.},

  abstract     = {Short-range order (SRO) refers to the tendency of atoms to arrange themselves in a crystal lattice over small distances (typically less than a few nanometers) without forming a fully ordered compound at long ranges. SRO in metals has been linked to properties of mechanical deformation, and in ceramics has been linked to properties related to diffusion. In semiconductors, the concept of SRO has only rarely been studied beyond theoretical predictions linking SRO to important changes in electronic band structure. Using energy-filtered electron microscopy and complementary simulations, Vogl et al . confirmed the presence of SRO in a germanium-silicon-tin semiconductor and identified the actual atomic structure of the SRO motifs. Their work explores an exciting area for understanding and controlling SRO in semiconductors. —Yury Suleymanov Chemical short-range ordering is expected to be a key factor for tuning the electronic structure of semiconductors. However, experimental evidence of short-range ordering is still lacking due to the challenge of characterizing atomic-scale ordering motifs. Here, we determined the presence of short-range order in a ternary GeSiSn semiconductor system using advanced energy-filtered four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy and large-scale atomistic models generated by a machine learning neuroevolution potential of first-principles accuracy. This approach revealed preferred ordering of different atomic species with the dominant occurrence of Si–Ge–Sn triplets. Our findings not only confirmed the presence of short-range order but also directly revealed the actual atomic structure, demonstrating the potential for informed atomic order–based band engineering as a third degree of freedom beyond composition and strain tuning.},

  abstract     = {Many animal species have evolved camouflage or aposematic (warning) coloration, color patterns that protect them from predation. Medina et al . designed a distributed experiment with artificial Lepidopteran prey to assess how characteristics of the ecosystem influenced the effectiveness of these strategies. They found that camouflage was more beneficial when it was rarely used by prey and in low-light environments, whereas warning coloration was less beneficial in high-predation environments, where competition between predators may motivate them to sample aposematic insects. This comparative analysis helps to explain the distribution and evolution of antipredator coloration. —Bianca Lopez Natural selection has repeatedly led to the evolution of two alternative antipredator color strategies—camouflage to avoid detection and aposematism to advertise unprofitability—but we lack understanding of how ecological context favors one strategy over the other. We conducted a globally replicated predation experiment at 21 sites on six continents to test how predator community, prey community, and visual environment influenced the predation risk of 15,018 artificial paper “moth” prey with cryptic or warning coloration. Results indicated that aposematic strategies fare better in environments with low predation intensity, whereas camouflage strategies are advantaged when other camouflaged prey species are rare and when light levels are low. This study demonstrates how multiple mechanisms shape antipredator strategies, helping to explain the evolution and global distribution of camouflaged and aposematic animals.},

This result highlights a route to quantum enhanced learning protocols for machine learning and developing quantum technologies. — Ian S.

Although previous efforts have focused on computational speedups, a definitive and provable quantum advantage that is unattainable by any classical system has remained elusive. In this work, we demonstrate a provable photonic quantum advantage by implementing a quantum-enhanced protocol for learning a high-dimensional physical process. Using imperfect Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen entanglement, we achieve a sample complexity reduction of 11.8 orders of magnitude compared to classical methods without entanglement.

Understanding of the differences among these lineages is largely dependent upon crania that are rare and often damaged and deformed by age. Feng et al . reconstructed the 1-million-year-old Yunxian 2 cranium using an approach that allowed for removal of much of the compression and distortion naturally present in the fossil. In doing so, they found that the cranium contained both primitive and derived traits and concluded that it is representative of the H. longi clade, which is sister to H. sapiens and likely contained the Denisovans. —Sacha Vignieri Diverse forms of Homo coexisted during the Middle Pleistocene. Whether these fossil humans represent different species or clades is debated. The ~1-million-year-old Yunxian 2 fossil from China is important for understanding the cladogenesis of Homo and the origin of Homo sapiens . In this study, we restored and reconstructed the distorted Yunxian 2 cranium using recently introduced technology. The results show that this cranium displays mosaic primitive and derived features. Morphometric and phylogenetic analyses suggest that it is an early member of the Asian H. longi clade, which includes the Denisovans and is the main part of the sister group to the H. sapiens clade. Both the H. sapiens and H. longi clades have deep roots extending beyond the Middle Pleistocene and probably experienced rapid early diversification.

Providing habitats in human-dominated landscapes is essential for maintaining populations and supporting ecosystem functions such as pollination, but habitat protection targets in such landscapes are poorly defined. Bishop et al . developed a framework to assess habitat needs based on the threshold at which populations respond more to increased habitat quality than quantity. They used a meta-analysis to define habitat quantity thresholds, using floral resources as a proxy for habitat quality, for insect pollinators (bumble bees, solitary bees, butterflies, and hoverflies) in agricultural landscapes. Hoverflies had a much lower threshold because of low habitat quality, and this framework could be adapted to guide targets for other taxa. —Bianca Lopez Biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes is declining, but evidence-based conservation targets to guide international policies for such landscapes are lacking. We present a framework for informing habitat conservation policies based on the enhancement of habitat quantity and quality and define thresholds of habitat quantity at which it becomes effective to also prioritize habitat quality. We applied this framework to insect pollinators, an important part of agroecosystem biodiversity, by synthesizing 59 studies from 19 countries. Given low habitat quality, hoverflies had the lowest threshold at 6% semi-natural habitat cover, followed by solitary bees (16%), bumble bees (18%), and butterflies (37%).

Lee et al . examined genome motion across length scales from the size of small genes (five kilobases) to whole chromosomes (75,000 kilobases) with high spatial and temporal resolution using Transposon Assisted Chromatin Kinetic Imaging Technology (TRACK-IT), an improved live-cell imaging method. The authors found that the genomic sequences within the same “kinetic domain” came together rapidly (less than 1 minute on average), whereas sequences in distinct kinetic domains took much longer (minutes to hours). The rapid search with kinetic domains is dependent upon the motor protein cohesin, which can pull together distal points faster than diffusion. —Di Jiang Genome function requires regulated genome motion. However, tools to directly observe this motion in vivo have been limited in coverage and resolution. Here we introduce an approach to tile mammalian chromosomes with self-mapping fluorescent labels and track them at ultraresolution. We find that sequences separated by submegabase distances transition to proximity in tens of seconds. This rapid search is dependent on cohesin and is exhibited only within domains. Domain borders act as kinetic impediments to this search process, rather than structural boundaries. The genomic separation–dependent scaling of the search time for cis interactions violated predictions of diffusion, suggesting motor-driven folding. We also uncover cohesin-dependent processive motion at 2.7 kilobases per second. Together, these multiscale dynamics reveal the organization of the genome into kinetically associated domains.},

O’Dwyer et al . used data collected from the Wind River Forest Dynamics Plot to test whether genetic information could improve population fluctuation predictions beyond ecological data alone. Indeed, using genetic data collected only once to calculate effective population size helped to improve their models over multiple species. Although genetic data can be expensive to collect, the fact that doing so only once improved predictions across several years demonstrates a potential benefit for such efforts in the future. —Corinne Simonti Species population sizes fluctuate over time, and these temporal dynamics play a key role in governing the maintenance of biodiversity. Although modeling approaches have been developed to characterize fluctuations in species abundances, the data required to parameterize these models from scratch are substantial. Here we introduce a new approach to modeling population fluctuations on decadal timescales by relating community-level dynamics to population-level patterns encoded in plant genomes. Using genomic samples taken at a single time point to generate contemporary effective population size estimates in a temperate montane forest, we accurately predict fluctuations across three censuses. Our approach facilitates the use of genomic demography to parameterize multispecies community models in ecology and shows that population genomic data can provide accurate predictions for ecological dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Mosquitoes serve as vectors for diseases such as dengue and malaria; however, mosquito species are unequally represented in genetics studies. Two groups collected and analyzed extensive genomic data from mosquito disease vector species (see the Perspective by Carter). Crawford et al . sequenced 1206 individuals of the dengue and Zika vector Aedes aegypti and found that highly invasive populations split from earlier lineages during the Atlantic slave trade. They identified genomic regions potentially underlying human-specializing behavioral adaptations. Boddé et al . examined 656 modern Anopheles funestus individuals, as well as 45 museum specimens. They found multiple instances of insecticide-resistance variants in this malaria vector, although most of these weren’t shared with museum specimens collected as recently as 1967, suggesting rapid emergence. Such results will help to inform gene drive and insecticide efforts, as well as public health initiatives. —Corinne Simonti Anopheles funestus s.s. is a major human malaria vector across Africa. To study its evolution, especially under vector control pressure, we sequenced 656 modern specimens (collected 2014 to 2018) and 45 historic specimens (collected 1927 to 1967) from 16 African countries. Despite high genetic diversity, the species shows stable but considerable continental population structure. Although one population showed little differentiation over a century and 4000 kilometers, nearby, we found two genetically distinct ecotypes. Vector control has resulted in strong signals of selection, with some resistance alleles shared across populations through gene flow and others arising independently. Fortunately, we found that a promising gene drive target in Anopheles gambiae is highly conserved in An. funestus . These insights will enable more strategic insecticide usage and gene drive deployment, supporting malaria elimination.},

  abstract     = {Genes are often controlled by enhancers located far away in the genome, but how their positioning affects gene activation is unclear. Eder et al . investigated how the position of the Sox2 gene influences activation by its enhancer. By systematically relocating reporter genes around the Sox2 locus, the authors found that Sox2 sits in an optimal “sweet spot” for activation and also restricts its enhancer’s reach. Removing Sox2 broadened and boosted enhancer-driven activation. This means that genes can act as gatekeepers, limiting their enhancers’ influence. Understanding these rules helps to explain gene regulation and may inform future genetic engineering or gene therapy strategies. —Di Jiang Genes are often activated by enhancers located at large genomic distances, and the importance of this positioning is poorly understood. By relocating promoter-reporter constructs into thousands of alternative positions within a single locus, we dissected the positional relationship between the mouse Sox2 gene and its distal enhancer. This revealed an intricate, sharply confined activation landscape in which the native Sox2 gene occupies an optimal position for its activation. Deletion of the gene relaxes this confinement and broadly increases reporter activity. The confining effect of the Sox2 gene is partially conferred by its ~1-kilobase coding region. Our local relocation approach provides high-resolution functional maps of a genomic locus and reveals that a gene can strongly constrain the realm of influence of its enhancer.},

Two groups collected and analyzed extensive genomic data from mosquito disease vector species (see the Perspective by Carter). Crawford et al . sequenced 1206 individuals of the dengue and Zika vector Aedes aegypti and found that highly invasive populations split from earlier lineages during the Atlantic slave trade. They identified genomic regions potentially underlying human-specializing behavioral adaptations. Boddé et al . examined 656 modern Anopheles funestus individuals, as well as 45 museum specimens. They found multiple instances of insecticide-resistance variants in this malaria vector, although most of these weren’t shared with museum specimens collected as recently as 1967, suggesting rapid emergence. Such results will help to inform gene drive and insecticide efforts, as well as public health initiatives. —Corinne Simonti The emergence and global expansion of Aedes aegypti puts more than half of all humans at risk of arbovirus infection, but the origin of this mosquito and the impact of contemporary gene flow on arbovirus control are unclear. We sequenced 1206 genomes from 73 globally distributed locations. After evolving a preference for humans in Sahelian West Africa, the invasive subspecies Ae. aegypti aegypti ( Aaa ) emerged in the Americas after the Atlantic slave trade era and expanded globally. Recent back-to-Africa Aaa migration introduced insecticide resistance and anthropophily into regions with recent dengue outbreaks, raising concern that Aaa movement could increase arbovirus risk in urban Africa. These data underscore developing complexity in the fight against dengue, Zika, and chikungunya and provide a platform to further study this important mosquito vector.},

In a Review, Li et al . contrasted the electrochemical behavior of both types of metals when coupled with nonaqueous electrolytes. A key goal was to highlight where knowledge from one group has relevance to the other and where specific problems may arise with only one group or one specific metal, with the aim of guiding the development of next-generation batteries. —Marc S. Lavine Monovalent (lithium, sodium, potassium) and multivalent (magnesium, calcium, aluminum) metal anodes are promising alternatives to graphite anodes for overcoming the performance limitations of lithium-ion batteries. In this Review, we compare and contrast their electrochemical behaviors in nonaqueous electrolytes by discussing their common challenges of irregular metal deposition and unstable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs), as well as their differences, which are due to dissimilar surface energies and cation charge densities. General design strategies for electrode, electrolyte, and interphase are proposed to enable horizontally deposited metals with preferred crystallographic orientations and stable SEIs with distinct chemical compositions yet similar structural homogeneity. Finally, we assess the specific advantages and unresolved challenges of each system, providing cross-disciplinary insights to advance high-energy and low-cost metal-anode batteries for next-generation energy storage.},

  abstract     = {When faults rupture, the sudden release of energy alters the properties of the surrounding crust, affecting its response to future stress. Seismic monitoring of these changes has been limited to shallow depths, leaving an incomplete picture of the response-recovery cycles of fault zones. To look deeper into this, Bryan et al . applied optimal transport to receiver functions at broadband seismic stations for several years before and after the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes in California (see the Perspective by Rodriguez Padilla). After the events, seismic waves slowed throughout the crustal column, a sign of both shallow and deep damage. Recovery at shallow depths occurred within months, whereas deep damage persisted for at least several years after rupture. —Angela Hessler Earthquakes abruptly release tectonic stress that builds slowly over time through the coupled evolution of faults and the surrounding crust. Seismic wavespeeds track crustal deformation and stress changes, but typical monitoring methods are most sensitive to shallow depths. Using receiver functions, we tracked rupture-zone wavespeed and anisotropy changes throughout the crust during the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence. Shallow coseismic wavespeed reductions recovered within months, whereas a deeper postseismic wavespeed drop persisted without measurable recovery over several years. The deep, persistent wavespeed drop likely reflects accumulating damage driven by postseismic deformation, suggesting two possible scenarios: (i) a slow interseismic recovery where wavespeed and anisotropy track long-term stress evolution; or (ii) permanent deformation of an immature fault zone. Both scenarios affect the dynamics and energy budget of the seismic cycle.},

This group has primarily practiced nomadic pastoralism in an extremely arid environment for the past 5000 to 8000 years, with as much as 80% of their traditional diet being composed of animal products. The authors identified several regions of the genome that appear to be under recent selection, including one near the gene STC1 , which is involved in the kidneys’ response to dehydration. The authors also shared the results with these groups, which may help them be more aware of possible medical complications as some individuals move to urban centers. —Corinne Simonti The Turkana pastoralists of Kenya inhabit arid, water-limited environments and rely largely on livestock for subsistence. Working with Turkana communities, we sequenced 367 whole genomes and identified eight regions with evidence for recent positive selection. One of these regions includes a putative regulatory element for STC1 —a kidney-expressed gene involved in metabolism and the response to dehydration. We show that STC1 is induced by antidiuretic hormone in human cells, is associated with urea levels in the Turkana themselves, and is under strong and recent selection in this population as well as a second East African population, the Daasanach.

Despite decades of innovation in C–H activation chemistry, methods for Z -selective functionalization of alkenes have eluded synthetic practitioners. Terminal alkenes present the biggest challenge for Z -selectivity as they require selective cleavage of the more hindered of two otherwise virtually identical C–H bonds. Herein, we describe the transformation of alkenes into transient 1,2- bis -sulfonium intermediates found to undergo Z -selective elimination, overturning a textbook E2 stereoselectivity rule through stabilizing interactions. We identify paired electrolysis as an enabling strategy to both selectively generate the requisite bis -sulfonium intermediate and drive its rapid elimination in situ.

Stemp et al . now demonstrate direct entanglement between two nuclear spins that are separated by a relatively long distance. Two phosphorus atoms implanted in silicon formed a system comprising two 31 P nuclei and two bound electrons. Control of the exchange interaction between the two electrons resulted in quantum entanglement of the two nuclear spins. The results and scalability of the method are promising for the development of nuclear spin–based quantum computers. —Ian S.

Current demonstrations of nuclear entanglement in semiconductors rely on coupling the nuclei to a common electron, which is not a scalable strategy. In this work, we demonstrated a two-qubit controlled-Z logic operation between the nuclei of two phosphorus atoms in a silicon device, separated by up to 20 nanometers. Each atom binds separate electrons, whose exchange interaction mediates the nuclear two-qubit gate. We prepared and measured a nuclear Bell state with a fidelity of 76 − 5 + 5 % and a concurrence of 0.67 − 0.05 + 0.05 .

  abstract     = {Rangelands provide livelihoods for billions of people but are being increasingly degraded. Overgrazing is often cited as a cause of this degradation, but the relative effects of grazing and climate change are poorly understood. Purevjav et al . designed a quasiexperimental study to disentangle the effects of climate and herd size on rangeland primary productivity in Mongolia, where livelihoods depend on rangelands and more than half of these rangelands are considered degraded. Although herd size had a negative effect on productivity, weather effects were much larger, particularly at decadal scales over which herders can adapt to changing conditions. These results suggest that policies limiting herd sizes may affect people without preventing rangeland degradation and support the need to curb climate change to protect ecosystems and livelihoods. —Bianca Lopez Rangelands are Earth’s dominant land type, supporting the livelihoods of more than 2 billion people. Concerns about rangeland degradation typically focus on overgrazing. But climate change may be a greater culprit. Using spatially disaggregated, nationwide data from Mongolia, from 1984 to 2024, we exploited seasonal variation in grazing locations to quasi-experimentally estimate the causal effects of livestock herd size, weather, and climate change on rangeland primary productivity. At interannual frequency, herd size modestly but significantly negatively affects primary productivity, with notable variation across ecological zones. The effects of weather fluctuations are, however, an order of magnitude larger. At the decadal scale, over which herders can adapt to climate change, herd size effects disappear, and temperature effects dominate. In Mongolia, climate change seems to drive most long-term change in rangeland primary productivity.},

This is partly driven by increases in extreme daily values of convective buoyancy, provided that both the undilute instability of near-surface air and the dilution by mixing with drier air above are considered. El Niño could plausibly drive similar changes in other tropical regions, and our framework could be further applied to changes in hourly extremes, to other internal variability modes, and to forced trends under climate change.},

  abstract     = {Human activities are putting increased pressure on marine ecosystems. Halpern et al . mapped the intensity of 10 different types of human-caused pressure, including the effects of climate change, fishing, and pollution, across the global oceans. Overlapping these data with the distribution of marine habitats and their vulnerabilities to stressors provides estimates of total impacts on ecosystems. Cumulative impacts are expected to double by midcentury, including in countries and coastal areas where people depend heavily on marine resources. Ocean warming and fisheries are two of the largest impacts, suggesting that curbing climate change and sustainable fisheries management could relieve stress on marine ecosystems. —Bianca Lopez Pressures from human activities are expected to increase substantially, affecting marine ecosystems globally. To plan for a sustainable future, we need to forecast the distributions of cumulative effects from multiple pressures. Here, we mapped (at 10-kilometer resolution) the future cumulative impacts of 10 climate, land-based, fishing, and other pressures on 20 marine habitats under two climate scenarios at mid-century (around 2050). We found that cumulative impacts are projected to increase 2.2 to 2.6 times globally, with coastal habitats facing higher impacts but offshore regions facing faster increases, especially in equatorial regions. Furthermore, many countries dependent on marine resources will have large increases in impacts. Incorporating these results into strategic policy and management will support more sustainable use and protection of marine ecosystems and the services they provide.},

We can’t directly ask those species, however, whether our categorization of their sounds matches their own interpretations of the meanings associated with them. Elie et al . conducted auditory discrimination tasks with zebra finches and found that the birds both discriminated and categorized the presumed meanings of their calls. Thus, the birds both understand the categories of their calls and create mental representations of their meaning, similar to what humans do. —Sacha Vignieri Vocal communication in social animals involves the production and perception of various calls that ethologists categorize into call types based on their acoustical structure and behavioral context. Whether these categories indicate distinct meanings for the animals remains unknown. The zebra finch, a gregarious songbird, uses ~11 call types that are known to communicate hunger, danger, or social conflict and to establish social contact and bonding. Using auditory discrimination tasks, we show that the birds both discriminate and categorize all the call types in their vocal repertoire. In addition, systematic errors were more frequent between call types used in similar behavioral contexts than could be expected from their acoustic similarity. Thus, zebra finches organize their calls into categories and create a mental representation of the meaning of these sounds.},

  abstract     = {The hippocampus is one of the most studied brain areas because of its major role in fundamental brain functions including learning, memory, and spatial navigation. In a Review, Farrell and Soltesz focused on the role of overlooked areas and circuits within the hippocampus, the CA2 region, the indusium griseum, and the fasciola cinereum. They summarized recent findings on these neglected hippocampal regions and related circuits and provided original insights into brain functions relevant to behavior and neurological disorders. These findings extend the role of the hippocampus beyond the classic view. —Mattia Maroso Traditional views of hippocampal function are largely based on the canonical flow of information from the entorhinal cortex through the trisynaptic loop—comprising the dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis regions CA3 and CA1—and back to cortex, where the hippocampus plays an important role in transforming relevant information into a usable storage system. This classic circuit has inspired current thinking on hippocampal functions related to learning, memory, and spatial navigation, but the potential functional contributions of other hippocampal areas, such as CA2, the fasciola cinereum, and the indusium griseum, and their integration of a major hypothalamic input, have been overlooked. These understudied circuits and nontraditional network dynamics such as dentate spikes have recently begun to yield fresh insights into unconventional circuit computations that extend the repertoire of hippocampal function beyond current models.},

High levels of chlorophyll c and fucoxanthin allow fast kinetics and the absorption of blue-green and green light, suitable for an ocean-dwelling coccolithophore. —Madeleine Seale Photosystem I (PSI) is a pigment-protein complex, which converts light energy into chemical energy in photosynthesis. Among photosynthetic organisms, PSI-LHC (light-harvesting complex) structures exhibit substantial differences in their sizes, reflecting adaptation to different light environments. Here we report the structure of a PSI-fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c binding protein (FCPI) supercomplex from the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi (Eh) at 2.79-angstrom resolution by cryo–electron microscopy, which showed a huge Eh-PSI-FCPI supercomplex containing 38 peripheral Eh-FCPI antennae and a linker protein (EhLP) in addition to the PSI core. A network of 819 pigments was found in Eh-PSI-FCPI, which functions to capture and transfer light energy with 95% quantum efficiency. This elucidates how its modular Eh-FCPI arrangement contributes to the expansion of PSI cross section and efficient light harvesting.},

  abstract     = {Transcription factors (TFs) are traditionally categorized as activators or repressors, but this binary distinction oversimplifies their functional roles. In practice, many TFs activate some genes while repressing others, depending on the regulatory context. Parisutham et al . investigated how TF function relates to the basal activity of their target promoters and found a conserved pattern across multiple TFs. Rather than uniformly amplifying or silencing gene expression, TFs often buffer against perturbations, opposing changes in expression levels. This buffering behavior appears to be a general feature of TF regulation, highlighting its central role in maintaining homeostasis of gene expression. —Di Jiang Transcription factors (TFs) may activate or repress gene expression through an interplay of different mechanisms, including RNA polymerase (RNAP) recruitment, exclusion, and initiation. However, depending on the regulated promoter identity, TF function can vary, and the principles underlying this context dependence remain unclear. We demonstrate an inverse scaling relationship between the promoter’s basal activity and its regulation by a given TF. Specifically, activation is weaker and repression is stronger on stronger promoters. This scaling applies to both activators and repressors, which suggests a common underlying mechanism where TFs regulate expression by stabilizing RNAP binding at the promoter. The consequence of this relationship is that TFs buffer expression by affecting constant regulated expression levels across promoters of different basal activity, ensuring homeostatic control despite genetic or environmental changes.},

Siegenthaler et al . used functional ultrasound imaging to screen for mouse brain areas strongly activated by visual objects. At the brain network level, the spatial navigation system, not the ventral visual stream as in primates, exhibited a robust preference for visual objects. At the brain region level, one of the top hits of the ultrasound screen was the postsubiculum, an area with many head direction cells. In recordings from postsubiculum cells in freely moving mice, visual objects boosted the firing rate of head direction cells, with preferred firing directions pointing toward the object, and decreased the firing of cells that encoded other head directions. —Peter Stern Animals use visual objects to guide navigation-related behaviors. However, visual object–preferring areas have yet to be described in the mouse brain, limiting our understanding of how visual objects affect spatial navigation system processing. Using functional ultrasound imaging, we identified brain areas that were preferentially activated by images of objects compared with their scrambled versions. Whereas visual cortex did not show a preference, areas associated with spatial navigation were preferentially activated by visual objects. Electrophysiological recordings in postsubiculum, the cortical head direction (HD) system hub, confirmed a preference for visual objects in both HD cells and fast-spiking interneurons. In freely moving animals, visual objects increased firing rates of HD cells aligned with a visual object but decreased activity in HD cells coding for other directions.},

However, this productivity is limited by the relative inefficiency of the primary carbon fixation enzyme Rubisco. Lu et al . introduced an additional metabolic pathway, the malyl-CoA glycerate (McG) cycle, into Arabidopsis thaliana . These plants convert a secondary product of Rubisco activity into acetyl coenzyme A, which can then feed into endogenous lipid synthesis pathways. Plants with the McG cycle had increased lipids, seed yield, and overall biomass. This work provides a proof of concept for enhancing carbon fixation and plant growth without the need to directly alter Rubisco performance. —Madeleine Seale Carbon fixation through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle accounts for the majority of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) uptake from the atmosphere. The CBB cycle generates C3 carbohydrates but is inefficient at producing acetyl–coenzyme A (CoA) (C2), which is the universal precursor for synthesizing lipids. In this work, we introduced in Arabidopsis thaliana a new-to-nature CO 2 fixing cycle, malyl-CoA-glycerate (McG) cycle, which together with the CBB cycle forms a dual-cycle CO 2 fixation system. This cycle can fix one additional carbon by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and convert the photorespiration product, glycolate, to acetyl-CoA. Plants with the McG cycle show enhanced protein abundance in their photosystems and enhanced photosystem II efficiency. McG plants had doubled CO 2 fixation rates under atmospheric CO 2 , increased lipid production, pronounced growth enhancement, and tripled the seed yield.},

Zelmanoff et al . investigated the role of oxytocin in modulating social behavior in mouse pups during separation and reunion with their mothers (see the Perspective by Bellone). Pups separated from their mothers produced more ultrasonic vocalizations upon reunion, and the effect was modulated by the activity of oxytocin-expressing neurons. Pharmacological and optogenetic inhibition of these neurons attenuated ultrasonic vocalizations, suggesting that oxytocin plays a major role in determining social behavior during development. —Mattia Maroso Oxytocin is essential in shaping social behavior across the lifespan. Although the role of oxytocin signaling in parental care has been widely investigated, little is known about its function in social behavior during early life. We studied the role of oxytocin in mouse pup social behavior during acute separation from the mother as well as upon reunion. The activity of oxytocin neurons was increased by acute maternal separation. Behaviorally, maternally separated pups emitted more ultrasonic vocalizations upon reunion, which were further modulated by nipple attachment behavior. These effects were attenuated by blocking the oxytocin receptor during maternal separation. Optogenetic silencing of oxytocin neurons during maternal separation disrupted vocal behavior during separation and reunion. Our findings reveal an important role of oxytocin in context-dependent vocal communication in mouse pups.},

  abstract     = {Land conversion not only reduces the total habitat available to other species, but it also fragments habitat into smaller and less-connected patches, thus supporting smaller and less-connected populations. Ecologists have developed various metrics capturing different aspects of habitat fragmentation, such as the number and size of habitat patches and their distribution across space. Zou et al . used remotely sensed data to quantify the degree of fragmentation of global forests from 2000 to 2020, comparing metrics focused on patch connectivity, aggregation, and structure. Measures incorporating habitat connectivity and aggregation suggested that more than half of global forests have become more fragmented over the past two decades. These changes suggest widespread forest degradation beyond the direct effects of habitat loss. —Bianca Lopez Habitat fragmentation, in which contiguous forests are broken into smaller, isolated patches, threatens biodiversity by disrupting species movement, shrinking populations, and altering ecosystem dynamics. Past assessments suggested declining global fragmentation, but they relied on structure-based metrics that overlook ecological connectivity. We analyzed global forest fragmentation from 2000 to 2020 using complementary metrics that captured patch connectivity, aggregation, and structure. Connectivity-based metrics revealed that 51 to 67% of forests globally—and 58 to 80% of tropical forests—became more fragmented, which is nearly twice the rate suggested by traditional structure-focused methods (30 to 35%). Aggregation-focused metrics confirmed increases in 57 to 83% of forests. Human activities such as agriculture and logging drive this change. Yet protected tropical areas saw up to an 82% reduction in fragmentation, underscoring the potential of targeted conservation.},

Although hybridization has been historically documented more often in plants, the relative rates of introgression in animals and plants have been difficult to quantify. Monnet et al . examined the relationship of introgression with genetic divergence in 61 animal and 280 plant pairs (see the Perspective by Brandvain). They found that the likelihood of plants hybridizing dropped off after genetic divergence levels of 0.3% in plants (consistent across different plant types) compared with 1.8% in animals. These results suggest that barriers to hybridization may arise more quickly in plants, contrary to historical views. —Corinne Simonti Speciation, the process by which new reproductively isolated species emerge from ancestral populations, results from the gradual accumulation of barriers to gene flow within genomes. To date, the notion that interspecific genetic exchange (introgression) occurs more frequently between plant species than animals has gained a strong footing in scientific discourse. By examining the dynamics of gene flow across a continuum of divergence in both kingdoms, we observed the opposite relationship: Plants experience less introgression than animals at the same level of genetic divergence, suggesting that species barriers are established more rapidly in plants. This pattern raises questions about which differences in microevolutionary processes between plants and animals influence the dynamics of reproductive isolation establishment at the macroevolutionary scale.},

Protonation of neutral 4-aminobenzoic acid (4ABA) occurs at the acid ( O -protomer) and amine ( N -protomer) functionalities, yielding two distinct species with relative energies dependent on the degree of hydration. Here, we measured the rates of intramolecular proton transfer in 4ABAH + ·(H 2 O) 6 ions upon protomer-selective vibrational excitation of initially cold (6 K) cluster ions isolated in a cryogenic ion trap. Interconversion rates were observed on the microsecond time scale.

Instead, Ma et al . showed that extreme wildfires in the west actually reduce fine particle concentrations in the eastern US by an amount comparable to the increases that they cause in the west (see the Perspective by Qian). They attributed this unexpected effect to weakened eastward transport of fire smoke and enhanced wet removal of air pollutants caused by heat-induced convection from fires. This mechanism actually reduces deaths and economic losses nationwide. —Jesse Smith Conventional wisdom suggests that wildfires in the western United States (WUS) degrade air quality nationwide as a result of aerosol emissions and eastward transport. However, we found that heat produced by wildfires, a commonly neglected effect, can reduce fine particle concentrations (PM 2.5 ) in the eastern United States (EUS) by an amount comparable to the increases in the WUS during the fire season. This phenomenon arises from fire heat–induced convection in the WUS and subsequent downstream meteorological changes distant from fires. Enhanced wet deposition and weakened eastward transport of fire aerosols lower PM 2.5 levels in the EUS. Therefore, neglecting the effect of fire heat on PM 2.5 pollution leads to an overestimate of 1200 additional premature deaths and 3.3 billion USD in economic losses, particularly in the densely populated EUS.},

More recent arrivals to the islands display more resistance, likely due to their more generalist requirements. —Sacha Vignieri Insect populations have declined worldwide, but the extent and drivers of these declines are debated.

We found that 79% of endemic species are in decline, starting after the arrival of humans approximately 3000 years ago and accelerating in the past 300 years, whereas recent arrivals are expanding.

However, conformally wrapping these film devices onto three-dimensional surfaces often leads to stress-induced damage. We propose a “drop-printing” strategy that enables damage-free film transfer using a droplet. The droplet acts as a lubricating layer between the film and the target surface, facilitating local sliding during shape-adaptive deformation. This mechanism prevents in-plane film stretching and reduces stress concentration. Even nonstretchable and fragile films can be intactly and accurately wrapped onto delicate surfaces, such as microscale microorganisms and optical fibers. Two-micrometer-thick silicon films, without any stretchable engineering, can form conformal neural-electronic interfaces by being drop-printed on nerves and brain tissue.

Mutations in LZTR1 are also associated with human diseases. Dharmaiah et al . used crystal structures to define the interaction of LZTR1-binding domains with various RAS proteins. Their results help to explain the effects of disease-causing mutations in LZTR1 and also provide clues for strategies to develop glue-like therapeutic molecules that could target oncogenic RAS proteins to LZTR1-dependent degradation. —L. Bryan Ray The RAS family of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) are tightly regulated signaling molecules that are further modulated by ubiquitination and proteolysis. Leucine Zipper-like Transcription Regulator 1 (LZTR1), a substrate adapter of the Cullin-3 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase, binds specific RAS GTPases and promotes their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We present structures of LZTR1 Kelch domains bound to RIT1, MRAS, and KRAS, revealing interfaces that govern RAS isoform selectivity and nucleotide specificity. Biochemical and structural analyses of disease-associated Kelch domain mutations revealed three types of alterations: impaired substrate interaction, loop destabilization, and blade-blade repulsion. In cellular and mouse models, mutations disrupting substrate binding phenocopied LZTR1 loss, underscoring its substrate specificity. These findings define RAS recognition mechanisms by LZTR1 and suggest a molecular glue strategy to degrade oncogenic KRAS.},

The right to adequate food is globally recognized, but access to safe food is not explicitly guaranteed (5, 6).

By identifying key features of the protein required for binding and altering critical amino acids, the authors engineered receptor proteins with an expanded repertoire of cold shock proteins. The research demonstrates a pipeline for the discovery and optimization of immune recognition mechanisms by using information from diverse species and systems. —Madeleine Seale Plants deploy a diverse array of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which perceive microbe-associated molecular patterns to activate immune responses. Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase subgroup XII (LRR-RLK-XII) represents one of the largest PRR families owing to lineage-specific diversification. Through bioinformatics and synthetic biology approaches, we characterized LRR-RLK-XIIs from 285 plant species and identified a receptor, “SCORE,” that perceives cold shock protein (CSP) peptides. SCORE orthologs from multiple angiosperm lineages exhibit CSP recognition polymorphisms, indicating recurrent selection for pathogen recognition through substitutions at key amino acid residues. Through functional phylogenomics and protein structure predictions, we engineered SCORE variants capable of detecting multiple phytopathogen CSP peptides, thus revealing the diverse PRR recognition landscape in plants.

  abstract     = {Neurogenetics has identified many distinct types of inhibitory interneurons. However, how this interneuron diversity contributes to network functions remains elusive. Valero et al . identified the distinct properties of optogenetically identified pyramidal cells and members of the major interneuron families (see the Perspective by Craig and González-Rueda). These properties include their firing rate statistics in different brain states and their contributions to various population activities. Using the electrophysiological fingerprints of this dataset, the researchers trained a machine learning algorithm to infer the different neuronal types in large-scale recordings and then constructed a connectivity graph of these major cell types through targeted optogenetic stimulations and functional connectivity analysis. These findings highlight the crucial role of cooperative interactions between interneuron types in the hippocampal network and demonstrate that such interaction is fundamental for the hippocampal cognitive map. —Peter Stern Identifying the computational roles of different neuron families is crucial for understanding neural networks. Most neural diversity is embodied in various types of γ-aminobutyric acid–mediated (GABAergic) interneurons, grouped into four major families. We collected datasets of opto-tagged neurons from all four families, along with excitatory neurons, from both the neocortex and hippocampus. The physiological features of these neurons were used to train a machine learning classifier, which subsequently inferred specific interneuron families in large-scale recordings. This combined approach enabled the reconstruction of synaptic connectivity motifs across interneuron family members. We further showed that these motifs differentially control the place field features of pyramidal neurons. Our findings attribute a prominent role to interneurons in the formation of a flexible cognitive map.},

Zhang et al . investigated the relationship between PM 2.5 , an index of particle pollution, and the development of Lewy body dementia (LBD), the second most common form of dementia. Epidemiological data showed that PM 2.5 exposure was associated with an increased risk of developing LBD. In mice, nasal administration of PM 2.5 led to brain atrophy due to the accumulation of pathological α-synuclein, loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and impaired cognition and motor function. The results identify a potential mechanistic link between air pollution and the development of dementia. —Mattia Maroso Evidence links air pollution to dementia, yet its role in Lewy body dementia (LBD) remains unclear. In this work, we showed in a cohort of 56.5 million individuals across the United States that fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) exposure raises LBD risk. Mechanistically, we found that PM 2.5 exposure led to brain atrophy in wild-type mice, an effect not seen in α-synuclein (αSyn)–deficient mice. PM 2.5 exposure generated a highly pathogenic αSyn strain, PM 2.5 –induced preformed fibril (PM-PFF), with enhanced proteinase K resistance and neurotoxicity, resembling αSyn LBD strains. PM 2.5 samples from China, the United States, and Europe consistently induced proteinase-resistant αSyn strains and in vivo pathology. Transcriptomic analyses revealed shared responses between PM 2.5 -exposed mice and LBD patients, underscoring PM 2.5 ’s role in LBD and stressing the need for interventions to reduce air pollution and its associated neurological disease burden.},

  abstract     = {The gut maintains its health by constantly renewing its inner lining, balancing cell production with the removal of cells through a process called extrusion. Krueger et al . found that extrusion is regulated by mechanical forces between cells. Cells are interconnected in a network that enables them to pull on their neighbors, creating a physical competition in a cellular tug-of-war. This way, cells test their mechanical strength relative to one another, and those that find themselves weaker extrude from the tissue while stronger cells remain. By removing unfit cells, this process safeguards the intestinal barrier and promotes homeostasis. —Stella M. Hurtley Cell extrusion is essential for homeostatic self-renewal of the intestinal epithelium. Extrusion is thought to be triggered by crowding-induced compression of cells at the intestinal villus tip. In this study, we found instead that a local “tug-of-war” competition between contractile cells regulated extrusion in the intestinal epithelium. We combined quantitative live microscopy, optogenetic induction of tissue tension, genetic perturbation of myosin II activity, and local disruption of the basal cortex in mouse intestines and intestinal organoids. These approaches revealed that a dynamic actomyosin network generates tension throughout the intestinal villi, including the villus tip region. Mechanically weak cells unable to maintain this tension underwent extrusion. Thus, epithelial barrier integrity depends on intercellular mechanics.},

Although 16 S ribosomal RNA sequencing and shotgun metagenomics have brought tremendous insights into the composition of communities, glimpses of their functional attributes are only just being achieved. In a Review, Pountain and Yanai discuss how the recent application of single-cell RNA sequencing technology has helped to evaluate function in microbial populations. —Caroline Ash Revealing insights into the function of microbial communities requires moving beyond measuring bulk taxonomic composition to detecting interactions between subpopulations. Following the transformative impact of single-cell gene expression profiling techniques on numerous fields of human biology, recent years have seen increased application to microbes. We review progress in the development of these techniques and discuss challenges in applying them to microbial communities. We highlight applications for dissecting the microbiome in human health and disease that reveal functional heterogeneity within gut communities, antibiotic responses, and the dynamics of mobile genetic elements. As single-cell gene expression technologies continue to develop, they are becoming ever more essential for examining and modulating the role of microbial communities in clinical and wider environments.},

Wyatt et al . synthesized 40 MAX materials (where M is a transition metal, A is a group 13 or 14 element, and X is either C or N) using 2 to 9 M elements. They were able to quantify the impact of entropy versus enthalpy on the resulting structure and properties. Enthalpy-driven short-range order persisted until configurational entropy became sufficiently large to randomize metal configurations. Compositional disorder in the precursor phases directly influenced the surface terminations (–O, –OH, and –F) and electronic properties when converted to MXenes. —Marc S. Lavine In compositionally complex materials, there is controversy on the effect of enthalpy versus entropy on the structure and short-range ordering in so-called high-entropy materials. To help address this controversy, we synthesized and probed 40 M 4 AlC 3 layered carbide phases containing two to nine metals and found that short-range ordering from enthalpy was present until the entropy increased enough to achieve complete disordering of the transition metals in their atomic planes. We transformed all of these layered carbide phases into two-dimensional (2D) sheets and showed the effects of the order versus disorder on their surface properties and electronic behavior. This study suggests the key effect that the competition between enthalpy and entropy has on short-range order in multicompositional materials.},

One less-explored component of this limb is the presence of either nails, as in primates, or claws, as in predators and diggers. Missagia et al . looked at different types of rodents, which vary with regard to this feature, some bearing a claw on their “thumb” and others a nail. The researchers concluded that the ancestral condition was the presence of a nail, which facilitated rodents’ well-known dexterous handling of food. Only species that evolved to dig or lost this handling acquired a claw. —Sacha Vignieri The unguis (hoof, claw, or nail) of the first digit (D1, also known as the thumb or pollex) of the tetrapod hand exhibits numerous functional adaptations, but its macroevolutionary association with ecological diversity is unknown. Across Rodentia, we find that most extant genera and ancestral lineages bear D1 nails. Exceptions follow structure-function associations that arose independently multiple times, specifically, the gain of D1 claws with subterranean habits and the loss of D1 ungues with oral-only feeding behavior. We hypothesize that early acquisition of D1 nails and manually dexterous food handling was crucial for rodents to adaptively leverage cranial specializations for efficient gnawing and thereby exploit hard seeds and nuts, a niche that they dominated after the extinction of multituberculates. Our study recasts ideas about rodent evolution and uncovers a previously unrecognized contributor to their successful radiation.},

  abstract     = {Despite decades of research advances and improved clinical outcomes, cardiovascular disease is still the most common cause of death worldwide. A major cause of mortality after myocardial infarction are arrhythmias resulting from injury to the cardiac muscle. During an ischemic event such as myocardial infarction, neutrophils are recruited to the heart, and Kumowski et al . have uncovered a direct link between these neutrophils and subsequent arrhythmias (see the Perspective by Thorp). Using mouse models supported by human data, the authors determined that resistin-like molecule gamma (RELMγ) is highly expressed in neutrophils after myocardial infarction. In the heart, RELMγ damages the cell membrane of cardiomyocytes, promoting cell death directly and also causing ion leaks that disrupt the heart’s electrical activity and result in arrhythmias. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Ventricular tachycardia disrupts the heart’s coordinated pump function, leading to sudden cardiac death. Neutrophils, which are recruited in high numbers to the ischemic myocardium, promote these arrhythmias. Comparing neutrophils with macrophages, we found that resistin-like molecule γ ( Retnlg or RELMγ) was the most differentially expressed gene in mouse infarcts. RELMγ is part of a pore-forming protein family that defends the host against bacteria by perforating their membranes. In mice with acute infarcts, leukocyte-specific Retnlg deletion reduced ventricular tachycardia. RELMγ elicited membrane defects that allowed cell exclusion dyes to enter the cardiomyocyte interior and also caused delayed afterdepolarizations and later cardiomyocyte death, both of which are strong arrhythmogenic triggers. Human resistin likewise attacked membranes of liposomes and mammalian cells. We describe how misdirected innate immune defense produces membrane leaks and ventricular arrhythmia.},

Jin et al . now report a two-step procedure using near-ultraviolet light that first reduces the carbon dioxide to ethane and then uses a previously reported photocatalyst to oxidize the ethane to ethylene (see the Perspective by Cortés). The first step relies on a gold-titania catalyst that appears to activate hydrogen heterolytically upon photoirradiation, leading to highly selective reductive coupling of carbon dioxide. —Jake S. Yeston Producing olefins by carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) hydrogenation is a long-standing goal. The usual products are multicarbon mixtures because the critical step of heterolytic hydrogen (H 2 ) dissociation at high temperatures complicates selectivity control. In this study, we report that irradiating gold–titanium dioxide at 365 nanometers induces heterolytic H 2 dissociation at ambient temperature. This process likely relies on interfacial electric dipoles from photogenerated electrons and holes situated on the metallic gold nanoparticles and interfacial gold–oxygen–titanium scaffolds. The heterolytic H 2 dissociation is further promoted by light-induced coating of gold nanoparticles with a titanium oxide layer. The resulting nucleophilic hydrogen species reduce CO 2 to ethane in >99% yield under light irradiation in a flow apparatus. Furthermore, cascading with a subsequent photocatalytic ethane dehydrogenation generates ethylene in >99% yield over 1500 hours of irradiation.},

By studying mice and human kidney tissue and urine samples, Conte et al . determined that renal progenitor cells are responsive to female sex hormones, showing increased proliferation and differentiation into kidney podocytes in response to estrogen and progesterone at physiologically relevant concentrations. The same phenomenon played a key role in pregnancy-induced expansion of the podocyte population to accommodate the increased workload on the kidneys. Conversely, a failure of this adaptation contributed to preeclampsia and increased the risk of long-term kidney impairment in both mothers and offspring in mouse models, consistent with epidemiological data from humans. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich The global burden of kidney disease displays marked sexual dimorphism. Lineage tracing and single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that starting from puberty, estrogen signaling in female mice supports self-renewal and differentiation of renal progenitors to increase filtration capacity, reducing sensitivity to glomerular injury compared with that of males. This phenomenon accelerated as female kidneys adapted to the workload of pregnancy. Deletion of estrogen receptor α in renal progenitors disrupted this adaptation, leading to preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and increased maternal risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Offspring from affected mothers had fewer nephrons, resulting in early-life hypertension and greater susceptibility to kidney disease. These results highlight the fundamental role of kidney fitness and renal progenitors for pregnancy and preeclampsia and as a determinant of sexual dimorphism in kidney disease.},

Most signals are captured in the 30- to 2000-Hz range, and the lower 10- to 30-Hz band remains largely unexplored because of persistent low-frequency control noise that limits sensitivity. Enhancing this sensitivity could increase cosmological reach. Using nonlinear optimal control through reinforcement learning with a frequency-domain reward, Buchli et al . developed a method that effectively reduces control noise in the low-frequency band. This method was successfully implemented at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in Livingston and the Caltech 40 Meter Prototype, achieving control noise levels on LIGO’s most demanding feedback control loop below the quantum noise, thus removing a critical obstacle to increased detector sensitivity. —Yury Suleymanov Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers and binary black hole eccentricity and provide early warnings for multimessenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today’s mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10- to 30-hertz band by over 30x and up to 100x in subbands, surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future gravitational wave observatories and, more broadly, instrumentation and control systems.},

  abstract     = {Earthquakes can trigger silent slip and mud volcanoes, but rarely have the processes been observed together or at long distances. Bayramov et al . documented the flare-up of more than 50 mud volcanoes in the West Caspian Kura basin and substantial aseismic slip across seven faults immediately after the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquakes over 1000 kilometers away. Their findings suggest that seismic waves increased pore pressure in the basin, leading to regional inflation, mud volcano eruption, and reduced effective stress on faults. Faults in fluid-rich basins may thus be susceptible to far-reaching triggering by large earthquakes. —Angela Hessler Seismic waves from large earthquakes are known to trigger slip on distant faults, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar and local geodetic and seismic data, we show that the 1000-kilometer-distant, February 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes in southeastern Türkiye triggered deformation and/or eruption at 56 mud volcanoes and centimeter-scale aseismic slip on seven faults over tens of kilometers within the fluid-rich Kura Basin in the West Caspian region. This transient deformation event, with an equivalent moment magnitude of 6.1, was coupled with local inflation below major hydrocarbon fields. We postulate that seismic waves led to a change in pore pressure at depth, which in turn triggered aseismic slip along several crustal faults crossing the basin and its surroundings.},

  abstract     = {Neuronal control of skeletal muscle function is ubiquitous across species for locomotion and doing work. In particular, emergent behaviors of neurons in biohybrid neuromuscular systems can advance bioinspired locomotion research. Although recent studies have demonstrated that chemical or optogenetic stimulation of neurons can control muscular actuation through the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the correlation between neuronal activities and resulting modulation in the muscle responses is less understood, hindering the engineering of high-level functional biohybrid systems. Here, we developed NMJ-based biohybrid crawling robots with optogenetic mouse motor neurons, skeletal muscles, 3D-printed hydrogel scaffolds, and integrated onboard wireless micro–light-emitting diode (μLED)–based optoelectronics. We investigated the coupling of the light stimulation and neuromuscular actuation through power spectral density (PSD) analysis. We verified the modulation of the mechanical functionality of the robot depending on the frequency of the optical stimulation to the neural tissue. We demonstrated continued muscle contraction up to 20 minutes after a 1-minute-long pulsed 2-hertz optical stimulation of the neural tissue. Furthermore, the robots were shown to maintain their mechanical functionality for more than 2 weeks. This study provides insights into reliable neuronal control with optoelectronics, supporting advancements in neuronal modulation, biohybrid intelligence, and automation.},

  abstract     = {Reading fluency is a vital building block for developing literacy, yet the best way to practice fluency—reading aloud—can cause anxiety severe enough to inhibit literacy development in ways that can have an adverse effect on students through adulthood. One promising intervention to mitigate oral reading anxiety is to have children read aloud to a robot. Although observations in prior work have suggested that people likely feel more comfortable in the presence of a robot instead of a human, few studies have empirically demonstrated that people feel less anxious performing in front of a robot compared with a human or used objective physiological indicators to identify decreased anxiety. To investigate whether a robotic reading companion could reduce reading anxiety felt by children, we conducted a within-subjects study where children aged 8 to 11 years ( n = 52) read aloud to a human and a robot individually while being monitored for physiological responses associated with anxiety. We found that children exhibited fewer physiological indicators of anxiety, specifically vocal jitter and heart rate variability, when reading to the robot compared with reading to a person. This paper provides strong evidence that a robot’s presence has an effect on the anxiety a person experiences while doing a task, offering justification for the use of robots in a wide-reaching array of social interactions that may be anxiety inducing.},

  abstract     = {According to productive failure (PF) theory, experiencing failure during problem-solving can enhance students’ knowledge acquisition in subsequent instruction. However, challenging students with problems beyond their current capabilities may strain their skills, prior knowledge, and emotional well-being. To address this, we designed a social robot–assisted teaching activity in which students observed a robot’s unsuccessful problem-solving attempts, offering a PF-like preparatory effect without requiring direct failure. We conducted two classroom-based studies in a middle school setting to evaluate the method’s effectiveness. In study 1 ( N = 135), we compared three instructional methods—observing robot failure (RF), individual problem-solving failure, and direct instruction—in an eighth-grade mathematics lesson. Students in the RF condition showed the greatest gains in conceptual understanding and reported lower social pressure, although no significant differences were found in procedural knowledge or knowledge transfer. Follow-up study 2 ( N = 110) further validated the method’s effectiveness in supporting knowledge acquisition after a 2-week robot-involved adaptation phase, when the novelty effect had largely subsided. Students confirmed their perception of the robot as a peer, and they offered positive evaluations of its intelligence and neutral views of its anthropomorphism. Our findings suggest that observing the robot’s failure has a comparable, or even greater, effect on knowledge acquisition than experiencing failure firsthand. These results underscore the value of social robots as peers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education and highlight the potential of integrating robotics with evidence-based teaching strategies to enhance learning outcomes.},

To overcome this challenge, we propose a robotic sensing approach that integrates embedded ultrasonic soft sensors (EUSSs) with magnetic actuators, resulting in a wireless sensor-integrated miniature machine with seamless integration and minimal interference between fields. The EUSS, with its compact dimensions (1.3 millimeters by 1.3 millimeters by 1.6 millimeters), softness (98 kilopascals), and lightweight design (4.6 milligrams), is compatible with both soft and rigid components in terms of deformability and size. By engineering onboard transducers and using passive ultrasound communication along with external magnetic fields, we could wirelessly detect and regulate environmental parameters such as force, vibration, viscosity, and temperature. Demonstrations in rabbit and porcine models show the potential for robotic feedback control, accurate drug dosing, and in situ physiological monitoring, paving the way for real-world applications of intelligent miniature machines.},

  abstract     = {Dynamics models that predict the effects of physical interactions are essential for planning and control in robotic manipulation. Although models based on physical principles often generalize well, they typically require full-state information, which can be difficult or impossible to extract from perception data in complex, real-world scenarios. Learning-based dynamics models provide an alternative by deriving state transition functions purely from perceived interaction data, enabling the capture of complex, hard-to-model factors and predictive uncertainty and accelerating simulations that are often too slow for real-time control. Recent successes in this field have demonstrated notable advancements in robot capabilities, including long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects, granular materials, and complex multiobject interactions such as stowing and packing. A crucial aspect of these investigations is the choice of state representation, which determines the inductive biases in the learning system for reduced-order modeling of scene dynamics. This article provides a timely and comprehensive review of current techniques and trade-offs in designing learned dynamics models, highlighting their role in advancing robot capabilities through integration with state estimation and control and identifying critical research gaps for future exploration.},

  abstract     = {Modern robotic manufacturing requires collision-free coordination of multiple robots to complete numerous tasks in shared, obstacle-rich workspaces. Although individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning under spatiotemporal constraints remain computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales. Existing multiarm systems deployed in industry rely on human intuition and experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on procedurally generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot configurations, and task distributions. It uses a graph representation of scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through RL to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the subproblems of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and scalability of our planner also open the door to capabilities such as fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based replanning, where rapid adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.},

Papadopoulou et al . found that oxidative phosphorylation promoted the nonpathogenic T H 17 cell state in mice and depended on the activation of the kinase AMPK by the adenosine receptor A 2A R. AMPK reduced the abundance of the histone acetyltransferase PCAF, leading to reduced expression of genes involved in aerobic glycolysis and an increase in the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Disrupting this pathway enabled T H 17 cells to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice. —Annalisa M. VanHook Metabolic reprogramming controls protective and pathogenic T helper 17 (T H 17) cell responses. When naïve T cells are differentiated into T H 17 cells in vitro, the presence of the cytokine activin A promotes their maturation into a nonpathogenic state. Here, we found that nonpathogenic T H 17 cells induced by activin A displayed reduced aerobic glycolysis and increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In response to activin A, signaling through the adenosine A 2A receptor (A 2A R) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) enhanced OXPHOS and reprogrammed pathogenic T H 17 cells toward nonpathogenic states that did not induce central nervous system autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. In pathogenic T H 17 cells, the transcriptional coactivator p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) increased acetylation at histone 3 Lys 9 (H3K9ac) of genes involved in aerobic glycolysis and T H 17 pathogenic programs. In contrast, in nonpathogenic activin A–treated T H 17 cells, AMPK signaling suppressed PCAF-mediated H3K9ac modification of genes involved in aerobic metabolism and enhanced H3K9ac modification of genes involved in OXPHOS and nonpathogenic T H 17 programs. Together, our findings uncover A 2A R-AMPK signaling as a central metabolic checkpoint that suppresses T H 17 cell pathogenicity.},

Alamir et al. used a tumor cell–derived spheroid system to investigate the role of the coregulatory receptor TIM3 on murine and human cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). Imaging and functional studies showed that in the relatively immunosuppressive three-dimensional environment of spheroids, TIM3 inhibited CTL responses, whereas in two-dimensional systems, it played a costimulatory role. These findings suggest that TIM3 amplifies either inhibitory or stimulatory signals in T cells in a context-dependent manner, which could help inform the development of therapies that target it. —John F. Foley TIM3 is a coregulatory receptor that is highly abundant on multiple immune cell types, including T cells in response to prolonged exposure to antigen, and it marks functionally suppressed cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the tumor microenvironment. TIM3 exhibits inhibitory function in vivo but paradoxically has costimulatory T cell signaling capability in vitro. Here, we found that TIM3 directly inhibited the function of murine and human CTLs in direct interaction with target tumor cell spheroids. TIM3 regulated the ability of suppressed CTLs to polarize their actin cytoskeleton as a required step in cytolysis. Whereas the expression of the proposed TIM3 ligands CEACAM1 and galectin 9 in trans on target tumor cells enhanced TIM3 function, expression of CEACAM1 in cis on CTLs had the opposite effect. TIM3 functioned as an inhibitory receptor on spheroid-suppressed CTLs but not on active CTLs in a two-dimensional tissue culture model. Together, these data suggest that TIM3 enhances T cell function, serving as either a coinhibitory or costimulatory receptor depending on the functional context of the T cell on which it is expressed.},

Sealover et al. identified differential and complementary engagement of downstream MAPK and PI3K pathways among mutant and wild-type RAS members that demanded a combined approach to effectively stunt tumor development. In KRAS-mutant cells, for example, inhibition of PI3K, which was activated by wild-type HRAS and NRAS more than by mutant KRAS, was synergistically cytotoxic with a KRAS-mutant–specific inhibitor. The findings reveal the critical contribution of wild-type RAS family members in cancer cells with mutant RAS and the need for therapeutic approaches that simultaneously target both. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Mutated RAS proteins activate downstream effector pathways (RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT) to drive oncogenic transformation and progression. Because RAS family members differentially engage these pathways, combined inhibition of both pathways is required to effectively treat RAS -mutated cancers. Here, we found that this was due to signaling contributed by wild-type RAS family members that activated an effector pathway that was poorly engaged by the mutant RAS family member. Wild-type KRAS and NRAS promoted RAF-MEK-ERK signaling in cells expressing mutant HRAS, whereas wild-type HRAS and NRAS promoted PI3K-AKT signaling in cells expressing mutant KRAS. Combining inhibitors targeting the poorly engaged RAS effector pathways with inhibitors targeting the mutant RAS resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity in a manner that depended on wild-type RAS expression. The farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib blocked mutant HRAS-PI3K signaling and synergized with MEK inhibitors in HRAS -mutated cells, whereas KRAS G12C inhibitors blocked mutant KRAS-MEK signaling and synergized with PI3K inhibitors in KRAS G12C -mutated cells. Synergy was abolished in MEFs lacking all RAS proteins and in cancer cell lines in which nonmutated RAS family members were deleted.

IL-15 and IL-18 stimulated mTORC1 activity through distinct pathways not previously implicated in its regulation. The combination of IL-15 and IL-18 improved the survival of mice engrafted with tumor cells, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of NK cell–based cancer immunotherapy. —Wei Wong The multiprotein complex mTORC1 is essential for the increase in protein synthesis and bioenergetic metabolism that supports the proliferation of many cell types, including natural killer (NK) cells, which are important innate effectors of the antitumoral response. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of mTORC1 activation in NK cells by interleukin-15 (IL-15) and IL-18, which promote NK cell function and are components of a cytokine cocktail used to preactivate NK cells for cancer immunotherapy. Through genetic and pharmacological approaches, we showed that IL-15 activated mTORC1 through the PI3K/Akt/ERK pathway, whereas IL-18 signaled through the p38 effectors MK2 and MK3 in both murine and human primary NK cells. Both pathways synergized to promote NK cell proliferation and effector functions in an mTORC1-dependent manner. Moreover, both pathways operated independently of the inhibitor TSC and the activator Rheb, revealing a noncanonical mode of mTORC1 activation by cytokines.

  abstract     = {Amphetamine is a stimulant that is used to treat various neurological disorders. It is also misused and induces changes in the gut microbiome. Mabry et al. found that Fusobacterium nucleatum in the guts of flies enhanced the psychomotor effects of amphetamine by increasing the amount of dopamine transporters in the brain. F. nucleatum produces butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that inhibits chromatin-modifying enzymes called HDACs. Manipulating this axis in flies suggested that butyrate increased the expression of the gene encoding the dopamine transporter through HDAC1 inhibition, thus enhancing dopamine-motivated behaviors. The findings reveal a potentially targetable gut-brain axis to treat amphetamine use disorder. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Amphetamines are psychostimulants that are commonly used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders and are prone to misuse. The pathogenesis of amphetamine use disorder (AUD) is associated with dysbiosis (an imbalance in the body’s microbiome) and bacterially produced short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are implicated in the gut-brain axis. Amphetamine exposure in both rats and humans increases the amount of intestinal Fusobacterium nucleatum , which releases SFCAs. Here, we found that colonization of gnotobiotic Drosophila melanogaster with F. nucleatum or supplementing the flies’ diet with the SCFA butyrate enhanced the psychomotor and reward properties of amphetamine. Butyrate inhibits histone deacetylases (HDACs), and knockdown of HDAC1 recapitulated the effects induced by F. nucleatum or butyrate. The enhancement in amphetamine-induced behaviors was mediated by an increase in the amount of released dopamine that resulted from amphetamine-induced reversal of dopamine transporter (DAT) function, termed nonvesicular dopamine release (NVDR). The magnitude of amphetamine-induced NVDR was partially mediated by an increase in DAT abundance stimulated at a transcriptional level, and the administration of F. nucleatum or butyrate enhanced NVDR by increasing DAT expression. The findings indicate that F. nucleatum supports AUD through epigenetic regulation of dopamine signaling and identify potential targets for AUD treatment.},

Okeoma et al . analyzed the contents of vesicles from donors and identified proteins that interacted with the viral transcriptional activator Tat and the human transcription factor NF-κB subunit p65. Only a few proteins interacted with both factors, and those proteins interacted with larger networks of transcriptional, RNA processing, and epigenetic regulators. These findings may lead to new therapeutics to more durably suppress or even eradicate HIV infection. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Replication of HIV-1 requires the coordinated action of host and viral transcription factors, most critically the viral transactivator Tat and the host nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). This activity is disrupted in infected cells that are cultured with extracellular vesicles (EVs) present in human semen, suggesting that they contain factors that could inform the development of new therapeutics. Here, we explored the contents of semen-derived EVs (SEVs) from uninfected donors and individuals with HIV-1 and identified host proteins that interacted with HIV Tat and the NF-κB subunit p65. Integrative network and pathway enrichment analyses of these complexes revealed associations with an array of biological functions regulating gene expression. Several proteins in SEVs bound to both Tat and NF-κB p65: the scaffolding and cell signaling regulatory protein AKAP9, the G protein signaling regulator ARHGEF28, the epigenetic reader BRD2, the small nuclear RNA processor INTS1, and the transcription elongation inhibitor NELFB. When complexed with p65, NELFB also interacted with HEXIM1, another transcription elongation inhibitor, suggesting that SEVs may inhibit HIV-1 propagation through multiple networks of transcriptional activation and repression. Exploring these data and the underlying mechanisms may inform the development of more effective or more durable therapeutics against HIV.},

  abstract     = {Tumor cells can escape drug-induced quiescence, reenter the cell cycle, and slowly proliferate in a state of drug-tolerant persistence that impairs treatment success. Using single-cell tracking techniques, Nangia et al. found that mTORC1-mediated increases in the amount of the cell-cycle protein cyclin D1 drove escape from standard BRAF and MEK inhibitors in cultured BRAF-mutant melanoma cells. Reducing cyclin D1 in melanoma cells or blocking mTORC1 signaling in melanoma and lung cancer cells reduced the proportion of cells that cycled under drug pressure in culture. Thus, mTORC1 signaling enables cells in drug-induced quiescence to reenter the cell cycle, which may impair long-term drug efficacy. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli In BRAF -mutant melanoma cells treated with inhibitors of the kinases BRAF and MEK, a subset of cells rapidly and nongenetically adapts to escape drug-induced quiescence and reenters the cell cycle. Here, we investigated the mechanisms enabling this drug escape by computationally reconstructing single-cell lineages from time-lapse imaging data, linking dynamic signaling pathways to distinct cell-cycle fate outcomes. We found that reactivation of the MEK substrate ERK was necessary but not sufficient to drive escape; rather, the activity of the protein complex mTORC1 was also required to promote cell growth and protein synthesis in drug-treated cells destined for cell-cycle reentry. ERK and mTORC1 signaling converged to increase the abundance of cyclin D1 protein, a critical bottleneck for cell-cycle commitment under drug pressure. In cells in which endogenous cyclin D1 was fluorescently tagged using CRISPR, the subset that escaped drug treatment exhibited marked accumulation of cyclin D1 at least 15 hours before cell-cycle reentry, enabling early prediction of future drug escape. Cyclin D1 thus represents both an early biomarker and potential therapeutic target for suppressing drug escape in melanoma. We observed a similar mTORC1-driven mechanism underlying escape in lung cancer cells, but not colon cancer cells, highlighting partial generalizability across cancer types.},

  abstract     = {Although opioids block nociceptive signaling, their prolonged use increases pain sensitivity and promotes analgesic tolerance. These adverse effects involve the activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) and the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5 in sensory neuron terminals in the spinal cord. Jin et al . found that morphine treatment increased the coupling of mGluR5 to Gα q in the spinal cords of rodents and that Gα q was required for morphine-induced increases in NMDAR phosphorylation and synaptic trafficking. Inhibition or knockdown of Gα q reduced morphine-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance. Thus, Gα q might be targeted to improve the analgesic effects of these drugs while reducing the need for dose escalation. —Annalisa M. VanHook Opioids relieve pain by activating μ-opioid receptors (MORs), which inhibit communication between pain-sensing neurons (nociceptors) and the spinal cord. However, prolonged opioid use can paradoxically lead to increased pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia) and reduced analgesic efficacy (tolerance), partly because of the activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) at the central terminals of primary sensory neurons in the spinal cord. Here, we identified a critical role for the G protein Gα q in this paradox. Pharmacological inhibition of Gα q in rats reversed morphine-induced increases in NMDAR phosphorylation, synaptic trafficking, and activity at sensory neuron terminals and reduced morphine-induced excitatory nociceptive input to spinal dorsal horn neurons. Morphine enhanced Gα q coupling specifically to metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) dimers in the spinal cord. Furthermore, targeted knockdown of Gα q in dorsal root ganglion neurons in mice normalized NMDAR-related changes and prevented NMDAR-mediated synaptic potentiation triggered by MOR activation. In addition, either pharmacological or genetic disruption of Gα q signaling enhanced morphine’s analgesic effects while reducing hyperalgesia and tolerance. These findings reveal that Gα q signaling contributes to opioid-induced NMDAR hyperactivity at nociceptor central terminals by promoting MOR-mGluR5 cross-talk. Targeting this pathway may improve the safety and efficacy of opioid-based pain management.},
