Bacteroides species are prominent, long-term constituents of the gut microbiome that also play host to diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs). DGRs produce extraordinary numbers of DNA sequence variants and variable protein sequences. Macadangdang et al . investigated the DGRs that specifically target bacterial adhesion proteins (pilins) without disrupting the scaffold of the adhesin (see the Perspective by Paul and Mekalanos). This arrangement maximizes the capacity and rate of bacterial diversification with minimal cost. Data from mother-baby pairs showed that the first of a lifelong experience of bacterial and DGR transfer occurs at birth, resulting in the transfer of Bacteroides variants that are specific to and stick with their new hosts. —Caroline Ash Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) accelerate evolution by rapidly diversifying variable proteins. The human gastrointestinal microbiota harbors the greatest density of DGRs known in nature, suggesting that they play adaptive roles in this environment. We identified >1100 distinct DGRs among human-associated Bacteroides species and discovered a subset that diversify adhesive components of type V pili and related proteins. We show that Bacteroides DGRs are horizontally transferred across species, display activity levels ranging from high to low, and preferentially alter the functional characteristics of ligand-binding residues on adhesive organelles. Specific variable protein sequences are enriched when Bacteroides strains compete with other commensal bacteria in gnotobiotic mice. Analysis of >2700 DGRs from diverse phyla in mother-infant pairs shows that Bacteroides DGRs are disproportionately transferred to vaginally delivered infants where they actively diversify. Our observations provide a foundation for understanding the potential roles of targeted genome plasticity in shaping host-associated microbial communities.},

ORF2p binds double-stranded DNA without sequence specificity, and the single-stranded DNA path suggests dynamic EN positioning during cleavage. EN activity was strongly stimulated by forked or flap DNAs, indicating that ORF2p acts as a structure-selective endonuclease and explaining why LINE-1 mobilization predominantly occurs during DNA replication. —Di Jiang Long interspersed nuclear element–1 (LINE-1 or L1), the only autonomously active retrotransposon in humans today, constitutes a large proportion of the genome and continues to evolve the genome and impact fundamental biological processes. L1 retrotransposition critically depends on its endonuclease and reverse transcriptase subunit open reading frame 2 protein (ORF2p), which targets genomic loci and nicks DNA using an evolutionarily distinct yet not fully understood mechanism. Our structural and biochemical analyses revealed that ORF2p is a structure-dependent endonuclease. It binds a double-stranded DNA region upstream of the nicking site and recognizes a downstream forked or flap structure for efficient DNA nicking. This discovery suggests that L1 mobilization piggybacks on chromosomal processes with noncanonical DNA structure intermediates.},

Although these strains only differ by about 12,000 genetic variants, the authors identified nearly 6500 associations between genetic variants and protein levels. Nearly all (98%) of these variants acted in trans (>1 kilobase away from coding sequence) and many affected transcription factors, leading to downstream effects on many proteins. The results of this study represent a comprehensive atlas of variant protein dynamics in an important model organism. —Corinne Simonti Understanding how genetic variation translates into complex phenotypes remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we address this by mapping genome-to-proteome relationships in 800 progeny of a cross between two yeast strains adapted to distinct environments. Despite the modest genetic distance between the parents, we observed notable proteomic diversity and mapped more than 6400 genotype-protein associations, with more than 1600 linked to individual genetic variants. Proteomic adaptation emerged from a conserved network of cis- and trans-regulatory variants, often originating from proteins not traditionally linked to gene regulation. This atlas allowed us to forecast organismal fitness effects across diverse conditions. By connecting genomic and proteomic landscapes at unprecedented resolution, our study provides a framework for predicting the phenotypic outcomes of natural genetic variation.},

Gao et al . found that deleting Aster-A specifically in T cells inhibited the uptake of dietary fats and prevented diet-induced obesity in mice (see the Perspective by Burkhardt and Ecker). By regulating the abundance of cholesterol in the plasma membrane, Aster-A modulated T cell receptor signaling and differentiation. In the absence of Aster-A, CD4 T cells in the gut produced a cytokine, interleukin-22, which decreased the ability of intestinal epithelial cells to take up fatty acids from the diet. —Sarah H. Ross The intrinsic pathways that control membrane organization in immune cells and their impact on cellular functions are poorly defined. We found that the nonvesicular cholesterol transporter Aster-A linked plasma membrane (PM) cholesterol availability in CD4 T cells to systemic metabolism. Aster-A was recruited to the PM during T cell receptor (TCR) activation, where it facilitated the removal of accessible cholesterol. Loss of Aster-A increased cholesterol accumulation in the PM, which enhanced TCR nanoclustering and signaling. Aster-A associated with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and negatively regulated calcium (Ca 2+ ) flux. Aster-A deficiency promoted CD4 T cells to acquire a T helper 17 (T H 17) phenotype and stimulated interleukin-22 production, which reduced intestinal fat absorption and conferred resistance to diet-induced obesity.

Acidosis, a metabolic state known to occur in tumors, appeared to be a main factor affecting cell metabolism by decreasing activity of the protein kinase ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase). ERK suppression blunted the effects of oncogene activation on mitochondrial morphology and favored tumor growth by allowing the cells to adapt to metabolic stress. —L. Bryan Ray Malignant tumors are characterized by diverse metabolic stresses, including nutrient shortages, hypoxia, and buildup of metabolic by-products. To understand how cancer cells adapt to such challenges, we conducted sequential CRISPR screens to identify genes that affect cellular fitness under specific metabolic stress conditions in cell culture and to then probe their relevance in pancreatic tumors. Comparative analyses of hundreds of fitness genes revealed that cancer metabolism in vivo was shaped by bioenergetic adaptations to tumor acidosis. Mechanistically, acidosis suppressed cytoplasmic activity of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), thereby preventing oncogene-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and promoting fused mitochondria. The resulting boost in mitochondrial respiration supported cancer cell adaptations to various metabolic stresses. Thus, acidosis is an environmental factor that alters energy metabolism to promote stress resilience in cancer.},

Chen et al . revealed a molecular mechanism that contributes to successful aging in these rodents: a change in the enzyme cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS), which is known to sense cytosolic DNA and initiate immune defense responses (see the Perspective by Martinez et al .). Unlike human cGAS, which inhibits DNA repair by homologous recombination in the nucleus, the naked mole rat enzyme has four amino acid changes that allow it to enhance DNA repair, thus delaying aging and enhancing life span. —L. Bryan Ray Efficient DNA repair might make possible the longevity of naked mole-rats. However, whether they have distinctive mechanisms to optimize functions of DNA repair suppressors is unclear. We find that naked mole-rat cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS) lacks the suppressive function of human or mouse homologs in homologous recombination repair through the alteration of four amino acids during evolution. The changes enable cGAS to retain chromatin longer upon DNA damage by weakening TRIM41-mediated ubiquitination and interaction with the segregase P97. Prolonged chromatin binding of cGAS enhanced the interaction between repair factors FANCI and RAD50 to facilitate RAD50 recruitment to damage sites, thereby potentiating homologous recombination repair. Moreover, the four amino acids mediate the function of cGAS in antagonizing cellular and tissue aging and extending life span. Manipulating cGAS might therefore constitute a mechanism for life-span extension.},

This positional coupling, called the positional initiation-termination axis, is most prominent in long genes and is governed by the rate of RNA polymerase II elongation. These findings uncover a molecular mechanism that shapes mRNA diversity across tissues. —Di Jiang Transcriptional initiation and termination decisions drive messenger RNA (mRNA) isoform diversity but the relationship between them remains poorly understood. By systematically profiling joint usage of transcription start and end sites, we observed that mRNA using upstream starts preferentially use upstream end sites and that the usage of downstream sites is similarly coupled. Our results suggest a positional initiation termination axis (PITA), in which usage of alternative terminal sites are coupled based on their genomic order. PITA is enriched in longer genes with distinct chromatin features. We find that mRNA 5′ start choice directly influences 3′ ends depending on RNA polymerase II trafficking speed.

Activating the STING (stimulator of interferon genes) pathway is one way to encourage tumor immune cell infiltrates and positive therapeutic response. However, targeting the STING pathway has not yet succeeded in human trials despite encouraging results from experimental preclinical models. Hsu et al . report one possible reason: Many human cancers lose expression of a gene called methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), which causes a block of the STING pathway, but MTAP deficiency is rare in animal models. The researchers found that targeting a related process, polyamine metabolism, with the existing drug DL-α-difluoromethylornithine could restore immune activity in MTAP-deleted cancers and reduce tumor growth. This approach may offer a new way to improve cancer treatment and patient selection for STING-based therapies. —Priscilla N. Kelly Cytosolic nucleic acid–sensing pathways are potential targets for cancer immunotherapy. Although stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists have shown substantial antitumor effects in animal models, their clinical efficacy in human tumors remains unclear. Deletion of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a common genomic alteration in human tumors but is rare in preclinical syngeneic mouse models. We found that homozygous MTAP deletion in human tumors creates a tumor microenvironment that obstructs cytosolic nucleic acid–sensing pathways by down-regulating interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to resistance to STING agonists. Targeting polyamine biosynthesis reverses IRF3 down-regulation, restoring sensitivity to STING agonists in MTAP-deficient tumors. Our findings suggest that MTAP genetic status may inform patient responses to STING agonist therapy and offer an alternative strategy for boosting antitumor immune responses using STING agonists in MTAP -deleted tumors.},

Most SSEs remain largely confined to single-anion systems (e.g., sulfides, oxides, halides, and polymers). Through mixed-anion design strategy, we develop crystalline Li 3 Ta 3 O 4 Cl 10 (LTOC) and its derivatives with excellent ionic conductivities (up to 13.7 millisiemens per centimeter at 25°C) and electrochemical stability. The LTOC structure features mixed-anion spiral chains, consisting of corner-shared oxygen and terminal chlorine atoms, which induces continuous “tetrahedron-tetrahedron” Li-ion migration pathways with low energy barriers. Additionally, LTOC demonstrates holistic cathode compatibility, enabling solid-state batteries operation at 4.9 volts versus Li/Li + and low temperature, down to −50°C. These findings describe a promising class of superionic conductors for high-performance solid-state batteries.},

  abstract     = {Ferroics are important materials for applications in solid-state memory storage and ultrafast switching. Ferromagnetics and ferroelectrics have stray fields that can interfere with nearby memories, resulting in depolarization and ultimately limiting storage density. By contrast, in ferroaxial materials, the electric dipoles line up head to tail, forming vortices and thereby removing the stray fields. However, these vortex states have so far been difficult to control and switch. Zeng et al . demonstrated how single optical pulses can repeatedly switch a ferroaxial phase between two stable states (see the Perspective by He and Khalsa). The controlled switching between left and right helicity could be useful in developing a new platform for ultrafast information storage. —Ian S. Osborne Ultrafast switching of ferroic phases is an active research area with technological potential. Yet, some key challenges remain, ranging from limited speeds in ferromagnets to intrinsic volatility of switched domains owing to depolarizing fields in ferroelectrics. Unlike these ferroic systems, ferroaxial materials host bistable states that preserve spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetry and are therefore immune to depolarizing fields but also difficult to manipulate with conventional methods. We demonstrate photo-induced switching of ferroaxial order by engineering an effective axial field composed of circularly driven terahertz phonon modes. A switched ferroaxial domain remains stable for many hours and can be reversed back with a second terahertz pulse of opposite helicity. The effects demonstrated in this work may lead to the development of a robust platform for ultrafast information storage.},

  abstract     = {Visualizing and quantifying the amount of a hormone within a cell can be achieved using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensors. These sensors involve a hormone binding to a pair of linked proteins, which then undergo conformational changes to alter the fluorescence emission ratio of two connected fluorescent proteins. Tang et al . have developed a FRET sensor for the plant hormone salicylic acid, which is primarily involved in activating immune responses. Using this sensor, the authors were able to visualize hormone levels with high sensitivity and spatial resolution at the cellular level and observed varied dynamics and patterns of salicylic acid up-regulation in response to bacterial infections. —Madeleine Seale Salicylic acid (SA) is a key phytohormone that orchestrates immune responses against pathogens, including Pseudomonas syringae bacteria. The timing and extent of SA accumulation are tightly controlled by plants but can be suppressed by pathogens to overcome immunity. Understanding SA dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolution remains challenging owing to limitations in existing detection methods that are indirect, destructive, or lacking in cellular precision and temporal resolution. We developed SalicS1, a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor specific to SA. SalicS1 enables real-time, reversible monitoring of SA levels in vivo with minimal perturbation of endogenous signaling. We reveal the propagation of an SA surge spreading from bacterial infection sites with spatiotemporal fidelity. SalicS1 unlocks precise understanding of SA dynamics underpinning crop resilience to pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Forest degradation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, such that forest protection projects are used as carbon offsets for greenhouse gas–producing activities in voluntary carbon markets. Recently, the effectiveness of carbon-offsetting programs such as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation Plus) has been called into question, causing a decline in carbon offset values. Tang et al . addressed this question with updated analyses incorporating many projects and carefully chosen controls. Across 52 REDD+ Avoided Unplanned Deforestation projects from 12 countries in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, the authors found greater climate benefits than previous studies but low efficacy overall: Less than 20% of projects met their emissions targets. Project success and overestimation both varied considerably between countries. —Bianca Lopez REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation Plus) projects generate carbon credits to offset emissions, but recent studies have questioned their effectiveness. We evaluated 52 voluntary REDD+ projects across 12 tropical countries using synthetic control methods. Only a minority of project units showed statistically significant reductions in deforestation, and just 19% met their reported emissions targets. Nonetheless, many underperforming projects still delivered partial climate benefits, with an estimated 13.2% of tradable credits supported by counterfactual analysis. Effectiveness varied by region, with stronger performance in Brazil and Africa. Although systematic over-crediting remains a concern, our results suggest greater climate benefits than previous assessments. Improving baseline methodologies and strengthening verification frameworks will be essential for enhancing the credibility and impact of forest carbon offsets.},

Although most people think of them as insectivores, there are bats that eat mammals and amphibians and even birds. Three bat species have been recorded preying on birds, but how and when they do this has been mostly unknown. Stidsholt et al . monitored greater noctule bats in flight and found that individuals track migrating birds using echolocation and consume them on the wing. These observations suggest that these efficient aerial predators have also evolved to prey on migrating birds. —Sacha Vignieri Despite billions of passerines seasonally migrating during the night at high altitudes, only three bat species have been found to consistently tap into this rich prey resource. However, it remains unknown where and how these bats locate, catch, and ingest relatively large passerine prey. Here, we used high-resolution biologging tags to reveal that greater noctule bats ( Nyctalus lasiopterus ) ascend to high altitudes, engage in long echo-guided chases, and consume migrating passerines in flight. By using a private sensory channel through ultrasonic echolocation, prolonged chasing, and mid-air prey consumption, these predators can hunt nocturnally migrating passerines at high altitudes and therefore exploit a rich food resource that remains largely inaccessible to most predators.},

However, increases in laser output power are limited by nonlinear effects that can damage the optical components and reduce the beam quality. Rothe et al . used a spatial wavefront-shaping technique for multimode fiber lasers that mitigates the detrimental processes, thus enabling output power to be increased appreciably while maintaining beam quality. —Ian S. Osborne High-power fiber lasers are powerful tools used in science, industry, and defense. A major roadblock for further power scaling of single-frequency fiber laser amplifiers is stimulated Brillouin scattering. Efforts have been made to mitigate this nonlinear process, but these were mostly limited to single-mode or few-mode fiber amplifiers, which have good beam quality. Here, we explored a highly multimode fiber amplifier in which stimulated Brillouin scattering was greatly suppressed due to a reduction of light intensity in a large fiber core and a broadening of the Brillouin scattering spectrum by multimode excitation. By applying a spatial wavefront shaping technique to the input light of a nonlinear amplifier, the output beam was focused to a diffraction-limited spot. Our multimode fiber amplifier can operate at high power with high efficiency and narrow linewidth, which ensures high coherence. Optical wavefront shaping enables coherent control of multimode laser amplification, with potential applications in coherent beam combining, large-scale interferometry and directed energy delivery.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is essential for life and depends on the cooperation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with the nuclear genome, but little is known about the mechanisms ensuring nuclear-mtDNA compatibility. Frison et al . found that mitochondria harboring a mtDNA mutation evade mitochondrial quality control by inhibiting the ubiquitin proteasome system. In mouse models, restoring mitochondrial ubiquitination through ubiquitin-specific peptidase 30 (Usp30) loss increased purifying selection of mtDNA in early embryogenesis. In vitro, genetically or chemically inhibiting Usp30 reduced mutant burden by increasing ubiquitin-mediated mitochondrial autophagy. Usp30 thus provides a promising target to treat and prevent mtDNA disorders. —Stella M. Hurtley Mitochondrial synthesis of adenosine triphosphate is essential for eukaryotic life but is dependent on the cooperation of two genomes: nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). mtDNA mutates ~15 times as fast as the nuclear genome, challenging this symbiotic relationship. Mechanisms must have evolved to moderate the impact of mtDNA mutagenesis but are poorly understood. Here, we observed purifying selection of a mouse mtDNA mutation modulated by Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 30 ( Usp30 ) during the maternal-zygotic transition. In vitro, Usp30 inhibition recapitulated these findings by increasing ubiquitin-mediated mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). We also found that high mutant burden, or heteroplasmy, impairs the ubiquitin-proteasome system, explaining how mutations can evade quality control to cause disease. Inhibiting USP30 unleashes latent mitophagy, reducing mutant mtDNA in high-heteroplasmy cells. These findings suggest a potential strategy to prevent mitochondrial disorders.},

  abstract     = {The total solar eclipse that occurred across the central southern to northeastern parts of the US presented an opportunity to study the responses of animals to rapid changes in light. Aguilar et al . anticipated this event and created an app that observers could use to record bird behavior, receiving input from over 10,000 users. They combined these data with locally recorded vocalizations analyzed by the artificial neural network model BirdNET. Together, these analyses revealed that half of the species responded to the end of the eclipse by singing a dawn chorus despite the “night” lasting only a few minutes. Variation in species response also informs us about variation in sensitivity to light, with implications for the impacts of artificial light. —Sacha Vignieri On 8 April 2024, a total solar eclipse disrupted light-dark cycles for North American birds during the lead-up to spring reproduction. Compiling more than 10,000 community observations and artificial intelligence analyses of nearly 100,000 vocalizations, we found that bird behavior was substantially affected by these few minutes of unexpected afternoon darkness. More than half of wild bird species changed their biological rhythms, with many producing a dawn chorus in the aftermath of the eclipse.

These bacteria are not uniformly distributed, however, and exhibit precise patterning around emerging lateral roots and early root differentiation zones. Tsai et al . established that the Casparian strip, an endodermal barrier around the root vasculature, is required for normal patterning of root bacteria (see the Perspective by Kozaeva and Brophy). At locations where the Casparian strip is absent, glutamine leaks from the vasculature and serves as an attractant for soil bacteria. Using precise spatial and temporal analysis, the authors provide insight into how bacteria around the root interact both with the plant and with each other. —Madeleine Seale Plant roots release exudates to encourage microbiome assembly, which influences the function and stress resilience of plants. How specific exudates drive spatial colonization patterns remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that endodermal Casparian strips—forming the root’s extracellular diffusion barrier—restrict nutrient leakage into the rhizosphere, coinciding with and controlling spatial colonization patterns of rhizobacteria. We find that vasculature-derived glutamine leakage is a major bacterial chemoattractant and enhancer of proliferation, defining a previously unknown pathway for root exudate formation. Bacteria defective in amino acid chemoperception display reduced attraction toward leakage sites, and roots with Casparian strip defects display bacterial overproliferation, dependent on bacterial capacity for amino acid metabolization. Associated chronic immune stimulation suggests that endodermal nutrient restriction is crucial for regulating microbial colonization and assembly, limiting excessive proliferation that could compromise plant health.},

  abstract     = {When cells experience a lack of amino acids, they initiate a stress response signaled by activations of the protein kinase GCN2. Zhou et al . used an in vitro translation system to refine our understanding of how this activation of GCN2 occurs. In their experiments, the critical factor appeared to be the collision of ribosomes that occurs when aminoacyl-transfer RNAs are not available and a peptide chain cannot be elongated. The trailing ribosomes then collide with the stalled ribosome, and GCN2 was found to be associated with this molecular traffic jam. There, the presence of uncharged transfer RNAs, another consequence of a shortage of amino acids, also promoted the phosphorylation and activation of GCN2. —L. Bryan Ray During nutrient deprivation, activation of the protein kinase GCN2 regulates cell survival and metabolic homeostasis. In addition to amino acid stress, GCN2 is activated by a variety of cellular stresses. GCN2 activation has been linked to its association with uncharged tRNAs, specific ribosomal proteins, and conditions of translational arrest, but their relative contribution to activation is unclear. Here, we used in vitro translation to reconstitute GCN2 activation by amino acid stress and compared collided ribosome populations induced by diverse translational stressors. Initiation of GCN2 signaling required the di-ribosome sensor GCN1, which recruits GCN2 to ribosomes in a collision-dependent manner, where GCN2 becomes activated by key ribosomal interactions and stably associated with collided ribosomes. Our findings define the molecular requirements and dynamics of GCN2 activation.},

This structure, formed by upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water from greater depths, has major impacts on both ocean biological productivity and climate. But how did this system behave during the Pliocene epoch, an interval that had a warmer climate than today and often is considered a climate analog for our warmer future? Rafter et al . analyzed the nitrogen isotopic compositions of marine sediments and organic phases in foraminifera to conclude that upwelling in the EEP has persisted over the past 4 million years, although the cold tongue was warmer during the Pliocene (see the Perspective by Rosenthal and Hess). These results have implications for both ocean circulation during the Pliocene and in the future. —Jesse Smith Upwelling generates a nutrient-rich “cold tongue” in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (EEP), with impacts on global climate, oceanic biological productivity, and the carbon cycle. The cold tongue was reduced during the Pliocene Epoch, a feature attributed to weaker upwelling and an associated deepening of the surface mixed layer in the EEP. Here, we report nitrogen-isotope evidence that modern-like upwelling occurred in the EEP during the Pliocene and has persisted over the past 5 million years. We explain the reduced Pliocene cold tongue as an expression of the reduced temperature difference between surface and subsurface waters in the tropical Pacific. The attendant reduction in the vertical density gradient may have maintained EEP upwelling despite the expected slackening of the trade winds under Pliocene warmth.},

However, recent data have demonstrated the existence of noncanonical routes of interneuronal communication mediating the transport of materials including calcium, mitochondria, and pathogenic proteins such as amyloid beta (Aβ). Using super-resolution and electron microscopy, Chang et al . identified and characterized structures called nanotubular bridges that connect dendrites in the brain (see the Perspective by Budinger and Heneka). These bridges mediate the transport of calcium ions, small molecules, and Aβ peptides, and may contribute to the spreading and accumulation of pathological Aβ in Alzheimer’s disease. —Mattia Maroso Intercellular nanotubular networks mediate material exchange, but their existence in neurons remains to be explored in detail. We identified long, thin dendritic filopodia forming direct dendrite–dendrite nanotubes (DNTs) in mammalian cortex. Super-resolution microscopy in dissociated neurons revealed DNTs’ actin-rich composition and dynamics, enabling long-range calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) propagation. Imaging and machine learning–based analysis validated in situ DNTs as anatomically distinct from synaptic spines. DNTs actively transported small molecules and human amyloid-β (Aβ); DNT density increased before plaque formation in the medial prefrontal cortex of APP/PS1 mice (APP, Aβ precursor protein; PS1, presenilin-1), suggesting that the dendrite-DNT network might play a role in Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Computational models of DNT-mediated Aβ propagation recapitulated early amyloidosis, predicting selective intracellular accumulation. These findings uncover a nanotubular connectivity layer in the brain, extending neuronal communication beyond classical synapses.},

REPAIRome offers insights into DNA repair mechanisms, enhances gene-editing precision, and explains the mutation patterns observed in cancer. In addition to being a tool for specialists in DNA repair, gene editing, or cancer evolution, this resource enables any researcher to explore whether a gene of interest affects DNA repair. —Di Jiang The analysis of DNA sequence outcomes provides molecular insights into double-strand break (DSB) repair mechanisms. Using parallel in-pool profiling of Cas9-induced insertions and deletions (indels) within a genome-wide knockout library, we present a comprehensive catalog that assesses the influence of nearly every human gene on DSB repair outcomes. This REPAIRome resource uncovers uncharacterized mechanisms, pathways, and factors involved in DSB repair, including opposing roles for XLF and PAXX, a molecular explanation for Cas9-induced multinucleotide insertions, HLTF functions in Cas9-induced DSB repair, the involvement of the SAGA complex in microhomology-mediated end joining, and an indel mutational signature linked to VHL loss, renal carcinoma, and hypoxia.

  abstract     = {Eukaryotic DNA is packaged as chromatin, the basic unit of which is the nucleosome, around which about 150 base pairs of DNA are wrapped, limiting its accessibility. Chromatin remodelers mobilize nucleosomes to regulate replication and transcription. Moore et al . studied two major remodelers, ACF and RSC, in crowded chromatin by recreating phase-separated chromatin droplets in vitro. They found that both remodelers could enter and mobilize nucleosomes within droplets, but only RSC decompacted chromatin and increased droplet mobility. This decompaction likely enhances DNA accessibility in cells. Their findings suggest that remodelers differ in biological importance depending on their capacity to mobilize and decompact compacted chromatin. —Di Jiang Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes mobilize nucleosomes, but how such mobilization affects chromatin condensation is unclear. We investigate effects of two major remodelers, ACF and RSC, using chromatin condensates and single-molecule footprinting. We find that both remodelers inhibit the formation of condensed chromatin. However, the remodelers have distinct effects on preformed chromatin condensates. ACF spaces nucleosomes without decondensing the chromatin, explaining how ACF maintains nucleosome organization in transcriptionally repressed genomic regions. By contrast, RSC catalyzes ATP-dependent decondensation of chromatin. RSC also drives micron-scale movements of entire chromatin condensates. These additional activities of RSC may contribute to its central role in transcription. The biological importance of remodelers may thus reflect both their effects on nucleosome mobilization and the corresponding consequences on chromatin dynamics at the mesoscale.},

  abstract     = {Despite the ubiquitousness of lithium-ion intercalation batteries, there are still many open questions about the relationship between ion and electron transfer. Zhang et al . present a combined experimental and modeling study examining the fundamental mechanisms of lithium-ion intercalation into battery cathodes by analyzing current-voltage responses at small overpotentials (see the Perspective by Warburton). A key finding was the close agreement between the experiments and coupled ion–electron transfer theory rate expressions. The authors concluded that the reaction-limited current in lithium-ion batteries is associated with the lithium-ion vacancy fraction, in conjunction with temperature and electrolyte effects, thus providing a pathway for designing lithium-ion battery interfaces. —Marc S. Lavine The underlying reaction mechanism in lithium-ion batteries remains poorly understood. We provide experimental and theoretical evidence that lithium intercalation occurs by coupled ion-electron transfer, where ion transfer across the electrode-electrolyte interface is facilitated by electron transfer to a neighboring redox site. Electrochemical measurements for a variety of common electrode and electrolyte materials reveal a universal dependence of the (de-)intercalation rate on Li + vacancy fraction, as well as temperature and electrolyte effects consistent with the theory, which could be used to guide the molecular design of lithium-ion battery interfaces.},

  abstract     = {Macroscopic crystallization of boria (B 2 O 3 ) occurs only under applied pressure. However, Zio et al . showed that a two-dimensional crystalline B 2 O 3 polymorph can grow on a platinum surface through elemental deposition. Large-scale scanning tunneling microscopy revealed that the B 2 O 3 monolayer had a honeycomb structure with high degree of crystallinity. This layer formed from boroxol (B 3 O 3 ) groups and had minimal interaction with the substrate, as confirmed by density functional theory. Boroxol groups are not constituents of the two known macroscopic crystalline phases, although their presence as nanodomains in boria glass has been inferred. —Phil Szuromi Diboron trioxide (B 2 O 3 ) represents an unusual case among polymorphic oxides, because its vitrified state features superstructural units—planar boroxol groups—that are never observed in its three-dimensional crystalline polymorphs. Crystalline polymorphs that incorporate boroxol groups have only been predicted theoretically, although their formation is crucial to rationalize the ability of B 2 O 3 to vitrify. Here we present the synthesis of a two-dimensional crystalline B 2 O 3 polymorph constituted by boroxol groups arranged in an atomically thin honeycomb lattice. By combining surface science experimental techniques with ab initio calculations, we characterize the structural and electronic properties of this B 2 O 3 polymorph down to the atomic level. This discovery enlarges the family of two-dimensional materials and enables the atomic tracking of individual structural units in trioxides.},

  abstract     = {One way in which companies and governments can limit potentially harmful biological research is by restricting the commercial synthesis of DNA that encodes particular proteins or is from select pathogens. However, screening methods are not necessarily designed to detect engineered sequences. Wittmann et al . worked with four commercial DNA synthesis companies to stress test and develop patches for screening methods to greatly improve their ability to identify sequences that should be restricted. Their results demonstrate that proteins of concern can be flagged by updated software even if their sequences have been altered using protein design methods. —Michael A Funk Advances in artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted protein engineering are enabling breakthroughs in the life sciences but also introduce new biosecurity challenges. Synthesis of nucleic acids is a choke point in AI-assisted protein engineering pipelines. Thus, an important focus for efforts to enhance biosecurity given AI-enabled capabilities is bolstering methods used by nucleic acid synthesis providers to screen orders. We evaluated the ability of open-source AI-powered protein design software to create variants of proteins of concern that could evade detection by the biosecurity screening tools used by nucleic acid synthesis providers, identifying a vulnerability where AI-redesigned sequences could not be detected reliably by current tools. In response, we developed and deployed patches, greatly improving detection rates of synthetic homologs more likely to retain wild type–like function.},

For quantum communication applications, one of the most desirable properties would be operation at telecommunication wavelengths. Weiss et al . have introduced a spin qubit based on an engineered organo-erbium molecule platform. They demonstrated addressability of the spin of the molecule with light at telecommunication wavelengths and verified the quantum behavior. This synthetic molecular approach to designing qubits is promising for achieving targeted performance for required applications. —Ian S. Osborne Optically addressable electronic spins in polyatomic molecules are a promising platform for quantum information science, with the potential to enable scalable qubit design and integration through atomistic tunability and nanoscale localization. However, optical state- and site-selection are an open challenge. In this work, we introduce an organo-erbium spin qubit in which narrow (megahertz-scale) optical and spin transitions couple to provide high-resolution access to spin degrees of freedom with telecommunication-frequency light. This spin-photon interface enables demonstration of optical spin polarization and readout that distinguishes between spin states and magnetically inequivalent sites in a molecular crystal. Operation at frequencies compatible with mature photonic and microwave devices provides an opportunity for engineering scalable, integrated molecular spin-optical quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {The Otophysan suborder contains nearly 70% of all freshwater fish species, many of which are quite familiar, such as carp, catfish, and eels. It had been believed that this group originated in fresh water before the breakup of Pangea. However, after analyzing a recently discovered Late Cretaceous fossil, Liu et al . concluded that this group first evolved in a marine environment and later colonized fresh water multiple separate times. Furthermore, the fossil informs on the evolution of the group’s Weberian hearing apparatus, suggesting that it was associated with freshwater adaptations. —Sacha Vignieri Otophysans, known for their enhanced hearing enabled by the complex Weberian apparatus, comprise two-thirds of extant freshwater fish species. Previously, they were thought to have originated in fresh water before the breakup of Pangea, implying a nearly 80-million-year gap between the origin and oldest known fossil. However, the discovery of a Late Cretaceous freshwater otophysan challenges this view. Integrating fossil, morphological, and genomic data, we estimate a younger crown group origin of ~154 million years ago. Notably, ancestral range and habitat reconstructions indicate marine origins for the otophysan crown groups, with at least two transitions to fresh water. Functional simulations of the Weberian ossicles of this fossil suggest that the distinctive hearing capabilities of otophysans evolved in conjunction with fusion of hearing ossicle parts and freshwater adaptations.},

  abstract     = {Many cold-adapted plants will either need to expand their ranges or genetically adapt to the warming temperatures caused by climate change. Fior et al . assembled a draft genome of the alpine wood pink ( Dianthus sylvestris ) and looked for signatures of selection in high- and low-elevation populations. They identified the gene DsCEN/2 , the two main haplotypes of which determine flowering time and segregate at different frequencies between low- and high-elevation populations. The low-elevation haplotype seems to have arisen during range expansion to warmer valleys during the Last Glacial Maximum. Given its fitness benefits to larger plants in warm conditions, this haplotype will likely increase in frequency in high-elevation populations with future temperature increases. —Corinne Simonti Adaptive evolution is key for species to persist in a warming climate. However, how adaptive genetic variants arise and shape both past and future evolutionary trajectories remains largely unknown. In this work, we integrate genomics with functional and ecological assays to unravel the evolutionary history and adaptive potential of alleles governing adaptation to climate through flowering time in an Alpine carnation. We reveal that “warm” and “cold” alleles of the flowering inhibitor CENTRORADIALIS ( DsCEN/2 ) originated through recombination of highly divergent haplotypes during the carnation radiation, implicating ancestral variation in seeding climate-adaptive alleles. These alleles survived in glacial refugia before mediating the species’ range expansion in response to postglacial warming. We predict that, by recapitulating past evolution, warm alleles will continue to facilitate adaptation under future climate change.},

Cunningham et al . examined data about the global distribution, frequency, and associated climate conditions of the most lethal and costly wildfire disasters from 1980 to 2023, finding that disaster risk was highest in regions near relatively affluent, populated areas, and that the frequency of economically disastrous wildfires increased sharply after 2015. They also found that major disasters coincided with extreme climatic conditions. —Jesse Smith Climate change and land mismanagement are creating increasingly fire-prone built and natural environments. However, despite worsening fire seasons, evidence is lacking globally for trends in socially and economically disastrous wildfires, partly due to sparse systematic records. Using a 44-year dataset (1980 to 2023) we analyze the distribution, trends, and climatic conditions connected with the most lethal and costly wildfires. Disastrous wildfires occurred globally over this period but were concentrated in the Mediterranean and temperate conifer biomes. Disaster risk was highest where highly energetic daily fire events intersected affluent, populated areas. Economic disasters increased sharply from 2015 onward, with 43% of the 200 most damaging events occurring in the last decade. Disasters coincided with increasingly extreme climatic conditions, highlighting the urgent need to adapt to a more fire-prone world.},
