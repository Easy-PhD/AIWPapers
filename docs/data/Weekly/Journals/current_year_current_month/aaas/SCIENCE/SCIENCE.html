  abstract     = {Traditionally, medicine has focused on treating disease after symptoms become apparent. Similarly, in patients with chronic diseases, treatment is usually updated in response to breakthrough symptoms or exacerbations. The rare exception to this approach is diabetes, for which continuous glucose monitors provide real-time information about the patient’s physiological state, allowing for rapid intervention. In a Review, Donnelly et al . discuss other diseases that may be amenable to continuous monitoring, such as cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders, and the technologies being developed to achieve this approach, such as monitoring of key protein concentrations. Depending on the state of clinical science for specific medical conditions, monitoring may be used to tailor lifestyle modifications, optimize clinical treatment, or advance research into the pathogenesis of various disease types. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Continuous biomarker monitoring is revolutionizing chronic disease management, with glucose monitoring for diabetes as the primary example. Given the success of this approach, a transition to continuous protein monitoring (CPM, a real-time, implantable or wearable technology) could similarly advance precision medicine. In this work, we review state-of-the-art CPM platforms and their prospective clinical impact across both chronic disorders—metabolic, cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative—and acute crises, such as sepsis and transplant dysfunction. We also highlight remaining barriers to widespread adoption, including sensor stability, robust machine learning models for live interpretation, and responsible data handling for patient privacy. With continued engineering and clinical validation, emerging biosensor technologies could transform disease management, facilitating earlier interventions and individualizing treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes.},

Zik et al . developed dual-transposon sequencing, a high-throughput method to systematically uncover genetic interactions. This approach uses the Cre-lox system to fuse two DNA barcodes identifying random transposon insertions within a single cell. Sequencing these recombined barcodes enabled parallel fitness assessment of millions of double mutants. Applied to Streptococcus pneumoniae , this revealed functions for previously uncharacterized genes across diverse biological pathways. This method offers a powerful tool to explore the vast genetic “dark matter” in microorganisms. —Di Jiang Gene redundancy complicates systematic characterization of gene function as single-gene deletions may not produce discernible phenotypes. We report dual transposon sequencing (dual Tn-seq), a platform for assaying the fitness of a comprehensive double mutant pool in parallel. Dual Tn-seq couples random barcode transposon site sequencing with the Cre- lox system, enabling deep sampling of 73% of the 1.3 million possible double gene deletions in Streptococcus pneumoniae . The genetic interactions identified span a wide range of biochemical processes, revealing new factors in presumably well-studied pathways, exemplified by a cytidine triphosphate synthase PyrJ. Moreover, this approach should permit further investigation of growth condition–specific genetic interactions. Because dual Tn-seq does not require the construction of a large array of single mutants, it should be readily adaptable to various microorganisms.},

  abstract     = {In eukaryotic cells, transcription and RNA splicing are tightly linked, but how these processes are coordinated remains unclear. Shao et al . found that the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal domain was not required for recruiting splicing factors during co-transcriptional splicing. Instead, the Pol II subunit RPB9 directly interacted with the splicing factor U2AF1, whereas U2AF2 operated independently. There is thus a dynamic “U2AF cycle” that separates splicing into two phases: an early Pol II–dependent phase and a later Pol II–independent phase. These findings reshape our understanding of how splicing is regulated during transcription, with implications for gene expression and disease mechanisms. —Di Jiang Distinguishing functional splice sites from abundant cryptic sites in precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) represents a fundamental challenge in decoding mammalian genomes. We demonstrate that the specific RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit RPB9 directly interacts with the 3′ AG dinucleotide binding factor U2AF1 to initiate 3′ splice site recognition. Combined with recent structural insights into Pol II–mediated 5′ splice site selection, these findings support a cotranscriptional mechanism to recognize paired 3′ and 5′ splice sites across individual exons. These initial exon definition events facilitate the recruitment of U2AF2 to heterodimerize with U2AF1, which also triggers U2AF1 release from elongating Pol II. Collectively, these results reveal dynamic U2AF cycling that partitions Pol II subunit–facilitated splice site recognition and subsequent Pol II–independent spliceosome assembly steps during cotranscriptional splicing.},

Hülse and Ridgwell report model results showing how high rates of organic carbon burial caused by elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, climate-sensitive phosphorous mineral weathering, and phosphate regeneration from marine sediments can turn warming events into ice ages. The juxtaposition of these conditions might help to explain the origins of past “snowball” climates such as those seen in the Neoproterozoic. —Jesse Smith Negative feedback between climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), mediated by the weathering of silicate minerals on land, is thought to provide the primary regulation of Earth’s climate on geological timescales. By contrast, we found that faster feedbacks involving organic matter are not only critical to Earth system recovery but can also create unexpected instability. Our Earth system model experiments show how sedimentary organic carbon burial, amplified by redox-sensitive phosphorus regeneration, can outweigh silicate weathering and paradoxically drive climate overcooling in response to massive CO 2 release. This instability depends on the initial balance between silicate weathering and organic carbon burial in addition to the state of global phosphorus cycling. It is most strongly expressed at intermediate ocean redox states, which may help us understand the timing of past ice ages.},

  abstract     = {Like leafcutter ants, fungus-farming termites ( Odontotermes obesus ) form a symbiotic relationship with a fungus ( Termitomyces ) that serves as a stable food source. An unknown feature of this relationship is how the termites prevent the nutritional “combs” they produce from being overtaken by other fungi such as filamentous Pseudoxylaria , which have been observed to overtake combs when termites are experimentally removed. Panchal et al . observed termites removing Pseudoxylaria and covering them with soil boluses, and fully encasing Pseudoxylaria successfully prevented its infection of combs (see the Perspective by Goes and Adams). Further experiments showed that soil boluses are effective because of the fungistatic properties of bacteria associated with the termites, which the termites selectively apply to the “weedy,” but not the crop, fungus. —Bianca Lopez The symbiotic agriculture of fungus-farming termites can collapse if they fail to prevent invading weeds. Previous studies suggest a role for symbiotic fungistatic microbes in bringing about weed control. However, how termites employ these microbes to suppress fungal weeds without affecting the fungal cultivar remains unknown. We show that the fungus-farming termite Odontotermes obesus uses specific behaviors to remove, isolate, and suppress the growth of the fungal weed Pseudoxylaria , primarily by encasing it with soil boluses containing fungistatic microbes. These behaviors efficiently suppress the weed without affecting the crop. This integration of specific behaviors with termite-derived microbes appears to be the proximate mechanism of how microbes are topically used by termites to confine the weed while keeping the crop unaffected.},

  abstract     = {For earthquake warnings, each second counts toward characterizing a fault’s rupture. Ruptures from large earthquakes, particularly those offshore, may have varying speed profiles that can only be resolved by dense arrays. In 2022, Atterholt et al . deployed a distributed acoustic sensing array along a 15-kilometer-long coastal telecommunications fiber with channels every 5 meters (see the Perspective by Brodsky and Ruiz). The array provided a second-by-second recording of the 2024 moment magnitude 7 earthquake offshore of Mendocino, California. Beam-forming analysis of P-wave arrivals showed that 8 seconds after the earthquake, the rupture slowed when it encountered the Mendocino Triple Junction and then jumped to supershear velocity before moving onshore. —Angela Hessler Fault structure and rupture physics are deeply intertwined, and observations of this coupling are critical for understanding earthquake behavior. Rupture propagation is observable at fine scales using dense seismic networks. Fiber-optic sensing allows for long-term deployments of ultradense arrays that enable high-resolution measurements of infrequent, large earthquakes. We recorded the 2024 moment magnitude ( M w ) 7 Mendocino Fault earthquake with a nearby fiber-optic array and imaged its behavior with seismic beamforming. The rupture propagated to the east at subshear velocity; stagnated near the Mendocino Triple Junction, a zone of structural complexity; and subsequently transitioned to supershear velocity. The correlation between source physics and structure shows how lithospheric heterogeneity affects first-order characteristics of earthquake ruptures. Our results also demonstrate the potential for fiber-optic sensing to improve real-time estimation of key parameters for early warning.},

  abstract     = {In some model organisms, starvation is known to induce epigenetic changes that extend the life span of progeny of the hungry parent. Zhang et al . investigated the mechanism of these effects in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans (see the Perspective by Bohnert). Their studies implicated an enzyme, lysosomal lipase-like 4 (LIPL-4), in the process. From there, the authors pieced together parts of a pathway in which increased activity of LIPL-4 activated signaling in intestinal lysosomes led to increased transcription and production of a variant of histone H3.3. Protein-tagging experiments indicated that the histone could be transferred to the germline, where it was modified by a methyltransferase and transmitted to progeny, thus extending their life span. —L. Bryan Ray The epigenome is sensitive to metabolic inputs and is crucial for aging. Lysosomes act as a signaling hub to sense metabolic cues and regulate longevity. We found that lysosomal metabolic pathways signal through the epigenome to regulate transgenerational longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans . Activation of lysosomal lipid signaling and lysosomal adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) or reduction of lysosomal mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling increased the expression of a histone H3.3 variant and increased its methylation on K79, leading to life-span extension across multiple generations. This transgenerational prolongevity effect required intestine-to-germline transportation of histone H3.3 and a germline-specific H3K79 methyltransferase and was recapitulated by overexpressing H3.3 or the H3K79 methyltransferase. Thus, signals from a lysosome affect the epigenome and link the soma and germ line to mediate transgenerational inheritance of longevity.},

SRO in metals has been linked to properties of mechanical deformation, and in ceramics has been linked to properties related to diffusion. In semiconductors, the concept of SRO has only rarely been studied beyond theoretical predictions linking SRO to important changes in electronic band structure. Using energy-filtered electron microscopy and complementary simulations, Vogl et al . confirmed the presence of SRO in a germanium-silicon-tin semiconductor and identified the actual atomic structure of the SRO motifs. Their work explores an exciting area for understanding and controlling SRO in semiconductors. —Yury Suleymanov Chemical short-range ordering is expected to be a key factor for tuning the electronic structure of semiconductors. However, experimental evidence of short-range ordering is still lacking due to the challenge of characterizing atomic-scale ordering motifs. Here, we determined the presence of short-range order in a ternary GeSiSn semiconductor system using advanced energy-filtered four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy and large-scale atomistic models generated by a machine learning neuroevolution potential of first-principles accuracy. This approach revealed preferred ordering of different atomic species with the dominant occurrence of Si–Ge–Sn triplets.

They found that camouflage was more beneficial when it was rarely used by prey and in low-light environments, whereas warning coloration was less beneficial in high-predation environments, where competition between predators may motivate them to sample aposematic insects. This comparative analysis helps to explain the distribution and evolution of antipredator coloration. —Bianca Lopez Natural selection has repeatedly led to the evolution of two alternative antipredator color strategies—camouflage to avoid detection and aposematism to advertise unprofitability—but we lack understanding of how ecological context favors one strategy over the other. We conducted a globally replicated predation experiment at 21 sites on six continents to test how predator community, prey community, and visual environment influenced the predation risk of 15,018 artificial paper “moth” prey with cryptic or warning coloration. Results indicated that aposematic strategies fare better in environments with low predation intensity, whereas camouflage strategies are advantaged when other camouflaged prey species are rare and when light levels are low.

  abstract     = {Understanding the properties of a system requires making measurements of a variable and then using that information to piece together a detailed understanding. As the system becomes more complex, the number of required measurements increases exponentially, placing fundamental limits on obtaining that information using classical means. Liu et al . demonstrated a quantum learning advantage in an optical system using entangled photons as probes to reduce the sampling complexity of the process by more than 11 orders of magnitude compared with classical probes. This result highlights a route to quantum enhanced learning protocols for machine learning and developing quantum technologies. — Ian S. Osborne Recent advances in quantum technologies have demonstrated that quantum systems can outperform classical ones in specific tasks, a concept known as quantum advantage. Although previous efforts have focused on computational speedups, a definitive and provable quantum advantage that is unattainable by any classical system has remained elusive. In this work, we demonstrate a provable photonic quantum advantage by implementing a quantum-enhanced protocol for learning a high-dimensional physical process. Using imperfect Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen entanglement, we achieve a sample complexity reduction of 11.8 orders of magnitude compared to classical methods without entanglement. These results show that large-scale, provable quantum advantage is achievable with current photonic technology and represent a key step toward practical quantum-enhanced learning protocols in quantum metrology and machine learning.},

  abstract     = {It is now well known that there were at one time many Homo lineages. Understanding of the differences among these lineages is largely dependent upon crania that are rare and often damaged and deformed by age. Feng et al . reconstructed the 1-million-year-old Yunxian 2 cranium using an approach that allowed for removal of much of the compression and distortion naturally present in the fossil. In doing so, they found that the cranium contained both primitive and derived traits and concluded that it is representative of the H. longi clade, which is sister to H. sapiens and likely contained the Denisovans. —Sacha Vignieri Diverse forms of Homo coexisted during the Middle Pleistocene. Whether these fossil humans represent different species or clades is debated. The ~1-million-year-old Yunxian 2 fossil from China is important for understanding the cladogenesis of Homo and the origin of Homo sapiens . In this study, we restored and reconstructed the distorted Yunxian 2 cranium using recently introduced technology. The results show that this cranium displays mosaic primitive and derived features. Morphometric and phylogenetic analyses suggest that it is an early member of the Asian H. longi clade, which includes the Denisovans and is the main part of the sister group to the H. sapiens clade. Both the H. sapiens and H. longi clades have deep roots extending beyond the Middle Pleistocene and probably experienced rapid early diversification. Yunxian 2 may preserve transitional features close to the origins of the two clades.},

  abstract     = {Many species are declining, with lack of adequate habitat being a primary driver. Providing habitats in human-dominated landscapes is essential for maintaining populations and supporting ecosystem functions such as pollination, but habitat protection targets in such landscapes are poorly defined. Bishop et al . developed a framework to assess habitat needs based on the threshold at which populations respond more to increased habitat quality than quantity. They used a meta-analysis to define habitat quantity thresholds, using floral resources as a proxy for habitat quality, for insect pollinators (bumble bees, solitary bees, butterflies, and hoverflies) in agricultural landscapes. Hoverflies had a much lower threshold because of low habitat quality, and this framework could be adapted to guide targets for other taxa. —Bianca Lopez Biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes is declining, but evidence-based conservation targets to guide international policies for such landscapes are lacking. We present a framework for informing habitat conservation policies based on the enhancement of habitat quantity and quality and define thresholds of habitat quantity at which it becomes effective to also prioritize habitat quality. We applied this framework to insect pollinators, an important part of agroecosystem biodiversity, by synthesizing 59 studies from 19 countries. Given low habitat quality, hoverflies had the lowest threshold at 6% semi-natural habitat cover, followed by solitary bees (16%), bumble bees (18%), and butterflies (37%). These figures represent minimum habitat thresholds in agricultural landscapes, but when habitat quantity is restricted, marked increases in quality are required to reach similar outcomes.},

The authors found that the genomic sequences within the same “kinetic domain” came together rapidly (less than 1 minute on average), whereas sequences in distinct kinetic domains took much longer (minutes to hours). The rapid search with kinetic domains is dependent upon the motor protein cohesin, which can pull together distal points faster than diffusion. —Di Jiang Genome function requires regulated genome motion. However, tools to directly observe this motion in vivo have been limited in coverage and resolution. Here we introduce an approach to tile mammalian chromosomes with self-mapping fluorescent labels and track them at ultraresolution. We find that sequences separated by submegabase distances transition to proximity in tens of seconds. This rapid search is dependent on cohesin and is exhibited only within domains. Domain borders act as kinetic impediments to this search process, rather than structural boundaries. The genomic separation–dependent scaling of the search time for cis interactions violated predictions of diffusion, suggesting motor-driven folding. We also uncover cohesin-dependent processive motion at 2.7 kilobases per second. Together, these multiscale dynamics reveal the organization of the genome into kinetically associated domains.},

Indeed, using genetic data collected only once to calculate effective population size helped to improve their models over multiple species. Although genetic data can be expensive to collect, the fact that doing so only once improved predictions across several years demonstrates a potential benefit for such efforts in the future. —Corinne Simonti Species population sizes fluctuate over time, and these temporal dynamics play a key role in governing the maintenance of biodiversity. Although modeling approaches have been developed to characterize fluctuations in species abundances, the data required to parameterize these models from scratch are substantial. Here we introduce a new approach to modeling population fluctuations on decadal timescales by relating community-level dynamics to population-level patterns encoded in plant genomes. Using genomic samples taken at a single time point to generate contemporary effective population size estimates in a temperate montane forest, we accurately predict fluctuations across three censuses.

Despite high genetic diversity, the species shows stable but considerable continental population structure. Although one population showed little differentiation over a century and 4000 kilometers, nearby, we found two genetically distinct ecotypes.

  abstract     = {Genes are often controlled by enhancers located far away in the genome, but how their positioning affects gene activation is unclear. Eder et al . investigated how the position of the Sox2 gene influences activation by its enhancer. By systematically relocating reporter genes around the Sox2 locus, the authors found that Sox2 sits in an optimal “sweet spot” for activation and also restricts its enhancer’s reach. Removing Sox2 broadened and boosted enhancer-driven activation. This means that genes can act as gatekeepers, limiting their enhancers’ influence. Understanding these rules helps to explain gene regulation and may inform future genetic engineering or gene therapy strategies. —Di Jiang Genes are often activated by enhancers located at large genomic distances, and the importance of this positioning is poorly understood. By relocating promoter-reporter constructs into thousands of alternative positions within a single locus, we dissected the positional relationship between the mouse Sox2 gene and its distal enhancer. This revealed an intricate, sharply confined activation landscape in which the native Sox2 gene occupies an optimal position for its activation. Deletion of the gene relaxes this confinement and broadly increases reporter activity. The confining effect of the Sox2 gene is partially conferred by its ~1-kilobase coding region. Our local relocation approach provides high-resolution functional maps of a genomic locus and reveals that a gene can strongly constrain the realm of influence of its enhancer.},

General design strategies for electrode, electrolyte, and interphase are proposed to enable horizontally deposited metals with preferred crystallographic orientations and stable SEIs with distinct chemical compositions yet similar structural homogeneity.

Seismic monitoring of these changes has been limited to shallow depths, leaving an incomplete picture of the response-recovery cycles of fault zones. To look deeper into this, Bryan et al . applied optimal transport to receiver functions at broadband seismic stations for several years before and after the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes in California (see the Perspective by Rodriguez Padilla). After the events, seismic waves slowed throughout the crustal column, a sign of both shallow and deep damage. Recovery at shallow depths occurred within months, whereas deep damage persisted for at least several years after rupture. —Angela Hessler Earthquakes abruptly release tectonic stress that builds slowly over time through the coupled evolution of faults and the surrounding crust. Seismic wavespeeds track crustal deformation and stress changes, but typical monitoring methods are most sensitive to shallow depths. Using receiver functions, we tracked rupture-zone wavespeed and anisotropy changes throughout the crust during the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence. Shallow coseismic wavespeed reductions recovered within months, whereas a deeper postseismic wavespeed drop persisted without measurable recovery over several years. The deep, persistent wavespeed drop likely reflects accumulating damage driven by postseismic deformation, suggesting two possible scenarios: (i) a slow interseismic recovery where wavespeed and anisotropy track long-term stress evolution; or (ii) permanent deformation of an immature fault zone. Both scenarios affect the dynamics and energy budget of the seismic cycle.},

The authors also shared the results with these groups, which may help them be more aware of possible medical complications as some individuals move to urban centers. —Corinne Simonti The Turkana pastoralists of Kenya inhabit arid, water-limited environments and rely largely on livestock for subsistence. Working with Turkana communities, we sequenced 367 whole genomes and identified eight regions with evidence for recent positive selection. One of these regions includes a putative regulatory element for STC1 —a kidney-expressed gene involved in metabolism and the response to dehydration. We show that STC1 is induced by antidiuretic hormone in human cells, is associated with urea levels in the Turkana themselves, and is under strong and recent selection in this population as well as a second East African population, the Daasanach. This work highlights how integrating anthropological and genomic approaches can lead to a new understanding of human physiology with biomedical relevance.},

  abstract     = {An enduring challenge in organic chemistry is the selective synthesis of Z olefins, carbon-carbon double bonds with the largest substituents on each carbon oriented on the same side of the bond axis. Verardi et al . report a method that electrochemically replaces carbon-hydrogen bonds on olefins with sulfonium groups. Surprisingly, one of the groups then underwent elimination in a Z-selective manner. The other group could then be replaced with a versatile range of substituents that preserve the Z geometry. —Jake S. Yeston The stereoselective functionalization of C–H bonds represents a central challenge in modern organic synthesis. Despite decades of innovation in C–H activation chemistry, methods for Z -selective functionalization of alkenes have eluded synthetic practitioners. Terminal alkenes present the biggest challenge for Z -selectivity as they require selective cleavage of the more hindered of two otherwise virtually identical C–H bonds. Herein, we describe the transformation of alkenes into transient 1,2- bis -sulfonium intermediates found to undergo Z -selective elimination, overturning a textbook E2 stereoselectivity rule through stabilizing interactions. We identify paired electrolysis as an enabling strategy to both selectively generate the requisite bis -sulfonium intermediate and drive its rapid elimination in situ. The resultant Z -alkenyl sulfonium linchpins provide access to a wide array of Z -alkene targets from inexpensive feedstocks through robust cross-coupling reactions.},

  abstract     = {The maturity of experimental studies of nuclear magnetic resonance and the sophistication with which nuclear spins can be manipulated provided the first demonstration of a quantum computer platform. However, progress stalled early on when it was realized that scaling up was problematic. Stemp et al . now demonstrate direct entanglement between two nuclear spins that are separated by a relatively long distance. Two phosphorus atoms implanted in silicon formed a system comprising two 31 P nuclei and two bound electrons. Control of the exchange interaction between the two electrons resulted in quantum entanglement of the two nuclear spins. The results and scalability of the method are promising for the development of nuclear spin–based quantum computers. —Ian S. Osborne The use of nuclear spins for quantum computation is limited by the difficulty in creating genuine quantum entanglement between distant nuclei. Current demonstrations of nuclear entanglement in semiconductors rely on coupling the nuclei to a common electron, which is not a scalable strategy. In this work, we demonstrated a two-qubit controlled-Z logic operation between the nuclei of two phosphorus atoms in a silicon device, separated by up to 20 nanometers. Each atom binds separate electrons, whose exchange interaction mediates the nuclear two-qubit gate. We prepared and measured a nuclear Bell state with a fidelity of 76 − 5 + 5 % and a concurrence of 0.67 − 0.05 + 0.05 . With this method, future progress in scaling up semiconductor spin qubits can be extended to the development of nuclear spin–based quantum computers.},

  abstract     = {Rangelands provide livelihoods for billions of people but are being increasingly degraded. Overgrazing is often cited as a cause of this degradation, but the relative effects of grazing and climate change are poorly understood. Purevjav et al . designed a quasiexperimental study to disentangle the effects of climate and herd size on rangeland primary productivity in Mongolia, where livelihoods depend on rangelands and more than half of these rangelands are considered degraded. Although herd size had a negative effect on productivity, weather effects were much larger, particularly at decadal scales over which herders can adapt to changing conditions. These results suggest that policies limiting herd sizes may affect people without preventing rangeland degradation and support the need to curb climate change to protect ecosystems and livelihoods. —Bianca Lopez Rangelands are Earth’s dominant land type, supporting the livelihoods of more than 2 billion people. Concerns about rangeland degradation typically focus on overgrazing. But climate change may be a greater culprit. Using spatially disaggregated, nationwide data from Mongolia, from 1984 to 2024, we exploited seasonal variation in grazing locations to quasi-experimentally estimate the causal effects of livestock herd size, weather, and climate change on rangeland primary productivity. At interannual frequency, herd size modestly but significantly negatively affects primary productivity, with notable variation across ecological zones. The effects of weather fluctuations are, however, an order of magnitude larger. At the decadal scale, over which herders can adapt to climate change, herd size effects disappear, and temperature effects dominate. In Mongolia, climate change seems to drive most long-term change in rangeland primary productivity.},

In this case, knowledge of position was relaxed, resulting in a sharpening of the velocity distribution function. These results should allow quantum mechanical effects to be explored further in macroscopic systems and may find applications in advanced quantum sensing technologies. —Ian S. Osborne Manipulating the motion of macroscopic objects near their quantum mechanical uncertainties has been desired in diverse fields, including fundamental physics, sensing, and transducers. Despite progress in ground-state cooling of a levitated solid particle, realizing its nonclassical states has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate quantum squeezing of the motion of a single nanoparticle by rapidly varying its oscillation frequency. We reveal appreciable narrowing of the velocity variance to –4.9 ± 0.1 decibels of that of the ground state using free-expansion measurements. Our work shows that a levitated nanoparticle offers an ideal platform for studying nonclassical states of its motion and provides a route to developing applications in quantum sensing and exploring quantum mechanics at a macroscopic scale.},

How much and when that rain falls has major implications for the environment, agriculture, water supply, and river flow. Hill et al . found that although the well-documented effect of El Niño events is to decrease summer rainfall, it also paradoxically intensifies extreme daily precipitation amounts, thereby resulting in hazardous conditions across the region. The processes that create this intensification may be important in other tropical locations as well. —Jesse Smith Extreme rainfall during the Indian summer monsoon can be destructive and deadly to the world’s third-largest economy and most populous country. Although El Niño events in the equatorial Pacific are known to suppress total summer rainfall throughout India, we show using observational data spanning 1901 to 2020 that, counterintuitively, they simultaneously intensify extreme daily rainfall. This is partly driven by increases in extreme daily values of convective buoyancy, provided that both the undilute instability of near-surface air and the dilution by mixing with drier air above are considered. El Niño could plausibly drive similar changes in other tropical regions, and our framework could be further applied to changes in hourly extremes, to other internal variability modes, and to forced trends under climate change.},

Overlapping these data with the distribution of marine habitats and their vulnerabilities to stressors provides estimates of total impacts on ecosystems. Cumulative impacts are expected to double by midcentury, including in countries and coastal areas where people depend heavily on marine resources. Ocean warming and fisheries are two of the largest impacts, suggesting that curbing climate change and sustainable fisheries management could relieve stress on marine ecosystems. —Bianca Lopez Pressures from human activities are expected to increase substantially, affecting marine ecosystems globally. To plan for a sustainable future, we need to forecast the distributions of cumulative effects from multiple pressures. Here, we mapped (at 10-kilometer resolution) the future cumulative impacts of 10 climate, land-based, fishing, and other pressures on 20 marine habitats under two climate scenarios at mid-century (around 2050). We found that cumulative impacts are projected to increase 2.2 to 2.6 times globally, with coastal habitats facing higher impacts but offshore regions facing faster increases, especially in equatorial regions. Furthermore, many countries dependent on marine resources will have large increases in impacts. Incorporating these results into strategic policy and management will support more sustainable use and protection of marine ecosystems and the services they provide.},

Thus, the birds both understand the categories of their calls and create mental representations of their meaning, similar to what humans do. —Sacha Vignieri Vocal communication in social animals involves the production and perception of various calls that ethologists categorize into call types based on their acoustical structure and behavioral context. Whether these categories indicate distinct meanings for the animals remains unknown. The zebra finch, a gregarious songbird, uses ~11 call types that are known to communicate hunger, danger, or social conflict and to establish social contact and bonding. Using auditory discrimination tasks, we show that the birds both discriminate and categorize all the call types in their vocal repertoire. In addition, systematic errors were more frequent between call types used in similar behavioral contexts than could be expected from their acoustic similarity.

In a Review, Farrell and Soltesz focused on the role of overlooked areas and circuits within the hippocampus, the CA2 region, the indusium griseum, and the fasciola cinereum. They summarized recent findings on these neglected hippocampal regions and related circuits and provided original insights into brain functions relevant to behavior and neurological disorders. These findings extend the role of the hippocampus beyond the classic view. —Mattia Maroso Traditional views of hippocampal function are largely based on the canonical flow of information from the entorhinal cortex through the trisynaptic loop—comprising the dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis regions CA3 and CA1—and back to cortex, where the hippocampus plays an important role in transforming relevant information into a usable storage system. This classic circuit has inspired current thinking on hippocampal functions related to learning, memory, and spatial navigation, but the potential functional contributions of other hippocampal areas, such as CA2, the fasciola cinereum, and the indusium griseum, and their integration of a major hypothalamic input, have been overlooked. These understudied circuits and nontraditional network dynamics such as dentate spikes have recently begun to yield fresh insights into unconventional circuit computations that extend the repertoire of hippocampal function beyond current models.},

  abstract     = {Transcription factors (TFs) are traditionally categorized as activators or repressors, but this binary distinction oversimplifies their functional roles. In practice, many TFs activate some genes while repressing others, depending on the regulatory context. Parisutham et al . investigated how TF function relates to the basal activity of their target promoters and found a conserved pattern across multiple TFs. Rather than uniformly amplifying or silencing gene expression, TFs often buffer against perturbations, opposing changes in expression levels. This buffering behavior appears to be a general feature of TF regulation, highlighting its central role in maintaining homeostasis of gene expression. —Di Jiang Transcription factors (TFs) may activate or repress gene expression through an interplay of different mechanisms, including RNA polymerase (RNAP) recruitment, exclusion, and initiation. However, depending on the regulated promoter identity, TF function can vary, and the principles underlying this context dependence remain unclear. We demonstrate an inverse scaling relationship between the promoter’s basal activity and its regulation by a given TF. Specifically, activation is weaker and repression is stronger on stronger promoters. This scaling applies to both activators and repressors, which suggests a common underlying mechanism where TFs regulate expression by stabilizing RNAP binding at the promoter. The consequence of this relationship is that TFs buffer expression by affecting constant regulated expression levels across promoters of different basal activity, ensuring homeostatic control despite genetic or environmental changes.},

At the brain network level, the spatial navigation system, not the ventral visual stream as in primates, exhibited a robust preference for visual objects. At the brain region level, one of the top hits of the ultrasound screen was the postsubiculum, an area with many head direction cells. In recordings from postsubiculum cells in freely moving mice, visual objects boosted the firing rate of head direction cells, with preferred firing directions pointing toward the object, and decreased the firing of cells that encoded other head directions. —Peter Stern Animals use visual objects to guide navigation-related behaviors. However, visual object–preferring areas have yet to be described in the mouse brain, limiting our understanding of how visual objects affect spatial navigation system processing. Using functional ultrasound imaging, we identified brain areas that were preferentially activated by images of objects compared with their scrambled versions. Whereas visual cortex did not show a preference, areas associated with spatial navigation were preferentially activated by visual objects. Electrophysiological recordings in postsubiculum, the cortical head direction (HD) system hub, confirmed a preference for visual objects in both HD cells and fast-spiking interneurons. In freely moving animals, visual objects increased firing rates of HD cells aligned with a visual object but decreased activity in HD cells coding for other directions.},

However, this productivity is limited by the relative inefficiency of the primary carbon fixation enzyme Rubisco. Lu et al . introduced an additional metabolic pathway, the malyl-CoA glycerate (McG) cycle, into Arabidopsis thaliana . These plants convert a secondary product of Rubisco activity into acetyl coenzyme A, which can then feed into endogenous lipid synthesis pathways. Plants with the McG cycle had increased lipids, seed yield, and overall biomass. This work provides a proof of concept for enhancing carbon fixation and plant growth without the need to directly alter Rubisco performance. —Madeleine Seale Carbon fixation through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle accounts for the majority of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) uptake from the atmosphere. The CBB cycle generates C3 carbohydrates but is inefficient at producing acetyl–coenzyme A (CoA) (C2), which is the universal precursor for synthesizing lipids. In this work, we introduced in Arabidopsis thaliana a new-to-nature CO 2 fixing cycle, malyl-CoA-glycerate (McG) cycle, which together with the CBB cycle forms a dual-cycle CO 2 fixation system. This cycle can fix one additional carbon by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and convert the photorespiration product, glycolate, to acetyl-CoA. Plants with the McG cycle show enhanced protein abundance in their photosystems and enhanced photosystem II efficiency. McG plants had doubled CO 2 fixation rates under atmospheric CO 2 , increased lipid production, pronounced growth enhancement, and tripled the seed yield.},

Zelmanoff et al . investigated the role of oxytocin in modulating social behavior in mouse pups during separation and reunion with their mothers (see the Perspective by Bellone). Pups separated from their mothers produced more ultrasonic vocalizations upon reunion, and the effect was modulated by the activity of oxytocin-expressing neurons. Pharmacological and optogenetic inhibition of these neurons attenuated ultrasonic vocalizations, suggesting that oxytocin plays a major role in determining social behavior during development. —Mattia Maroso Oxytocin is essential in shaping social behavior across the lifespan. Although the role of oxytocin signaling in parental care has been widely investigated, little is known about its function in social behavior during early life. We studied the role of oxytocin in mouse pup social behavior during acute separation from the mother as well as upon reunion. The activity of oxytocin neurons was increased by acute maternal separation. Behaviorally, maternally separated pups emitted more ultrasonic vocalizations upon reunion, which were further modulated by nipple attachment behavior. These effects were attenuated by blocking the oxytocin receptor during maternal separation. Optogenetic silencing of oxytocin neurons during maternal separation disrupted vocal behavior during separation and reunion. Our findings reveal an important role of oxytocin in context-dependent vocal communication in mouse pups.},

  abstract     = {Land conversion not only reduces the total habitat available to other species, but it also fragments habitat into smaller and less-connected patches, thus supporting smaller and less-connected populations. Ecologists have developed various metrics capturing different aspects of habitat fragmentation, such as the number and size of habitat patches and their distribution across space. Zou et al . used remotely sensed data to quantify the degree of fragmentation of global forests from 2000 to 2020, comparing metrics focused on patch connectivity, aggregation, and structure. Measures incorporating habitat connectivity and aggregation suggested that more than half of global forests have become more fragmented over the past two decades. These changes suggest widespread forest degradation beyond the direct effects of habitat loss. —Bianca Lopez Habitat fragmentation, in which contiguous forests are broken into smaller, isolated patches, threatens biodiversity by disrupting species movement, shrinking populations, and altering ecosystem dynamics. Past assessments suggested declining global fragmentation, but they relied on structure-based metrics that overlook ecological connectivity. We analyzed global forest fragmentation from 2000 to 2020 using complementary metrics that captured patch connectivity, aggregation, and structure. Connectivity-based metrics revealed that 51 to 67% of forests globally—and 58 to 80% of tropical forests—became more fragmented, which is nearly twice the rate suggested by traditional structure-focused methods (30 to 35%). Aggregation-focused metrics confirmed increases in 57 to 83% of forests. Human activities such as agriculture and logging drive this change. Yet protected tropical areas saw up to an 82% reduction in fragmentation, underscoring the potential of targeted conservation.},

  abstract     = {Introgression has been extensively studied for its potential to introduce adaptive alleles into another population or species. Although hybridization has been historically documented more often in plants, the relative rates of introgression in animals and plants have been difficult to quantify. Monnet et al . examined the relationship of introgression with genetic divergence in 61 animal and 280 plant pairs (see the Perspective by Brandvain). They found that the likelihood of plants hybridizing dropped off after genetic divergence levels of 0.3% in plants (consistent across different plant types) compared with 1.8% in animals. These results suggest that barriers to hybridization may arise more quickly in plants, contrary to historical views. —Corinne Simonti Speciation, the process by which new reproductively isolated species emerge from ancestral populations, results from the gradual accumulation of barriers to gene flow within genomes. To date, the notion that interspecific genetic exchange (introgression) occurs more frequently between plant species than animals has gained a strong footing in scientific discourse. By examining the dynamics of gene flow across a continuum of divergence in both kingdoms, we observed the opposite relationship: Plants experience less introgression than animals at the same level of genetic divergence, suggesting that species barriers are established more rapidly in plants. This pattern raises questions about which differences in microevolutionary processes between plants and animals influence the dynamics of reproductive isolation establishment at the macroevolutionary scale.},

  abstract     = {Proton transfer is perhaps the most fundamental chemical reaction, underlying numerous more complex transformations in both biochemical and synthetic systems. The process often involves a network of numerous water molecules. To home in on the details in a well-controlled context, Rana et al . studied interconversion of two protonated isomers, or protomers, of 4-aminobenzoic acid in small water clusters. By measuring the kinetics of proton migration between nitrogen and oxygen sites with well-resolved spectroscopic signatures, the authors were able to establish precise benchmarks for future modeling. —Jake S. Yeston Isolated cluster systems can help to elucidate the molecular level description of water-mediated proton transfer. Protonation of neutral 4-aminobenzoic acid (4ABA) occurs at the acid ( O -protomer) and amine ( N -protomer) functionalities, yielding two distinct species with relative energies dependent on the degree of hydration. Here, we measured the rates of intramolecular proton transfer in 4ABAH + ·(H 2 O) 6 ions upon protomer-selective vibrational excitation of initially cold (6 K) cluster ions isolated in a cryogenic ion trap. Interconversion rates were observed on the microsecond time scale. These results quantify the kinetics of proton transfers in the context of a closed, finite system at well-defined internal energies and therefore provide experimental benchmarks for theoretical efforts that are being developed to treat relatively slow, highly cooperative solvent-mediated chemical processes.},

  abstract     = {One could be excused for assuming that wildfires in the western US worsen air quality across the rest of the nation only due to smoke transport, but that would be incorrect. Instead, Ma et al . showed that extreme wildfires in the west actually reduce fine particle concentrations in the eastern US by an amount comparable to the increases that they cause in the west (see the Perspective by Qian). They attributed this unexpected effect to weakened eastward transport of fire smoke and enhanced wet removal of air pollutants caused by heat-induced convection from fires. This mechanism actually reduces deaths and economic losses nationwide. —Jesse Smith Conventional wisdom suggests that wildfires in the western United States (WUS) degrade air quality nationwide as a result of aerosol emissions and eastward transport. However, we found that heat produced by wildfires, a commonly neglected effect, can reduce fine particle concentrations (PM 2.5 ) in the eastern United States (EUS) by an amount comparable to the increases in the WUS during the fire season. This phenomenon arises from fire heat–induced convection in the WUS and subsequent downstream meteorological changes distant from fires. Enhanced wet deposition and weakened eastward transport of fire aerosols lower PM 2.5 levels in the EUS. Therefore, neglecting the effect of fire heat on PM 2.5 pollution leads to an overestimate of 1200 additional premature deaths and 3.3 billion USD in economic losses, particularly in the densely populated EUS.},

  abstract     = {Recent research has revealed a worrisome, and seemingly increasing, decline in insect populations globally. That said, not all species have been shown to be declining, and the reasons for the differences are not always clear. Liu et al . looked at ant species, using a community genetics approach, on remote Fijian islands to determine susceptibility to human impacts and disturbance. They found that endemic species and those most sensitive to habitat disturbance began to decline as long as 3000 years ago, with the first arrival of humans. More recent arrivals to the islands display more resistance, likely due to their more generalist requirements. —Sacha Vignieri Insect populations have declined worldwide, but the extent and drivers of these declines are debated. Most studies rely on field surveys performed in the past century, leaving gaps in our understanding of longer-term trends. Using a “community genomics” approach, we estimated community assembly over millions of years and more recent demographic trends of ant species in the Fijian archipelago. We found that 79% of endemic species are in decline, starting after the arrival of humans approximately 3000 years ago and accelerating in the past 300 years, whereas recent arrivals are expanding. The primary correlate of population decline among endemic species was found to be sensitivity to habitat disturbance. This study demonstrates the value of contemporary collections for estimating long-term community trends and highlights the vulnerability of endemic island species to anthropogenic change.},

  abstract     = {Wrapping of thin-film bioelectronic devices onto three-dimensional surfaces can lead to residual stress and device failure. Li et al . overcame this challenge by using droplets of water, water-gelatin mixtures, or buffer solutions as a dynamic lubricating layer to enable conformal wrapping of fragile, nonstretchable films onto intricate substrates such as skin, polymers, cells, and nerves. The droplet lets the device slide across the target substrate, allowing it to conform to the underlying shape. The authors demonstrated drop printing onto nerves and brain tissue, enabling light-controlled neuromodulation. —Marc S. Lavine Bioelectronic interfaces demonstrate promising applications in health monitoring, medical treatment, and augmented reality. However, conformally wrapping these film devices onto three-dimensional surfaces often leads to stress-induced damage. We propose a “drop-printing” strategy that enables damage-free film transfer using a droplet. The droplet acts as a lubricating layer between the film and the target surface, facilitating local sliding during shape-adaptive deformation. This mechanism prevents in-plane film stretching and reduces stress concentration. Even nonstretchable and fragile films can be intactly and accurately wrapped onto delicate surfaces, such as microscale microorganisms and optical fibers. Two-micrometer-thick silicon films, without any stretchable engineering, can form conformal neural-electronic interfaces by being drop-printed on nerves and brain tissue. The interfaces achieve light-controlled in vivo neuromodulation with high spatiotemporal resolution.},

  abstract     = {Coordination of carbon monoxide (CO) to transition metals is a central feature of organometallic chemistry. The twofold bonding motif simultaneously involves electron donation from carbon to the metal and back-bonding from the metal to the carbon. The electronic structure of metals outside of the transition block of the periodic table is less susceptible to this motif, and such metals therefore do not tend to bind CO. Dietz et al . now report the surprising isolation of a (diboryl)tin–CO complex produced below 0°C. Upon warming, the complex rearranges to a tin carbene through migration of both boryl ligands. —Jake S.

Here, we report an isolable, crystalline main-group metal carbonyl complex and its isomerization to a carbene-stabilized metal atom. The stannylene (Boryl) 2 Sn [where Boryl is B(NDippCH) 2 ] coordinates CO reversibly, affording an isolable adduct below 0°C, which was characterized by x-ray crystallography.

  abstract     = {Misregulation of members of the small guanosine triphosphatase RAS family leads to cancer and other human diseases. One way in which RAS proteins are regulated is through controlled degradation. The substrate adaptor protein Leucine Zipper-like Transcription Regulator 1 (LZTR1) couples RAS proteins to a ubiquitin ligase, and then ubiquitination leads to their degradation. Mutations in LZTR1 are also associated with human diseases. Dharmaiah et al . used crystal structures to define the interaction of LZTR1-binding domains with various RAS proteins. Their results help to explain the effects of disease-causing mutations in LZTR1 and also provide clues for strategies to develop glue-like therapeutic molecules that could target oncogenic RAS proteins to LZTR1-dependent degradation. —L. Bryan Ray The RAS family of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) are tightly regulated signaling molecules that are further modulated by ubiquitination and proteolysis. Leucine Zipper-like Transcription Regulator 1 (LZTR1), a substrate adapter of the Cullin-3 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase, binds specific RAS GTPases and promotes their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We present structures of LZTR1 Kelch domains bound to RIT1, MRAS, and KRAS, revealing interfaces that govern RAS isoform selectivity and nucleotide specificity. Biochemical and structural analyses of disease-associated Kelch domain mutations revealed three types of alterations: impaired substrate interaction, loop destabilization, and blade-blade repulsion. In cellular and mouse models, mutations disrupting substrate binding phenocopied LZTR1 loss, underscoring its substrate specificity. These findings define RAS recognition mechanisms by LZTR1 and suggest a molecular glue strategy to degrade oncogenic KRAS.},

Ngou et al . analyzed thousands of plant pattern recognition receptors and identified distantly related receptors with similar ligand-binding regions that convergently evolved to detect bacterial cold shock proteins. By identifying key features of the protein required for binding and altering critical amino acids, the authors engineered receptor proteins with an expanded repertoire of cold shock proteins. The research demonstrates a pipeline for the discovery and optimization of immune recognition mechanisms by using information from diverse species and systems. —Madeleine Seale Plants deploy a diverse array of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which perceive microbe-associated molecular patterns to activate immune responses. Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase subgroup XII (LRR-RLK-XII) represents one of the largest PRR families owing to lineage-specific diversification. Through bioinformatics and synthetic biology approaches, we characterized LRR-RLK-XIIs from 285 plant species and identified a receptor, “SCORE,” that perceives cold shock protein (CSP) peptides. SCORE orthologs from multiple angiosperm lineages exhibit CSP recognition polymorphisms, indicating recurrent selection for pathogen recognition through substitutions at key amino acid residues. Through functional phylogenomics and protein structure predictions, we engineered SCORE variants capable of detecting multiple phytopathogen CSP peptides, thus revealing the diverse PRR recognition landscape in plants. Our strategy holds promise for engineering plant immune receptors, particularly for perennial crops.},

  abstract     = {Neurogenetics has identified many distinct types of inhibitory interneurons. However, how this interneuron diversity contributes to network functions remains elusive. Valero et al . identified the distinct properties of optogenetically identified pyramidal cells and members of the major interneuron families (see the Perspective by Craig and González-Rueda). These properties include their firing rate statistics in different brain states and their contributions to various population activities. Using the electrophysiological fingerprints of this dataset, the researchers trained a machine learning algorithm to infer the different neuronal types in large-scale recordings and then constructed a connectivity graph of these major cell types through targeted optogenetic stimulations and functional connectivity analysis. These findings highlight the crucial role of cooperative interactions between interneuron types in the hippocampal network and demonstrate that such interaction is fundamental for the hippocampal cognitive map. —Peter Stern Identifying the computational roles of different neuron families is crucial for understanding neural networks. Most neural diversity is embodied in various types of γ-aminobutyric acid–mediated (GABAergic) interneurons, grouped into four major families. We collected datasets of opto-tagged neurons from all four families, along with excitatory neurons, from both the neocortex and hippocampus. The physiological features of these neurons were used to train a machine learning classifier, which subsequently inferred specific interneuron families in large-scale recordings. This combined approach enabled the reconstruction of synaptic connectivity motifs across interneuron family members. We further showed that these motifs differentially control the place field features of pyramidal neurons. Our findings attribute a prominent role to interneurons in the formation of a flexible cognitive map.},

Zhang et al . investigated the relationship between PM 2.5 , an index of particle pollution, and the development of Lewy body dementia (LBD), the second most common form of dementia. Epidemiological data showed that PM 2.5 exposure was associated with an increased risk of developing LBD. In mice, nasal administration of PM 2.5 led to brain atrophy due to the accumulation of pathological α-synuclein, loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and impaired cognition and motor function. The results identify a potential mechanistic link between air pollution and the development of dementia. —Mattia Maroso Evidence links air pollution to dementia, yet its role in Lewy body dementia (LBD) remains unclear. In this work, we showed in a cohort of 56.5 million individuals across the United States that fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) exposure raises LBD risk. Mechanistically, we found that PM 2.5 exposure led to brain atrophy in wild-type mice, an effect not seen in α-synuclein (αSyn)–deficient mice. PM 2.5 exposure generated a highly pathogenic αSyn strain, PM 2.5 –induced preformed fibril (PM-PFF), with enhanced proteinase K resistance and neurotoxicity, resembling αSyn LBD strains. PM 2.5 samples from China, the United States, and Europe consistently induced proteinase-resistant αSyn strains and in vivo pathology. Transcriptomic analyses revealed shared responses between PM 2.5 -exposed mice and LBD patients, underscoring PM 2.5 ’s role in LBD and stressing the need for interventions to reduce air pollution and its associated neurological disease burden.},

  abstract     = {The gut maintains its health by constantly renewing its inner lining, balancing cell production with the removal of cells through a process called extrusion. Krueger et al . found that extrusion is regulated by mechanical forces between cells. Cells are interconnected in a network that enables them to pull on their neighbors, creating a physical competition in a cellular tug-of-war. This way, cells test their mechanical strength relative to one another, and those that find themselves weaker extrude from the tissue while stronger cells remain. By removing unfit cells, this process safeguards the intestinal barrier and promotes homeostasis. —Stella M. Hurtley Cell extrusion is essential for homeostatic self-renewal of the intestinal epithelium. Extrusion is thought to be triggered by crowding-induced compression of cells at the intestinal villus tip. In this study, we found instead that a local “tug-of-war” competition between contractile cells regulated extrusion in the intestinal epithelium. We combined quantitative live microscopy, optogenetic induction of tissue tension, genetic perturbation of myosin II activity, and local disruption of the basal cortex in mouse intestines and intestinal organoids. These approaches revealed that a dynamic actomyosin network generates tension throughout the intestinal villi, including the villus tip region. Mechanically weak cells unable to maintain this tension underwent extrusion. Thus, epithelial barrier integrity depends on intercellular mechanics.},

Wyatt et al . synthesized 40 MAX materials (where M is a transition metal, A is a group 13 or 14 element, and X is either C or N) using 2 to 9 M elements. They were able to quantify the impact of entropy versus enthalpy on the resulting structure and properties. Enthalpy-driven short-range order persisted until configurational entropy became sufficiently large to randomize metal configurations. Compositional disorder in the precursor phases directly influenced the surface terminations (–O, –OH, and –F) and electronic properties when converted to MXenes. —Marc S. Lavine In compositionally complex materials, there is controversy on the effect of enthalpy versus entropy on the structure and short-range ordering in so-called high-entropy materials. To help address this controversy, we synthesized and probed 40 M 4 AlC 3 layered carbide phases containing two to nine metals and found that short-range ordering from enthalpy was present until the entropy increased enough to achieve complete disordering of the transition metals in their atomic planes. We transformed all of these layered carbide phases into two-dimensional (2D) sheets and showed the effects of the order versus disorder on their surface properties and electronic behavior. This study suggests the key effect that the competition between enthalpy and entropy has on short-range order in multicompositional materials.},

One less-explored component of this limb is the presence of either nails, as in primates, or claws, as in predators and diggers. Missagia et al . looked at different types of rodents, which vary with regard to this feature, some bearing a claw on their “thumb” and others a nail. The researchers concluded that the ancestral condition was the presence of a nail, which facilitated rodents’ well-known dexterous handling of food. Only species that evolved to dig or lost this handling acquired a claw. —Sacha Vignieri The unguis (hoof, claw, or nail) of the first digit (D1, also known as the thumb or pollex) of the tetrapod hand exhibits numerous functional adaptations, but its macroevolutionary association with ecological diversity is unknown. Across Rodentia, we find that most extant genera and ancestral lineages bear D1 nails. Exceptions follow structure-function associations that arose independently multiple times, specifically, the gain of D1 claws with subterranean habits and the loss of D1 ungues with oral-only feeding behavior. We hypothesize that early acquisition of D1 nails and manually dexterous food handling was crucial for rodents to adaptively leverage cranial specializations for efficient gnawing and thereby exploit hard seeds and nuts, a niche that they dominated after the extinction of multituberculates.

  abstract     = {Despite decades of research advances and improved clinical outcomes, cardiovascular disease is still the most common cause of death worldwide. A major cause of mortality after myocardial infarction are arrhythmias resulting from injury to the cardiac muscle. During an ischemic event such as myocardial infarction, neutrophils are recruited to the heart, and Kumowski et al . have uncovered a direct link between these neutrophils and subsequent arrhythmias (see the Perspective by Thorp). Using mouse models supported by human data, the authors determined that resistin-like molecule gamma (RELMγ) is highly expressed in neutrophils after myocardial infarction. In the heart, RELMγ damages the cell membrane of cardiomyocytes, promoting cell death directly and also causing ion leaks that disrupt the heart’s electrical activity and result in arrhythmias. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Ventricular tachycardia disrupts the heart’s coordinated pump function, leading to sudden cardiac death. Neutrophils, which are recruited in high numbers to the ischemic myocardium, promote these arrhythmias. Comparing neutrophils with macrophages, we found that resistin-like molecule γ ( Retnlg or RELMγ) was the most differentially expressed gene in mouse infarcts. RELMγ is part of a pore-forming protein family that defends the host against bacteria by perforating their membranes. In mice with acute infarcts, leukocyte-specific Retnlg deletion reduced ventricular tachycardia. RELMγ elicited membrane defects that allowed cell exclusion dyes to enter the cardiomyocyte interior and also caused delayed afterdepolarizations and later cardiomyocyte death, both of which are strong arrhythmogenic triggers. Human resistin likewise attacked membranes of liposomes and mammalian cells. We describe how misdirected innate immune defense produces membrane leaks and ventricular arrhythmia.},

Jin et al . now report a two-step procedure using near-ultraviolet light that first reduces the carbon dioxide to ethane and then uses a previously reported photocatalyst to oxidize the ethane to ethylene (see the Perspective by Cortés). The first step relies on a gold-titania catalyst that appears to activate hydrogen heterolytically upon photoirradiation, leading to highly selective reductive coupling of carbon dioxide. —Jake S. Yeston Producing olefins by carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) hydrogenation is a long-standing goal. The usual products are multicarbon mixtures because the critical step of heterolytic hydrogen (H 2 ) dissociation at high temperatures complicates selectivity control. In this study, we report that irradiating gold–titanium dioxide at 365 nanometers induces heterolytic H 2 dissociation at ambient temperature. This process likely relies on interfacial electric dipoles from photogenerated electrons and holes situated on the metallic gold nanoparticles and interfacial gold–oxygen–titanium scaffolds. The heterolytic H 2 dissociation is further promoted by light-induced coating of gold nanoparticles with a titanium oxide layer. The resulting nucleophilic hydrogen species reduce CO 2 to ethane in >99% yield under light irradiation in a flow apparatus. Furthermore, cascading with a subsequent photocatalytic ethane dehydrogenation generates ethylene in >99% yield over 1500 hours of irradiation.},

  abstract     = {Chiral nanohelices electrochemically synthesized from cobalt-iron nanoparticles can act as spin filters when aligned on magnetic substrates. Jeon et al . used chiral organic molecules and applied potentials to control the spiral direction and strand pitch during assembly in anodized aluminum oxide templates. Different handed helices showed opposite signs of electromotive force induction, and this effect served as a metric for chirality. —Phil Szuromi Chiral crystals with well-defined handedness in atomic arrangements exhibit properties such as spin selectivity, asymmetric magnetoresistance, and skyrmions. Although similar geometry-induced phenomena in chiral organic molecule-based systems were observed, synthesizing uniform inorganic nanostructures with desired chirality using a scalable method remains challenging. We electrochemically synthesized chiral ferromagnetic cobalt-iron nanohelices from nanoparticles in anodized aluminum oxide templates. The spiral directions and the number of strands were regulated by incorporating chiral molecules and applying an appropriate potential. We demonstrate the observation of Faraday’s law of induction at the nanoscale and show how chiral nanohelices regulate the electron flow direction. The implications of our findings extend to the technological realm, with chirality- and ferromagnetism-based spin-tunable devices.},

  abstract     = {Adamantane can adopt the same tetrahedral carbon skeleton as diamond. Fu et al . found that electron-beam irradiation of adamantane crystallites in a transmission electron microscope at low temperatures (296 to 100 K) and under vacuum conditions led to the activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. These conditions enabled the formation of carbon-carbon bonds to create a diamond lattice. —Phil Szuromi Diamond and adamantane ( Ad ) share a T d -symmetric carbon skeleton, but converting Ad to diamond has been challenging because it requires selective carbon-hydrogen (C–H) bond cleavage and monomer assembly into a diamond lattice. Our approach differs from the conventional high-temperature, high-pressure diamond syntheses. We electron-irradiated Ad submicrocrystals at 80 to 200 kilo–electron volts and 100 to 296 kelvin in vacuum for tens of seconds. This process yielded defect-free nanodiamonds (NDs) of cubic crystal structure, accompanied by hydrogen gas evolution. Time-resolved transmission electron microscopy revealed the initial formation of Ad oligomers transforming into spherical NDs. A sizable kinetic isotope effect indicates that C–H cleavage was rate-determining, and other hydrocarbons tested failed to form NDs.},

  abstract     = {Although both men and women can develop chronic kidney disease, women of reproductive age appear to be relatively protected. By studying mice and human kidney tissue and urine samples, Conte et al . determined that renal progenitor cells are responsive to female sex hormones, showing increased proliferation and differentiation into kidney podocytes in response to estrogen and progesterone at physiologically relevant concentrations. The same phenomenon played a key role in pregnancy-induced expansion of the podocyte population to accommodate the increased workload on the kidneys. Conversely, a failure of this adaptation contributed to preeclampsia and increased the risk of long-term kidney impairment in both mothers and offspring in mouse models, consistent with epidemiological data from humans. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich The global burden of kidney disease displays marked sexual dimorphism. Lineage tracing and single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that starting from puberty, estrogen signaling in female mice supports self-renewal and differentiation of renal progenitors to increase filtration capacity, reducing sensitivity to glomerular injury compared with that of males. This phenomenon accelerated as female kidneys adapted to the workload of pregnancy. Deletion of estrogen receptor α in renal progenitors disrupted this adaptation, leading to preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and increased maternal risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Offspring from affected mothers had fewer nephrons, resulting in early-life hypertension and greater susceptibility to kidney disease. These results highlight the fundamental role of kidney fitness and renal progenitors for pregnancy and preeclampsia and as a determinant of sexual dimorphism in kidney disease.},

  abstract     = {Gravitational wave detectors have revolutionized astrophysics by detecting black holes and neutron stars. Most signals are captured in the 30- to 2000-Hz range, and the lower 10- to 30-Hz band remains largely unexplored because of persistent low-frequency control noise that limits sensitivity. Enhancing this sensitivity could increase cosmological reach. Using nonlinear optimal control through reinforcement learning with a frequency-domain reward, Buchli et al . developed a method that effectively reduces control noise in the low-frequency band. This method was successfully implemented at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in Livingston and the Caltech 40 Meter Prototype, achieving control noise levels on LIGO’s most demanding feedback control loop below the quantum noise, thus removing a critical obstacle to increased detector sensitivity. —Yury Suleymanov Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers and binary black hole eccentricity and provide early warnings for multimessenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today’s mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10- to 30-hertz band by over 30x and up to 100x in subbands, surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future gravitational wave observatories and, more broadly, instrumentation and control systems.},

  abstract     = {Earthquakes can trigger silent slip and mud volcanoes, but rarely have the processes been observed together or at long distances. Bayramov et al . documented the flare-up of more than 50 mud volcanoes in the West Caspian Kura basin and substantial aseismic slip across seven faults immediately after the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquakes over 1000 kilometers away. Their findings suggest that seismic waves increased pore pressure in the basin, leading to regional inflation, mud volcano eruption, and reduced effective stress on faults. Faults in fluid-rich basins may thus be susceptible to far-reaching triggering by large earthquakes. —Angela Hessler Seismic waves from large earthquakes are known to trigger slip on distant faults, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar and local geodetic and seismic data, we show that the 1000-kilometer-distant, February 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes in southeastern Türkiye triggered deformation and/or eruption at 56 mud volcanoes and centimeter-scale aseismic slip on seven faults over tens of kilometers within the fluid-rich Kura Basin in the West Caspian region. This transient deformation event, with an equivalent moment magnitude of 6.1, was coupled with local inflation below major hydrocarbon fields. We postulate that seismic waves led to a change in pore pressure at depth, which in turn triggered aseismic slip along several crustal faults crossing the basin and its surroundings.},
