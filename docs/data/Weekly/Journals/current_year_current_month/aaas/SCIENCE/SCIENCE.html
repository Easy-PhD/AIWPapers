  abstract     = {Bacteria in the soil form complex communities, and some colonize the surfaces of roots. These bacteria are not uniformly distributed, however, and exhibit precise patterning around emerging lateral roots and early root differentiation zones. Tsai et al . established that the Casparian strip, an endodermal barrier around the root vasculature, is required for normal patterning of root bacteria (see the Perspective by Kozaeva and Brophy). At locations where the Casparian strip is absent, glutamine leaks from the vasculature and serves as an attractant for soil bacteria. Using precise spatial and temporal analysis, the authors provide insight into how bacteria around the root interact both with the plant and with each other. —Madeleine Seale Plant roots release exudates to encourage microbiome assembly, which influences the function and stress resilience of plants. How specific exudates drive spatial colonization patterns remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that endodermal Casparian strips—forming the root’s extracellular diffusion barrier—restrict nutrient leakage into the rhizosphere, coinciding with and controlling spatial colonization patterns of rhizobacteria. We find that vasculature-derived glutamine leakage is a major bacterial chemoattractant and enhancer of proliferation, defining a previously unknown pathway for root exudate formation. Bacteria defective in amino acid chemoperception display reduced attraction toward leakage sites, and roots with Casparian strip defects display bacterial overproliferation, dependent on bacterial capacity for amino acid metabolization. Associated chronic immune stimulation suggests that endodermal nutrient restriction is crucial for regulating microbial colonization and assembly, limiting excessive proliferation that could compromise plant health.},

  abstract     = {When cells experience a lack of amino acids, they initiate a stress response signaled by activations of the protein kinase GCN2. Zhou et al . used an in vitro translation system to refine our understanding of how this activation of GCN2 occurs. In their experiments, the critical factor appeared to be the collision of ribosomes that occurs when aminoacyl-transfer RNAs are not available and a peptide chain cannot be elongated. The trailing ribosomes then collide with the stalled ribosome, and GCN2 was found to be associated with this molecular traffic jam. There, the presence of uncharged transfer RNAs, another consequence of a shortage of amino acids, also promoted the phosphorylation and activation of GCN2. —L. Bryan Ray During nutrient deprivation, activation of the protein kinase GCN2 regulates cell survival and metabolic homeostasis. In addition to amino acid stress, GCN2 is activated by a variety of cellular stresses. GCN2 activation has been linked to its association with uncharged tRNAs, specific ribosomal proteins, and conditions of translational arrest, but their relative contribution to activation is unclear. Here, we used in vitro translation to reconstitute GCN2 activation by amino acid stress and compared collided ribosome populations induced by diverse translational stressors. Initiation of GCN2 signaling required the di-ribosome sensor GCN1, which recruits GCN2 to ribosomes in a collision-dependent manner, where GCN2 becomes activated by key ribosomal interactions and stably associated with collided ribosomes. Our findings define the molecular requirements and dynamics of GCN2 activation.},

  abstract     = {A distinguishing feature of the mostly warm surface of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (EEP) is a “cold tongue” that extends thousands of kilometers to the west from Ecuador. This structure, formed by upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water from greater depths, has major impacts on both ocean biological productivity and climate. But how did this system behave during the Pliocene epoch, an interval that had a warmer climate than today and often is considered a climate analog for our warmer future? Rafter et al . analyzed the nitrogen isotopic compositions of marine sediments and organic phases in foraminifera to conclude that upwelling in the EEP has persisted over the past 4 million years, although the cold tongue was warmer during the Pliocene (see the Perspective by Rosenthal and Hess). These results have implications for both ocean circulation during the Pliocene and in the future. —Jesse Smith Upwelling generates a nutrient-rich “cold tongue” in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (EEP), with impacts on global climate, oceanic biological productivity, and the carbon cycle. The cold tongue was reduced during the Pliocene Epoch, a feature attributed to weaker upwelling and an associated deepening of the surface mixed layer in the EEP. Here, we report nitrogen-isotope evidence that modern-like upwelling occurred in the EEP during the Pliocene and has persisted over the past 5 million years. We explain the reduced Pliocene cold tongue as an expression of the reduced temperature difference between surface and subsurface waters in the tropical Pacific. The attendant reduction in the vertical density gradient may have maintained EEP upwelling despite the expected slackening of the trade winds under Pliocene warmth.},

However, recent data have demonstrated the existence of noncanonical routes of interneuronal communication mediating the transport of materials including calcium, mitochondria, and pathogenic proteins such as amyloid beta (Aβ). Using super-resolution and electron microscopy, Chang et al . identified and characterized structures called nanotubular bridges that connect dendrites in the brain (see the Perspective by Budinger and Heneka). These bridges mediate the transport of calcium ions, small molecules, and Aβ peptides, and may contribute to the spreading and accumulation of pathological Aβ in Alzheimer’s disease. —Mattia Maroso Intercellular nanotubular networks mediate material exchange, but their existence in neurons remains to be explored in detail. We identified long, thin dendritic filopodia forming direct dendrite–dendrite nanotubes (DNTs) in mammalian cortex. Super-resolution microscopy in dissociated neurons revealed DNTs’ actin-rich composition and dynamics, enabling long-range calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) propagation. Imaging and machine learning–based analysis validated in situ DNTs as anatomically distinct from synaptic spines. DNTs actively transported small molecules and human amyloid-β (Aβ); DNT density increased before plaque formation in the medial prefrontal cortex of APP/PS1 mice (APP, Aβ precursor protein; PS1, presenilin-1), suggesting that the dendrite-DNT network might play a role in Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Computational models of DNT-mediated Aβ propagation recapitulated early amyloidosis, predicting selective intracellular accumulation. These findings uncover a nanotubular connectivity layer in the brain, extending neuronal communication beyond classical synapses.},

REPAIRome offers insights into DNA repair mechanisms, enhances gene-editing precision, and explains the mutation patterns observed in cancer. In addition to being a tool for specialists in DNA repair, gene editing, or cancer evolution, this resource enables any researcher to explore whether a gene of interest affects DNA repair. —Di Jiang The analysis of DNA sequence outcomes provides molecular insights into double-strand break (DSB) repair mechanisms. Using parallel in-pool profiling of Cas9-induced insertions and deletions (indels) within a genome-wide knockout library, we present a comprehensive catalog that assesses the influence of nearly every human gene on DSB repair outcomes. This REPAIRome resource uncovers uncharacterized mechanisms, pathways, and factors involved in DSB repair, including opposing roles for XLF and PAXX, a molecular explanation for Cas9-induced multinucleotide insertions, HLTF functions in Cas9-induced DSB repair, the involvement of the SAGA complex in microhomology-mediated end joining, and an indel mutational signature linked to VHL loss, renal carcinoma, and hypoxia. These results exemplify the potential of REPAIRome to drive future discoveries in DSB repair, CRISPR-Cas gene editing and the etiology of cancer mutational signatures.},

  abstract     = {Eukaryotic DNA is packaged as chromatin, the basic unit of which is the nucleosome, around which about 150 base pairs of DNA are wrapped, limiting its accessibility. Chromatin remodelers mobilize nucleosomes to regulate replication and transcription. Moore et al . studied two major remodelers, ACF and RSC, in crowded chromatin by recreating phase-separated chromatin droplets in vitro. They found that both remodelers could enter and mobilize nucleosomes within droplets, but only RSC decompacted chromatin and increased droplet mobility. This decompaction likely enhances DNA accessibility in cells. Their findings suggest that remodelers differ in biological importance depending on their capacity to mobilize and decompact compacted chromatin. —Di Jiang Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes mobilize nucleosomes, but how such mobilization affects chromatin condensation is unclear. We investigate effects of two major remodelers, ACF and RSC, using chromatin condensates and single-molecule footprinting. We find that both remodelers inhibit the formation of condensed chromatin. However, the remodelers have distinct effects on preformed chromatin condensates. ACF spaces nucleosomes without decondensing the chromatin, explaining how ACF maintains nucleosome organization in transcriptionally repressed genomic regions. By contrast, RSC catalyzes ATP-dependent decondensation of chromatin. RSC also drives micron-scale movements of entire chromatin condensates. These additional activities of RSC may contribute to its central role in transcription. The biological importance of remodelers may thus reflect both their effects on nucleosome mobilization and the corresponding consequences on chromatin dynamics at the mesoscale.},

Zhang et al . present a combined experimental and modeling study examining the fundamental mechanisms of lithium-ion intercalation into battery cathodes by analyzing current-voltage responses at small overpotentials (see the Perspective by Warburton). A key finding was the close agreement between the experiments and coupled ion–electron transfer theory rate expressions. The authors concluded that the reaction-limited current in lithium-ion batteries is associated with the lithium-ion vacancy fraction, in conjunction with temperature and electrolyte effects, thus providing a pathway for designing lithium-ion battery interfaces. —Marc S. Lavine The underlying reaction mechanism in lithium-ion batteries remains poorly understood. We provide experimental and theoretical evidence that lithium intercalation occurs by coupled ion-electron transfer, where ion transfer across the electrode-electrolyte interface is facilitated by electron transfer to a neighboring redox site. Electrochemical measurements for a variety of common electrode and electrolyte materials reveal a universal dependence of the (de-)intercalation rate on Li + vacancy fraction, as well as temperature and electrolyte effects consistent with the theory, which could be used to guide the molecular design of lithium-ion battery interfaces.},

  abstract     = {The Otophysan suborder contains nearly 70% of all freshwater fish species, many of which are quite familiar, such as carp, catfish, and eels. It had been believed that this group originated in fresh water before the breakup of Pangea. However, after analyzing a recently discovered Late Cretaceous fossil, Liu et al . concluded that this group first evolved in a marine environment and later colonized fresh water multiple separate times. Furthermore, the fossil informs on the evolution of the group’s Weberian hearing apparatus, suggesting that it was associated with freshwater adaptations. —Sacha Vignieri Otophysans, known for their enhanced hearing enabled by the complex Weberian apparatus, comprise two-thirds of extant freshwater fish species. Previously, they were thought to have originated in fresh water before the breakup of Pangea, implying a nearly 80-million-year gap between the origin and oldest known fossil. However, the discovery of a Late Cretaceous freshwater otophysan challenges this view. Integrating fossil, morphological, and genomic data, we estimate a younger crown group origin of ~154 million years ago. Notably, ancestral range and habitat reconstructions indicate marine origins for the otophysan crown groups, with at least two transitions to fresh water. Functional simulations of the Weberian ossicles of this fossil suggest that the distinctive hearing capabilities of otophysans evolved in conjunction with fusion of hearing ossicle parts and freshwater adaptations.},

  abstract     = {Many cold-adapted plants will either need to expand their ranges or genetically adapt to the warming temperatures caused by climate change. Fior et al . assembled a draft genome of the alpine wood pink ( Dianthus sylvestris ) and looked for signatures of selection in high- and low-elevation populations. They identified the gene DsCEN/2 , the two main haplotypes of which determine flowering time and segregate at different frequencies between low- and high-elevation populations. The low-elevation haplotype seems to have arisen during range expansion to warmer valleys during the Last Glacial Maximum. Given its fitness benefits to larger plants in warm conditions, this haplotype will likely increase in frequency in high-elevation populations with future temperature increases. —Corinne Simonti Adaptive evolution is key for species to persist in a warming climate. However, how adaptive genetic variants arise and shape both past and future evolutionary trajectories remains largely unknown. In this work, we integrate genomics with functional and ecological assays to unravel the evolutionary history and adaptive potential of alleles governing adaptation to climate through flowering time in an Alpine carnation. We reveal that “warm” and “cold” alleles of the flowering inhibitor CENTRORADIALIS ( DsCEN/2 ) originated through recombination of highly divergent haplotypes during the carnation radiation, implicating ancestral variation in seeding climate-adaptive alleles. These alleles survived in glacial refugia before mediating the species’ range expansion in response to postglacial warming. We predict that, by recapitulating past evolution, warm alleles will continue to facilitate adaptation under future climate change.},

  abstract     = {As climate warms and humans build in more undeveloped environments, the threat of costly wildfire disasters is thought to be increasing. Cunningham et al . examined data about the global distribution, frequency, and associated climate conditions of the most lethal and costly wildfire disasters from 1980 to 2023, finding that disaster risk was highest in regions near relatively affluent, populated areas, and that the frequency of economically disastrous wildfires increased sharply after 2015. They also found that major disasters coincided with extreme climatic conditions. —Jesse Smith Climate change and land mismanagement are creating increasingly fire-prone built and natural environments. However, despite worsening fire seasons, evidence is lacking globally for trends in socially and economically disastrous wildfires, partly due to sparse systematic records. Using a 44-year dataset (1980 to 2023) we analyze the distribution, trends, and climatic conditions connected with the most lethal and costly wildfires. Disastrous wildfires occurred globally over this period but were concentrated in the Mediterranean and temperate conifer biomes. Disaster risk was highest where highly energetic daily fire events intersected affluent, populated areas. Economic disasters increased sharply from 2015 onward, with 43% of the 200 most damaging events occurring in the last decade. Disasters coincided with increasingly extreme climatic conditions, highlighting the urgent need to adapt to a more fire-prone world.},
