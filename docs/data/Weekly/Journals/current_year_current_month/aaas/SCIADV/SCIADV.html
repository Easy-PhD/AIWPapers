  abstract     = {The gut microbiota is essential for many aspects of host physiology, and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) modulates its function. The microbiota community determines the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in cancer immunotherapy; however, mechanisms able to improve this function are not known. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released by the microbiota restricts the sIgA repertoire by limiting T follicular helper (T FH ) cell activity in the Peyer’s patches via stimulation of the ionotropic P2X7 receptor. We show that sIgA amplification by oral administration of the ATP hydrolyzing enzyme apyrase corrects enteropathic features of ICB and improves therapeutic efficacy. Consistent with sIgA function in reshaping the gut ecosystem and enhancing ICB, IgA −/− mice did not show any improvement of antitumor response by apyrase administration. Mechanistically, data in mice and patients with cancer suggest that invigorated enterotropic cytotoxic T cells expressing the chemokine receptor CCR9 replenish the tumor microenvironment in a CCL25-mediated manner and control tumor growth, resulting in improved ICB efficacy.},

Although charge carrier mobility in single-crystalline organic semiconductors (OSCs) reaches 10 square centimeters per volt per second (cm 2 V −1 s −1 ), it is predominantly limited by molecular vibrations excited at room temperature. The extent to which mobility in single-crystalline OSCs can be increased remains a central question. Here, we demonstrate charge transport in a clean two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG) in uniaxially strained, single-crystalline OSCs at cryogenic temperatures, with minimized lattice vibrations. Hall effect measurements reveal a mobility of 117 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at 2 kelvin under 2.8% compressional strain, with an extraordinarily large piezoresistive effect and low sheet resistivity of 550 ohms, one-fifth of the lowest resistivity in unstrained samples. These clean systems offer opportunities to explore intrinsic strain-induced charge transport physics, where condensed matter phenomena, characterized by weakly bonded molecular orbitals, combine electronic correlation and lattice degrees of freedom.},

How Golgi residents remain in their designated compartments despite a constant flow of secretory cargo is incompletely understood. Here, we determine the structure of the COPI vesicle coat containing GOLPH3, an adaptor protein that binds the cytosolic tails of many Golgi residents. Analysis of this structure, together with structure-guided mutagenesis and functional assays, reveals how GOLPH3 uses coincidence detection of COPI and lipids to engage Golgi residents preferentially at late cisternae. Our findings rationalize the logic of cisternal maturation and explain how COPI can engage different types of substrates in different Golgi cisternae to retrieve some proteins back to the ER while retaining others within the Golgi apparatus.},

Here, we present a metastructure to mimic both mesoscale phase change and macroscopic mechanical properties of polydomain materials such as liquid crystal elastomers, which achieves unprecedented tunability over domain structures through the rational design of unit cells and their spatial arrangements. These metastructure system is used to explore and directly visualize the complex mesoscale topological deformation mechanisms hidden at molecular scales, providing fundamental insights into the mechanical properties of these materials. Beyond mimicking known polydomain materials, we demonstrate functionalities including mechanical encoding/decoding and programmable shape morphing.

Their rapid evolution often obscures evolutionary relationships, limiting the ability to assign functions using sequence-based methods. Although the conservation of protein fold can reveal deep homologies, viral proteins remain underrepresented in structural databases. We address this by clustering viral sequences from RefSeq and predicting the structures of ~27,000 representative proteins using AlphaFold2 to create the Viral AlphaFold Database (VAD). We uncover conserved folds in diverse viruses infecting bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. We predict homodimers and make comparisons to the Protein Data Bank, providing data on oligomerization potential. We reveal considerable functional darkness in the viral protein universe and report the discovery and validation of an uncharacterized toxin-antitoxin system.

  abstract     = {Controllable adhesive interfaces offer unique opportunities for dynamic object capture, especially for aerospace engineering. However, existing approaches often lack the capability to efficiently dissipate impact energy and rapidly protect the adhesive interface during rebound and typically rely on complex mechanical and control systems to fulfill multiple functions. Here, we present a sequential phase-switching adhesion strategy using shape memory polymers (SMPs) to facilitate full-cycle capture operations. The engineered SMP-frame adhesive structure captures targets with normalized kinetic energies exceeding 3800 joules per square meter, empowered by the intrinsic viscoelasticity of the material to provide both strong energy dissipation and rapid adhesive interface strengthening. The dynamic strengthening mechanism delays crack propagation and greatly enhances detachment toughness, enabling unprecedented rebound suppression within the short timescales of collision. The adhesive-integrated system successfully performs dynamic capture, manipulation, and release under free-floating conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the sequential phase-switching adhesion strategy. The proposed concept and design offer a paradigm for robust, multifunctional capture in high-dynamics environments.},

In this study, we use cutting-edge experimental techniques to probe the pressure evolution of the relaxation spectrum in a Zr 46.8 Ti 8.2 Cu 7.5 Ni 10 Be 27.5 metallic glass across gigapascal pressure ranges. Our findings reveal two distinct relaxation mechanisms under high pressure: In the β-relaxation regime, compression drives the system with reduced atomic mobility and enhanced structural disorder, without appreciable density changes. Conversely, α-relaxation under pressure promotes density-driven structural ordering that improves thermal stability. Notably, the transition between these regimes occurs at a constant T / T g,P ratio, independent of applied pressure. These results provide crucial insights for decoupling the competing structural and relaxation contributions to glass stability, establishing a systematic framework for tailoring glass properties through controlled thermomechanical processing.},

Nef is a multifunctional, immunomodulatory protein that downmodulates cell surface proteins, including CD4 and MHC class I (MHC-I), which are important for T cell–mediated immunity. In addition, Nef also regulates cell-intrinsic immunity—Nef boosts the infectivity of virions produced and released from HIV-infected cells, at least in part, by counteracting the antiviral activity of transmembrane proteins SERINC3 and SERINC5. Here, we show that Nef proteins derived from many primary isolates of HIV-1 restore infectivity in interferon-treated cells and confer resistance to the antiviral protein interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) in a SERINC3/5-independent manner. Using Nef derived from primary HIV-1 clade C infection, we found that Nef interacts with IFITM3 in membranes, reduces IFITM3 incorporation into HIV-1 virions, and restores HIV-1 fusion with target cells. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized immunomodulatory role for Nef in the setting of the interferon-induced antiviral state during HIV-1 infection.},

This review systematically explores the integration of ML and TENG technology for intelligent sports. First, the fundamental theory and basic knowledge of TENGs are introduced, highlighting their versatility in sports sensing systems. Subsequently, a comprehensive overview of ML models for TENG signal analysis is discussed. Recent advancements of ML-assisted TENG-based intelligent sports applications, including sports training evaluation, sports health monitoring, and virtual/augmented reality sports, are then highlighted.

  abstract     = {Intracellular Ca 2+ controls various cellular functions, and local Ca 2+ dynamics are tightly regulated upon environmental cues. How cellular Ca 2+ balance is maintained during stress remains unresolved. Here, we identify an intracellular phosphoregulatory module comprising calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK)–ER-type Ca 2+ -ATPases 1 (ECA1) that integrates [Ca 2+ ] cyt flux with abscisic acid (ABA) homeostasis to modulate root growth under osmotic stress. Pharmacological and genetic disruption of ECA1-mediated Ca 2+ efflux triggered enhanced [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients and [ABA] cyt , exacerbating root growth hypersensitivity to osmotic stress. Biochemical assays reveal that CPK2/6/11 directly bind and phosphorylate ECA1, enhancing its Ca 2+ -pumping activity to restore cytosolic Ca 2+ equilibrium and subsequently prevent ABA cyt overaccumulation. Genetic analysis shows that eca1cpk11 phenocopied eca1 hypersensitivity, while triple and quadruple mutants amplified osmotic sensitivity, demonstrating that CPKs and ECA1 function as a cooperative phosphoregulatory hub regulating Ca 2+ signaling and root growth. Our work resolves a critical gap by elucidating how plants couple ionic and hormonal messengers to balance plant growth and stress resilience.},

  abstract     = {Complex I (CI; NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is central to energy generation and metabolic homeostasis in mammalian cells but contributes to adverse outcome pathways under challenging conditions. During ischemia, mammalian CI transitions from a turnover-ready, structurally “closed” state toward a dormant “open” state that prevents it from functioning in reverse during reperfusion to produce reactive oxygen species. Unfortunately, simpler, genetically tractable CI models do not recapitulate the same regulatory behavior, compromising mechanistic studies. Here, we report the structure of isolated CI from the yeast Pichia pastoris ( Pp -CI) and identify distinct closed and open states that resemble those of mammalian CI. Notably, a hitherto-unknown protein (NUQM) completes an interdomain bridge in only the closed state, implying that NUQM stabilizes it by restricting the conformational changes of opening. The direct correlation of NUQM binding with closed/open status in Pp -CI provides opportunities for investigating regulatory mechanisms relevant to reversible catalysis and ischemia-reperfusion injury.},

Mitochondria are also a key source of intracellular ROS, yet their contribution to plant immunity is poorly characterized. Here, we studied mitochondrial ROS (mROS) function in plant-pathogen interactions, deploying genetically encoded sensors, assorted fluorescent markers, and genetic approaches to track mROS, specifically H 2 O 2 , dynamics and identify interorganelle contact sites. We unexpectedly found a mitochondria–endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ROS signal cascade functioning independently of apoplastic and chloroplastic ROS in plant immunity. mROS initiate immune responses induced by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora parasitica and promote mitochondria-ER association. These enhanced mitochondria-ER membrane associations are required for transfer of mROS signals and initiation of extensive unfolded protein responses. We conclude that mROS transfer via mitochondria-ER membranes to the ER lumen is an underappreciated yet essential component in plant defense.},

Like humans, 72% of mammals exhibited a female life expectancy advantage, while 68% of birds showed a male advantage, as expected from the harmful effects of sex chromosomes described by the heterogametic sex hypothesis. Yet, sex differences varied widely. In zoos, we found strong evidence that this variation generally correlated with both the mating system and sexual size dimorphism. Although with weaker evidence, the patterns remained consistent in populations from the wild, with an even larger effect of the mating system. Thus, even in zoos, where environmental pressures are largely reduced, precopulatory sexual selection seems to play a fundamental role in shaping sex differences in life expectancy in mammals and birds.},

In contrast, two-dimensional materials, with their all-surface nature, offer a platform for tuning quantum emitters via chemical functionalization. Because of its semiconducting properties that enable electrical addressability, monolayer WSe 2 is a promising candidate for quantum emission, although the complex interplay between point defects and the localized strain needed to activate quantum emission leads to poor spectral purity. Here, we demonstrate that functionalizing monolayer WSe 2 with conformal adlayers of 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) improves quantum emission spectral purity. Optical spectroscopy reveals that PTCDA functionalization lowers defect activation energies by 10 meV and induces a 30 nm redshift in quantum emission wavelength, while preserving the bright and dark exciton energies of monolayer WSe 2 . First-principles calculations corroborate these findings, thus providing molecular-level insight into the underlying mechanism of enhanced spectral purity.},

This approach provided the first quantitative and spatial analysis of the translational machinery within stress granules. Our findings suggest that stress granules have a limited impact on global translation regulation but serve to protect small ribosomal subunits and preinitiation complexes from degradation. Numerical simulations based on a phase-field model accurately reproduced the spatial distribution of ribosomal components inside and outside the stress granules, shedding light on the thermodynamic principles governing this process.},

Nonlinear spectroscopy cannot unambiguously distinguish coherent electronic dynamics from underdamped vibrational motion, and rigorous numerical simulations of realistic microscopic models have been intractable. Experimental studies supported by approximate numerical treatments that severely coarse-grain the vibrational environment have claimed the absence of long-lived quantum effects. Here, we report the nonperturbative, accurate microscopic model simulations of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex and demonstrate the presence of long-lived excitonic coherences at 77 kelvin and room temperature, which persist on picosecond timescales, similar to those of excitation energy transfer. Furthermore, we show that full microscopic simulations of nonlinear optical spectra are essential for identifying experimental evidence of quantum effects in photosynthesis, as approximate theoretical methods can misinterpret experimental data and potentially overlook quantum phenomena.},

Here, we show a one-step, acid-free, and alkali-free extraction process for Li from mineral ores with an initial Li content of only 4.8%. By applying flash Joule heating to α-spodumene under an atmosphere of Cl 2 (FJH-Cl 2 ), LiCl immediately distills from the remaining nonvolatile aluminum and silicon oxides. LiCl with a 97% purity and 94% yield can be achieved, enormously reducing costs and waste emissions. Local processing with FJH-Cl 2 can markedly lessen the complexity and cost of obtaining Li, obviating remote mining and facilitating the world’s progression toward cleaner renewable energies, which also paves the way for extracting critical metals from other mineral ores.},

A coplanar capacitive sensor was attached to the stent graft using a specially developed flexible thermal adhesive to monitor blood leakage, without compromising the stent graft’s function. It seamlessly folds and unfolds with the stent, allowing implantation through catheter-based procedures. Experimental validation confirmed that the sensor does not induce blood leakage and demonstrated long-term stability and functionality under vascular and dynamic conditions.

Comprehensive magnetostratigraphic sampling shows highly variable directions, consistent with a rapidly changing geomagnetic field along a longitudinally preferred band. High-precision geochronology constrains the geomagnetic variability to ~568 to 562 million years and suggests rates that are likely too rapid for true polar wander or plate tectonic interpretations. Comparison of igneous- and sedimentary-derived data, using a new statistical approach combining Bingham and Fisher distributions, indicates a high-inclination paleomagnetic direction that is compatible with independent evidence for regional glaciation.

In this study, we demonstrate how chronic stress alters region-specific O-glycosylation across multiple brain regions, with a particular focus on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Our findings reveal significant changes in sialylated O-glycosylation patterns mediated by St3gal1 , a sialyltransferase essential for O-glycosylation. Notably, knockdown of St3gal1 in nonstressed mice induced depressive-like behaviors, whereas its overexpression in stressed mice alleviated depressive symptoms, underscoring its regulatory role in stress resilience. In addition, we identify potential glycoprotein targets and downstream regulators of St3gal1 , including neurexin 2 (NRXN2) in the medial PFC (mPFC), offering insights into molecular pathways linking O-glycosylation to depressive-like behaviors.},

Upon infection, ectocervical epithelia reinforce barrier integrity, whereas endocervical epithelia, particularly uninfected bystander cells, exhibit extensive transcriptional reprogramming characterized by robust interferon activation, antigen presentation, and antimicrobial defense. Infection profoundly reshapes epithelial intercellular communication, positioning bystander cells as major contributors to signaling networks coordinating immune responses and tissue regeneration.

We determined the functions of individual constituent proteins in the structure and function of Eut BMCs and demonstrated that EutQ is essential for cargo encapsulation and Eut BMC formation through specific association with the shell and cargo enzymes. We found that Eut proteins can self-assemble to form cargo and shell aggregates independently in vivo and that the biogenesis of Eut BMCs follows a “shell-initiated” pathway. Cargo enzymes exhibit dynamic liquid-like organization within the Eut BMC. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the structure and assembly of the Eut BMC that serves as a paradigm for membraneless organelles.},

  abstract     = {Mountain glaciers are sensitive climate indicators. Glaciers in the western United States are projected to disappear by 2100 CE, but whether they were previously absent in the current interglacial (past 11,700 years) remains debated. Here, we present evidence that two of the largest glaciers in California’s Sierra Nevada near Yosemite National Park persisted throughout the Holocene. Cosmogenic in situ carbon-14 and beryllium-10 exposure dating in newly exposed proglacial bedrock indicates continuous Holocene cover, likely by ice. At a nearby smaller glacier, bedrock exposure-burial ages suggest glacier expansion at ~7 thousand years ago, earlier than previously recognized. Moraine exposure ages at these sites and the Sierra Nevada’s largest glacier are distributed across the past several thousand years, suggesting that glaciers were near their preindustrial extent for much of the late Holocene. These findings imply that a glacier-free Sierra Nevada is unprecedented since before the Holocene. Future alpine glacial environments in California are thereby likely a no-analog scenario within the current interglacial.},

Progress in this field has been limited to the reactions promoted by bridged biaryl intermediates with five- or six-membered rings. Herein we demonstrate the first example of a carbene-catalyzed atroposelective dynamic kinetic acylation reaction via transient seven-membered cyclic hemiacetals. The key for the success of this reaction relies on the formation and configurational instability of the transient seven-membered cyclic hemiacetal intermediate. The axially chiral biaryl aldehyde products obtained via this method can undergo a series of further transformations. Notably, one of the axially chiral biaryl aldehyde products can be used as the key and common intermediate for the asymmetric synthesis of natural product steganone. Preliminary density functional theory calculations reveal the molecular origins underlying the observed chemo- and enantioselectivity outcomes.},

However, the kinetics of T reg generation across different tissues remains unclear. Here, we investigate T reg ontogeny from birth to adulthood in various tissues. In lymphoid organs, the adult T reg pool is continuously replenished with cells generated at different ages. In contrast, the skin retains a large fraction of T regs that colonize the tissue during the neonatal period, with minimal turnover in adulthood. The liver, lungs, and colon exhibit intermediate T reg renewal dynamics. Notably, neonatal T regs that persist into adulthood display a more activated phenotype and express markers associated with tissue-resident T regs and type 2 immunity.

Here, we designed and developed pseudo-rhodamine electrochromic molecules through a “tandem all-in-one” synthetic strategy that covalently integrates three distinct functional units within a single molecule. This molecular architecture simultaneously achieves exceptionally high heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant and ultrahigh molar absorption coefficient. We verified the underlying electrochromic mechanism involving a two-electron redox process of pyridinecarboxylic acid derivative units coupled with reversible pseudo-rhodamine spirocyclization. By implementing this tandem all-in-one molecular engineering strategy, different functional subunits within the electrochromic molecule are mutually bonded to interact through alternating reaction sequences, enabling near-synchronous operation of individual units. The resulting electrochromic display demonstrates ultrafast response speeds (35 milliseconds for bleaching and 65 milliseconds for coloration), capable of smooth video playback and rapid switching between digital states. The design principle showcases a prospective design pathway for the development of ultrafast electrochromic video displays.},

In partnership with the Santa Clara County Public Defender’s Office, we randomly assigned 5709 public defender clients to either receive automated text message reminders (treatment) or not receive reminders (control). We found that reminders reduced warrants issued for missed court dates by ~20%, with 12.1% of clients in control issued a warrant compared to 9.7% of clients in treatment. Further, we found that incarceration from missed court dates dropped by a similar amount, from 6.6% in control to 5.2% in treatment.

Strains with a single-chromosome architecture, whether linear or circular, exhibited faster growth, enhanced stress tolerance, and greater interstrain competitiveness. In contrast, bipartite chromosome strains showed higher virulence gene expression and enhanced transient plant transformation efficiency, suggesting a pathogenic adaptation. Whole-transcriptome analysis revealed architecture-dependent gene expression patterns, underscoring the profound impact of chromosome organization on Agrobacterium fitness and virulence.

On the basis of this finding, we develop a water-flow gated transistor (WGT) capable of transducing flow signals down to 600 nanometers per second into electrical signals, achieving a voltage responsivity up to 1.53 × 10 4 volts per meter-second, about two orders of magnitude higher than existing hydroelectronic devices.

We used a temperature-dependent population dynamics model to assess the impacts of lake warming and fishing on 521 freshwater fish populations in the Midwestern United States—a transitional zone between cold- and warmwater species. Overall, most warmwater species (65% of populations) exhibited increases in productivity from warming, while slightly more than half of the cool-/cold-water species (53% of populations) experienced reduced productivity. Populations closer to their carrying capacity showed greater resilience to warming. For the majority of populations (92%), fishing had a more pronounced effect on population dynamics than warming during the time period examined. Therefore, while warming is likely to increasingly threaten many fish populations, effective local fishery management remains a key lever to mitigate these impacts.},

We also show that the most exploited extinct taxa were at the apex of the ranking of the prey choice model. After the diversity and abundance of megafauna had already declined severely (~12,500 B.P.), and especially after they had virtually disappeared (~11,600 B.P.), the human diet was broadened. This strongly reinforces the idea that humans must be central to the debate on Quaternary extinctions in South America.},

Through in vitro and in vivo studies, we demonstrate that AuNSVs improve vector accumulation and uptake within the tumor, resulting in enhanced protein expression and therapeutic efficacy. Mechanistically, these effects are the result of an iterative delivery process in which AuNSVs enter cells initially through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and release AuNPs into the cytoplasm. AuNPs subsequently adsorb and inactivate cellular trafficking regulators PP2A and Rab7, producing two effects: (i) rapid entry of additional AuNSVs through activation of caveolin-mediated endocytosis (CvME) and (ii) endosomal escape through inhibited endolysosomal fusion. We propose that AuNSVs be exploited as next-generation mRNA delivery systems.},

Experimental validation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated substantial improvements in stability and productivity for fluorescent proteins and human proinsulin. The results highlight a scalable, adaptable, and organism-agnostic method to enhance the evolutionary stability of engineered strains, with broad implications for industrial biotechnology and synthetic biology.},

  abstract     = {Phosphate (Pi) is an essential nutrient that frequently limits plant growth because of its low availability in soils, especially during early seedling development in Arabidopsis . Under Pi-deficient conditions, etiolated seedlings exhibit elongated hypocotyls, shortened roots, and small, pale cotyledons—a morphological adaptation that enhances light-foraging capacity. However, how Pi is strategically distributed among these organs to optimize seedling establishment remains unclear. We here identify a PHR1-EIN3/EIL1 regulatory module that directs minimal Pi resources to suppress root elongation and cotyledon expansion or to accelerate greening, promoting Pi conservation. This mechanism prioritizes hypocotyl elongation to improve light acquisition. In contrast, under sufficient Pi supply, hypocotyl and root growth is promoted along with cotyledon enlargement, while greening is delayed. Thus, the PHR1-EIN3/EIL1 module enables efficient allocation of limited Pi to maximize hypocotyl elongation for light foraging during early seedling establishment while strategically restricting Pi usage in other organs to enhance overall survival.},

Although mitophagy is one of the main pathways involved in the clearance of damaged or old mitochondria, its coordination with mitochondrial biogenesis is poorly characterized. Here, by unbiased approaches including last-generation liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and transcriptomics, we identify the protein phosphatase PP2A-B55α/PPP2R2A as a Parkin-dependent regulator of mitochondrial number. Upon mitochondrial damage, PP2A-B55α determines the amplitude of mitophagy induction and execution by regulating both early and late mitophagy events. A few minutes after the insult, ULK1 is released from the inhibitory regulation of PP2A-B55α, whereas 2 to 4 hours later, PP2A-B55α promotes the nuclear translocation of TFEB, the master regulator of autophagy and lysosome genes, to support mitophagy execution. Moreover, PP2A-B55α controls a transcriptional program of mitochondrial biogenesis by stabilizing the Parkin substrate and PGC-1α inhibitor PARIS. PP2A-B55α targeting rescues neurodegenerative phenotypes in a fly model of Parkinson’s disease, thus suggesting potential therapeutic application.},

How FAK becomes activated in response to cell-ECM adhesive forces at single FAs to facilitate directional motion is poorly understood. Using micropillar-based force microscopy and FA-targeted FRET biosensors, we monitored real-time traction forces and FAK activity at individual FAs during assembly and disassembly. Our results demonstrate oscillatory temporal coupling of traction force and FAK activity in high-tension FAs before FA disassembly. Cross-correlation analyses revealed that force precedes FAK activation, guiding FA turnover. Atomistic molecular simulations unveiled a force-induced mechanism where traction forces disrupt autoinhibitory FERM-kinase interactions in FAK, enabling catalytic activity without structural unfolding. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the spatiotemporal integration of mechanical forces and biochemical signaling in cell migration.},

Here, we demonstrate unprecedented control to engineer Feshbach resonances at tunable positions via Floquet driving in a lithium-6 (^{6}Li) atom gas, achieved through strong magnetic field modulation at megacycles per second frequencies. This periodic modulation creates scattering resonances whenever dressed molecular levels cross the atomic threshold. By adding a second modulation at twice the base frequency, we tune the asymmetry of resonance loss profiles and suppress two-body losses from Floquet heating. This technique enhances control over atomic interactions, expanding possibilities for quantum simulations of complex systems and studies of exotic quantum phases.},

Loss of AMOC stability has been inferred from slowing recovery of temperature and salinity fluctuations over time. However, observational datasets, constructed from records with sparse spatial and temporal coverage, may introduce substantial biases in stability indicators. Alternative records are therefore needed for reliable stability assessments. Here, using bivalve-derived environmental reconstructions, we show that the subpolar North Atlantic has experienced two destabilization episodes over the past ~150 years. The first preceded the rapid circulation changes associated with the 1920s North Atlantic regime shift, suggesting that a tipping point may have been crossed in the early 20th century. The second and stronger destabilization began around 1950 and continues to the present, supporting evidence of recent stability loss and suggesting that the region is moving toward a tipping point.},

Here, we combine atomic-resolution imaging under in situ electrical biasing conditions with first-principles calculations to unravel the atomic-scale switching mechanisms in SnSe, a vdW group IV monochalcogenide. Our results uncover the coexistence of a consecutive 90° switching pathway and a direct 180° switching pathway from antiferroelectric (AFE) to FE order in this vdW system. Atomic-scale investigations and strain analysis reveal that the switching processes simultaneously induce interlayer sliding and compressive strain, while the lattice remains coherent despite the presence of multidomain structures. These findings elucidate vdW ferroelectric switching dynamics at atomic scale and lay the foundation for the rational design of 2D ferroelectric nanodevices.},

Compared to NC IMPBs, CC IMPBs have smaller, sulfur (S)–poor, highly siderophile element (HSE)–enriched cores and younger core formation ages. However, the origins of these differences remain debated. Using equilibrium partitioning models between the S-poor solid and the S-rich liquid metal, we argue that HSE enrichment in IID, IIF, IIIF, and IVB cores resulted from a multistage evolutionary sequence: (i) segregation of S-rich, HSE-depleted protocores during initial planetesimal heating; (ii) collisional disruption before S-poor metal segregation; (iii) reaccretion of mantle fragments into daughter planetesimals; and (iv) further 26 Al-driven heating producing HSE-enriched, S-poor cores. We suggest that iron meteorites from these CC IMPBs originate from such second-generation cores. Accounting for “missing” S-rich protocores helps reconcile several NC-CC IMPB differences and highlights the role of early collisional processing in shaping planetesimal chemical evolution.},

However, research to date has focused primarily on phase and retardance aberrations, whereas another major source of aberration—diattenuation—remains largely unexplored. Unlike the others, diattenuation affects intensity in addition to phase and polarization, limiting the intrinsic correction capability of adaptive systems. In this work, we propose the use of optical skyrmions to probe diattenuation-aberrated systems and provide metrics that characterize the performance of vectorial adaptive optics (V-AO), with theoretical and experimental validations. Based on the probed results, we demonstrate V-AO correction under real-world aberrations for complex media imaging and analyze correction strategies to optimize measurements in aberrated polarimetric systems. This work paves the way for high-dimensional aberration correction, introduces a previously unidentified use of optical skyrmions, and provides insights that will aid the development of vectorial measurement systems.},

The unexpected observation of positive Seebeck coefficients in this regime indicates the presence of nontrivial electron correlations. Furthermore, our comprehensive investigation across the superconducting dome reveals that the evolution of (thermo)electric normal-state properties—specifically, the sign changes of the Hall and Seebeck coefficients—coincides with the evolution of superconducting anisotropy and pairing strength.

We used Nkapl transgenic mouse models to explore the impact of NKAPL on SCZ-related cognitive deficits. NKAPL acts as a transcriptional repressor of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolizing enzyme succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH). Nkapl deletion in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interneurons led to increased SSADH levels, reduced GABA concentration in the synaptic cleft, impaired inhibitory synaptic transmission, and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, the rs1635 mutation (T153N) caused similar effects as the Nkapl knockout. Reexpression of wild-type NKAPL or genetic knockdown of SSADH in mPFC interneurons restored the synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in Nkapl −/− mice. Our study indicates the potential role of NKAPL and SSADH in mPFC interneurons in neuronal mechanisms of learning and memory in mice.},

  abstract     = {The increasing incidence of central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL) is hindered by the blood-brain barrier and costly prolonged drug development. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a carboplatin lock-designed MOF (Pt-MOFs@Glu) targeting intestinal macrophages for brain-directed drug transport. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses revealed that intestinal macrophages migrate to the brain in response to chemokines. Building on this insight, Pt-MOFs@Glu was designed to engage these cells for precise delivery. Comprising carboplatin, pyrazine-quinoxaline, and β-glucan, the system induces an “avalanche effect” in the CNSL microenvironment, promoting tumor apoptosis and inhibiting metastasis. Combining pyrazine-quinoxaline to lock carboplatin and β-glucan to boost targeting, immunity, and oral absorption, the system enables ROS-triggered drug release, efficiently crosses the gastrointestinal tract and BBB, and synergizes chemo-immunotherapy to enhance therapeutic efficacy. This approach redefines CNSL treatment by harnessing the gut-brain axis, offering a transformative pathway to overcoming therapeutic barriers and improving patient outcomes.},

  abstract     = {The distinctive three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architecture adopted by chromosomes during meiosis is essential for fertility, yet the functional implications of the fine-scale spatial organization remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the impact of RAD21L deletion, a meiosis-specific cohesin subunit, on the 3D genome architecture and gene expression in the male germ line. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that RAD21L deficiency impairs meiotic chromatin organization and inter/intrachromosomal interactions. This conspicuous 3D genome reorganization also disrupts bouquet formation, resulting in increased telomeric interactions between heterologous chromosomes in primary spermatocytes. Genome reorganization was accompanied by detectable transcriptional dysregulation in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, mainly affecting sex chromosomes. Collectively, our findings establish the cohesin RAD21L as a germline-specific critical regulator of genome-wide 3D genome reorganization during spermatogenesis and a modulator of the male germline transcriptional landscape.},

Moreover, the extent to which they can be used to reliably track movement kinematics remains unclear. Here, we describe a tracking method that uses near-infrared quantum dots as injectable markers. We demonstrate that our tags can be injected beneath the skin or into joints and imaged for months in freely moving mice noninvasively using standard cameras. Last, we create a large ground-truth dataset for training the next generation of markerless systems. By using injectable landmarks in the joints, this method brings us closer to understanding how the brain controls skeletal movements.},

Here, we develop refined techniques for accurately and precisely measuring 234 U/ 238 U using multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, providing a reproducibility of ±0.08 per mil (2σ). At this sub-epsilon precision level, the half-life of 234 U is refined to 245,670 ± 260 years. For U-Th geochronology, systematic uncertainties from decay constants largely cancel, effectively reducing the uncertainty in the 234 U half-life to ~±25 years. This improved measurement precision consequently reduces total 2σ age uncertainties to ±3 thousand years (kyr) at ~600 thousand years ago (ka) and ±6 kyr at ~700 ka, a substantial improvement over earlier methods with uncertainties of tens of thousands of years.},

We propose an innovative causal criterion, knockoff conditional mutual information (KOCMI), to accurately infer interventional direct causality without prior knowledge of the network structure using either time-independent or time-series data. KOCMI performs knockoff operation on a variable as its virtual intervention, which preserves the original network structure, and then identifies the causality between two variables by estimating the distributional invariance before and after such a virtual intervention. We show that, algorithmically, KOCMI enables quantification of causal relationship, even for networks with loops, and, theoretically, is also consistent with the do-calculus causal analyses but without their prerequisite of the network structure. KOCMI shows superior performance on benchmark and real datasets, comparing with existing methods. Overall, KOCMI provides a powerful tool in inferring interventional causality, which is theoretically ensured and experimentally validated by real intervention data.},

However, most UDP-glycosyltransferases encounter three major limitations: low activity, poor regioselectivity, and restricted substrate availability, hindering their pharmaceutical applications. To address these challenges, we conducted protein engineering on a previously unidentified glycosyltransferase, UGT75AJ2, which had 3′,7- O -glycosylation capabilities. Our approach involved three strategies: (i) development of a tailored focused rational iterative site-specific mutagenesis strategy, augmented by virtual screening and iterative mutagenesis, to design mutant Mut4-1 (S367A/V274A/F82V/I132T) with a 128-fold enhancement in relative catalytic activity; (ii) enhancement of the enzyme’s compatibility with a broader spectrum of sugar donors achieved through structural-based engineering, yielding mutant S14G/F366H/S367G and demonstrating effective utilization of diverse donors; (iii) construction of a targeted mutant library to enhance regioselectivity by active site analysis, leading to mutants with high selectivity for targeted glycosylation sites. This comprehensive study tackles predominant challenges in UDP-glycosyltransferases protein engineering, providing innovative approaches and insights that enhance the development of flavonoid glycosides.},

This finding is verified by the absence of a signal in a conventional type-II superconductor using the same setup and by ruling out the trapped-vortex effects through micro-Hall array measurements. Both the temperature dependence and the magnitude of the observed anomalous thermal Hall conductivity are quite different from those expected for the quantized thermal edge current of an intrinsic ATHE but consistent with extrinsic impurity-induced ATHEs in chiral superconductivity. Our study of ATHE offers an alternative approach to probe TRS breaking in the superconducting states.},

We conducted a data-driven investigation into the predictability of outbreak severity, using chikungunya virus (CHIKV) as a case study. For mosquito-transmitted viruses like CHIKV, the potential for severe outbreaks is often assessed using climate-based estimates of the basic reproduction number, R 0 . We derived a large set of R 0 estimates for CHIKV by fitting a mechanistic model to data from 86 chikungunya outbreaks. These R 0 estimates were weakly predicted by climatic and other factors. Among deterministic drivers of outbreak severity, the contribution of R 0 was comparable to that of generation interval length, transmission distance, and population network structure. While aspects of chikungunya outbreak severity are predictable, innovative approaches are needed that look beyond the impacts of climate on R 0 .},

Under future climate conditions (2070 to 2100; SSP3-7.0 scenario), projections indicate a 26% rise in the number of extreme storms, an 8% increase in average storm precipitation, and a 17% reduction in dry intervals preceding flood peaks. The dominant flood type is projected to shift from those produced by isolated storms (38%) to ones produced by compound storm clustering (49%)—the type of floods that have been responsible for catastrophic floods historically.

A hidden Markov model is sufficient to model these transitions and can be incorporated into a drift-diffusion model framework that has previously been used to model perceptual decision-making in larval zebrafish. Furthermore, we fit a mixture model of performance distributions and extract two latent variables termed “focus” and “competence” that are largely influenced by parents and environmental context, respectively. This quantitative framework can potentially help to identify a genetic basis and a neural mechanism for attention that extends across organisms.},

The model integrates tide gauges, GPS, and satellite altimetry with past and future constraints on mountain glaciers, polar ice sheets, thermal expansion, ocean circulation, land water storage, and glacial history. By separating unforced ocean variability from long-term trends, we provide posterior estimates of sea level change and vertical land motion. The inclusion of local constraints reduces uncertainty in near-term local projections while producing global median projections and uncertainty ranges similar to those in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
