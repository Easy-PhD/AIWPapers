Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising adsorbents, yet atomic-level insights into Xe and Kr adsorption remain limited. Here, we report the first application of high-field solid-state 83 Kr nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), alongside extensive 129 Xe NMR, to investigate gas adsorption in eight MOFs representing three design strategies: ultramicroporous one-dimensional–channel MOFs with pore sizes matching noble gas diameters, functionalized MOFs, and MOFs with open metal sites. Single-gas and coadsorption studies reveal distinct adsorption sites, guest-host interactions, and gas dynamics in each MOF. Most MOFs retain crystallinity after exposure to 60-kilogray γ radiation. Several radiation-sensitive MOFs exhibit enhanced stability in the presence of Xe, suggesting that Xe adsorption enhances framework stability and may broaden the range of MOFs usable under γ radiation in nuclear off-gas separation. These findings offer valuable molecular-level design insights.},

However, once prototyped, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)–based silicone elastomer is limited in mechanical strength and programmable spatial construction due to the flexible polymer matrix and mismatched interface with other materials. We propose a mechanically strengthened PDMS-based origami structure (MSOS) via polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)/acetone solution swelling. The planar elastomer precursor can be swollen-folded into programmable spatial construction based on mechanically strengthened creases during solvent diffusion and de-gelatinization. This strengthened crease is induced by a hierarchical shrink-fitting based on solute molecular chain insertion and a seamless coupling interface between elastomer microstructures and solidified PMMA. We present a programmable MSOS to support a load more than 58,100 times of its own weight and a pillbug-inspired ringbot to resist heavy impact. Our work provides a strategy toward customized mechanically strengthened soft material for developing functional structural architectures and soft origami robots.},

Under acidic conditions, a previously unidentified class of β-carbolines (βCs), termed secofumitremorgins (SFs), with potent antiangiogenic activity in zebrafish models was found and identified via nuclear magnetic resonance, Marfey’s analysis, and quantum calculations. Using gene knockout, heterologous expression, precursor feeding, isotope tracing, molecular docking, and site-directed mutagenesis, a unique biosynthetic pathway for SFs was characterized, beyond the Pictet-Spenglerase–mediated biosynthetic process. Furthermore, an unreported pH-regulated mechanism was unveiled, where P450 (FtmG) facilitated new fumitremorgin intermediate formation, enabling spontaneous, nonenzymatic generation of βCs and spirotryprostatins under distinct pH conditions. Notably, this work provides detailed experimental evidence and reaction mechanisms for synergistic enzymatic and nonenzymatic catalysis driving metabolite diversification under pH stress. The findings expand biosynthetic paradigms for indole alkaloids and highlight the therapeutic potential of pH-elicited βCs, advancing strategies for natural product discovery.},

  abstract     = {Chiral electromagnetic materials, with their unique spatial configurations, can regulate the propagation and polarization of electromagnetic waves, serving as powerful tools for tailoring electromagnetic behavior. However, their functional potential is often limited by the intrinsic constraints of conventional host materials, which typically lack sufficient flexibility in defect engineering, magnetic modulation, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) enhancement. To address this challenge, we introduce high-entropy metal oxides (HEMOs) into carbon-based chiral frameworks, constructing HEMO and carbon nanocoil (HEMO@CNC) composites. By combining advanced microscopy, electromagnetic measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is revealed that increasing entropy and helical strain jointly induce nonlinear changes in SOC strength and defect-related localized states. Benefiting from these effects, the HEMO@CNC system achieves an ultrawide bandwidth, outperforming linear structures and low-entropy systems. This work provides a potential paradigm for integrating topological defect engineering and high-entropy quantum modulation, offering deeper insights into advancing electromagnetic functional materials from macroscopic design toward geometry-defect-spin synergistic regulation.},

We demonstrate a strategy to introduce and tune Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) to unprecedented magnitudes in inversion-symmetric solids by incorporating ultrasmall silver nanoparticles in bulk gold. The near-identical lattice constants of Ag and Au allow dense packing of the Ag/Au hetero-interfaces without compromising the global BIS. By varying the density of embedded nanoparticles, we generate Rashba SOI in a bulk metal with coupling strength ~15 meV∙Å, higher than any known system preserving BIS globally, and show up to ~20 times increase in the spin-orbit scattering rate. We argue that the combined effect of charge transfer at the interfaces and polaronic localization enhances the SOI.},

In contrast, a third pathway, which leverages the two-electron nucleophilic potential of alkyl–Co III , has remained unexplored because of the inherently low polarization of the C–Co bond. Here, we report an axial-coordination activation strategy to unlock this reactivity space in Co-MHAT catalysis. Through stoichiometric organometallic studies using well-defined alkyl–Co III complexes, we demonstrate that an alkoxide ligand can render alkyl–Co III sufficiently nucleophilic to displace a suitable leaving group, via a stereospecific backside-backside approach. This pathway is further applied in catalysis, enabling a diastereoselective redox neutral Co-MHAT cyclopropanation reaction.},

Here, we present a hydrogel platform that enables spatiotemporal modulation of toughness through a latent ionic cross-linking mechanism. By embedding calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) microparticles in alginate/polyacrylamide double-network hydrogels, we create a system where localized calcium release and thus ionic cross-linking can be programmed in both space and time. Spatial control is achieved by direct ink writing of CaCO 3 , while temporal activation is triggered by glucono-δ-lactone, a biocompatible acidifier that releases calcium on demand. This strategy allows user-defined tuning of stiffness and toughness, enabling fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) hydrogels with tailored mechanical profiles. The resulting materials offer a versatile platform for anisotropic impact shielding, directional strain sensing, and 3D-printed tissue adhesives, representing a paradigm shift for adaptive, reconfigurable, and multifunctional soft materials.},

The SRMM exhibits a large stiffness conversion capability (40-fold) and high-density information encoding performance (10-bit). Coupling with the mechanoluminescent materials, the mechanical information achieves visualization conveniently, which is attributed to the conversion of the stiffness data into optical signals through optical energy level transitions.

  abstract     = {Many antibiotics target essential cellular processes. To combat multidrug-resistant bacteria, new antibacterial strategies are needed. In the peptidoglycan biogenesis pathway in Escherichia coli , MurJ, the lipid II flippase, is an essential membrane protein. The 37-residue protein M from the Levivirus phage, known as Lys M or Sgl M , targets MurJ and induces cell lysis; however, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the MurJ/Lys M (JM) complex at 3.09-angstrom resolution, revealing that Lys M interacts with the crevasse between TM2 and TM7 of MurJ, locking MurJ in an outward-facing conformation, with Lys M acting like a wedge. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis and pull-down assays revealed key residues responsible for Lys M function, and molecular dynamics simulations showed that Lys M stabilizes MurJ’s outward-facing state. These findings demonstrate an unprecedented phage-derived mechanism for blocking lipid II transport, providing a structural framework for designing MurJ-targeted antimicrobial agents.},

  abstract     = {Accommodation, the space available for potential sediment deposition, is a central concept for stratigraphic heterogeneity prediction and deciphering Earth history. We define accommodation quantitatively as mean thickness of potential deposition per unit of time, calculated per unit area based on a maximum deposition rate and slope-controlled probabilities of erosion and deposition. Testing this definition in a simple numerical stratigraphic forward model reproduces key stratal geometries and behaviors, suggesting basic predictive power. However, the model output is missing much stratigraphic detail, and it is difficult to see how this can be added through extension of the accommodation definition. This suggests that accommodation has less predictive power than typically assumed; many important elements of stratal prediction must come instead from independent calculation of sediment erosion, routing, and depositional processes.},

Here, we present a hybrid platform that enables comprehensive dc and ac analog signal processing within a 2D-ACT device. By synergistically integrating 2D-FET and SAW components, our system achieves real-time subwavelength carrier monitoring and ac signal manipulation. ac measurements further elucidate mechanisms of dc acoustoelectric current generation. Notably, by controlling the phase and intensity of counter-propagating SAWs, we demonstrate analog signal addition and subtraction capabilities not previously realized in 2D-ACT devices. This platform establishes a benchmark for compact, low-loss ACT devices in ac signal processing, representing a notable advance for acoustoelectric technologies and 2D material systems.},

However, their commercial viability is limited by the poor cycle stability and complex degradation mechanism. This study underscores the pivotal role of electro-chemo-mechanical interactions in driving the failure of SSBs. Leveraging advanced x-ray imaging and spectroscopy techniques, we analyzed LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 (NMC811) cathodes from cycled Li x In||Li 6 PS 5 Cl (LPSC)||NMC811 SSBs, uncovering the interplay between microstructure, chemical heterogeneity, mechanical characteristics, and electrochemical performance. Our results show that revealing electro-chemo-mechanical interactions is essential to develop strategies to suppress the degradation of SSBs. Particularly, we revisit a LiNbO 3 (LNO) coating layer to mitigate electrochemical degradation. The LNO@NMC811 cathode retains 116 milliampere-hours per gram after 200 cycles, showing excellent stability, while the uncoated NMC811 cathode keeps degrading over time, with suppressed chemical heterogeneity and mechanical failure. This work highlights the importance of synergizing advanced material design with coating techniques, ensuring uniform lithium flux and improving mechanical properties to achieve stable, high-performance SSBs.},

We report a plasmon-induced route to plasmonic-polymer hybrid nanomaterials using in operando single-particle spectroelectrochemistry. An energy transfer efficiency of 40% is achievable when the spectral overlap between gold nanorod scattering and polymer absorption is maximized. We also show that PIRET-initiated polymerization proceeds through a different mechanism than bulk polymerization, supported by spectroscopic evidence and density functional theory calculations, highlighting efficient energy cascading from photon to plasmon to exciton and, lastly, to unconventional light-initiated chemistry.},

We develop a three-component (ThrCo) LNP by replacing cholesterol and PEGylated lipids in Pfizer-BioNTech LNPs with zwitterionic pyridine carboxybetaine (PyCB) ionizable lipids (ILs), achieving ~70% lower liver accumulation and a 4.5-fold increase in spleen-specific mRNA translation. PyCB ILs enhance LNP hydrophilicity, stabilizing the outer membrane to compensate for cholesterol removal. PyCB groups also exhibit strong protonation at endosomal pH, facilitating mRNA translation. The zwitterionic surface of ThrCo LNP reduces protein adsorption, thereby preventing the accelerated blood clearance effect caused by PEGylated lipids following repeated administrations. Thus, ThrCo LNP–based vaccines efficiently deliver mRNA to splenic antigen-presenting cells, boosting immune responses and improving therapeutic outcomes.},

Through coculturing for 30 to 120 days, we observed the presence of tubular blood vessels at the center of vROs. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the vascularization in ROs was associated with angiogenesis and immune response. Furthermore, we observed that MGs in VOs migrated and integrated into the vROs as VOs and ROs fused, with the vROs exhibiting responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. The vROs expressed tight junction protein claudin-5 and displayed similar characteristics to the inner blood-retinal barrier (iBRB). These vRO models, which incorporate vascular structures and MGs, provide an alternate avenue for retinal vascular disease research and hold promise for future clinical applications.},

Comparing to the lamellar structures formed at noncatalyzed electrodes, Li 2 S deposited at Pt catalytic electrode exhibited a spherical morphology. The zero-order reaction kinetics was captured on catalytic surfaces, differing from noncatalyzed electrodes. The electrodeposition of Li 2 S follows the overpotential-driven progressive and instantaneous nucleation processes, showing a promoted deposition and reversible dissolution at the overpotential of 80 mV. The Li 2 S transformation under high polysulfides concentrations indicated that an increase of catalytic sites and uniform distribution of Li 2 S would be critical for practical Li-S batteries.

We demonstrate the existence of a quantum limit cycle in phase space in the absence of a drive and the occurrence of quantum synchronization when the nonlinear oscillator is externally driven. We additionally show that synchronization can be enhanced with the help of squeezing perpendicular to the direction of the drive and, counterintuitively, linear dissipation. We also observe the bifurcation to a bistable phase-space distribution for large squeezing.

Valosin-containing protein (VCP), an enzyme implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, is essential for SG disassembly, but whether and how this process is coordinated with SG assembly remains unclear. Here, we identify the VCP cofactor, Alveolar soft part sarcoma locus (ASPL) as a key regulator linking SG assembly and disassembly. ASPL promotes SG assembly by facilitating biomolecular condensation of Ras guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein-binding protein (G3BP) and stabilizing its interactions with other SG proteins. ASPL also facilitates phosphorylation and activation of VCP by UNC-51-like kinases 1 and 2 (ULK1/2), enabling G3BP extraction and efficient SG disassembly. Pathogenic VCP mutations that disrupt ASPL binding impair SG disassembly, a defect rescued by phosphomimetic mutations or ASPL depletion. Our findings suggest that disruptions in the ASPL-VCP interaction uncouple SG assembly and disassembly, representing a potential mechanism underlying VCP-associated neurodegenerative diseases.},

Here, we integrated biochemistry, multiscale cryo–electron microscopy, and AlphaFold modeling to investigate the architecture of the centriole. Using an improved centriole isolation method, we determined the structure of the A-C linker bound to microtubule triplets, which revealed how the A-C linker cross-links microtubules and integrates with the B-C junction. We found marked changes in the structure and composition of the A-C linker that correlate with the presence of other centriolar modules, including the pinhead, cartwheel, and inner scaffold.

  abstract     = {Phosphorus (P) limitation severely affects crop yields. To address the molecular basis of inorganic phosphate (Pi) specific transport within the sulfate transporter (SULTR) family, we determined the cryo–electron microscopy structures of Oryza sativa SULTR-like phosphorus distribution transporter (OsSPDT), a key Pi transporter for grain allocation, in apo- and Pi-binding states. OsSPDT forms a domain-swapped homodimer with each protomer containing an N-terminal domain (NTD), a transmembrane domain (TMD) divided into core and gate subdomains, and a C-terminal sulfate transporter and antisigma factor (STAS) domain. The structure adopts a cytoplasm-facing conformation with Pi coordinated at the core-gate interface. Key residues, including SPDT-unique Ser 170 , mediate Pi specificity within the binding pocket, distinguishing it evolutionarily from sulfate transporters within the SULTR family. Domain-swapping and mutational studies demonstrate functional interdependence of the NTD, TMD, and STAS domains. This work elucidates Pi selectivity in plant SULTR transporters and provides a molecular basis for developing low-phytate rice via OsSPDT gene editing.},

Ubiquitin-specific protease 21 (USP21), one of four major H2AK119-specific deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes. However, the mechanisms by which USP21 specifically deubiquitinates H2AK119ub and is regulated are unknown. We determined the cryo-EM structure of the USP21 catalytic domain bound to an H2AK119ub nucleosome, which revealed a recognition mode that differs from that of other H2AK119-specific DUBs. We unexpectedly found that the N-terminal IDR of USP21 inhibits the enzyme’s activity. Using AlphaFold-Multimer to perform a virtual screen of USP21 interactors, we identified kinases that phosphorylate the USP21 IDR and thereby relieve autoinhibition. AlphaFold3 modeling of USP21 suggests a structural model for autoinhibition. AlphaFold analysis suggests that phosphorylation-regulated autoinhibition may be a feature of various USP enzymes. These findings shed light on the mechanisms of H2AK119 deubiquitination and reveal a previously unexplored mode of phosphorylation-dependent DUB autoregulation.},

Nevertheless, little is known about the precise neural mechanisms governing the regulation of contagious pain in response to diverse environmental stressors. Here, we report that early life maternal separation (MS) precipitates impairments in the pain contagion between familiar partners. Specifically, we identify the indispensable role of glutamatergic projections from the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) to the prelimbic cortex (PrL) for the development of vicarious pain hypersensitivity. MS dampens activation of the PVT → PrL pathway during social interactions between observer and painful demonstrator. Augmenting the excitability or activity of the PVT → PrL circuit through chemogenetic interventions or tactile stimulation resembling social touch significantly ameliorates the MS-evoked contagious pain deficits. Collectively, our findings delineate a neural circuitry substrate underlying the loss of contagious pain stemming from MS and propose a potential therapeutic avenue for mitigating empathic impairments associated with early life adversity.},

The causative NLRs [resistance to Melanaphis sorghi 1A (RMES1A) and RMES1B] lack signaling domains and have adenosine triphosphatase mutations expected to abrogate function, suggesting that RMES1 NLRs regulate immunity via a noncanonical mechanism. The RMES1 NLR family is ancient, orthologous to phloem-feeding resistance genes in rice and syntenic across the grass superpangenome. Thus, gene birth-and-death processes at an ancient gene cluster created rare standing variation and provided the adaptive allele for evolutionary rescue.},

Gene duplication resulting from polyploidization offers insights into plant adaptation to environmental stress. Here, we reveal that extensive duplication of GhRALF30L , which encodes an intrinsically disordered small peptide, contributes to thermotolerance in cotton male reproductive organs. Polyploidization has driven the formation of 23 GhRALF30L genes in allotetraploid cotton, whereas only four or five homologs are identified in its two diploid ancestors. Expression and functional analyses confirm that GhRALF30L regulates thermotolerance in a dosage-dependent manner, with reduced dosage decreasing heat resistance. Under heat stress, GhRALF30L interacts with GhFERA1/GhCAPA1 and enhances their condensation at the plasma membrane, which activates heat stress responses by up-regulating the expression of heat shock factors ( HSFs ), heat shock proteins ( HSPs ), and reactive oxygen species scavenging genes. Our findings demonstrate that the GhRALF30L gene cluster, resulting from polyploidization, confers thermotolerance through facilitating the condensation of GhFERA1/GhCAPA1.},

We found that loss of clh-1 extends life span, improves stress resistance, reduces neuronal damage, and extends health span. These effects are linked to protective pathways, including those for oxidative stress and autophagy, and depend on the DAF-16/FoxO transcription factor. Notably, by knocking down and overexpressing the carbonic anhydrase cah-4 , we show that it is the glial alkalinization caused by loss of clh-1 that mediates these protective effects.

We developed an automated radio frequency identification (RFID) tracking system to continuously collect behavioral data from entire colonies, monitoring 102 individuals from five colonies for 30 days. Based on behavioral parameters, we statistically identified distinct behavioral phenotypes, comprising one cluster for breeders and six clusters for nonbreeders. Breeders formed strong social bonds, consistently remaining close in activity rhythm synchrony, spatial proximity, and directional following. In contrast, nonbreeders exhibited behavioral heterogeneity according to their cluster: One cluster avoided other active nonbreeders, whereas another cluster attracted frequent following.

Through the IL-27–IL-27 receptor interaction, these IL-27/CXCL10-producing B cells targeted CD40-activated B cells in vitro and, upon induction by immunization and viral infection, optimized antibody responses and antiviral immunity in vivo. Also present in breast cancer tumors and retained there through CXCL10-CXCR3 interaction–mediated self-targeting, these cells promoted B cell PD-L1 expression and immune evasion. Mechanistically, Il27 and Cxcl10 transcription was induced by synergizing Toll-like receptor (TLR) and CD40 signals and driven by coinduced transcription factor BATF3, which directly targeted these genes.

Analyzing two decades of seismicity (2005–2024) across three crustal sectors, we distinguished magma recharge from the mantle, its transfer and storage at intermediate depths, and final ascent to the surface. Moreover, we found that b value time variations can precede geochemical anomalies from magma ascent and its eruption by a few months.

This enhancement enables precise modulation of key device characteristics, including readout current, hysteresis window, and charge storage capacity, with quantitative behavior accurately modeled by the Poole-Frenkel effect.

The machine learning strategy identified microdroplet size as the key parameter controlling electric field strength, product yield, and selectivity. In our lab-based scaled-up system, microdroplets <10 micrometers improved performance by four to seven orders of magnitude over bulk-phase systems, achieving ~99% methanol selectivity. Strong interfacial electric fields stabilize intermediates and modulate carbon-oxygen bond lengths, directing pathways to high-value products.

  abstract     = {Nicotine is the predominant alkaloid in tobacco leaves and affects the human nervous system by interacting with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Chronic nicotine exposure leads to nAChR desensitization, while nicotine withdrawal leads to nAChR recovery. However, detailed molecular mechanisms underlying nicotine-induced nAChR desensitization and its recovery remain elusive. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the α7 nAChR in complex with nicotine in both an open state and multiple desensitized states. Comparative analyses reveal progressive conformational changes during recovery from nicotine-induced desensitization and show that asymmetric nicotine binding disrupts the symmetry of the channel pore at the 16′ and 17′ sites. Integrating these findings with patch-clamp recordings and computational simulations, we identify an agonist-free structure that represents an atypical desensitized state closely resembling the resting conformation of α7 nAChR. These detailed mechanistic studies enhance our understanding of nicotine’s effects on α7 nAChRs.},

  abstract     = {Metazoans suppress transposons via small RNA–mediated silencing, but ciliates physically eliminate transposons from somatic genomes. Here, we report the high-quality germline genome assembly of a marine ciliate Euplotes vannus , where ~80% are transposons and other germline-specific DNA that has to be precisely eliminated during soma development. We demonstrate that a class of soma-derived 30-nucleotide small RNAs precisely targets nontransposon DNA against elimination during this process. Small RNA–mediated targeting remains functional across varying small RNA lengths and is compatible with heterozygous sites. These small RNAs are cleaved by Dicer-like ribonuclease from long noncoding RNAs, which are bidirectionally transcribed of somatic chromosomes, initiated at subtelomeric chromosome breakage sequences (5′-TTGAA-3′). On the basis of these findings and time-course transcriptomic profiling, we propose a model elucidating the molecular mechanism of DNA elimination in Euplotes . These findings provide insights into the role of small RNAs in transmitting genetic information across generations and maintaining genome stability.},

We engineered a Caenorhabditis elegans model with a hyperactive 20 S proteasome (α3ΔN) for selective 20 S activation. α3ΔN markedly enhanced IDP and misfolded protein degradation, reduced oxidative damage, and improved endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation (ERAD). Aggregation-prone substrates such as vitellogenins and human alpha-1 antitrypsin (ATZ) were efficiently cleared. Integrated proteomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal systemic adaptations featuring increased protein turnover and oxidative stress resistance independent of superoxide dismutases (SODs). Notably, α3ΔN extended life span and stress resistance independently of canonical unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling via xbp-1 . These findings substantiate a “20 S pathway” of proteostasis that directly alleviates protein aggregation and oxidative stress, offering a promising therapeutic angle for neurodegenerative diseases.},

We here derive an exact formula for the efficiency of any cyclically driven quantum engine by using generalized laws of quantum thermodynamics that account for all possible correlations between all involved parties, including initial correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of two basic modes of engine operation: the usual thermal case, where heat is converted into work, and an athermal regime, where work is extracted from entropic resources, such as system-bath correlations. In the latter regime, the efficiency is not bounded by the usual Carnot formula. Our results provide a unified formalism to determine the efficiency of correlated microscopic quantum machines.},

K. rhaeticus produces the bacterial cellulose (BC) matrix that integrates Bacillus spores within, whereas the confined spores keep dormant and are resistant to harsh conditions in the environment. Bacillus spores can germinate and confer desired functions to the materials. Modulating the binding affinity of spores to the BC matrix with genetic engineering can improve cell loading and therefore enhance the material functionality.

Here, we uncover a critical role for the ATM-TRMT10A-BRCA1 signaling axis in regulating homologous recombination (HR) repair and PARPi sensitivity. We demonstrate that ATM phosphorylates TRMT10A at serine-28 after DNA damage, promoting BRCA1 recruitment and efficient HR repair. TRMT10A deletion disrupts HR repair, sensitizing cells to PARPis. Moreover, TRMT10A is up-regulated in mCRPC through stabilization by USP10. Targeting USP10 with spautin-1 induces TRMT10A degradation and enhances tumor sensitivity to PARPis in cell-derived xenografts and patient-derived xenograft models. These findings identify TRMT10A as a therapeutic vulnerability in mCRPC and demonstrate that combined inhibition of PARP and USP10 offers a promising synthetic lethal strategy for a broader group of patients lacking classical BRCA mutations.},

NLPs disrupt plant membranes through interactions with glycosylinositol phosphorylceramides (GIPCs), but the specificity of these interactions remains unclear. We studied binding and pore formation of NLPs in model membranes with GIPCs derived from dicotyledonous or monocotyledonous plants. Using the cytotoxic NLP 2 from fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa (MpNEP2), we show that membrane binding and damage extend beyond previously studied oomycetal NLPs. Furthermore, NLP Pya from the oomycete Pythium aphanidermatum exhibits promiscuous binding with a marked preference for branched GIPC series B lipids. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the structural plasticity of NLP Pya provides a rational basis for its interaction with a variety of GIPC headgroups. These results clarify the molecular basis of NLP cytotoxicity and emphasize their role in broad-spectrum pathogenicity.},

Here, we further dissect the molecular characteristics of this system and reveal the involvement of a phase-separated compartment in pairing. Focusing on the PC protein HIM-8, we explored its functional domains in vivo and its self-multimerizing properties in vitro. We find that the amino-terminal domain facilitates PC chromatin binding of the carboxyl-terminal domain, whereas the middle unstructured region is essential for PC association with the nuclear envelop (NE). Integrated analyses suggest that PC-NE association is mediated by a DNA-containing phase-separated compartment that is spatially distinct from, but connected to, the chromosome axis—likely through flexible linkages. We propose that homology evaluation occurs within this compartment, where direct DNA-DNA interactions could play a role.},

Here, we use deep learning and two decades’ worth of orbital images to track the global, diurnal, and seasonal migration patterns of dust devils across Mars, providing a distributed characterization of the dynamics of near-surface winds. Across Mars, derived wind stresses systematically exceed those predicted by global circulation models and frequently surpass the threshold required to initiate particle saltation and the lifting of dust. We identify instances of fast-moving dust devils, indicating strong near-surface winds, that are colocated with large-scale dust lifting events and storms. Our observations show that strong near-surface winds are abundant on Mars and play an important role in atmospheric dust sourcing, directly informing more accurate models of Mars’ atmosphere, weather, and climate.},

During normal replication, p21 promotes nascent DNA synthesis alongside the DNA polymerase iota (Pol ι)/p53 complex. When p21 is down-regulated but detectable, nascent DNA tracks are longer and discontinuous and rely on primase and DNA polymerase (PrimPol). With the complete elimination of p21, nascent DNA tracks become shorter and continuous and depend on Pol kappa (κ). Endogenous p21 levels are critical for genomic stability, as both PrimPol- and Pol κ–mediated syntheses can induce chromosomal instability. The residual expression of p21 in p53-null cells influences the involvement of PrimPol or Pol κ in nascent DNA synthesis and subsequent chromosomal instability. Our results demonstrate that endogenous levels of p21 in cycling cells, insufficient for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition, prevent genomic instability through proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding (PCNA), limiting PrimPol and Pol κ’s role in nascent DNA synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Network methods capture the interplay between structure and dynamics of complex systems across scales by modeling indirect interactions as random walks. However, path data from real-world systems frequently exhibit memory effects that this first-order Markov model fails to capture. Although higher-order Markov models can capture these effects, they grow rapidly in size and require large amounts of data, making them prone to overfitting some parts and underfitting others in systems with uneven coverage. To address this challenge, we construct concise networks from path data by interpolating between first-order and second-order Markov models. We prioritize simplicity and interpretability by creating state nodes that capture prominent second-order effects and by proposing a transparent measure that balances model size and quality. Our concise networks reveal large-scale memory patterns in both synthetic and real-world systems while remaining far simpler than full second-order models.},

Herein, we present a photoactivatable immunostimulator based on nanoengineered microalgae (PCC@AuNP) to simultaneously enhance tumor immunogenicity and remodel the TME. Mechanistically, photocatalytically generated hydrogen induces robust immunogenic cell death by triggering severe endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Concurrently, photosynthetic oxygen production and photocatalytic lactic acid depletion collaboratively alleviate immunosuppression within the TME, thereby enhancing cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity by reducing the infiltration of immunosuppressive cells and promoting the repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages from the M2 to the M1 phenotype. In vivo studies demonstrate that PCC@AuNP not only eradicates primary tumors but also elicits potent systemic antitumor immunity against distant lesions, without observable toxicity to healthy tissues. Collectively, this innovative PCC@AuNP platform offers a safe and effective therapeutic strategy, heralding a pioneering era of cascade-augmented gas-driven cancer immunotherapy with superior precision and biosafety.},

Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 integrates innate immune signals following diet-induced obesity to promote glucose homeostasis through the induction of mitophagy. Whereas TRAF6 was dispensable for pancreatic β cell function at baseline, TRAF6 was pivotal for insulin secretion, mitochondrial respiration, and mitophagy following metabolic stress in mouse and human islets. TRAF6 was critical for the recruitment and function of the ubiquitin-mediated (Parkin-dependent) mitophagy machinery. Glucose intolerance induced by TRAF6 deficiency following metabolic stress was reversed by concomitant Parkin deficiency by relieving obstructions in receptor-mediated (Parkin-independent) mitophagy. Our results establish that TRAF6 is vital for traffic through Parkin-mediated mitophagy and implicates TRAF6 in the cross-regulation of ubiquitin- and receptor-mediated mitophagy. Together, we illustrate that β cells engage innate immune signaling to adaptively respond to a diabetogenic environment.},

Integrative analysis revealed highly cell type–specific regulatory elements and enabled the reconstruction of the gene regulatory network governing differentiation. We identified putative candidate regulons, such as ELK3, enriched in pro–B cells and potentially involved in cell cycle progression. Regulons from bulk data were projected onto single-cell data, validating their activity and refining the regulatory landscape.

Overexpression of the immunostimulatory cytokine TNFSF14/LIGHT associates with improved survival and correlates with increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients and a clinically relevant model of colorectal liver metastases. We demonstrate that LIGHT monotherapy activates T cells, but also induces T cell exhaustion and the recruitment of immunosuppressive elements. As colorectal liver metastases exhibit high levels of CTLA-4 expression, we combined LIGHT overexpression with anti-CTLA-4, leading to complete tumor control. The combination functions by homing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, inducing tumor antigen-specific T cells, and reversing T cell exhaustion. Whereas both LIGHT overexpression and anti-CTLA-4 increase tumor-promoting macrophages, the combination eliminates this population. The ability of LIGHT overexpression combined with CTLA-4 inhibition to reverse T cell exhaustion and myeloid cell suppression is supported by analysis of complementary patient cohorts and has strong clinical relevance, especially given that liver metastases contribute to immunotherapy resistance across various cancer types.},

They are typically derived from secondary formation, which is generated through atmospheric chemical reactions involving precursor compounds, such as phenolic compounds. However, information on NAC formation mechanisms remains limited. Here, we found that particulate-phase NAC concentrations were notably affected by relative humidity (RH) in field observations. Smog chamber experiments indicated that RH could influence NAC formation via changes in gaseous water concentration, rather than solely through aerosol liquid water content. Theoretical calculations further clarified that water clusters (WCs), formed from gaseous water, can notably lower reaction energy barriers along the NAC formation pathway, rendering this pathway competitive under atmospheric conditions. Hence, we propose a potential mechanism in which WCs catalyze NAC formation, offering a previously unidentified perspective on atmospheric secondary aerosol formation.},

Here, we analyzed 217 global marine food webs, quantifying structural properties and multidimensional stability to evaluate how diversity and structure jointly influence stability. Our analyses reveal that diversity is consistently linked to stability through dual pathways: positively associated with resistance and resilience via indirect structural mediation, yet negatively correlated with local stability unless interaction strength is accounted for. Critically, omitting structural mediation yields a net negative diversity-stability correlation, whereas integrating food web structure uncovers context-dependent positive relationships, underscoring structural metrics as pivotal explanatory variables. Our findings reconcile the diversity-stability debate by showing that the food web structure mediates context-dependent stability outcomes—integrating direct and indirect pathways resolves contradictions and advances actionable metrics for conservation strategies resilient to environmental changes.},

Combined with our parameter-efficient miniset self-attention block, this enables QuAN to access high-order moments of bit-string distributions and preferentially attend to less noisy snapshots. We test QuAN across three quantum simulation settings: driven hard-core Bose-Hubbard model, random quantum circuits, and toric code under coherent and incoherent noise. QuAN directly learns entanglement and state complexity growth from experimental computational basis measurements, including complexity growth in random circuits from noisy data. In regimes inaccessible to existing theory, QuAN unveils the complete phase diagram for noisy toric code data as a function of both noise types, highlighting AI’s transformative potential for assisting quantum hardware.},

Existing theories propose different mechanisms for these patterns, but no single mechanism has successfully explained both. However, the planetary parameters of the four Solar System giant planets suggest that a fundamentally different mechanism is unlikely. In this study, we show that convection-driven columnar structures can account for both eastward and westward equatorial jets, framing the phenomenon as a bifurcation. Consequently, both superrotation and subrotation emerge as stable branches of the same mechanistic solution. Our analysis of these solutions uncovers similarities in the properties of equatorial waves and the leading-order momentum balance. This study suggests that the fundamental dynamics governing equatorial jet formation may be more broadly applicable across the Jovian planets than previously believed, offering a unified explanation for their two distinct zonal wind patterns.},

  abstract     = {Remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D) can occur after hypocaloric diet, bariatric surgery, or pharmacological treatments and associates with improved β cell function. Here, we studied islets from nondiabetic ( n = 15) and T2D ( n = 21) donors. We examined whether T2D β cell dysfunction can be rescued, charted the underlying molecular mechanisms by RNA sequencing, and mined transcriptomes for drug targets. Glucose responsiveness of T2D β cells improved in 60% of preparations after 3-day culture in euglycemic conditions. This was accompanied by changes in expression of >400 genes involved in functional or inflammatory pathways. Drug repurposing and target identification analyses predicted chemical and genetic hits, including JAK inhibitors, which were validated in a β cell line, human islets, and db/db mice. Therefore, defective β cell glucose responsiveness in T2D can recover, demonstrating β cell functional plasticity. The recovery associates with transcriptomic traits, pointing to targetable defects to induce T2D remission.},

  abstract     = {Airflow detection while smelling is a fundamental requirement for olfaction, yet the mechanisms underlying such multimodal processing in the olfactory system remain unknown. We report here that mice can accurately discriminate airflow in the absence of whiskers. Modulated sniffing and refined calcium signaling in the olfactory bulb inhibitory network during olfactory anemo-discriminations confirmed the orthonasal airflow information processing. Genetic perturbation of AMPAR function and optogenetic control bidirectionally shifted the anemo-discrimination learning pace, with contrasting phenotypes observed for odor learning, engagement of inhibitory circuits, and setting the optimal inhibition level for stimulus refinement. Enhanced learning caused by multimodal odor-airflow stimuli at subthreshold levels confirmed the heightened olfactory perception by mechanical stimuli. Our results thus explain the multimodality of olfaction and reveal the unexplored dimensionality of odor perception.},

The microbiota community determines the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in cancer immunotherapy; however, mechanisms able to improve this function are not known. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released by the microbiota restricts the sIgA repertoire by limiting T follicular helper (T FH ) cell activity in the Peyer’s patches via stimulation of the ionotropic P2X7 receptor. We show that sIgA amplification by oral administration of the ATP hydrolyzing enzyme apyrase corrects enteropathic features of ICB and improves therapeutic efficacy. Consistent with sIgA function in reshaping the gut ecosystem and enhancing ICB, IgA −/− mice did not show any improvement of antitumor response by apyrase administration. Mechanistically, data in mice and patients with cancer suggest that invigorated enterotropic cytotoxic T cells expressing the chemokine receptor CCR9 replenish the tumor microenvironment in a CCL25-mediated manner and control tumor growth, resulting in improved ICB efficacy.},

Although charge carrier mobility in single-crystalline organic semiconductors (OSCs) reaches 10 square centimeters per volt per second (cm 2 V −1 s −1 ), it is predominantly limited by molecular vibrations excited at room temperature. The extent to which mobility in single-crystalline OSCs can be increased remains a central question. Here, we demonstrate charge transport in a clean two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG) in uniaxially strained, single-crystalline OSCs at cryogenic temperatures, with minimized lattice vibrations. Hall effect measurements reveal a mobility of 117 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at 2 kelvin under 2.8% compressional strain, with an extraordinarily large piezoresistive effect and low sheet resistivity of 550 ohms, one-fifth of the lowest resistivity in unstrained samples. These clean systems offer opportunities to explore intrinsic strain-induced charge transport physics, where condensed matter phenomena, characterized by weakly bonded molecular orbitals, combine electronic correlation and lattice degrees of freedom.},

Analysis of this structure, together with structure-guided mutagenesis and functional assays, reveals how GOLPH3 uses coincidence detection of COPI and lipids to engage Golgi residents preferentially at late cisternae. Our findings rationalize the logic of cisternal maturation and explain how COPI can engage different types of substrates in different Golgi cisternae to retrieve some proteins back to the ER while retaining others within the Golgi apparatus.},

Here, we present a sequential phase-switching adhesion strategy using shape memory polymers (SMPs) to facilitate full-cycle capture operations. The engineered SMP-frame adhesive structure captures targets with normalized kinetic energies exceeding 3800 joules per square meter, empowered by the intrinsic viscoelasticity of the material to provide both strong energy dissipation and rapid adhesive interface strengthening. The dynamic strengthening mechanism delays crack propagation and greatly enhances detachment toughness, enabling unprecedented rebound suppression within the short timescales of collision. The adhesive-integrated system successfully performs dynamic capture, manipulation, and release under free-floating conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the sequential phase-switching adhesion strategy.

In this study, we use cutting-edge experimental techniques to probe the pressure evolution of the relaxation spectrum in a Zr 46.8 Ti 8.2 Cu 7.5 Ni 10 Be 27.5 metallic glass across gigapascal pressure ranges. Our findings reveal two distinct relaxation mechanisms under high pressure: In the β-relaxation regime, compression drives the system with reduced atomic mobility and enhanced structural disorder, without appreciable density changes. Conversely, α-relaxation under pressure promotes density-driven structural ordering that improves thermal stability. Notably, the transition between these regimes occurs at a constant T / T g,P ratio, independent of applied pressure. These results provide crucial insights for decoupling the competing structural and relaxation contributions to glass stability, establishing a systematic framework for tailoring glass properties through controlled thermomechanical processing.},

Nef is a multifunctional, immunomodulatory protein that downmodulates cell surface proteins, including CD4 and MHC class I (MHC-I), which are important for T cell–mediated immunity. In addition, Nef also regulates cell-intrinsic immunity—Nef boosts the infectivity of virions produced and released from HIV-infected cells, at least in part, by counteracting the antiviral activity of transmembrane proteins SERINC3 and SERINC5. Here, we show that Nef proteins derived from many primary isolates of HIV-1 restore infectivity in interferon-treated cells and confer resistance to the antiviral protein interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) in a SERINC3/5-independent manner. Using Nef derived from primary HIV-1 clade C infection, we found that Nef interacts with IFITM3 in membranes, reduces IFITM3 incorporation into HIV-1 virions, and restores HIV-1 fusion with target cells. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized immunomodulatory role for Nef in the setting of the interferon-induced antiviral state during HIV-1 infection.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of internet of things, big data, and artificial intelligence is propelling sports science into a data-driven era, demanding real-time, multidimensional athletic performance monitoring. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have demonstrated exceptional potential in intelligent sports. However, the complexity and volume of TENG-generated data pose challenges for manual analysis. Machine learning (ML), with strengths in pattern recognition and adaptive processing, provides a powerful solution to enhance TENG-based sensing signal interpretation. This review systematically explores the integration of ML and TENG technology for intelligent sports. First, the fundamental theory and basic knowledge of TENGs are introduced, highlighting their versatility in sports sensing systems. Subsequently, a comprehensive overview of ML models for TENG signal analysis is discussed. Recent advancements of ML-assisted TENG-based intelligent sports applications, including sports training evaluation, sports health monitoring, and virtual/augmented reality sports, are then highlighted. Last, current challenges and future prospects of TENG-based intelligent sports systems are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Intracellular Ca 2+ controls various cellular functions, and local Ca 2+ dynamics are tightly regulated upon environmental cues. How cellular Ca 2+ balance is maintained during stress remains unresolved. Here, we identify an intracellular phosphoregulatory module comprising calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK)–ER-type Ca 2+ -ATPases 1 (ECA1) that integrates [Ca 2+ ] cyt flux with abscisic acid (ABA) homeostasis to modulate root growth under osmotic stress. Pharmacological and genetic disruption of ECA1-mediated Ca 2+ efflux triggered enhanced [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients and [ABA] cyt , exacerbating root growth hypersensitivity to osmotic stress. Biochemical assays reveal that CPK2/6/11 directly bind and phosphorylate ECA1, enhancing its Ca 2+ -pumping activity to restore cytosolic Ca 2+ equilibrium and subsequently prevent ABA cyt overaccumulation. Genetic analysis shows that eca1cpk11 phenocopied eca1 hypersensitivity, while triple and quadruple mutants amplified osmotic sensitivity, demonstrating that CPKs and ECA1 function as a cooperative phosphoregulatory hub regulating Ca 2+ signaling and root growth. Our work resolves a critical gap by elucidating how plants couple ionic and hormonal messengers to balance plant growth and stress resilience.},

During ischemia, mammalian CI transitions from a turnover-ready, structurally “closed” state toward a dormant “open” state that prevents it from functioning in reverse during reperfusion to produce reactive oxygen species. Unfortunately, simpler, genetically tractable CI models do not recapitulate the same regulatory behavior, compromising mechanistic studies. Here, we report the structure of isolated CI from the yeast Pichia pastoris ( Pp -CI) and identify distinct closed and open states that resemble those of mammalian CI. Notably, a hitherto-unknown protein (NUQM) completes an interdomain bridge in only the closed state, implying that NUQM stabilizes it by restricting the conformational changes of opening. The direct correlation of NUQM binding with closed/open status in Pp -CI provides opportunities for investigating regulatory mechanisms relevant to reversible catalysis and ischemia-reperfusion injury.},

Mitochondria are also a key source of intracellular ROS, yet their contribution to plant immunity is poorly characterized. Here, we studied mitochondrial ROS (mROS) function in plant-pathogen interactions, deploying genetically encoded sensors, assorted fluorescent markers, and genetic approaches to track mROS, specifically H 2 O 2 , dynamics and identify interorganelle contact sites. We unexpectedly found a mitochondria–endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ROS signal cascade functioning independently of apoplastic and chloroplastic ROS in plant immunity. mROS initiate immune responses induced by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora parasitica and promote mitochondria-ER association. These enhanced mitochondria-ER membrane associations are required for transfer of mROS signals and initiation of extensive unfolded protein responses. We conclude that mROS transfer via mitochondria-ER membranes to the ER lumen is an underappreciated yet essential component in plant defense.},

Like humans, 72% of mammals exhibited a female life expectancy advantage, while 68% of birds showed a male advantage, as expected from the harmful effects of sex chromosomes described by the heterogametic sex hypothesis. Yet, sex differences varied widely. In zoos, we found strong evidence that this variation generally correlated with both the mating system and sexual size dimorphism. Although with weaker evidence, the patterns remained consistent in populations from the wild, with an even larger effect of the mating system. Thus, even in zoos, where environmental pressures are largely reduced, precopulatory sexual selection seems to play a fundamental role in shaping sex differences in life expectancy in mammals and birds.},

In contrast, two-dimensional materials, with their all-surface nature, offer a platform for tuning quantum emitters via chemical functionalization. Because of its semiconducting properties that enable electrical addressability, monolayer WSe 2 is a promising candidate for quantum emission, although the complex interplay between point defects and the localized strain needed to activate quantum emission leads to poor spectral purity. Here, we demonstrate that functionalizing monolayer WSe 2 with conformal adlayers of 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) improves quantum emission spectral purity. Optical spectroscopy reveals that PTCDA functionalization lowers defect activation energies by 10 meV and induces a 30 nm redshift in quantum emission wavelength, while preserving the bright and dark exciton energies of monolayer WSe 2 . First-principles calculations corroborate these findings, thus providing molecular-level insight into the underlying mechanism of enhanced spectral purity.},

This approach provided the first quantitative and spatial analysis of the translational machinery within stress granules. Our findings suggest that stress granules have a limited impact on global translation regulation but serve to protect small ribosomal subunits and preinitiation complexes from degradation. Numerical simulations based on a phase-field model accurately reproduced the spatial distribution of ribosomal components inside and outside the stress granules, shedding light on the thermodynamic principles governing this process.},

Experimental studies supported by approximate numerical treatments that severely coarse-grain the vibrational environment have claimed the absence of long-lived quantum effects. Here, we report the nonperturbative, accurate microscopic model simulations of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex and demonstrate the presence of long-lived excitonic coherences at 77 kelvin and room temperature, which persist on picosecond timescales, similar to those of excitation energy transfer. Furthermore, we show that full microscopic simulations of nonlinear optical spectra are essential for identifying experimental evidence of quantum effects in photosynthesis, as approximate theoretical methods can misinterpret experimental data and potentially overlook quantum phenomena.},

Comprehensive magnetostratigraphic sampling shows highly variable directions, consistent with a rapidly changing geomagnetic field along a longitudinally preferred band. High-precision geochronology constrains the geomagnetic variability to ~568 to 562 million years and suggests rates that are likely too rapid for true polar wander or plate tectonic interpretations. Comparison of igneous- and sedimentary-derived data, using a new statistical approach combining Bingham and Fisher distributions, indicates a high-inclination paleomagnetic direction that is compatible with independent evidence for regional glaciation.

In this study, we demonstrate how chronic stress alters region-specific O-glycosylation across multiple brain regions, with a particular focus on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Our findings reveal significant changes in sialylated O-glycosylation patterns mediated by St3gal1 , a sialyltransferase essential for O-glycosylation. Notably, knockdown of St3gal1 in nonstressed mice induced depressive-like behaviors, whereas its overexpression in stressed mice alleviated depressive symptoms, underscoring its regulatory role in stress resilience. In addition, we identify potential glycoprotein targets and downstream regulators of St3gal1 , including neurexin 2 (NRXN2) in the medial PFC (mPFC), offering insights into molecular pathways linking O-glycosylation to depressive-like behaviors.},

  abstract     = {The uterine cervix is a critical mucosal interface that balances immune defense and reproductive function, yet how its distinct epithelial compartments coordinate responses to infection remains unclear. Here, we integrate patient-derived three-dimensional cervical organoids, single-cell transcriptomics, and native tissue analysis to construct a high-resolution atlas of epithelial cell diversity and immune dynamics during Chlamydia trachomatis infection. We demonstrate that cervical organoids closely resemble native tissue at transcriptional and cellular levels, identifying epithelial subtypes with region-specific immune specializations. Upon infection, ectocervical epithelia reinforce barrier integrity, whereas endocervical epithelia, particularly uninfected bystander cells, exhibit extensive transcriptional reprogramming characterized by robust interferon activation, antigen presentation, and antimicrobial defense. Infection profoundly reshapes epithelial intercellular communication, positioning bystander cells as major contributors to signaling networks coordinating immune responses and tissue regeneration. Our findings highlight a sophisticated epithelial-intrinsic immune network critical for cervical mucosal defense and establish a physiologically relevant platform for studying host-pathogen interactions and guiding targeted mucosal therapies against reproductive tract infections and pathologies.},

This ability gives pathogens a competitive edge over commensal microbiota, which can drive virulence in the inflamed gut. Despite such a critical function, the molecular mechanisms underlying the synthesis of Eut BMCs remain elusive. We report a systematic study for dissecting the molecular basis underlying Eut BMC assembly in Salmonella . We determined the functions of individual constituent proteins in the structure and function of Eut BMCs and demonstrated that EutQ is essential for cargo encapsulation and Eut BMC formation through specific association with the shell and cargo enzymes. We found that Eut proteins can self-assemble to form cargo and shell aggregates independently in vivo and that the biogenesis of Eut BMCs follows a “shell-initiated” pathway. Cargo enzymes exhibit dynamic liquid-like organization within the Eut BMC. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the structure and assembly of the Eut BMC that serves as a paradigm for membraneless organelles.},

Glaciers in the western United States are projected to disappear by 2100 CE, but whether they were previously absent in the current interglacial (past 11,700 years) remains debated. Here, we present evidence that two of the largest glaciers in California’s Sierra Nevada near Yosemite National Park persisted throughout the Holocene. Cosmogenic in situ carbon-14 and beryllium-10 exposure dating in newly exposed proglacial bedrock indicates continuous Holocene cover, likely by ice. At a nearby smaller glacier, bedrock exposure-burial ages suggest glacier expansion at ~7 thousand years ago, earlier than previously recognized. Moraine exposure ages at these sites and the Sierra Nevada’s largest glacier are distributed across the past several thousand years, suggesting that glaciers were near their preindustrial extent for much of the late Holocene. These findings imply that a glacier-free Sierra Nevada is unprecedented since before the Holocene. Future alpine glacial environments in California are thereby likely a no-analog scenario within the current interglacial.},

Herein we demonstrate the first example of a carbene-catalyzed atroposelective dynamic kinetic acylation reaction via transient seven-membered cyclic hemiacetals. The key for the success of this reaction relies on the formation and configurational instability of the transient seven-membered cyclic hemiacetal intermediate. The axially chiral biaryl aldehyde products obtained via this method can undergo a series of further transformations. Notably, one of the axially chiral biaryl aldehyde products can be used as the key and common intermediate for the asymmetric synthesis of natural product steganone.

In lymphoid organs, the adult T reg pool is continuously replenished with cells generated at different ages. In contrast, the skin retains a large fraction of T regs that colonize the tissue during the neonatal period, with minimal turnover in adulthood. The liver, lungs, and colon exhibit intermediate T reg renewal dynamics. Notably, neonatal T regs that persist into adulthood display a more activated phenotype and express markers associated with tissue-resident T regs and type 2 immunity.

Here, we designed and developed pseudo-rhodamine electrochromic molecules through a “tandem all-in-one” synthetic strategy that covalently integrates three distinct functional units within a single molecule. This molecular architecture simultaneously achieves exceptionally high heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant and ultrahigh molar absorption coefficient. We verified the underlying electrochromic mechanism involving a two-electron redox process of pyridinecarboxylic acid derivative units coupled with reversible pseudo-rhodamine spirocyclization. By implementing this tandem all-in-one molecular engineering strategy, different functional subunits within the electrochromic molecule are mutually bonded to interact through alternating reaction sequences, enabling near-synchronous operation of individual units. The resulting electrochromic display demonstrates ultrafast response speeds (35 milliseconds for bleaching and 65 milliseconds for coloration), capable of smooth video playback and rapid switching between digital states. The design principle showcases a prospective design pathway for the development of ultrafast electrochromic video displays.},

In partnership with the Santa Clara County Public Defender’s Office, we randomly assigned 5709 public defender clients to either receive automated text message reminders (treatment) or not receive reminders (control). We found that reminders reduced warrants issued for missed court dates by ~20%, with 12.1% of clients in control issued a warrant compared to 9.7% of clients in treatment. Further, we found that incarceration from missed court dates dropped by a similar amount, from 6.6% in control to 5.2% in treatment.

Strains with a single-chromosome architecture, whether linear or circular, exhibited faster growth, enhanced stress tolerance, and greater interstrain competitiveness. In contrast, bipartite chromosome strains showed higher virulence gene expression and enhanced transient plant transformation efficiency, suggesting a pathogenic adaptation. Whole-transcriptome analysis revealed architecture-dependent gene expression patterns, underscoring the profound impact of chromosome organization on Agrobacterium fitness and virulence.

Overall, most warmwater species (65% of populations) exhibited increases in productivity from warming, while slightly more than half of the cool-/cold-water species (53% of populations) experienced reduced productivity. Populations closer to their carrying capacity showed greater resilience to warming. For the majority of populations (92%), fishing had a more pronounced effect on population dynamics than warming during the time period examined. Therefore, while warming is likely to increasingly threaten many fish populations, effective local fishery management remains a key lever to mitigate these impacts.},

We also show that the most exploited extinct taxa were at the apex of the ranking of the prey choice model. After the diversity and abundance of megafauna had already declined severely (~12,500 B.P.), and especially after they had virtually disappeared (~11,600 B.P.), the human diet was broadened. This strongly reinforces the idea that humans must be central to the debate on Quaternary extinctions in South America.},

  abstract     = {Clinical translation of therapeutic messenger RNA (mRNA) technologies, particularly in solid tumors, has been limited due to unavailability of effective delivery systems. Here, we describe an mRNA delivery system that overcomes current challenges by co-encapsulating gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and mRNA within non-ionic surfactant vehicles (NSVs) to create “Aurniosoves” (AuNSVs). Through in vitro and in vivo studies, we demonstrate that AuNSVs improve vector accumulation and uptake within the tumor, resulting in enhanced protein expression and therapeutic efficacy. Mechanistically, these effects are the result of an iterative delivery process in which AuNSVs enter cells initially through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and release AuNPs into the cytoplasm. AuNPs subsequently adsorb and inactivate cellular trafficking regulators PP2A and Rab7, producing two effects: (i) rapid entry of additional AuNSVs through activation of caveolin-mediated endocytosis (CvME) and (ii) endosomal escape through inhibited endolysosomal fusion. We propose that AuNSVs be exploited as next-generation mRNA delivery systems.},

This ensures both selective pressure against deleterious mutations and the high expression of the GOI. By leveraging a machine learning framework, we predict optimal GOI-EG pairs on the basis of bioinformatic and biophysical features, identify linkers likely to minimize protein misfolding, and optimize DNA sequences for stability and expression. Experimental validation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated substantial improvements in stability and productivity for fluorescent proteins and human proinsulin.

Under Pi-deficient conditions, etiolated seedlings exhibit elongated hypocotyls, shortened roots, and small, pale cotyledons—a morphological adaptation that enhances light-foraging capacity. However, how Pi is strategically distributed among these organs to optimize seedling establishment remains unclear. We here identify a PHR1-EIN3/EIL1 regulatory module that directs minimal Pi resources to suppress root elongation and cotyledon expansion or to accelerate greening, promoting Pi conservation. This mechanism prioritizes hypocotyl elongation to improve light acquisition. In contrast, under sufficient Pi supply, hypocotyl and root growth is promoted along with cotyledon enlargement, while greening is delayed. Thus, the PHR1-EIN3/EIL1 module enables efficient allocation of limited Pi to maximize hypocotyl elongation for light foraging during early seedling establishment while strategically restricting Pi usage in other organs to enhance overall survival.},

Although mitophagy is one of the main pathways involved in the clearance of damaged or old mitochondria, its coordination with mitochondrial biogenesis is poorly characterized. Here, by unbiased approaches including last-generation liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and transcriptomics, we identify the protein phosphatase PP2A-B55α/PPP2R2A as a Parkin-dependent regulator of mitochondrial number. Upon mitochondrial damage, PP2A-B55α determines the amplitude of mitophagy induction and execution by regulating both early and late mitophagy events. A few minutes after the insult, ULK1 is released from the inhibitory regulation of PP2A-B55α, whereas 2 to 4 hours later, PP2A-B55α promotes the nuclear translocation of TFEB, the master regulator of autophagy and lysosome genes, to support mitophagy execution. Moreover, PP2A-B55α controls a transcriptional program of mitochondrial biogenesis by stabilizing the Parkin substrate and PGC-1α inhibitor PARIS. PP2A-B55α targeting rescues neurodegenerative phenotypes in a fly model of Parkinson’s disease, thus suggesting potential therapeutic application.},

How FAK becomes activated in response to cell-ECM adhesive forces at single FAs to facilitate directional motion is poorly understood. Using micropillar-based force microscopy and FA-targeted FRET biosensors, we monitored real-time traction forces and FAK activity at individual FAs during assembly and disassembly. Our results demonstrate oscillatory temporal coupling of traction force and FAK activity in high-tension FAs before FA disassembly. Cross-correlation analyses revealed that force precedes FAK activation, guiding FA turnover. Atomistic molecular simulations unveiled a force-induced mechanism where traction forces disrupt autoinhibitory FERM-kinase interactions in FAK, enabling catalytic activity without structural unfolding. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the spatiotemporal integration of mechanical forces and biochemical signaling in cell migration.},

Here, we demonstrate unprecedented control to engineer Feshbach resonances at tunable positions via Floquet driving in a lithium-6 (^{6}Li) atom gas, achieved through strong magnetic field modulation at megacycles per second frequencies. This periodic modulation creates scattering resonances whenever dressed molecular levels cross the atomic threshold. By adding a second modulation at twice the base frequency, we tune the asymmetry of resonance loss profiles and suppress two-body losses from Floquet heating. This technique enhances control over atomic interactions, expanding possibilities for quantum simulations of complex systems and studies of exotic quantum phases.},

Loss of AMOC stability has been inferred from slowing recovery of temperature and salinity fluctuations over time. However, observational datasets, constructed from records with sparse spatial and temporal coverage, may introduce substantial biases in stability indicators. Alternative records are therefore needed for reliable stability assessments. Here, using bivalve-derived environmental reconstructions, we show that the subpolar North Atlantic has experienced two destabilization episodes over the past ~150 years. The first preceded the rapid circulation changes associated with the 1920s North Atlantic regime shift, suggesting that a tipping point may have been crossed in the early 20th century. The second and stronger destabilization began around 1950 and continues to the present, supporting evidence of recent stability loss and suggesting that the region is moving toward a tipping point.},

Here, we combine atomic-resolution imaging under in situ electrical biasing conditions with first-principles calculations to unravel the atomic-scale switching mechanisms in SnSe, a vdW group IV monochalcogenide. Our results uncover the coexistence of a consecutive 90° switching pathway and a direct 180° switching pathway from antiferroelectric (AFE) to FE order in this vdW system. Atomic-scale investigations and strain analysis reveal that the switching processes simultaneously induce interlayer sliding and compressive strain, while the lattice remains coherent despite the presence of multidomain structures. These findings elucidate vdW ferroelectric switching dynamics at atomic scale and lay the foundation for the rational design of 2D ferroelectric nanodevices.},

Compared to NC IMPBs, CC IMPBs have smaller, sulfur (S)–poor, highly siderophile element (HSE)–enriched cores and younger core formation ages. However, the origins of these differences remain debated. Using equilibrium partitioning models between the S-poor solid and the S-rich liquid metal, we argue that HSE enrichment in IID, IIF, IIIF, and IVB cores resulted from a multistage evolutionary sequence: (i) segregation of S-rich, HSE-depleted protocores during initial planetesimal heating; (ii) collisional disruption before S-poor metal segregation; (iii) reaccretion of mantle fragments into daughter planetesimals; and (iv) further 26 Al-driven heating producing HSE-enriched, S-poor cores. We suggest that iron meteorites from these CC IMPBs originate from such second-generation cores. Accounting for “missing” S-rich protocores helps reconcile several NC-CC IMPB differences and highlights the role of early collisional processing in shaping planetesimal chemical evolution.},

Unlike the others, diattenuation affects intensity in addition to phase and polarization, limiting the intrinsic correction capability of adaptive systems. In this work, we propose the use of optical skyrmions to probe diattenuation-aberrated systems and provide metrics that characterize the performance of vectorial adaptive optics (V-AO), with theoretical and experimental validations. Based on the probed results, we demonstrate V-AO correction under real-world aberrations for complex media imaging and analyze correction strategies to optimize measurements in aberrated polarimetric systems. This work paves the way for high-dimensional aberration correction, introduces a previously unidentified use of optical skyrmions, and provides insights that will aid the development of vectorial measurement systems.},

The unexpected observation of positive Seebeck coefficients in this regime indicates the presence of nontrivial electron correlations. Furthermore, our comprehensive investigation across the superconducting dome reveals that the evolution of (thermo)electric normal-state properties—specifically, the sign changes of the Hall and Seebeck coefficients—coincides with the evolution of superconducting anisotropy and pairing strength.

NKAPL acts as a transcriptional repressor of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolizing enzyme succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH). Nkapl deletion in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interneurons led to increased SSADH levels, reduced GABA concentration in the synaptic cleft, impaired inhibitory synaptic transmission, and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, the rs1635 mutation (T153N) caused similar effects as the Nkapl knockout. Reexpression of wild-type NKAPL or genetic knockdown of SSADH in mPFC interneurons restored the synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in Nkapl −/− mice. Our study indicates the potential role of NKAPL and SSADH in mPFC interneurons in neuronal mechanisms of learning and memory in mice.},

  abstract     = {The Tan contact is a pivotal quantity for characterizing many-body quantum systems, bridging microscopic correlations to macroscopic thermodynamic behavior. It is defined as the weight of universal 1 / k 4 momentum tails, but, so far, its direct measurement has been hindered in Bose gases due to interactions strongly altering time-of-flight imaging. Here, we report the first direct measurement of the Tan contact in a strongly correlated Lieb-Liniger gas. Leveraging the one-dimensional geometry of our system, we implement a two-stage expansion scheme, yielding interaction-immune imaging. Our results show good agreement with theoretical predictions and are consistent with a predicted universal scaling law. Our work paves the way for further characterization of the Lieb-Liniger gas across broad interaction regimes and holds promise for extension to other correlated quantum gases in confined geometries.},

To overcome these obstacles, we developed a carboplatin lock-designed MOF (Pt-MOFs@Glu) targeting intestinal macrophages for brain-directed drug transport. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses revealed that intestinal macrophages migrate to the brain in response to chemokines. Building on this insight, Pt-MOFs@Glu was designed to engage these cells for precise delivery. Comprising carboplatin, pyrazine-quinoxaline, and β-glucan, the system induces an “avalanche effect” in the CNSL microenvironment, promoting tumor apoptosis and inhibiting metastasis. Combining pyrazine-quinoxaline to lock carboplatin and β-glucan to boost targeting, immunity, and oral absorption, the system enables ROS-triggered drug release, efficiently crosses the gastrointestinal tract and BBB, and synergizes chemo-immunotherapy to enhance therapeutic efficacy. This approach redefines CNSL treatment by harnessing the gut-brain axis, offering a transformative pathway to overcoming therapeutic barriers and improving patient outcomes.},

Here, we investigate the impact of RAD21L deletion, a meiosis-specific cohesin subunit, on the 3D genome architecture and gene expression in the male germ line. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that RAD21L deficiency impairs meiotic chromatin organization and inter/intrachromosomal interactions. This conspicuous 3D genome reorganization also disrupts bouquet formation, resulting in increased telomeric interactions between heterologous chromosomes in primary spermatocytes. Genome reorganization was accompanied by detectable transcriptional dysregulation in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, mainly affecting sex chromosomes. Collectively, our findings establish the cohesin RAD21L as a germline-specific critical regulator of genome-wide 3D genome reorganization during spermatogenesis and a modulator of the male germline transcriptional landscape.},

At this sub-epsilon precision level, the half-life of 234 U is refined to 245,670 ± 260 years. For U-Th geochronology, systematic uncertainties from decay constants largely cancel, effectively reducing the uncertainty in the 234 U half-life to ~±25 years. This improved measurement precision consequently reduces total 2σ age uncertainties to ±3 thousand years (kyr) at ~600 thousand years ago (ka) and ±6 kyr at ~700 ka, a substantial improvement over earlier methods with uncertainties of tens of thousands of years.},

We propose an innovative causal criterion, knockoff conditional mutual information (KOCMI), to accurately infer interventional direct causality without prior knowledge of the network structure using either time-independent or time-series data. KOCMI performs knockoff operation on a variable as its virtual intervention, which preserves the original network structure, and then identifies the causality between two variables by estimating the distributional invariance before and after such a virtual intervention. We show that, algorithmically, KOCMI enables quantification of causal relationship, even for networks with loops, and, theoretically, is also consistent with the do-calculus causal analyses but without their prerequisite of the network structure. KOCMI shows superior performance on benchmark and real datasets, comparing with existing methods. Overall, KOCMI provides a powerful tool in inferring interventional causality, which is theoretically ensured and experimentally validated by real intervention data.},

To address these challenges, we conducted protein engineering on a previously unidentified glycosyltransferase, UGT75AJ2, which had 3′,7- O -glycosylation capabilities. Our approach involved three strategies: (i) development of a tailored focused rational iterative site-specific mutagenesis strategy, augmented by virtual screening and iterative mutagenesis, to design mutant Mut4-1 (S367A/V274A/F82V/I132T) with a 128-fold enhancement in relative catalytic activity; (ii) enhancement of the enzyme’s compatibility with a broader spectrum of sugar donors achieved through structural-based engineering, yielding mutant S14G/F366H/S367G and demonstrating effective utilization of diverse donors; (iii) construction of a targeted mutant library to enhance regioselectivity by active site analysis, leading to mutants with high selectivity for targeted glycosylation sites.

This finding is verified by the absence of a signal in a conventional type-II superconductor using the same setup and by ruling out the trapped-vortex effects through micro-Hall array measurements. Both the temperature dependence and the magnitude of the observed anomalous thermal Hall conductivity are quite different from those expected for the quantized thermal edge current of an intrinsic ATHE but consistent with extrinsic impurity-induced ATHEs in chiral superconductivity.

For mosquito-transmitted viruses like CHIKV, the potential for severe outbreaks is often assessed using climate-based estimates of the basic reproduction number, R 0 . We derived a large set of R 0 estimates for CHIKV by fitting a mechanistic model to data from 86 chikungunya outbreaks. These R 0 estimates were weakly predicted by climatic and other factors. Among deterministic drivers of outbreak severity, the contribution of R 0 was comparable to that of generation interval length, transmission distance, and population network structure. While aspects of chikungunya outbreak severity are predictable, innovative approaches are needed that look beyond the impacts of climate on R 0 .},

A hidden Markov model is sufficient to model these transitions and can be incorporated into a drift-diffusion model framework that has previously been used to model perceptual decision-making in larval zebrafish. Furthermore, we fit a mixture model of performance distributions and extract two latent variables termed “focus” and “competence” that are largely influenced by parents and environmental context, respectively.

The model integrates tide gauges, GPS, and satellite altimetry with past and future constraints on mountain glaciers, polar ice sheets, thermal expansion, ocean circulation, land water storage, and glacial history. By separating unforced ocean variability from long-term trends, we provide posterior estimates of sea level change and vertical land motion. The inclusion of local constraints reduces uncertainty in near-term local projections while producing global median projections and uncertainty ranges similar to those in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
