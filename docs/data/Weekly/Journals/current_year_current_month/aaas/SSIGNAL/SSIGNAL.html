  abstract     = {Although T helper 17 (T H 17) cells protect against infection, they can adopt a pathogenic state that drives autoimmunity. Papadopoulou et al . found that oxidative phosphorylation promoted the nonpathogenic T H 17 cell state in mice and depended on the activation of the kinase AMPK by the adenosine receptor A 2A R. AMPK reduced the abundance of the histone acetyltransferase PCAF, leading to reduced expression of genes involved in aerobic glycolysis and an increase in the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Disrupting this pathway enabled T H 17 cells to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice. —Annalisa M. VanHook Metabolic reprogramming controls protective and pathogenic T helper 17 (T H 17) cell responses. When naïve T cells are differentiated into T H 17 cells in vitro, the presence of the cytokine activin A promotes their maturation into a nonpathogenic state. Here, we found that nonpathogenic T H 17 cells induced by activin A displayed reduced aerobic glycolysis and increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In response to activin A, signaling through the adenosine A 2A receptor (A 2A R) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) enhanced OXPHOS and reprogrammed pathogenic T H 17 cells toward nonpathogenic states that did not induce central nervous system autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. In pathogenic T H 17 cells, the transcriptional coactivator p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) increased acetylation at histone 3 Lys 9 (H3K9ac) of genes involved in aerobic glycolysis and T H 17 pathogenic programs. In contrast, in nonpathogenic activin A–treated T H 17 cells, AMPK signaling suppressed PCAF-mediated H3K9ac modification of genes involved in aerobic metabolism and enhanced H3K9ac modification of genes involved in OXPHOS and nonpathogenic T H 17 programs. Together, our findings uncover A 2A R-AMPK signaling as a central metabolic checkpoint that suppresses T H 17 cell pathogenicity.},

Alamir et al. used a tumor cell–derived spheroid system to investigate the role of the coregulatory receptor TIM3 on murine and human cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). Imaging and functional studies showed that in the relatively immunosuppressive three-dimensional environment of spheroids, TIM3 inhibited CTL responses, whereas in two-dimensional systems, it played a costimulatory role. These findings suggest that TIM3 amplifies either inhibitory or stimulatory signals in T cells in a context-dependent manner, which could help inform the development of therapies that target it. —John F. Foley TIM3 is a coregulatory receptor that is highly abundant on multiple immune cell types, including T cells in response to prolonged exposure to antigen, and it marks functionally suppressed cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the tumor microenvironment. TIM3 exhibits inhibitory function in vivo but paradoxically has costimulatory T cell signaling capability in vitro. Here, we found that TIM3 directly inhibited the function of murine and human CTLs in direct interaction with target tumor cell spheroids. TIM3 regulated the ability of suppressed CTLs to polarize their actin cytoskeleton as a required step in cytolysis. Whereas the expression of the proposed TIM3 ligands CEACAM1 and galectin 9 in trans on target tumor cells enhanced TIM3 function, expression of CEACAM1 in cis on CTLs had the opposite effect. TIM3 functioned as an inhibitory receptor on spheroid-suppressed CTLs but not on active CTLs in a two-dimensional tissue culture model. Together, these data suggest that TIM3 enhances T cell function, serving as either a coinhibitory or costimulatory receptor depending on the functional context of the T cell on which it is expressed.},

Sealover et al. identified differential and complementary engagement of downstream MAPK and PI3K pathways among mutant and wild-type RAS members that demanded a combined approach to effectively stunt tumor development. In KRAS-mutant cells, for example, inhibition of PI3K, which was activated by wild-type HRAS and NRAS more than by mutant KRAS, was synergistically cytotoxic with a KRAS-mutant–specific inhibitor. The findings reveal the critical contribution of wild-type RAS family members in cancer cells with mutant RAS and the need for therapeutic approaches that simultaneously target both. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Mutated RAS proteins activate downstream effector pathways (RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT) to drive oncogenic transformation and progression. Because RAS family members differentially engage these pathways, combined inhibition of both pathways is required to effectively treat RAS -mutated cancers. Here, we found that this was due to signaling contributed by wild-type RAS family members that activated an effector pathway that was poorly engaged by the mutant RAS family member. Wild-type KRAS and NRAS promoted RAF-MEK-ERK signaling in cells expressing mutant HRAS, whereas wild-type HRAS and NRAS promoted PI3K-AKT signaling in cells expressing mutant KRAS. Combining inhibitors targeting the poorly engaged RAS effector pathways with inhibitors targeting the mutant RAS resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity in a manner that depended on wild-type RAS expression. The farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib blocked mutant HRAS-PI3K signaling and synergized with MEK inhibitors in HRAS -mutated cells, whereas KRAS G12C inhibitors blocked mutant KRAS-MEK signaling and synergized with PI3K inhibitors in KRAS G12C -mutated cells. Synergy was abolished in MEFs lacking all RAS proteins and in cancer cell lines in which nonmutated RAS family members were deleted.

Fallone et al. found that IL-15 and IL-18 synergized to activate the complex mTORC1, which resulted in increased proliferation and function of both mouse and human NK cells. IL-15 and IL-18 stimulated mTORC1 activity through distinct pathways not previously implicated in its regulation. The combination of IL-15 and IL-18 improved the survival of mice engrafted with tumor cells, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of NK cell–based cancer immunotherapy. —Wei Wong The multiprotein complex mTORC1 is essential for the increase in protein synthesis and bioenergetic metabolism that supports the proliferation of many cell types, including natural killer (NK) cells, which are important innate effectors of the antitumoral response. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of mTORC1 activation in NK cells by interleukin-15 (IL-15) and IL-18, which promote NK cell function and are components of a cytokine cocktail used to preactivate NK cells for cancer immunotherapy. Through genetic and pharmacological approaches, we showed that IL-15 activated mTORC1 through the PI3K/Akt/ERK pathway, whereas IL-18 signaled through the p38 effectors MK2 and MK3 in both murine and human primary NK cells. Both pathways synergized to promote NK cell proliferation and effector functions in an mTORC1-dependent manner. Moreover, both pathways operated independently of the inhibitor TSC and the activator Rheb, revealing a noncanonical mode of mTORC1 activation by cytokines. Treating mice with IL-15 and IL-18 in combination led to increased NK cell numbers and improved antitumoral activity, suggesting that this cytokine combination could be exploited to enhance NK cell potential in therapeutic settings.},

  abstract     = {Amphetamine is a stimulant that is used to treat various neurological disorders. It is also misused and induces changes in the gut microbiome. Mabry et al. found that Fusobacterium nucleatum in the guts of flies enhanced the psychomotor effects of amphetamine by increasing the amount of dopamine transporters in the brain. F. nucleatum produces butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that inhibits chromatin-modifying enzymes called HDACs. Manipulating this axis in flies suggested that butyrate increased the expression of the gene encoding the dopamine transporter through HDAC1 inhibition, thus enhancing dopamine-motivated behaviors. The findings reveal a potentially targetable gut-brain axis to treat amphetamine use disorder. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Amphetamines are psychostimulants that are commonly used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders and are prone to misuse. The pathogenesis of amphetamine use disorder (AUD) is associated with dysbiosis (an imbalance in the body’s microbiome) and bacterially produced short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are implicated in the gut-brain axis. Amphetamine exposure in both rats and humans increases the amount of intestinal Fusobacterium nucleatum , which releases SFCAs. Here, we found that colonization of gnotobiotic Drosophila melanogaster with F. nucleatum or supplementing the flies’ diet with the SCFA butyrate enhanced the psychomotor and reward properties of amphetamine. Butyrate inhibits histone deacetylases (HDACs), and knockdown of HDAC1 recapitulated the effects induced by F. nucleatum or butyrate. The enhancement in amphetamine-induced behaviors was mediated by an increase in the amount of released dopamine that resulted from amphetamine-induced reversal of dopamine transporter (DAT) function, termed nonvesicular dopamine release (NVDR). The magnitude of amphetamine-induced NVDR was partially mediated by an increase in DAT abundance stimulated at a transcriptional level, and the administration of F. nucleatum or butyrate enhanced NVDR by increasing DAT expression. The findings indicate that F. nucleatum supports AUD through epigenetic regulation of dopamine signaling and identify potential targets for AUD treatment.},

Only a few proteins interacted with both factors, and those proteins interacted with larger networks of transcriptional, RNA processing, and epigenetic regulators. These findings may lead to new therapeutics to more durably suppress or even eradicate HIV infection. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Replication of HIV-1 requires the coordinated action of host and viral transcription factors, most critically the viral transactivator Tat and the host nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). This activity is disrupted in infected cells that are cultured with extracellular vesicles (EVs) present in human semen, suggesting that they contain factors that could inform the development of new therapeutics. Here, we explored the contents of semen-derived EVs (SEVs) from uninfected donors and individuals with HIV-1 and identified host proteins that interacted with HIV Tat and the NF-κB subunit p65. Integrative network and pathway enrichment analyses of these complexes revealed associations with an array of biological functions regulating gene expression. Several proteins in SEVs bound to both Tat and NF-κB p65: the scaffolding and cell signaling regulatory protein AKAP9, the G protein signaling regulator ARHGEF28, the epigenetic reader BRD2, the small nuclear RNA processor INTS1, and the transcription elongation inhibitor NELFB. When complexed with p65, NELFB also interacted with HEXIM1, another transcription elongation inhibitor, suggesting that SEVs may inhibit HIV-1 propagation through multiple networks of transcriptional activation and repression.

Using single-cell tracking techniques, Nangia et al. found that mTORC1-mediated increases in the amount of the cell-cycle protein cyclin D1 drove escape from standard BRAF and MEK inhibitors in cultured BRAF-mutant melanoma cells. Reducing cyclin D1 in melanoma cells or blocking mTORC1 signaling in melanoma and lung cancer cells reduced the proportion of cells that cycled under drug pressure in culture. Thus, mTORC1 signaling enables cells in drug-induced quiescence to reenter the cell cycle, which may impair long-term drug efficacy. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli In BRAF -mutant melanoma cells treated with inhibitors of the kinases BRAF and MEK, a subset of cells rapidly and nongenetically adapts to escape drug-induced quiescence and reenters the cell cycle. Here, we investigated the mechanisms enabling this drug escape by computationally reconstructing single-cell lineages from time-lapse imaging data, linking dynamic signaling pathways to distinct cell-cycle fate outcomes. We found that reactivation of the MEK substrate ERK was necessary but not sufficient to drive escape; rather, the activity of the protein complex mTORC1 was also required to promote cell growth and protein synthesis in drug-treated cells destined for cell-cycle reentry. ERK and mTORC1 signaling converged to increase the abundance of cyclin D1 protein, a critical bottleneck for cell-cycle commitment under drug pressure. In cells in which endogenous cyclin D1 was fluorescently tagged using CRISPR, the subset that escaped drug treatment exhibited marked accumulation of cyclin D1 at least 15 hours before cell-cycle reentry, enabling early prediction of future drug escape. Cyclin D1 thus represents both an early biomarker and potential therapeutic target for suppressing drug escape in melanoma. We observed a similar mTORC1-driven mechanism underlying escape in lung cancer cells, but not colon cancer cells, highlighting partial generalizability across cancer types.},

  abstract     = {Although opioids block nociceptive signaling, their prolonged use increases pain sensitivity and promotes analgesic tolerance. These adverse effects involve the activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) and the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5 in sensory neuron terminals in the spinal cord. Jin et al . found that morphine treatment increased the coupling of mGluR5 to Gα q in the spinal cords of rodents and that Gα q was required for morphine-induced increases in NMDAR phosphorylation and synaptic trafficking. Inhibition or knockdown of Gα q reduced morphine-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance. Thus, Gα q might be targeted to improve the analgesic effects of these drugs while reducing the need for dose escalation. —Annalisa M. VanHook Opioids relieve pain by activating μ-opioid receptors (MORs), which inhibit communication between pain-sensing neurons (nociceptors) and the spinal cord. However, prolonged opioid use can paradoxically lead to increased pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia) and reduced analgesic efficacy (tolerance), partly because of the activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) at the central terminals of primary sensory neurons in the spinal cord. Here, we identified a critical role for the G protein Gα q in this paradox. Pharmacological inhibition of Gα q in rats reversed morphine-induced increases in NMDAR phosphorylation, synaptic trafficking, and activity at sensory neuron terminals and reduced morphine-induced excitatory nociceptive input to spinal dorsal horn neurons. Morphine enhanced Gα q coupling specifically to metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) dimers in the spinal cord. Furthermore, targeted knockdown of Gα q in dorsal root ganglion neurons in mice normalized NMDAR-related changes and prevented NMDAR-mediated synaptic potentiation triggered by MOR activation. In addition, either pharmacological or genetic disruption of Gα q signaling enhanced morphine’s analgesic effects while reducing hyperalgesia and tolerance. These findings reveal that Gα q signaling contributes to opioid-induced NMDAR hyperactivity at nociceptor central terminals by promoting MOR-mGluR5 cross-talk. Targeting this pathway may improve the safety and efficacy of opioid-based pain management.},
