A key hallmark is the strengthening of attraction between hydrophobic solutes with increasing temperature, a feature often attributed to entropy changes from disrupted hydrogen bonding in water. Here we present an alternative framework based on surface phase behavior, supported by extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Using metadynamics, we quantify the solvent-mediated effective potential between nanometer-scale hydrophobic solutes in the monatomic water (mW) model, the Simple Point Charge Extended water model, and a Lennard-Jones solvent. We develop a morphometric model which incorporates a scaling theory of critical drying, linking the range and strength of hydrophobic attraction to interfacial thermodynamics and proximity to vapor–liquid coexistence. The model reproduces the effective potential across diverse solute sizes, degrees of hydrophobicity, and thermodynamic states. Our simulations recover the inverse temperature dependence of hydrophobicity, showing it arises generically from rapid thermal expansion of the solvation shell.},

This study explores the development and application of a chitosan-doped ZnO memristor for neuromorphic computing, focusing on its volatile threshold switching behavior and bio-inspired sensory applications. The device exhibits excellent memristive performance, with a high switching ratio (∼10 5 ), stable endurance (>10 4 cycles), and rapid switching speeds (turn-on/turn-off times of ∼23/21 µ s). Symmetric threshold voltages (±2 V) and low resistance variability highlight its reliability. Integrated into an oscillatory neuron circuit (R–C configuration), the memristor emulates spiking dynamics, demonstrating tunable frequency and energy efficiency (∼832 nJ/spike). Furthermore, the circuit successfully replicates biological motion detection and sound localization by processing spatiotemporal input differences, mimicking direction-selective ganglion cells and medial superior olive neurons. These results validate the memristor’s potential for bio-inspired sensory systems, offering a scalable, energy-efficient platform for neuromorphic computing and artificial perception.},

The model is applied in the context of all-optical resonant magnetization switching in two-dimensional magnetic materials, particularly reproducing the experimental findings for reverse magnetization by all-optical means for a monolayer CrI 3 . Our phenomenological model can be applied to other systems characterized by an order parameter and excitonic fields created through resonant light, offering versatility and potential to guide future experimental and theoretical studies in LIPT phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and predicting hydrogen adsorption energy is key to designing effective electrocatalysts. In this study, we develop a physically interpretable descriptor within a framework that decomposes atomic hydrogen adsorption energy into intuitive contributions, applied to 22 group IV and III–V 2D honeycomb materials. The density functional theory (DFT) calculated adsorption energy is decomposed into two components: bond energy, approximated by the integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP), and the energy cost of forming the additional bond, termed distortion energy E d . This decomposition facilitates analysis of adsorption trends beyond treating adsorption energy as a single quantity. We find that ICOHP correlates strongly with the adsorption site electronegativity ( R 2 = 0.86), improving to R 2 = 0.91 when electronegativity differences and structural parameters are included. E d shows moderate correlation with the unrelaxed vacancy energy E vac ( R 2 = 0.60) and can be accurately modeled ( R 2 = 0.92) using similar dependences on electronegativity and structural parameters. Notably, E vac can be expressed in terms of the sum of electronegativities, enabling a DFT-free formulation. Combining both components into an E ads descriptor, we achieve an R 2 score of 0.82 across both group IV and III–V systems. Further analysis reveals that increasing the adsorption site electronegativity weakens adsorption unless the lattice constant is sufficiently large. In addition, we identify a linear relationship between ICOHP and the zero-point energy change, allowing the descriptor to be extended to the free energy of hydrogen adsorption, a key indicator of hydrogen evolution reaction activity.},

In this study, we systematically investigate FeN 4 , CoN 4 , and NiN 4 active sites coordinated with a broad range of axial ligands to elucidate how ligand environments influence reaction energetics across different metal centers. Free energy analyses reveal that axial ligands can substantially modify key steps in the ORR pathway, including *OOH formation and *OH desorption, with distinct effects observed for each metal. FeN 4 exhibits tunable activity and selectivity depending on the ligand, balancing between 4 e − and 2 e − pathways. CoN 4 shows a pronounced preference toward the 2 e − pathway under specific ligand environments, highlighting its potential for selective H 2 O 2 production. In contrast, NiN 4 displays generally high energy barriers and limited ORR activity across all axial ligands. These results establish a comparative framework for understanding how axial ligand coordination governs ORR performance and provide guidance for the rational design of M–N–C SACs with tailored activity and selectivity.},

In this study, we aim to provide insight into which FH order to choose, in what temperature range the FH corrections are reliable, and whether they can be applied outside of equilibrium. We study argon, neon, hydrogen, and helium using accurate ab initio interaction potentials combined with FH corrections up to 14th order. By comparing to full quantum mechanical calculations, we find that the second virial coefficient is predicted within 2% with first-order FH corrections at temperatures above ≈ 10 K for argon and neon, and within 10% above 23 K for hydrogen. At cryogenic temperatures, first-order FH corrections offer a significant improvement compared to classical interaction potentials. Increasing to second-order FH corrections yields a small improvement in the case of neon and helium, while higher-order corrections give systematically less accurate predictions. At sufficiently low temperatures, the accuracy of the FH corrections deteriorates rapidly due to the increasingly relevant impact of the discretization of energy states when the thermal energy is small compared to the energy gaps between bound dimer states. By comparing to full quantum mechanical calculations, we show that FH corrections decrease the accuracy in the prediction of transport properties at infinite dilution. This shows that the qualitative picture of “quantum swelling” only applies when considering a large number of particles and not for binary collision dynamics.},

In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids. Here, we derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion–convection equation) with an energy barrier due to the crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in reasonable agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are compared with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids. The comparison suggests that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity.},

  abstract     = {Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture and storage using ionic liquids (ILs) is a promising research area within the broader issue of greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change. Here, we conducted a systematic molecular dynamics study to identify structural features that optimize CO 2 solubility in ILs. A total of 24 ILs, based on 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cations with varying alkyl chain lengths and paired with six different anions, were examined. Simulations were performed at 300 K and 1 atm, across 0%, 10%, and 30% CO 2 mole fractions. The void probability distribution functions revealed remarkable morphological similarities among the systems, with a strong correlation between the anion molar volume and the total number of voids in the liquid. The void network topology showed that spherical anions such as [BF 4 ] − and [PF 6 ] − promote narrow-channel connectivity, while bulkier anions significantly modify the interstitial network connecting the voids. Radial distribution functions highlighted that CO 2 is preferentially located near polar domains, particularly around anions, with minimal disruption to the overall packing. These localized perturbations in the IL structure were more pronounced for smaller anions, which are more tightly coordinated with the cations. Interaction energy analysis revealed that extending the cation alkyl chains does not enhance CO 2 solubility in molar terms, as the gas interacts mainly with polar regions. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of dispersion interactions in CO 2 uptake and suggest that ILs incorporating soft, bulky anions may be promising candidates for carbon capture, offering a balance between increased free volume near the polar domains and manageable viscosity.},

  abstract     = {XF n (X = Xe, Rn, Og; n = 2, 4) are important rare gas compounds, but they have received limited theoretical attention. There still exist controversies over the lowest energy structure of OgF 4 . In this work, the CCSD(T) method with spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is employed for determining geometries, harmonic frequencies, and dissociation energies of these heavy and superheavy rare gas fluorides. Our results show that the lowest-energy structure for XF 2 is D ∞h and that for XF 4 is D 4h . In addition, a T d structure emerges for OgF 4 with SOC, lying about 2 kcal/mol above the D 4h structure. Moreover, a C 2v structure appears in scalar-relativistic calculations for XF 2 and XeF 4 ; however, the C 2v structure for OgF 2 vanishes when SOC is included. SOC increases both bond lengths and dissociation energies of these molecules and is essential for describing properties of RnF n and OgF n accurately. Furthermore, an atom-in-molecule (AIM) analysis program is developed to analyze electron densities of these systems with SOC. AIM and Mulliken population analyses reveal that the X–F bond exhibits a mixed ionic-covalent character. SOC diminishes the covalent character in these molecules, particularly for RnF n and OgF n , and relatively larger covalent character is observed in XF 4 than that in XF 2 .},

  abstract     = {For the N 2 + N process, the quasi-classical trajectory method based on the first-principles potential energy surface is combined with the neural network method to construct a high-precision cross section model for inelastic collision, the Zeldovich exchange reaction, and the dissociation reaction. The rate coefficients at relatively low temperatures (<4000 K) are obtained by integrating the derived cross section model, and an accurate prediction of the vibrationally relaxation time of N 2 is achieved by solving the corresponding master equations. It is found that the rate coefficient from the first vibrational excited state to the ground state can be accurately fitted by a second-order Arrhenius formula, and below 2000 K, the vibrational relaxation times calculated by the two-state method are consistent with those of the full vibrational ladder method (Landau–Teller formula and the e-folding method). The logarithm of the vibrational relaxation times turns out to show a linear relationship with T t r − 2 / 3 ⁠ , rather than the traditionally expected T t r − 1 / 3 ⁠ . The obtained vibrational relaxation times of the N 2 + N process span nine orders of magnitude in the range of 1000–30000 K and provide a database for the study of the relaxation dynamics of N 2 molecules in hypersonic flows.},

  abstract     = {Microwave and millimeter-wave rotational spectra of 46 thiophene isotopologues are used to determine a new semi-experimental equilibrium ( r e SE ) structure for thiophene. The large dataset of isotopologues—roughly twice as large as any dataset used for a semi-experimental equilibrium structure determination for a molecule of this size—and the broad frequency coverage enable a detailed investigation concerning previously reported discrepancies between the structural parameters of the r e SE and r e structures of thiophene. The observation of rotational spectra for 23 new thiophene- d x isotopologues, many with additional 34 S or 13 C substitution at natural abundance, is made possible by the high sensitivity of the PARIS FTMW spectrometer in the microwave frequency region. Frequency coverage for thiophene and single heavy-atom isotopologues in the millimeter-wave region has been expanded to include the range of 82–750 GHz. Bond distances and bond angles of the new highly precise and accurate r e SE structure are determined with precisions of ≤0.0002 Å and ≤0.02°, respectively. This study provides strong evidence that the discrepancies can be addressed only by improvements to the theoretical r e structure and that the precision and accuracy of the semi-experimental equilibrium ( r e SE ) structural parameters are approaching the limit of structure determination.},

We also show a scheme to render an interpretable “PathMap,” showing the free energy ridges between paths and the branching and merging of the transition channels. MultiPMD is a flexible and promising method for systems with competing or controversial pathways, which appear in many biomolecular systems, including proteins and nucleic acids.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the quantum transport in a hybrid ring system consisting of a quantum dot (QD) coupled to two Majorana bound states (MBSs) hosted in a topological superconducting nanowire, threaded by a magnetic flux. Utilizing the dissipaton equation-of-motion approach, we demonstrate that the differential conductance shows periodic behavior, and its periodicity depends on both the QD energy level and the MBS overlapping. A zero-bias peak (ZBP) emerges as a result of the balance between normal and anomalous tunneling processes, associated with the presence of a single MBS. Beyond the phase-dependent periodic behavior, the shot noise exhibits voltage-dependent transitions between sub-Poissonian ( F = 0.5), Poissonian ( F = 1), and super-Poissonian ( F > 1) regimes. Strikingly, we find a giant Fano factor ( F ≫ 1) emerging at the balance point, accompanied by a peak in the shot noise. This distinctive feature may serve as a supplementary signature for MBS detection. However, both ZBP in the differential conductance and shot noise peak are degraded by thermal effects.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we achieved significant GPU acceleration based on quadratic scaling path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) [Feldman and Hirshberg, J. Chem. Phys. 159 , 154107 (2023)] and developed an open-source PIMD code repository. Numerical experiments show that for a system of 1600 interacting identical bosons in a harmonic trap, using a single GPU and a single CPU, it only takes two hours to achieve satisfactory simulation accuracy. With the increase in the number of identical particles, the advantage of GPU acceleration over CPU becomes more obvious, making it possible to simulate tens of thousands of identical particles from first principles using a single GPU. Our study shows that GPU acceleration can lay a solid foundation for the wide application of PIMD simulations for large-scale identical particle quantum systems with more than 10 000 particles in the presence of two-body interaction. Numerical experiments show that a 24 GB GPU can simulate up to 20 000 identical particles from first principles, and the GPU acceleration leads to a roughly linear relationship between the computation time and the number of identical particles. In addition, we have also successfully implemented simulations for fictitious identical particle thermodynamics using GPU to overcome the fermion sign problem, which makes it promising to efficiently and accurately simulate tens of thousands of fermions based on GPU when the recently proposed ξ -extrapolation method holds.},

  abstract     = {Rubber friction is of major practical importance in applications such as tires, rubber seals, and footwear. This review article focuses on the theory and experimental studies of rubber friction on substrates with random roughness. We examine both steady sliding and accelerated motion, with particular attention to the origins of the breakloose friction force and the influence of pre-slip, elasticity, and flash temperature on friction dynamics. We further discuss rolling friction for cylinders and spheres, as well as sliding friction for triangular sliders on dry and lubricated rubber surfaces. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results obtained using different materials, geometries, and environmental conditions, highlighting the importance of accounting for multiscale roughness. Open challenges, such as the role of adhesion enhancement, energy dissipation due to crack opening, and the physical origin of the short-distance roughness cutoff, are discussed.},
