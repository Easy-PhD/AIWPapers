  abstract     = {We study how protein condensates respond to a site of active RNA transcription (i.e., a gene promoter) due to electrostatic protein–RNA interactions. Our results indicate that condensates can show directed motion toward the promoter, driven by gradients in the RNA concentration. Analytical theory, consistent with simulations, predicts that the droplet velocity has a non-monotonic dependence on the distance to the promoter. We explore the consequences of this gradient-sensing mechanism for enhancer–promoter (E–P) communication using polymer simulations of the intervening chromatin chain. Directed motion of enhancer-bound condensates can, together with loop extrusion by cohesin, collaboratively increase the enhancer–promoter contact probability. Finally, we investigate under which conditions condensates can exhibit oscillations in their morphology and in the distance to the promoter. Oscillatory dynamics are caused by a delayed response of transcription to condensate-promoter contact and negative feedback from the accumulation of RNA at the promoter, which results in charge repulsion.},

Information about the microstructure can be deduced from measurements of the structure factor—a quantity directly proportional to the scattered intensity. While the time evolution of the structure factor can be measured relatively easily, modeling it has proved to be much more difficult. We believe the latter could be impeding our ability to control spinodal decomposition. Using synthetic data corresponding to two different polymer blends, we investigate the use of dynamic mode decomposition to model the time evolution of the structure factor during polymeric spinodal decomposition. Based on the accuracy and range of the predictions we obtained using dynamic mode decomposition, we believe our results are promising for the use of dynamic mode decomposition in an experimental setting, which could improve our ability to control spinodal decomposition in automated experiments.},

  abstract     = {Polymer density is a critical factor influencing material performance and industrial applications, and it can be tailored by modifying the chemical structure of repeating units. Traditional polymer density characterization methods rely heavily on domain expertise; however, the vast chemical space comprising over one million potential polymer structures makes conventional experimental screening inefficient and costly. In this study, we proposed a machine learning framework for polymer density prediction, rigorously evaluating four models: neural networks (NNs), random forest (RF), XGBoost, and graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs). Using a curated dataset of 1432 homopolymers from the PoLyInfo database, our comparative analysis indicated that the GCNN model enhanced by a directed message passing neural network (D-MPNN) for feature extraction achieves superior predictive accuracy (mean absolute error, MAE = 0.0497 g/cm 3 ; coefficient of determination, R 2 = 0.8097) relative to the other models. Experimental validation on six polymers demonstrated strong agreement between measured densities and GCNN predictions with relative errors not exceeding 4.8%. In-depth error analysis combined with SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) and subgroup evaluations reveals fundamental relationships between specific functional groups and polymer density, improving the model’s interpretability. Furthermore, t-SNE visualization and kernel density estimation (KDE) analysis revealed that the D-MPNN framework effectively captures critical chemical space features governing density, explaining the GCNN’s superior performance. This work establishes a reliable and scalable computational framework for high-throughput polymer screening, providing scientific insights into structure–property relationships while positioning density prediction as a prerequisite for incorporating density-dependent properties into polymer informatics and accelerating the discovery of novel polymer materials.},

For a polymer undergoing ideal Rouse dynamics, the slow modes identified by these transformations coincide with the conventional Rouse modes. When applied to the Fourier modes of the segment density, we show that tICA generates dynamics equivalent to dynamic self-consistent field theory (D-SCFT) with a wavevector-dependent Onsager coefficient and a free energy functional subject to the random phase approximation. We then introduce a hidden variable method and a time-local approach to include temporal memory in the tICA-generated dynamics and generalize it to construct continuum models for the nonequilibrium case of spinodal decomposition of a symmetric diblock copolymer melt.},

It is shown that a relatively weak potential can lead to a strong contraction of the polymer chain: the radius of gyration becomes much smaller compared to the size of the free cyclic chain. The pronounced decrease in the terminal relaxation time of cyclic macromolecules in the presence of a harmonic potential compared to the Rouse relaxation time leads to a lengthening of the time interval for the transition to the normal, i.e., the Fickian, diffusion regime, generating a quasi-plateau at increasing molecular mass for the time dependence of segmental mean squared displacement.},

This study focused on lead-free tin-based perovskites with iodine–bromine mixed anions. Bromide perovskites have a wide bandgap; therefore, they are promising light absorbers for perovskite–silicon tandem solar cells. However, surface defects generally affect the PCE of Sn-based perovskite solar cells because they serve as trapping and recombination sites for excitons (electron–hole pairs). In this study, density functional theory calculations were employed to investigate the molecular passivation of surface defects in Sn-based mixed-halide perovskites. The results showed that a Lewis base is effective for passivating p -type defects. In addition, we established a molecule–defect interaction model to explain the passivation mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are well known to give rise to a quantum confined structure of excitons. Because of this quantum confinement, new physics of hot exciton relaxation dynamics arises. Decades of work using transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy have yielded initial simple observations, such as estimates of the cooling rate from single pump photon energy experiments. More detailed TA experiments employed variable pump photon energies to measure excitonic state-resolved transition rates. These TA measurements, usually the simplest form, have been employed to characterize QDs and their relaxation dynamics to this day. Yet, these TA measurements are fundamentally lacking in their ability to measure energy-resolved hot exciton cooling, which requires observation of the full cooling history through the real excitonic manifold. Here, we employ coherent multi-dimensional spectroscopy (CMDS) to perform an atomistically directed study of hot exciton cooling in CdSe QDs, revealing energy resolved relaxation dynamics. CMDS experiments are compared with simulations and prior TA measurements and simpler theories. Our findings reveal a hot exciton relaxation dynamics landscape. This relaxation dynamics landscape is a linear or sub-linear function of excess energy for different structures of QDs, with a strong size dependence. Our model simulations parameterized by the empirical pseudopotential model reproduces the experimental functional form and the dependence upon QD diameter and shell.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical properties of graphene are investigated using classical molecular dynamics simulations as a function of temperature T and external stress τ . The elastic response is characterized by calculating elastic constants via three complementary methods: (i) numerical derivatives of stress–strain curves, (ii) analysis of cell fluctuation correlations, and (iii) phonon dispersion analysis. Simulations were performed with two interatomic models: an empirical potential and a tight-binding electronic Hamiltonian. Both models predict that the Poisson’s ratio ν of graphene increases monotonically with applied stress. The range of stresses studied spans the entire domain of mechanical stability of the planar structure. Two mechanical instabilities are identified. Under tensile stress, fracture occurs, signaled by the softening of a phonon mode at the Brillouin zone boundary ( K point). At the studied temperatures ( T < 1500 K), auxetic behavior ( ν < 0) appears only at high tensile stresses, near the fracture threshold. Under compressive stress, a spinodal instability associated with long-wavelength wrinkling is observed. Finite-size analysis of this instability at 300 K reveals the existence of a finite surface tension σ in the unstressed membrane, which arises from the anharmonic coupling between out-of-plane and in-plane fluctuations. The surface tension stabilizes the membrane’s flat morphology. In the thermodynamic limit, the onset of the wrinkling instability occurs when the compressive stress matches the surface tension ( τ = σ ). Under this spinodal condition, the area compressibility modulus B is characterized by a scaling law N −1/2 , where N is the number of atoms in the simulation cell.},

Our previous studies have uncovered the strong dependence between melting entropy in the eutectic mixtures and mixing enthalpy, which has been serving as an important reference for glass formation, showing that negative mixing enthalpy largely reduces the melting entropy. In this paper, we focused on the question as to how melting entropy is associated with another classical glass formation criterion of molecule/atom size difference of components. This question has been challenging since it is constantly entangled with the effect of mixing enthalpy and easily smeared. Here, four binary eutectics constituted by molecules with similar structural and chemical characteristics but quite different molecular size were elaborately selected. The extremely low mixing enthalpy measured in four eutectic systems using a C80 microcalorimeter guarantees the neglectable effect of the mixing enthalpy. The determination of melting entropies and the critical cooling rate for glass formation at the eutectic compositions for the four systems uncovers an evident relation between melting entropy and molecular size difference, confirming the compatibility of the two glass formation criteria for mixing systems.},

Both systems turned out to be good glass formers, differing by 17 K in the glass transition temperature, which indicated a strong change in the self-assembly pattern. This supposition was further confirmed by the analysis of dielectric spectra, where, apart from the α -relaxation, also a unique Debye (D)-mode, being a fingerprint of the self-association, characterized by different dynamical properties (dielectric strength, timescale separation from the α -process), was detected in both samples. Further diffraction and infrared investigations, supported by density functional theory computations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, revealed that hydrogen (H)-bonds play a key role in the association in 3P1Pol, while in 3P1Pal, there are at least five different intermolecular interactions involving dipole–dipole forces and π-stacking, as well as extraordinary H-bonds formed between methylene groups neighboring with the formyl unit and carbonyl moiety. Finally, optimized dimeric structures, along with MD simulations, allowed us to propose a molecular mechanism responsible for the D-process in 3P1Pal.

The 35 Cl − dynamics appears to be close to the structural (or α-) relaxation as seen by rheology. To examine possible sub-α responses, we scrutinize different representations of the viscoelastic response, including the shear modulus G *, compliance J * = 1/ G *, fluidity F* = i ωJ* , and viscosity η* = 1/ F* , with some of these quantities being more susceptible to low-frequency features than others. This way, we are able to detect supramolecular rheological signatures not only for HmimCl but also for 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide.

To address their limited ionic conductivity, various strategies have been proposed, including modifying the ion solvation environment and enhancing the transport of selected ions (e.g., Li + ). Despite the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions in determining key physicochemical properties, their influence on ion transport in such systems has received relatively little attention. In this work, we investigate the connection between ion transport and electrostatic screening using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([pyr 14 ][TFSI]) doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) at molar fractions x LiTFSI ≤ 0.3. We find that the charge–charge and density–density correlation functions exhibit oscillatory exponential decay, indicating that LiTFSI-doped [pyr 14 ][TFSI] is a charge- and mass-dense system. The electrostatic screening length decreases with increasing LiTFSI concentration, whereas the decay length of the density–density correlation functions remains nearly unchanged. Notably, we find that the x LiTFSI -sensitive screening length serves as a central length scale for disentangling species-specific contributions of ion pairs to collective ion transport upon LiTFSI doping. This framework provides a unifying perspective on the interplay between structure and transport in ionic liquid systems.},

  abstract     = {Joint direct microscopy–calorimetry measurements of crystal growth were performed for a 60 nm amorphous Sb 2 S 3 film deposited either on a Kapton foil or on a soda-lime glass. Calorimetric crystallization proceeded in two steps, originating either from mechanical and stress-induced defects (230–275 °C) or from homogeneously formed nuclei (255–310 °C); both processes exhibited an identical activation energy of 200 kJ mol −1 . At temperatures <230 °C, a Sb 2 O 3 crystalline phase formed along the rhombohedral Sb 2 S 3 structure. The normal growth model with the activation energy of ∼250 kJ mol −1 was used to describe the microscopic crystal growth rate data, and the viscosity–diffusivity decoupling was characterized by Ediger’s parameter ξ varying between 0.40 and 0.55. The crystal growth rate was slightly higher in the film deposited on the glass substrate, with the compressive stress introduced at higher T having only a small effect. Meanwhile, the deposition on the glass substrate led to a significantly higher (especially below the glass transition temperature) nucleation rate, which underlines the key aspect of the crystallization process in very thin chalcogenide films: the formation of nuclei due to the internal stresses arising from the difference of the film/substrate thermal expansion coefficients.},

With simulations of the mW water model, we investigate the devitrification and “melting” dynamics of both conventional quenched (QG) and vapor deposited (DG) amorphous ices under controlled heating ramps. By developing an algorithm to reconstruct hydrogen-bond networks, we show that bond ring statistics correlate with the structural stability of the glasses and allow tracking crystalline and liquid clusters during devitrification and melting. We find that QG melts in the bulk, whereas melting in DG preferentially begins near the free surface. During devitrification, the DG shows an excess of 5-membered rings near the free surface, which is consistent with its tendency to nucleate the crystal phase in this region. In addition, the DG shows an Avrami exponent exceeding the standard 1 + d behavior, while both glasses display the same sub-3d growth of liquid clusters across heating rates, indicating that the DG enhanced exponent stems from its higher kinetic stability.},

  abstract     = {Folding and unfolding in molecules as simple as short hydrocarbons and as complicated as large proteins continue to be an active research field. Here, we investigate folding in n -C 14 H 30 using both density functional theory (DFT)/B3LYP calculations of 27 772 local minima and a kinetic transition network calculated for a previously reported potential energy surface (PES) obtained by fitting roughly 250 000 B3LYP energies. In addition to generating a database of minima and the transition states that connect them, these calculations and the PES based on them have been used to develop a simple and accurate model for the energy landscape. The model for the local minima is based on the number of gauche torsions as well as their interactions with neighbors and next-nearest neighbors, resulting in three parameters, which are fitted using the direct DFT results. The transition states are governed by 13 parameters based on differences between the two connected local minima. The model predicts that there are 44 530 local minima (not counting permutation-inversion isomers) connected by 525 028 transition states, including degenerate rearrangements. When compared to the actual stationary points, it achieves a minimum absolute energy error of 43 cm −1 for the local minima and 47 cm −1 for the transition state barriers connecting levels of different energy. The model also provides accurate predictions of the most kinetically relevant folding and unfolding pathways, for example, from very highly excited configurations to the global minimum. In addition, it facilitates the determination of a disconnectivity graph using the Cambridge Energy Landscapes programs.},

  abstract     = {The formation of carbinolamine represents the crucial initial step in the aldol reaction, specifically involving the interaction between p-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone, facilitated by amine-catalyzed mesoporous silica nanoparticles (amine-MSN). In this process, a nitrogen atom from propylamine, which acts as the catalytic moiety, engages in the formation of a covalent bond with a carbon atom from acetone, leading to the generation of a carbinolamine intermediate. This reaction is significantly influenced by the presence of silanol groups located on the surface of the amine-MSN, which contribute to the catalytic activity. Moreover, the reaction solvent plays a vital role; water serves as an essential solvent that enhances the rate of the aldol reaction. In this work, a comprehensive investigation is conducted to understand the catalytic influence of water explicitly in carbinolamine formation via three distinct pathways: (1) without the assistance of silanol groups, (2) silanol assistance occurs indirectly through hydrogen bonding, and (3) a pathway that showcases direct silanol assistance in the hydrogen atom transfer processes. To analyze the reaction mechanism in the amine-MSN system, this study employs the fragment molecular orbital method, which can accurately treat the complexities associated with large molecular systems like the MSN pore model (Si 392 O 958 H 348 ). The concerted mechanism study reveals that the presence of water molecules significantly lowers the energy barrier associated with carbinolamine formation, thereby enhancing the feasibility and efficiency of the reaction. This insight highlights the pivotal role of the solvent and the nature of catalytic sites in optimizing aldol reactions within mesoporous silica frameworks.},

Recent experiments have demonstrated that in a collision-free vacuum environment, C 6 − exhibits fast radiative cooling from its highly vibrationally excited states through inverse internal conversion (IIC). Since IIC is driven by vibronic coupling, the understanding of vibronic structures of C 6 − is of theoretical significance. Here, we utilize time-dependent density functional theory to calculate the absorption spectrum of C 6 − ⁠ , allowing us to reassign the peaks in the experimental spectrum to the vibronic progressions associated with the C 2 Π g ← X 2 Π u and D 2 Π g ← X 2 Π u electronic transitions. A vibronic coupling density analysis reasonably explains the strong vibronic peaks and validates the reassignment. We also discuss the potential softening caused by quadratic vibronic coupling in the excited states and the partially allowed vibronic transitions. In addition, we show that a pseudo-Jahn–Teller distortion occurs along the ν 4 ( σ u + ) antisymmetric stretching mode due to the pseudo-degeneracy of the A and B states.},

The key findings reveal a clear β -dependent ( β is the angle of alignment) scattering behavior: the β = 90° configuration in the abstraction channel enhances reactivity and dominates the formation of the products at lower vibrational states with increasing collision energy. In contrast, the β = 0° configuration promotes all vibrational states in the exchange channel. Notably, the β = 45° configuration displays the smallest cross sections in both channels due to destructive quantum interference, contrasting with the constructive interference in the β = 90° configuration. Channel competition analysis demonstrates that β = 0°/45° configurations enhance exchange channel dominance, whereas β = 90° favors the abstraction channel. The differential cross section shows that the products in the abstraction channel shift from backward to forward in the β = 0°/45° configuration, while maintaining sideways distributions in the β = 90° configuration, and in the exchange channel, it is always backward scattering. The highest reaction rate in the abstraction channel occurs at the parallel alignment in the temperature region between 200 and 1000 K.},

Among these, protonated carbon chains are of great interest due to the presence of a permanent dipole moment and their relevance in describing astrochemical processes, making their detection possible in cold molecular clouds such as TMC-1. C 5 H + ( ⁠ 1 Σ g + ⁠ ) is an important molecule for understanding the formation and evolution of carbon-rich environments. However, to accurately model its abundance and spectroscopic properties, it is essential to account for its collisional interactions with H 2 , the most abundant molecule in the ISM. In this study, we present a quantum dynamical study for the C 5 H + –H 2 collision, employing high-level CCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations to construct an accurate potential energy surface (PES). The PES is further augmented using a neural network fitting model, ensuring spectroscopic accuracy. The PES is expanded into radial components using bispherical harmonics. Then, close coupling methods were used to calculate cross sections and rate coefficients for different rotational transitions of C 5 H + , up to 100 K. Throughout the temperature range, a propensity is observed for even transitions over odd transitions. The rate coefficients for He and H 2 collisions are compared for C 5 H + , C 5 , and C 6 H − . For both low and high temperatures, rate coefficients for C 5 H + are found to be higher than C 5 and C 6 H − for both the He and H 2 collisions.},

This study demonstrates that high-energy kHz pulses can confine 1- μ m-radius polystyrene beads in water within ∼26 μ m. This approach utilizes the unique properties of high-energy pulsed lasers, distinct from continuous-wave and megahertz pulsed lasers traditionally used in optical trapping. The pulsing nature of the kHz laser generates strong instantaneous forces that attract and confine particles within a specific region, inducing a “ping-pong” motion within the confined space. When the laser pulses strike the microparticles, the strong gradient forces pull the particles toward the laser focus, while the scattering force from the laser pushes them away. This interaction creates a dynamic equilibrium, causing the particles to oscillate continuously in a back-and-forth motion until the laser is blocked. This phenomenon differs from conventional optical trapping, which offers unique particle confinement possibilities. When combined with optical trapping, especially at femtomolar concentrations or single-particle conditions, this novel development shows that the kHz laser draws particles from significant distances toward the focal point, enhancing its trapping efficiency. All experiments were conducted on a single setup, varying only laser characteristics, ensuring high credibility in the results.},

  abstract     = {Sum-frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG-VS) has been well-established as a unique spectroscopic probe to interrogate the structure, interaction, and dynamics of molecular interfaces, with sub-monolayer sensitivity and broad applications. Sub-1 cm −1 High-Resolution Broadband SFG-VS (HR-BB-SFG-VS) has shown advantages with high spectral resolution and accurate spectral line shape. However, due to the lower peak intensity for the long picosecond pulse used in achieving sub-wavenumber resolution in the HR-BB-SFG-VS measurement, only molecular interfaces with relatively strong signal have been studied. To achieve detailed understanding and broader applications in molecular interfacial studies with HR-BB-SFG-VS, higher sensitivity and better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for HR-BB-SFG-VS is required. In this report, we present a systematic effort on the significant improvement of sensitivity and SNR for HR-BB-SFG-VS. Through optimization of laser pulse characteristics, automatic sample height control, and detection conditions, the sensitivity of HR-BB-SFG-VS was improved, reaching a level of 3 × 10 −6 of the SFG signal from the α-quartz standard. The high SNR spectra of various molecular interfaces are thus obtained with exquisite line shapes and fine spectral features. To name a couple of examples, a new hydrogen-bonded water band around 3300 cm −1 can be explicitly identified in the air/neat-water interface spectra and pure chiral spectral peaks at the level of 1 × 10 −5 of the quartz signal were measured at the air/Leucine aqueous solution interface etc. Such improvements in sensitivity and SNR in HR-BB-SFG-VS have brought and shall bring new opportunities and new discoveries with broad applications to molecular interface studies, in addition to the advantage of HR-BB-SFG-VS for its sub-wavenumber spectral resolution and the ability for intrinsic spectral line shape.},

Our implementation in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package is tailored to solid-state systems by employing periodic boundary conditions and the gauge-including projector augmented waves approach. Relativistic effects are included on the level of the zeroth-order regular approximation (ZORA). We discuss the challenges posed by the PAW partial wave basis in describing SOC regarding chemical shielding tensors. Our method is in good agreement with existing local-basis ZORA implementations for a series of Sn, Hg, and Pb molecules and cluster approximations for crystalline systems.},

  abstract     = {An explicitly correlated extension of a pair-function based perturbation theory is presented. The reference is obtained as the antisymmetrized product of strongly orthogonal geminals, termed Strictly Localized Geminals (SLG), which can capture static correlation at mean-field cost. Geminals entering SLG are spin unrestricted, in general, and are expanded in the one-electron basis of the natural orbitals of the unrestricted Hartree–Fock wavefunction. Dynamic correlation is accounted for by perturbation theory (PT) at second order via a Dyall-like Hamiltonian acting as the zero-order operator [Földvári et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 150 , 034103 (2019)]. Here, an explicitly correlated (F12) correction is added to SLGPT2 to improve the description of dynamic correlation and enhance convergence with respect to the basis size. The resulting SLGPT2-F12 scheme inherits the fragmented structure of the SLGPT2 method, facilitating an efficient solution scheme. For numerical illustration, the SLGPT2-F12 approach is applied to small diradical systems, mainly focusing on singlet–triplet splittings.},

  abstract     = {We model Auger spectra using second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation (MP2) theory combined with complex-scaled basis functions. For this purpose, we decompose the complex MP2 energy of the core-hole state into contributions from specific decay channels and propose a corresponding equation-of-motion (EOM) method for computing the doubly ionized final states of Auger decay. These methods lead to significant savings in computational cost compared to our recently developed approaches based on coupled-cluster theory [F. Matz and T.-C. Jagau, J. Chem. Phys. 156 , 114117 (2022)]. The test set for this study comprises water, ammonia, methane, hydrogen sulfide, phosphine, and silane. The energies of the final states of Auger decay are obtained with an accuracy comparable to EOM coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) theory. Partial decay widths and branching ratios between KLL, KLM, and KMM decay of K-shell holes in third-row hydrides are in good agreement with EOM-CCSD, while deviations are more significant for second-row hydrides. For L 1 -shell holes, which undergo Coster–Kronig decay, MP2 yields unphysical results. However, we show that a suitable shift of the MP2 energy denominators leads to more reliable branching ratios and spectra for these problematic cases.},

We apply mmfX2C-DIP-EOMCC to several neutral atoms and diatomic molecules to obtain the ground and first few excited states of the corresponding dication species, and we observe excellent agreement (to within 0.001 eV) between DIPs obtained from mmfX2C- and four-component DIP-EOMCC calculations that include 3-hole–1-particle (3 h 1 p ) excitations, with either the Dirac–Coulomb or Dirac–Coulomb–Gaunt Hamiltonians. We also compare double IPs for mmfX2C-DIP-EOMCC calculations with the full Dirac–Coulomb–Breit Hamiltonian to those from experiment. The mmfX2C-DIP-EOMCC with 3 h 1 p excitations leads to errors in absolute double IPs that generally overestimate experimental data for noble gases by 0.1–0.4 eV, whereas the inclusion of 4 h 2 p excitations results in double IPs that are too low by 0.1–0.2 eV, at the large basis set limit.},

  abstract     = {Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations extend the length and time scales of atomistic simulations by replacing groups of correlated atoms with CG beads. Machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) has recently emerged as a promising approach to construct highly accurate force fields for CG molecular dynamics. However, the calibration of MLCG force fields typically hinges on force matching, which demands extensive reference atomistic trajectories with corresponding force labels. In practice, atomistic forces are often not recorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing datasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force matching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference atomistic forces are not present. While this approach produces force fields that recapitulate slow collective motion, it introduces significant local distortions due to the corrupting effects of the noise-based kernel. In this work, we introduce more general kernels based on normalizing flows that substantially reduce these local distortions while preserving global conformational accuracy. We demonstrate our method on small proteins, showing that flow-based kernels can generate high-quality CG forces solely from configurational samples.},

  abstract     = {Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely trusted many-body method for solving the Schrödinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power make FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method’s inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to assess the reproducibility of the method, affirming that yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water–methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move, the determinant locality approximation, or the determinant T-move schemes, while the older locality approximation leads to considerable variability in results. These findings demonstrate that, with appropriate choices of algorithmic details, fixed-node DMC is reproducible across diverse community codes—highlighting the maturity and robustness of the method as a tool for open and reliable computational science.},

  abstract     = {We introduce an efficient method, TTN-HEOM, for exactly calculating the open quantum dynamics for driven quantum systems interacting with highly structured bosonic baths by combining the tree tensor network (TTN) decomposition scheme with the bexcitonic generalization of the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The method yields a series of quantum master equations for all core tensors in the TTN that efficiently and accurately capture the open quantum dynamics for non-Markovian environments to all orders in the system–bath interaction. These master equations are constructed based on the time-dependent Dirac–Frenkel variational principle, which isolates the optimal dynamics for the core tensors given the TTN ansatz. The dynamics converges to the HEOM when increasing the rank of the core tensors, a limit in which the TTN ansatz becomes exact. We introduce TENSO , tensor equations for non-Markovian structured open systems, as a general-purpose Python code to propagate the TTN-HEOM dynamics. We implement three general propagators for the coupled master equations: two fixed-rank methods that require a constant memory footprint during the dynamics and one adaptive-rank method with a variable memory footprint controlled by the target level of computational error. We exemplify the utility of these methods by simulating a two-level system coupled to a structured bath containing one Drude–Lorentz component and eight Brownian oscillators, which is beyond what can presently be computed using the standard HEOM. Our results show that the TTN-HEOM is capable of simulating both dephasing and relaxation dynamics of driven quantum systems interacting with structured baths, even those of chemical complexity, with an affordable computational cost.},

  abstract     = {We present a self-consistent algorithm for optimal control simulations of many-body quantum systems. The algorithm features a two-step synergism that combines discrete real-time machine learning (DRTL) with Quantum Optimal Control Theory (QOCT) using the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. Specifically, in step (1), DRTL is employed to identify a compact working space (i.e., the important portion of the Hilbert space) for the time evolution of the many-body quantum system in the presence of a control field (i.e., the initial or previously updated field), and in step (2), QOCT utilizes the DRTL-determined working space to find a newly updated control field for a chosen objective. Steps 1 and 2 are iterated until a self-consistent control objective value is reached such that the resulting optimal control field yields the same targeted objective value when the corresponding working space is systematically enlarged. To demonstrate this two-step self-consistent DRTL-QOCT synergistic algorithm, we perform optimal control simulations of strongly interacting 1D as well as 2D Heisenberg spin systems. In both scenarios, only a single spin (at the left end site for 1D and the upper left corner site for 2D) is driven by the time-dependent control fields to create an excitation at the opposite site as the target. It is found that, starting from all spin-down zero excitation states, the synergistic method is able to identify working spaces and convergence of the desired controlled dynamics with just a few iterations of the overall algorithm. In the cases studied, the dimensionality of the working space scales only quasi-linearly with the number of spins.},

However, the requirement for extremely high pressures limits their practical applications. In this study, YH 4 is adopted as a base material, with partial substitution of yttrium (Y) by scandium (Sc), lanthanum (La), and zirconium (Zr). Pure YH 4 , stable at 120 GPa, exhibits a critical temperature ( T c ) of 84–95 K. Substituting half of the Y atoms increases T c to 124.43 K for (Y,Sc)H 4 at 100 GPa but reduces it to 101.24 K for (Y,La)H 4 at 120 GPa. In contrast, (Y,Zr)H 4 at 200 GPa shows a further suppressed T c of 69.55 K. The remarkable superconductivity in (Y,Sc)H 4 might be related to its unique phonon dispersion without an optical-acoustic gap, compressed Y–H bonds, and significant electron delocalization under pressure, collectively boosting electron–phonon interactions. Furthermore, the lowest optical phonons play a crucial role in the superconductivity of these materials. This work suggests that substituting Y with same-group metal elements is an effective strategy to enhance T c in hydride superconductors.},

This extension employs non-exponential basis sets to expand the bath correlation functions, overcoming the reliance of the original cNMSSE on exponential decompositions of the spectral density. Consequently, the extended cNMSSE is applicable to environments beyond those characterized by Debye-type spectral densities. The flexibility to employ general basis functions is particularly advantageous for handling spectral densities with higher-order poles, for which exponential decompositions are often inaccurate or unavailable. The extended cNMSSE is implemented in a pseudo-Fock space using conventional ladder operators and solved efficiently via matrix product state techniques, preserving the favorable linear-scaling and wavefunction-based nature of the original method. Benchmark simulations across four representative cases, including discrete spectral density, Ohmic spectral density with exponential and algebraic cutoffs, and critically damped Brownian spectral density, demonstrate excellent agreement with results of hierarchy of forward–backward stochastic Schrödinger equations and extended hierarchical equation of motion.},

Our method adapts the adversarial learning paradigm, combining a physics-based generator with a neural network discriminator that differentiates between AA and CG trajectories. By adversarially optimizing CG parameters, our approach eliminates the need for predefined kinetic features. Applied to liquid water, it accurately reproduces radial and angular distribution functions as well as dynamical mean squared displacement, even extrapolating long-timescale dynamics from short training trajectories. This framework offers a new approach for bottom-up CG modeling, offering a systematic and principled way to preserve dynamic consistency in complex coarse-grained molecular systems.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel computational approach based on ratchet-and-pawl molecular dynamics (rMD) for accurately estimating ligand dissociation kinetics in protein–ligand complexes. By integrating Kramers’s theory with Bell’s equation, our method systematically investigates the relationship between the effective biasing force applied during simulations and the ligand residence times. The proposed technique is demonstrated through extensive simulations of the benzamidine–trypsin complex, employing first an implicit solvent model (multi-eGO) to set up the approach parameters and then an explicit solvent model. Our results illustrate the method’s reliability, accuracy, and computational efficiency, with calculated kinetic rates closely matching experimental values. Overall, this study highlights rMD as a versatile and efficient non-equilibrium methodology, broadly applicable to kinetic analyses in chemical and biological systems.},

  abstract     = {Accurately modeling volume-dependent properties of water remains a challenge for density functional theory (DFT), with widely used functionals failing to reproduce key features of the water density isobar, including its shape, density, and temperature of the density maximum. Here, we compare the performance of the RPBE-D3 and vdW-DF-cx functionals using replica exchange molecular dynamics (MD) driven by machine-learned force fields. Our simulations reveal that vdW-DF-cx predicts the water density more accurately than RPBE-D3 and reproduces the isobar closely between 307 and 340 K. In contrast, RPBE-D3 underestimates the density across the entire temperature range. However, vdW-DF-cx predicts the maximum density temperature to be ∼30 K higher than experiment. Using the local structure index, we attribute this shift to an onset of low-density, ice-like structures in the vdW-DF-cx-based MD at too high temperatures. Static DFT calculations on water dimers and representative high- and low-density water structures reveal that key features of the density isobars are reflected in the static energy-volume curves. In particular, the equilibrium intermolecular distance and curvature correlate with the maximum density and curvature around the maximum of the density isobar. Similarly, the early onset of the low-density structure is connected to the energetic preference for more structured, low-density water over a less ordered, high-density water structure. Decomposing the exchange–correlation energy reveals that the non-local dispersion energy decisively influences the predicted equilibrium intermolecular distances, whereas the semi-local part governs the balance between low- and high-density liquid structures.},

  abstract     = {Density functional theory (DFT) is a cornerstone of modern electronic structure theory. In the Kohn–Sham scheme, the many-electron Schrödinger equation is replaced by a set of effective single-particle equations. Thus, the full complexity of the quantum mechanical many-particle effects is mapped to the exchange–correlation potential v xc ( r ). Almost all DFT calculations done in practice rely on approximations to v xc ( r ). However, numerical representations of the quasi-exact v xc ( r ) can be obtained from quasi-exact densities by inverting the Kohn–Sham procedure. This inverse Kohn–Sham scheme is an important source of insight into exact DFT. Here, we review the inverse Kohn–Sham problem and explain in detail several aspects of why Kohn–Sham inversion is intrinsically difficult. We then present several inversion schemes and discuss their pros and cons, specifically addressing the effects of statistical uncertainties that are inevitable in quantum Monte Carlo reference densities. We use these schemes to obtain representations of v xc ( r ) that correspond to the ground-state densities that have become available from accurate diffusion Monte Carlo calculations on real space grids for the Li 2 and N 2 molecules, and the C atom. In the latter, the highest occupied orbital has a nodal line and the exchange–correlation potential goes to a different asymptotic value in this direction. As an outlook, we discuss the possibility of interlacing quantum Monte Carlo and Kohn–Sham theory by using the quasi-exact Kohn–Sham determinant to fix the nodes in a diffusion Monte Carlo calculation.},
