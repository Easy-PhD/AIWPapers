  abstract     = {The glycine receptor (GlyR) is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel that plays important physiological roles in the nervous system. Its malfunction is related to neurological disorders, including startle disease (hyperekplexia), which is characterized by exaggerated startle responses to sudden unexpected stimuli, such as noise or touch. Here, we unravel the molecular mechanisms of action of a specific mutation that is linked to startle disease: Asn46Lys (N46K). This residue, in the GlyR extracellular domain, is not directly involved in neurotransmitter binding but can disrupt the neurotransmitter pathway. To understand how, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the wild-type and mutated extracellular domain of a homomeric α 1 GlyR, assessing the effects of the Asn46Lys mutation. We then sampled multiple unbinding and binding events by means of metadynamics simulations, with a funnel restraint to limit the exploration in the solvent. By evaluating the binding free energy landscape, we observed a substantial reduction in neurotransmitter binding affinity, which is consistent with experiments. We suggest that such a reduction is linked to the interaction of its crucial glutamic acid residue with the lysine mutation competing with the glycine ligand.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause oxidative damage to wall teichoic acid (WTA) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) in two bacterial species: Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we found that ROS primarily induce structural damage through dehydrogenation reactions and the cleavage of C–C and C–O bonds. Notably, the teichoic acid (TA) from S. aureus was found to be more susceptible to damage compared to that of S. pneumoniae , which exhibited stronger antioxidant properties due to its ring structure and chemical modifications. The efficiency of damage increased with ROS concentration, following the order, O > O 3 > OH, with a maximum of 22.22% C–C bond cleavage observed at the highest concentration. In addition, the patterns of damage in the TA of these two bacterial species were significantly different. In S. aureus , WTA damage was predominantly characterized by C–C and C–O bond cleavage in the repeating units, whereas LTA damage was primarily due to the cleavage of C–C bonds in the ring structure. In S. pneumoniae , damage to both WTA and LTA mainly occurred at the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) ring structure and the poly (RboP) site. This study offers new insights into the sterilizing effects of plasma.},

  abstract     = {Silver ions (Ag + ) are known to interact with DNA through nonspecific and specific mechanisms, inducing conformational and mechanical changes in the double helix. In this study, we investigate how varying Ag + concentrations affect the mechanical properties of DNA, in particular, contour length, persistence length, end-to-end distance, and area of occupation, using atomic force microscopy. At low Ag + concentrations, we observe localized stiffening and shortening of DNA molecules, which we attribute to the formation of monoadducts and biadducts with specific DNA bases. These interactions promote the emergence of secondary structures that contribute to DNA compaction and a reduction in contour length. At intermediate concentrations, accumulation of torsional stress and the formation of multiple metal-mediated contacts lead to a global conformational collapse, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the effective persistence length. At the highest Ag + concentration tested (1.5 mM), the uniform distribution of molecular area suggests a widespread structural collapse of DNA. These findings support previous reports of Ag + -induced DNA condensation and reveal a progressive structural transition from extended to globular conformations. The observed behavior provides insights into the biophysical consequences of metal–DNA interactions and may have implications for understanding the molecular basis of the antimicrobial activity of silver ions.},

  abstract     = {Heteropolymers are ubiquitous in both synthetic systems, such as block copolymers, and biological macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids. Beyond their chemical composition, these polymers often exhibit spatial variations in physical properties. For instance, in biopolymers such as chromatin, the heterogeneity of extensibility arises from inherent molecular features as well as extensile or contractile active forces. In this article, we develop a theoretical framework that extends the physics of flexible polymers, a widely used tool for describing biopolymer dynamics, to incorporate spatially varying extensibility. Using this approach, we specifically analyze the structure and dynamics of flexible heteropolymers with periodic stepwise extensibility profiles. We find that this heterogeneity leads to qualitative deviations in dynamical observables, such as mean squared displacement, while also increasing structural anisotropy. Altogether, this framework provides a platform for interpreting heterogeneous extensibility from experimental data, especially for biopolymers, as well as for designing heteropolymers with tailored structural and dynamic properties.},

A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations, we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.},

These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here, we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. In contrast, discrete-time simulations are slow to show this instability, particularly for large system sizes. For the remaining state space, we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.},

Despite the absence of surface charge on the (non-polarizable) channel walls and the associated electric double layer, we do observe robust ion selectivity. This selectivity favors the transport of cations from base to tip when the electric field is directed from base to tip, and anions from base to tip when the field direction is reversed. In addition, we observe a corresponding electro-osmotic water flow from base to tip, regardless of the electric field direction. Intriguingly, ion selectivity and electro-osmotic flow are conventionally associated with surface charge and electric double layers. Here, however, we uncover a novel mechanism for these phenomena in uncharged tapered nanoslits, where ion selectivity arises from the divergence of the heterogeneous water polarization.},

In response, surface-grafted polymers undergo a transition from an isotropic brush-layer in a good solvent to heterogeneous patches in CNS. To quantitatively describe this transition, we use the surface coverage θ as an additional order parameter and develop a theoretical model for its calculation, which is compared with the simulations. By further examining θ as a function of CNS concentration, we observe that PDNPs exhibit a collapse-reentry process similar to planar brushes, but with richer details of the two-step reentry behavior: angular isotropy recovery followed by radial expansion. We investigate how this CNS-induced collapse transition influences the reversible adsorption/exclusion of cargo nanoparticles on PDNPs, depending on the size of the cargo and the concentration of the cosolvent.},

  abstract     = {The generalized Langevin equation provides a powerful framework for modeling and interpreting the conformational dynamics of (macro)molecules in solution. However, recent studies have shown that the standard fluctuation–dissipation relation—linking the memory kernel to the statistics of the random force—can include a non-zero cross correlation term between conservative and random forces. This raises questions about how to correctly extract memory kernels from simulation data when this correlation is neglected and whether inverting the Volterra equation to obtain a memory kernel yields a physically meaningful result. In a recent work [Wolf et al. J. Chem. Phys. 162 , 054113 (2025)], we proposed an approximation to account for the cross correlation term. We demonstrate in this work that cross correlations play a significant role in the collapse transition of a hydrophobic polymer under various solvent conditions. In addition, we demonstrate that our proposed approximation yields an improved description of barrier crossing times. Notably, we find that this improvement has the same magnitude as the improvement gained by accounting for memory effects.},

Thermal effects on the structure, enthalpy (Δ ads H ), and Gibbs free energy (Δ ads G ) of adsorption were analyzed. The relatively fast surface diffusion of the adsorbate was identified as the dominant anharmonic effect causing an increase in Δ ads G of up to 50% compared to static harmonic calculations. In contrast, the anharmonic effect on Δ ads H was shown to be nearly negligible. The computed thermodynamic data were used to predict the desorption kinetics parameters, i.e., activation energy ( E a ), Arrhenius pre-factor ( ν ), and position of desorption maximum ( T max ). Among the DFAs tested, the PBE + D4 method was found to provide the best overall agreement with the experimental data.

While sodium is the dominant alkali metal in such systems, cesium often exhibits distinct bulk behavior relative to lighter alkali cations. Aqueous mixtures of cesium hydroxide and sodium nitrite were compared to alkali hydroxide analogs using small-angle x-ray scattering, revealing that cesium disrupts the sodium nitrite electrolyte structure, forming cesium-rich domains. This mesoscale segregation contrasts with the near-ideal mixing observed in other mixed hydroxide–nitrite systems. Raman spectroscopy indicates cesium–nitrite ion pairing, evidenced by vibrational shifts distinct from those associated with sodium. Multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy further supports cesium–nitrite and cesium–hydroxide association, revealing a distinct local environment for nitrite in cesium-containing solutions. Together, these findings show that cesium promotes a unique solution structure dominated by specific ion pairing within segregated domains.

  abstract     = {We investigate the solubilities of water in liquid CO 2 in the presence and absence of coexisting clathrate hydrate from theoretical calculations of the chemical potentials of water and CO 2 in the aqueous, hydrate, and CO 2 fluid phases across a wide range of temperatures and pressures. One of the advantages of the present method is that it is applicable to deeply cooled and heavily compressed states where a CO 2 hydrate is formed. The experimental solubility curve against temperature is successfully recovered with an appropriate correction for the self-polarization energy implicitly embedded in the pairwise additive interaction model for water. The solubility of water in liquid CO 2 coexisting with an aqueous solution decreases upon cooling. It is found that the intervening hydrate steadily reduces the solubility of water compared to that assumed to be in direct contact with the aqueous phase. The significant decrease results from the decrease in the chemical potential of water in the hydrate, relocating the boundary from the water/hydrate to the hydrate/fluid. Liquid CO 2 loses its capacity to retain water upon cooling more seriously than that anticipated from the water/fluid boundary, and an excessive amount of water is precipitated into hydrate at low temperatures. The thermodynamic properties thus calculated provide valuable information on problems in the massive transport of CO 2 , specifically the blockage of pipelines and corrosion of vessels.},

Here, we prepared Ir(ppy) 3 doped vapor-deposited glasses in three different organic semiconductor hosts; Ir(ppy) 3 in a dilute concentration is often used as a light emitter in phosphorescent OLEDs. We studied these glasses during temperature ramping using spectroscopic ellipsometry and found that the Ir(ppy) 3 doped PVD glasses have high kinetic stability and high density. Surprisingly, the observed kinetic stability exceeds that of single-component PVD glasses.

  abstract     = {Modeling ionic activity is essential for understanding ion-specific effects in environmental and industrial systems. The microscopic interactions of heavy metal salts in aqueous solutions become increasingly complex with rising salt molality, posing significant challenges for accurately modeling ionic activity. This study applies, for the first time, an electrolyte version of the cubic-plus-association equation of state to calculate the mean ionic activity coefficients of several heavy metal salts in water at 298.15 K. Experimental data for four types of salts—nickel, cadmium, cobalt, and zinc salts—were compiled, and the ion–water binary interaction parameters are regressed from these measurements. The model successfully predicts water activity, osmotic coefficients, and mean ionic activity coefficients across most systems. Without explicit incorporation of ionic association, the average calculation relative average deviation of the mean ionic activity coefficient for nickel and cobalt salts is 5.9% and 6.3%, respectively, extending the applicable molality range up to 5.0 mol/kg water and 5.5 mol/kg water. For solutions of cadmium salts and zinc salts that have been confirmed to contain ion pairs, ion association was introduced into the model for calculation. The calculation results indicate that the consideration of ion association has significantly reduced the calculation deviations. Within the calculated salt molality ranges, the average relative deviation of the mean ionic activity coefficient for cadmium salts is all below 2.0%, while that for zinc salts is all less than 5.5%, respectively. This study provides valuable insights into the micro-level factors influencing activity coefficients and offers recommendations for improving model accuracy under complex conditions.},

We compare this standard method to a protocol that focuses on a virtual cavity whose size is chosen to include short-range dipolar cross correlations, while excluding long-range correlations that are affected by the choice of electrostatic boundary conditions. We tested this protocol on three non-polarizable systems with different dielectric permittivities. We showed that it produces the same dielectric spectra as the standard method while being less sensitive to noise. The question of the decomposition of a dielectric spectrum into self and cross contributions is discussed in the context of both methods.

On the basis of rotational analyses, nine vibronic bands in the LIF spectra have been attributed to the C ̃ Δ u 2 – X ̃ Π g 2 electronic transition of SiNSi. The 32 393 and 32 505 cm −1 subbands have been assigned to the two spin components of the 0 0 0 band.

The experimental identification that the Σ u ( + ) 2 level is lower than Σ u ( − ) 2 suggests that the in-phase bending potential, labeled as V + , is the lower (or outer) one for the C ̃ Δ u 2 electronic state. The Δl = ±2 vibronic bands, such as C ̃ (02 2 0) Σ u ( + ) 2 – X ̃ ( 0 0 0 0 ) Π g 2 ⁠ , which are forbidden by the Δl = 0 selection rule, are induced by the (quadratic) Renner–Teller (R–T) interaction of the C ̃ Δ u 2 state with the E ̃ Σ u + 2 state, i.e., the vibronic transition moment is induced by the quadratic R–T (2RT) interaction of the C ̃ Δ u 2 state with the E ̃ Σ u + 2 state. The vibronic bands can also obtain their transition moments through their neighbors, which are the vibronic bands of the electronically forbidden D ̃ Σ g + 2 – X ̃ Π g 2 transition. Based on the theory of the quaternary R–T (4RT) interaction, the vibrational structure of the C ̃ Δ u 2 state has been analyzed, and a local perturbation between the C ̃ ( 0 2 l 0 ) levels and their neighbor, D ̃ ( 0 1 1 0 ) Π u 2 ⁠ , has been identified.

  abstract     = {We have generated SiNSi in supersonic free expansions and observed laser induced fluorescence (LIF) in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible regions. We measured two kinds of LIF excitation spectra from the X ̃ Π g 2 electronic state: one detecting UV fluorescence and the other detecting visible fluorescence. By exciting the vibronic bands observed in the LIF excitation spectra, we recorded dispersed fluorescence (DF) spectra from the single vibronic levels to the X ̃ Π g 2 state. The vibrational structures of the DF spectra are complicated due to the relatively large vibronic interactions in the X ̃ Π g 2 state. We were not able to analyze the structure using regular formulations derived from perturbational treatments that consider the Renner–Teller (R–T) and spin–orbit (SO) couplings and the anharmonicity of the ν 2 bending potential. Instead, we analyzed it by directly diagonalizing the vibronic Hamiltonian, including not only R–T, SO, and the anharmonicity but also Fermi resonance between the ν 1 symmetric stretching and ν 2 modes and anharmonicities, x 11 and x 12 . The vibronic analysis revealed two characteristics: a relatively large R–T parameter, ϵ = +0.51, and a SO constant close to the bending frequency, A ≈ 0.8 ω 2 . Both these characteristics bring about accidental proximity of the vibronic levels in the D ∞h system, and this proximity causes heavy mixing among the vibronic levels. The results can be applied to find weak vibrationally hot bands in the rotationally resolved LIF excitation spectra observed, and actually the Q 1 p band head of the hot band, C ̃ ( 0 1 1 0 ) Π g 2 − X ̃ ( 0 1 1 0 ) κ Σ g ( + ) 2 ⁠ , has been able to be assigned.

  abstract     = {Hydrogen bonds, crucial for the formation and stabilization of complex organic molecules, present intriguing possibilities for the existence of such molecular complexes in extraterrestrial environments. To investigate the microscopic hydrogen-bonding networks in nitrile–methanol clusters—potential candidates for interstellar organic complexes—we recorded infrared spectra of neutral XN-M (XN = nitriles; M = methanol) heterodimers in the 2600-3900 cm −1 range using infrared-vacuum ultraviolet (IR-VUV) spectroscopy. Quantum chemical calculations based on harmonic approximations are typically used to simulate such spectral peaks; however, they often fail to fully reproduce the experimental features. To overcome these limitations, we employed ab initio anharmonic algorithms and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Anharmonic algorithms successfully assigned elusive spectral features by accounting for vibrational couplings (e.g., Fermi resonances and combination bands), and AIMD proved essential for accurately assigning characteristically broad hydrogen-bonded OH bands unresolved by harmonic methods. Applying this integrated approach, we confirmed the distinct H-bonding preferences in the XN-M heterodimers: acetonitrile (ACN) and unsaturated aliphatic nitriles (e.g., 3-butene nitrile, 3BN; 4-pentene nitrile, 4PN) predominantly adopt linear N⋯H–O configurations, whereas acrylonitrile and benzonitrile favor cyclic double H-bonded structures. This study establishes a powerful framework that integrates advanced computational methodologies to decipher hydrogen-bonding motifs from complex spectral data, enabling the direct interpretation of both laboratory and astronomical infrared observations.},

We find that increasing gold content weakens CO and O adsorption and limits oxygen-induced structural changes, while copper-rich particles undergo pronounced oxidation and reconstruction. Bader charge analysis shows that, in bare nanoalloys, Au withdraws electron density from Cu due to their electronegativity difference. In oxidized Cu–Au nanoalloys, the charge on Cu atoms depends on the number of O neighbors and can reach values typical of Cu 2 O (0.6 e ) and CuO (1.1 e ). On average, the Cu atoms exhibit positive effective Bader charges of ∼0.9 e in these nanoalloys.

  abstract     = {4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) is a widely utilized DNA sensor, renowned for its strong affinity for the AT minor groove. Despite its essential role as a fluorescent probe in molecular biology and biomedical research, the origins of DAPI’s intrinsic fluorescence and the mechanisms behind its fluorescence enhancement upon DNA sensing remain unresolved. This study provides a comprehensive investigation into the fluorescence dynamics of DAPI, both in solution and when bound to detect the AT minor groove of a self-complementary dodecamer duplex DNA. We employed an integrated approach combining femtosecond broadband time-resolved fluorescence, transient absorption, and supported by theoretical calculations. The results reveal an unprecedented ultrafast inter-solute–solvent three-state excited-state proton transfer pathway, which clarifies the root cause of low fluorescence yield and fluorescence dynamics of free form DAPI in aqueous solution. Irrespective of the structural heterogeneity and rotamer conformation of the ground state of DAPI, this involves deprotonation of the excited state at a rate of ∼2.4 ps, followed by proton reuptake by the resulting weakly emissive deprotonated state, leading to direct reformation of DAPI’s ground state at 139 ps. Binding to the DNA minor groove completely inhibits this proton transfer, accounting for the significant fluorescence enhancement observed in the DAPI-DNA complex. Furthermore, the broadband capacity of our time-resolved fluorescence approach enables, for the first time, direct tracking of the fluorescence dynamic Stokes shift of minor groove-bound DAPI, revealing significant dispersive collective solvation dynamics specific to the sensing site. These findings provide valuable insights into how microenvironments dictate DAPI fluorescence dynamics and may assist in the strategic design of light-up sensors for recognizing interior hydration dynamics and local residue motions of DNA.},

  abstract     = {The current status of the theoretical foundations of the Chiral-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect has substantially improved from its original one-electron formulation. However, there is a need to improve the inclusion of electron–vibrational interaction, the exchange and correlation effects arising from electron–electron interactions, and non-Born–Oppenheimer coupling to enhance the predictive power of the theory and its agreement with experiments. In an attempt to overcome these difficulties, we advance in the present work a microscopic quantum mechanical treatment of CISS based on the relativistic Breit–Pauli many-particle Hamiltonian. In particular, we determine in this context the effect that including non-Born–Oppenheimer components arising in a Taylor expansion of the electron–nuclear potential has on the spin–orbit coupling term of this Hamiltonian. We also consider in this framework the electron–electron exchange and correlation effects and propose some practical approximations based on non-relativistic approaches. Finally, we extend the application of the Breit–Pauli Hamiltonian to describe nuclear–nuclear spin interactions and discuss the possibility of explaining enantiomeric selectivity in cross-polarization nuclear magnetic resonance experiments.},

  abstract     = {The mean back relaxation (MBR) relates the value of a stochastic process at three different time points. It has been shown to detect broken detailed balance under certain conditions. For experiments of probe particles in living and passivated cells, MBR was found to be related to the so-called effective energy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. In this paper, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters that enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding qualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the phenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of time parameters compared to previous work, allowing us to test it in systems with limited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in dependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in MBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in terms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum as a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data to a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process.},

  abstract     = {Providing highly simplified models of strongly correlated electronic systems that challenge ab initio calculations can serve as a valuable testing ground to improve these methods. In this study, we present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of one-dimensional transition metal mono-oxide chains (VO, CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO) using density functional theory (DFT), DFT+ U , and coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) calculations. The Hubbard U parameter for DFT+ U is determined using linear response theory. In all systems studied except MnO, the presence of multiple local minima—primarily due to the electronic degrees of freedom associated with the d -orbitals—leads to significant challenges for DFT, DFT+ U , and Hartree–Fock methods in finding the global minimum in ab initio calculations. Our results indicate that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state is energetically favored for all chains, except CrO, when using DFT+ U and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. Analysis of the band structures shows that while PBE often predicts metallic or half-metallic FM states, DFT+ U opens band gaps and correctly yields insulating behavior in all cases. Furthermore, we compared the energy differences between the AFM and FM states using DFT+ U and CCSD for CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO. Our findings indicate that CCSD predicts larger energy differences in some cases compared to DFT+ U , suggesting that the Hubbard U parameter obtained through linear response theory may be overestimated when used to calculate energy differences between different magnetic states. For CrO, CCSD predicts an AFM ground state, in contrast to the predictions from DFT+ U and PBE methods.},

Our methodology combines ab initio molecular dynamics with time-dependent density functional theory and a polarizable continuum model to characterize the ground- and excited-state potential energy surfaces of the rotor in cyclohexane. Time-resolved vibrational analysis based on wavelet transform enables the decomposition of the nuclear motion into time–frequency components. This approach allows us to follow the evolution of vibrational dynamics and their role in key relaxation pathways and spectroscopic signals. We propose that, although not directly observable, complex vibrational dynamics influence the emission by modulating both the transition energy and the emission dipole moment. These include C=C stretching, out-of-plane motions at the axle carbon, and rotor–stator torsional modes. For the first time, we assign and interpret low-frequency modes observed experimentally at ∼180 cm −1 in time-resolved fluorescence. We reproduce the extent and the dynamics of the pronounced red shift of the C=C stretching mode upon excitation, as observed in the femtosecond stimulated Raman spectrum (1585 cm −1 in the ground state vs 1350–1440 cm −1 in the excited state). Regarding the photoisomerization, we identify a clear correlated steric-relief mechanism of the two main relaxation coordinates: torsion about the C=C axle and pyramidalization at the stator–bridge carbon. This study demonstrates the power of transient vibrational analysis in unraveling complex photorelaxation mechanisms by establishing a direct link between experimental data and excited-state molecular dynamics simulations.},

These limitations pose significant challenges in scientific and engineering contexts, where generating exhaustive datasets is often impractical and the goal is to frequently discover novel solutions outside the training domain. In this work, we explore the use of dynamical data through a graph neural network-based simulator to enable efficient system-to-property learning and out-of-distribution prediction in the context of uniaxial compression of two-dimensional disordered elastic networks. We find that the simulator can learn the underlying physical dynamics from a small number of training examples and accurately reproduce the temporal evolution of unseen networks. Notably, the simulator is able to accurately predict emergent properties such as Poisson’s ratio and its dependence on strain, even though it was not explicitly trained for this task. In addition, it generalizes well across variations in system temperature, strain amplitude, and most significantly, Poisson’s ratios beyond the training range. These findings suggest that using dynamical data to train machine learning models can support more information efficient and generalizable approaches for materials and molecular design, especially in data-scarce settings.},

The new CVs can be used directly in PLUMED—a popular open-source library for enhanced-sampling and free-energy methods—so they can be used directly in metadynamics workflows. They allow the investigation of conformational transitions, the identification of metastable states, and the mapping of free-energy landscapes of any seven-membered-ring molecule. This provides a quantitative framework for probing the conformational behavior of flexible seven-membered scaffolds and will aid in the rational design of conformationally locked substrates for enzyme engineering and related applications.},

The computational complexity of this model scales identically to CC2 with molecular size. Conventional CC2 and its regularized BWs-CC2 variants, as well as conventional MP2 and two of its regularized BW-s2 variants, were assessed on a 535 element database spanning thermochemistry, non-covalent interactions, barrier heights, and isomerization energies. To ensure a well-defined model chemistry, the assessment was performed using internally stable spin-polarized Hartree–Fock (HF) orbitals in the finite aug-cc-pVQZ basis without counterpoise corrections. As a result of using stable orbitals, contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that CC2 substantially outperforms MP2 on molecules with significantly spin contaminated reference orbitals without a significant increase in error on systems with a spin-pure reference, showing the value of its single substitutions. While no single choice of regularization parameters can be optimal for all datasets, we find that BWs-CC2 generally outperforms both CC2 and BW-s2 with a single judicious parameter choice. Additional tests on dipole moments and bond lengths of diatomics provide further support for the utility of this choice. The main outliers and poorest performing cases are associated with large amounts of spin-contamination in the HF reference, which is indicative of systems with either strong correlation or extensive artificial symmetry breaking. Overall, these findings argue that the perception of the quality of the CC2 ground state should be reevaluated and that it can be further improved upon by the soundly based BWs-CC2 variant with the recommended parameter choice.},

  abstract     = {Forming new hybrid quasiparticles by strong light–matter coupling is a promising tool for tailoring the photophysics and photochemistry of molecules. Thus, the ultrafast dynamics of polaritons formed upon strong light–matter coupling has been extensively studied by pump–probe spectroscopy. Although it was predicted that the partial photonic character of polaritons should shorten their lifetime compared to purely molecular excited states, many studies do not observe this effect. So far, the unexpected longevity of the spectral signatures has been either explained by relaxation into a manifold of so-called dark states or by other uncontrolled effects that change the properties of cavity materials. In order to resolve these issues, we investigate here the dependence of the line shape of pump–probe spectra of polaritons on the ratio of photonic and molecular character. Furthermore, by phenomenologically including relaxation to dark states, we find that it is possible to spectrally resolve this relaxation process by observing a characteristic phase flip in the pump–probe signal. Our results show that the signatures of dark state relaxation and the influence of the cavity resonance energy and their contributions to the polariton dynamics can be disentangled from the spectral line shapes.},

For a model of cis – trans isomerization in a protonated Schiff base, vibronic effects induced by intramolecular torsional and bond-length-alternation modes act concertedly with a collective environmental mode, which plays the role of an effective tuning mode. The latter is coupled to a residual environment, and the combination of the effective and residual modes conforms to an overdamped Brownian oscillator type spectral density. Thermal averages are included by the thermofield dynamics approach, in line with the thermal Hamiltonian developed in Paper I. The m-NN potentials, modeled according to the regularized diabatic states representation, permit an accurate representation of the vibronic coupling Hamiltonian beyond a linear vibronic coupling model. The initial excited-state dynamics is determined by the approach to a curved conical intersection seam, followed by a strongly dissipative phase leading to equilibration in the adiabatic ground state. The characteristic inertial time scale of the environment impacts not only the time of approach to the conical intersection seam but also the isomerization yield. The present study makes first steps toward extending the m-NN approach to a treatment of collective environmental non-equilibrium evolution on par with intramolecular excited-state nonadiabatic dynamics.},

Here, we show how neural network (NN) potentials can be adapted to a combination of intramolecular coordinates and collective environmental modes. Specifically, we use multiplicative NN (m-NN) potentials, which are fitted to a diabatic representation of regularized diabatic states type. These potentials are readily combined with multiconfigurational wave functions for high-dimensional quantum dynamics. The thermofield dynamics (TFD) approach is employed to include thermal averaging at the wave function level, and we formulate a thermal NN/TFD Hamiltonian that accommodates initial vibronic correlations and collective/residual-mode coupling in the environmental subspace. For a model system describing the isomerization of protonated Schiff bases in solution, the solvent is represented by an overdamped Brownian-oscillator spectral density. In a companion paper [B.

  abstract     = {Understanding the dynamic behavior of polar fluids is essential for modeling complex systems such as electrolytes and biological media. In this work, we develop and apply a stochastic density functional theory (SDFT) framework to describe the polarization dynamics in the Stockmayer fluid, a prototypical model of dipolar liquids consisting of Lennard-Jones particles with embedded point dipoles. Starting from the overdamped Langevin dynamics of dipolar particles, we derive analytical expressions for the intermediate scattering functions and dynamic structure factors of the longitudinal and transverse components of the polarization field, within linearized SDFT. To assess the theory’s validity, we compare its predictions with results from Brownian Dynamics simulations of the Stockmayer fluid. We find that SDFT captures the longitudinal polarization fluctuations accurately, while transverse fluctuations are underestimated due to the neglect of dipolar correlations. By incorporating the Kirkwood factor into a modified SDFT, we recover quantitative agreement for both components across a range of dipole strengths. This study highlights the utility of SDFT as a coarse-grained description of polar fluid dynamics and provides insights into the role of collective effects in polarization relaxation.},

  abstract     = {The core–shell type structure of metal-dielectric nanoparticles has great applications in the fields of nanophotonics and biomedical sciences due to the plasmonic properties of metals and field enhancements at metal-dielectric interfaces. The present study reveals critical insights into the influence of these properties on the optical trapping of core–shell nanoparticles, investigated using generalized Lorenz-Mie theory. Specifically, the presence of Fano resonance is discussed based on the size contribution of the core and shell and its influence on the directionality of the scattering force. Furthermore, the effects of optical nonlinearity on the appearance of Fano resonance and trapping efficiency are explored under femtosecond pulsed excitation.},

  abstract     = {Dimensionality reduction represents a crucial step in extracting meaningful insights from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Conventional approaches, including linear methods such as principal component analysis as well as various autoencoder architectures, typically operate under the assumption of independent and identically distributed data, disregarding the sequential nature of MD simulations. Here, we introduce a physics-informed representation learning framework that leverages Gaussian processes combined with variational autoencoders to exploit the temporal dependencies inherent in MD data. Time-dependent kernel functions—such as the Matérn kernel—directly impose the temporal correlation structure of the input coordinates onto a low-dimensional space, preserving Markovianity in the reduced representation while faithfully capturing the essential dynamics. Using a three-dimensional toy model, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully identify and separate dynamically distinct states that are geometrically indistinguishable due to hidden degrees of freedom. Applying the framework to a 50 μ s-long MD trajectory of T4 lysozyme, we uncover dynamically distinct conformational substates that previous analyses failed to resolve, revealing functional relationships that become apparent only when temporal correlations are taken into account. This time-aware perspective provides a promising framework for understanding complex biomolecular systems, in which conventional collective variables fail to capture the full dynamical picture.},

  abstract     = {We present an efficient approach to simulate real-time quantum dynamics using projected variational quantum dynamics, where the computational cost is reduced by strategically optimizing only a subset of the variational parameters at each time step. Typically, the variational Ansatz consists of repeated blocks of parameterized quantum circuits, where all parameters are updated in a standard optimization procedure. In contrast, our method selectively optimizes one block at a time while keeping the others fixed, allowing for significant reductions in computational overhead. This semi-global optimization strategy ensures that all qubits are still involved in the evolution, but the optimization is localized to specific blocks, thus avoiding the need to update all parameters simultaneously. We propose different approaches for choosing the next block for optimization, including sequential, random, and fidelity-based updation. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods in a series of spin-lattice models with varying sizes and complexity. Our method preserves the accuracy of the time evolution with a much lower computational cost. This new optimization strategy provides a promising path toward high-fidelity simulation of the time evolution of complex quantum systems with reduced computational resources.},

  abstract     = {Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) has emerged as a groundbreaking advancement in the field of photoluminescence behavior. A thorough understanding of the AIE mechanism is essential for the rational design of innovative molecules exhibiting these exceptional properties. In this study, we report a quantum mechanical (QM) investigation through spin-flip time dependent density functional theory (SF-TDDFT) using optimally tuned range-separated hybrid (OT-RSH) functional to explore the cause of fluorescence quenching of the ethylene derivatives such as TPE-9CB, TPE-3CB, and tetraphenylethene-triphenylamine in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution. The fluorescence enhancement in the crystalline state of an ethylene derivative TPE-9CB is studied by adopting a QM:MM based approach using the SF-TDDFT method and RSH functional. It is observed that the OT-RSH functional delivers impressive results regarding photophysical properties. The twisting of the central C=C bond has been identified as the phenomenon that quenches the photoexcited state of the ethylene derivatives in THF solution. Notably, the minimum-gap point (MGP) along the α-torsional coordinate of the S 1 state in solution lies ∼0.1 eV below the Frank–Condon (FC) point for all the derivatives. Interestingly, all examined monomers exhibited nearly zero oscillator strength ( f values) near the point of minimum-gap, indicating minimal radiative transitions in the solution state. Conversely, the excited state deactivation channels, which involve the twisting of the central C=C bond in the solution phase, are effectively restricted in the solid state by steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion from the neighboring molecules. In the solid state, the MGP is 0.48 eV above the FC point, demanding high energy to prevent photoinduced rotary relaxation. This effectively blocks nonradiative deactivation pathways, resulting in a significant enhancement of the emission response. Our findings underscore the potential of AIE phenomena in advancing material design and applications.},

We describe electronic states of N -electron systems by means of variational evaluation of the corresponding two-electron reduced density matrix elements, subject to determined N -representability conditions, arising from the restricted, unrestricted, and generalized spin approaches. The results are compared with those predicted by the counterpart treatments involving wave functions. We report potential energy curves for a series of hydrogen atom clusters with different geometries in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field. These results allow us to analyze and discuss crossings between potential energy curves involving transitions between electronic states of different spin multiplicities. The predictions provided by these methods have been contrasted with the results arising from the full configuration interaction procedure, confirming changes of ⟨ S ̂ 2 ⟩ and ⟨ S ̂ z ⟩ expectation values.},

  abstract     = {In addition to translational and rotational symmetries, clusters of identical interacting particles possess permutational symmetry. Coarse-grained models for such systems are instrumental in identifying metastable states, providing an effective description of their dynamics, and estimating transition rates. We propose a numerical framework for learning collective variables that respect translational, rotational, and permutational symmetries and for estimating transition rates and residence times. It combines a sort-based featurization, residence manifold learning in the feature space, and learning of collective variables with autoencoders whose loss function utilizes the orthogonality relationship [F. Legoll and T. Lelievre, Nonlinearity 23 , 2131–2163 (2010)]. The committor of the resulting reduced model is used as the reaction coordinate in the forward flux sampling and to design a control for sampling the transition path process. We offer two case studies, the Lennard-Jones-7 in 2D and the Lennard-Jones-8 in 3D. The transition rates and residence times computed with the aid of the reduced models agree with those obtained via brute-force methods.},
