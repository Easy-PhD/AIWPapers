Localized properties, including polarization, lattice parameter, and chemical composition, are parameterized from atomic-scale imaging, and their causal relationships are reconstructed using a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model. This approach is further extended to explore the spatial variability of the causal coupling using the sliding window transform method, which revealed that new causal relationships emerged at both the expected locations, such as domain walls and interfaces, and at additional regions forming clusters in the vicinity of the walls or spatially distributed features. While the exact physical origins of these relationships are unclear, they likely represent nanophase-separated regions in the morphotropic phase boundaries. Overall, we posit that an in-depth understanding of complex disordered materials away from thermodynamic equilibrium necessitates understanding not only the generative processes that can lead to observed microscopic states but also the causal links between multiple interacting subsystems.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the behavior of a fluid as it flows through porous media is critical for electrochemical devices and other scientific, industrial, and environmental applications. The main challenge lies in accurately capturing the complex, multi-scale fluid flow behavior through irregular porous microstructures, all while maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a multi-fidelity surrogate model that predicts the high-fidelity flow field state variables in explicit porous media microstructures with minimal computational cost. Our approach begins by collecting both low-fidelity and high-fidelity simulation data to train the surrogate model. The former low-fidelity data are obtained from numerical simulations of fluid flowing through macro-scale structures having homogenized effective material properties. On the other hand, the latter high-fidelity data include geometric details of the dehomogenized explicit porous media microstructure. This technique combines the detailed accuracy of high-fidelity data with the computational efficiency of low-fidelity data, thus enhancing the model performance. In addition, we integrate physics-informed neural networks into the surrogate modeling process, embedding physical laws derived from the Navier–Stokes equations that govern fluid flow. This multi-scale, multi-fidelity approach offers a precise and cost-effective solution for predicting the fluid flow velocity and pressure fields in the porous media. For relevant porous media fluid flow applications, we show a ∼ 1 0 3 × faster solution in terms of increased computational speed for a given model with reasonable representative accuracy of the solution, within a range of ∼5%–20% for velocity and ≤10% for pressure fields.},

However, studying these transitions typically requires large supercells to minimize constraints on atomic movements, significantly increasing computational time and cost. In this study, we developed a machine learning potential by fine-tuning the MACE-MP-0 model with a customized BTO database. The fine-tuned MACE model demonstrated high accuracy in reproducing the structural and dynamic characteristics of BTO systems. Notably, the model effectively represented changes in lattice constants and polarization during phase transitions (rhombohedral → orthorhombic → tetragonal → cubic). Furthermore, we employed the fine-tuned MACE model to investigate the melting point of BTO and subsequently generated liquid-phase and amorphous structures via thermal annealing, providing valuable insights into the high-temperature behavior of BTO.},

To improve crystal quality, the multi-point seed technique and the flux film coated technique have been developed, enabling the growth of low-dislocation GaN wafers via the Na-flux method. However, the coalescence boundary (CB) region, formed by the fusion of multiple growth fronts, exhibits complex structural variations that remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we investigate the CB region of FFC-GaN using synchrotron-based nanobeam x-ray diffraction (nanoXRD). To analyze the high-dimensional diffraction data without prior labeling, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning framework that combines Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with agglomerative clustering. This approach identifies six crystallographically distinct clusters that align well with growth sectors inferred from cathodoluminescence imaging. By further applying the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, we enhance the pixel-level interpretation of structural evolution during different growth stages of CB. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the combination of UMAP, clustering, and statistical testing enables direct, label-free crystallographic analysis of crystal growth sectors. This framework is believed to be generalizable to other high-dimensional experimental datasets, opening new avenues for uncovering hidden structural features in complex material systems.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian optimization (BO) has become an indispensable tool for autonomous decision-making across diverse applications from autonomous vehicle control to accelerated drug and materials discovery. With the growing interest in self-driving laboratories, BO of chemical systems is crucial for machine learning guided experimental planning. Typically, BO employs a regression surrogate model to predict the distribution of unseen parts of the search space. However, for the selection of molecules, picking the top candidates with respect to a distribution, the relative ordering of their properties may be more important than their exact values. In this paper, we introduce rank-based Bayesian optimization (RBO), which utilizes a ranking model as the surrogate. We present a comprehensive investigation of RBO’s optimization performance compared to conventional BO on various chemical datasets. Our results demonstrate similar or improved optimization performance using ranking models, particularly for datasets with rough structure–property landscapes and activity cliffs. Furthermore, we observe a high correlation between the surrogate ranking ability and BO performance, and this ability is maintained even at early iterations of BO optimization when using ranking surrogate models. We conclude that RBO is an effective alternative to regression-based BO, especially for optimizing novel chemical compounds.},

We first generate a scattering dataset by carrying out molecular dynamics simulations of the polydisperse hard spheres modeled by the truncated-shifted Lennard-Jones model, then analyze the scattering function dataset using singular value decomposition to confirm the feasibility of dimensional compression. Then, we split the dataset into training and testing sets and train our neural network on the training set only. Our generator model produces a scattering function with significantly higher accuracy compared to the traditional Percus–Yevick approximation and β correction, and the inferrer model can extract the volume fraction and polydispersity with much higher accuracy than traditional model functions.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of artificial-intelligence driven autonomous experiments demands physics-based modeling and decision-making processes, not only to improve the accuracy of the experimental trajectory but also to increase trust by allowing transparent human-machine collaboration. High-quality structural characterization techniques (e.g., x ray, neutron, or static light scattering) are a particularly relevant example of this need: they provide invaluable information but are challenging to analyze without expert oversight. Here, we introduce AutoSAS, a novel framework for human-aside-the-loop automated data classification. AutoSAS leverages human-defined candidate models, high-throughput combinatorial fitting, and information-theoretic model selection to generate both classification results and quantitative structural descriptors. We implement AutoSAS in an open-source package designed for use with the Autonomous Formulation Laboratory for x-ray and neutron scattering-based optimization of multi-component liquid formulations. In a first application, we leveraged a set of expert defined candidate models to classify, refine the structure, and track transformations in a model injectable drug carrier system. We evaluated four model selection methods and benchmarked them against an optimized machine learning classifier, and the best approach was one that balanced quality of the fit and complexity of the model. AutoSAS not only corroborated the critical micelle concentration boundary identified in previous experiments but also discovered a second structural transition boundary not identified by the previous methods. These results demonstrate the potential of AutoSAS to enhance autonomous experimental workflows by providing robust, interpretable model selection, paving the way for more reliable and insightful structural characterization in complex formulations.},

An example of this is the design of photonic metasurfaces by using their photoluminescent spectrum as the input data to predict their topology. One fundamental challenge of these systems is their ability to represent nonlinear relationships between sets of data that have different dimensionalities. Existing design methods often implement a conditional generative adversarial network in order to solve this problem, but in many cases, the solution is unable to generate structures that provide multiple peaks when validated. It is demonstrated that in response to the target spectrum, the bidirectional adversarial autoencoder is able to generate structures that provide multiple peaks on several occasions. As a result, the proposed model represents an important advance toward the generation of nonlinear photonic metasurfaces that can be used in advanced metasurface design.},

As a model system, we used the periodic precipitation of copper(II) hydroxide and targeted the synthesis of “Liesegang” precipitation bands with a well-defined spacing. Our workflow involved conducting high-throughput synthesis experiments, mapping the spatial distribution of the products as a function of initial reactant concentrations, and scalarizing the emerging patterns using empirical scaling laws. Subsequently, machine learning models were deployed to process the scalarized descriptors and inform the next round of experimental conditions in order to converge toward a target precipitation pattern, without human input. We anticipate that these results open pathways for autonomous materials synthesis via reaction–diffusion coupling to create complex products with user-defined chemistry, morphology, and spatial distribution within a reaction medium.},

We demonstrate that the new ML model accurately reproduces the energy bands and wavefunctions of structures outside the training set, closely matching first-principle calculations. This accuracy is achieved with significantly lower computational costs due to the elimination of self-consistency iterations and the reduced size of the plane-wave basis set.

  abstract     = {Significant advancements in machine learning have accelerated and improved structure–property predictions for materials discovery. However, data are often scarce due to large parameter spaces consisting of chemistry, structure, synthesis, and processing variables. At small data limits, theory can be leveraged to inform machine learning (ML) models with domain knowledge and improve generalization. Here, we determine how the accuracy of first-principles calculations affects theory-informed ML predictions of the experimental solvation free energy Δ G solv e x p in both “small” (10 1 –10 2 ) and “large” (10 3 –10 4 ) data size limits. We compare several existing theory-informed techniques to a baseline (no theory) model: feature-informed, difference, and ratio. At small data limits, all theory-informed models exhibit lower RMSE, reducing training data size by more than 65% compared to the baseline model. With larger training set sizes and as theory prediction accuracy declines, the difference and ratio models exhibit larger errors than the baseline model, indicating negative transfer occurs. No negative transfer is observed in the feature-informed model; however, the model is unable to extrapolate outside of the known Δ G solv e x p distribution, whereas the difference and ratio models exhibit lower extrapolation error. Finally, we employ each model in an active learning algorithm and compare two exploration acquisition functions: maximum difference and maximum variance. Sampling with the maximum difference policy reduces RMSE and variance of the feature-informed model faster than maximum variance early in the exploration campaign, as it identifies label bounds in fewer iterations. Our findings highlight the balance between leveraging theory and relying on data-driven models in high-throughput materials discovery.},

  abstract     = {We analyzed the application of quantum machine learning in histopathological cancer detection under adversarial attacks, demonstrating its potential to enhance diagnostic performance in adverse circumstances. Adversarial attacks are one of the major concerns in any image classification machine learning model and are responsible for perturbing the original input images, which, therefore, results in misclassification. To encounter this problem, we first developed the hybrid quantum transfer learning model by incorporating multiple transfer learning architectures such as ResNet-18, VGG-16, Inception-v3, and AlexNet with variational quantum circuits for histopathological cancer detection. Second, we introduced white-box adversarial attacks using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and DeepFool and projected gradient descent (PGD) methods in this model and evaluated each model’s performance against these adversarial attacks. We analyzed that the Hybrid Classical Quantum Deep Learning model (HCQ-DL) with ResNet-18 provides 78.05% accuracy compared to the Classical ResNet-18 model with the highest accuracy of 50.84% for FGSM attacks. Similarly, for DeepFool attacks, HCQ-DL with ResNet-18 performs 52.12% accurately compared to the Classical ResNet-18 model with the highest accuracy of 37.87% and for PGD attacks, HCQ-DL with ResNet-18 has 52.94% performance accuracy compared to the Classical Inception-V3 model with the highest accuracy of 32.05%. As a result, we observed that HCQ-DL models are more resilient to these adversarial attacks compared to classical deep learning models and show potential to achieve greater robustness when combined with additional defense techniques.},

  abstract     = {Metallic thin films offer a platform to experimentally study the dynamics of microstructural evolution, but the required transmission electron microscopy (TEM)-based imaging generates complex images that are challenging to segment and quantify. This work provides a comparative analysis of a new YOLOv8 model and an established U-Net model for bright-field TEM images of polycrystals, employing a framework leveraging physical observables to evaluate performance against two hand-traced benchmark datasets. This methodology obviates the comparison of large, diversely structured, and manually labeled datasets that are required to assess performance on a per-image/per-pixel basis. It is found that the YOLOv8 model, adapted for real-time instance segmentation, has up to 43× faster inferencing (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090) compared to U-Net and reconstructs hand-traced grain size distributions (GSDs) with excellent fidelity, finding mean diameter within 3% for grains near an optimal magnification; for grains that deviate from the optimal pixel-diameter, the size of small- (large)-diameter grains is systematically over- (under)-estimated. This is partially mitigated by including scale-aware augmentations during training. Moreover, when the bias is corrected post-inference by a rigid shift in distribution, the YOLOv8 model reproduces ground truth GSDs with exceptional fidelity, with statistical tests indicating <5% probability that the distributions are distinct. Based on ground truth data, calibration curves pertaining to this shift can be constructed for a given model. This issue is not present in the U-Net model’s results, indicating that for quantitative measurements where the true size of objects is of interest, special procedures must be implemented for YOLO-based models.},

  abstract     = {Materials informatics (MI), emerging from the fusion of materials science and data science, has the potential to greatly accelerate material development and discovery. Although MI relies on data from both computational and experimental studies, their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we addressed this challenge by training a machine learning model on experimental data and applying it to compositional entries in a computational database, thereby creating a unified dataset. In this study, we use these integrated datasets to construct material maps that visualize the relationships between material properties and structural features. The goal is to provide experimental researchers with a practical tool for exploring structurally similar compounds and thus their associated routes. We generate the materials map using the MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which represents crystal structures as graphs and employs deep learning for property prediction. Statistical analyses reveal that the MDL equipped with a message passing neural network (MPNN) architecture efficiently captures features related to the structural complexity of materials. Interestingly, this representational advantage does not always lead to higher accuracy in property prediction. We attribute this finding to the strong learning capacity of MPNN, which contributes primarily to the organization of data points within the materials map rather than to incremental gains in predictive precision.},

This approach benefits from robust pretrained features, which improve convergence and generalization even with large training datasets. By fine-tuning pretrained deep learning architectures—including VisionTransformer, ResNet152, and VGG19—we accurately predict eigenfrequencies, dilution coefficients, and buckling behaviors. Using a large dataset of 170 000 samples generated with COMSOL Multiphysics, our models capture complex physical phenomena, delivering performance comparable to traditional finite element methods but at significantly reduced computational cost. Specifically, eigenfrequency predictions across 15 eigenmodes consistently achieve low relative errors (1%–3%) with minimal variance. Dilution coefficient predictions remain accurate for lower eigenmodes, maintaining relative errors below 10% for the four lowest modes using static pruning thresholds. However, for higher modes, accuracy deteriorates—potentially due to the increased complexity and localized nature of higher-order mode shapes. In addition, our models exhibit robust performance in classifying membrane buckling behaviors in a binary setting, achieving over 95% accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Artificial neural networks (NNs) can be implemented using chemical reaction networks (CRNs), where the concentrations of species act as inputs and outputs. In such biochemical computing, noise-robust computing is crucial due to the intrinsic and extrinsic noise present in chemical reactions. Previously suggested CRNs for feed-forward networks often utilized the rectified linear unit or discrete activation functions. However, one concern in this case is the discontinuities of the derivatives of those non-smooth functions, which can cause significant noise disruption during backpropagation. In this study, we propose CRNs that perform both feed-forward and training processes using smooth activation functions to avoid discontinuities in the backpropagation. All reactions occur in a single pot, and the reactions for training are bimolecular. Our case studies on the XOR, Iris, MNIST datasets, and a non-linear regression model demonstrate that computation via the CRN (i) maintains accuracy despite noise in the reaction rates and the concentration of species and (ii) is insensitive to the choice of the running time and the magnitude of the noise in comparison to NNs with a non-smooth activation function. This work presents a noise-robust NN and backpropagation implemented by CRNs, paving the way for more stable and efficient biochemical computing systems.},

  abstract     = {Imaging techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), are used to understand the morphology and microstructure of material systems. However, large datasets are needed to relate the microstructure and composition of the material system to overall behavior. Depending on the complexity and cost of the material system and imaging techniques, accurate datasets are difficult to obtain. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can provide a framework to understand the relation between the morphology and microstructural behavior of material systems. Deep convolution GANs (DC-GANs) can be trained from experimentally characterized datasets to predict the morphology of various material systems. Hence, in this investigation, a limited dataset of 48 SEM images for PDMS with various weight fractions of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was obtained and used to train a DC-GAN. Iterative image augmentation techniques were then used to accurately extend the limited dataset. SEM micrographs of CNT-PDMS were then generated from the trained DC-GAN to predict the morphology and microstructure for different magnifications and weight fractions of CNTs. Error analysis approaches based on generator and discriminator losses were used to assess the accuracy and reliability of the trained sets. This proposed approach provides a verifiable framework for training experimentally obtained SEM microstructural datasets of any dimension that can be trained to understand the behavior of CNT-polymer systems and to augment experimental imaging predictions.},

Greater efficiency in software design to lower costs is of clear benefit to AI customers. It is also, however, critical to acknowledge the urgent need to sustain the otherwise continuous growth of compute power needed for AI systems and to reduce the energy consumption of AI systems, both of which are generally growing exponentially. Hardware has a critical role to play here. Thus, in addition to software progress, fundamental innovations across the hardware stack—from functional materials and novel devices to efficient system architectures and new computing paradigms—are pressing needs. Considering the ongoing climate crisis, we argue for the urgent need for accelerated and connected government- and industry-funded research and development in the hardware domain.

  abstract     = {The aerodynamic stability of large-scale birds, attributed to their covert feathers, has long fascinated biologists and bio-inspired design communities. However, existing theories cannot accurately describe the biological physics of coverts. Here, we propose a theory, based on their biological constraints, by defining covert behavior in terms of two modes: Mode Attach and Mode Deform. To validate the theory and to provide a greater understanding of the physics involved, we conduct a series of wind tunnel experiments using coverts on a man-made wing. Both the biological and physical aspects of this theory are well validated. The results show that in Mode Attach, the covert wake coincides with the wing-bound vortices, whereas in Mode Deform, it detaches from the wing wake vortices. The root constraint level affects the process of transitioning from Mode Attach to Mode Deform. Coverts positioned closer to the wing's leading edge result in smaller coherent turbulence structure scales exhibited in the wake region and higher shedding stability of the wake vortices. Furthermore, compared to those in the clean wing case, the nonlinear vortex packets attached to the wing's suction surface are modulated into self-sustaining attached vortices at multiple scales. Additional anechoic tunnel tests also demonstrated that this theory and definition provide a platform for studying both the aerodynamics and the aeroacoustics of coverts.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, I-V-VI 2 compounds have attracted significant scholarly attention due to their inherently low thermal conductivity. However, almost no n -type counterpart with a similar rock salt structure has been identified within the I-V-VI 2 family. It is worth noting that AgBiSe 2 synthesized via the high-temperature solid-state method stands out as one of the rare n -type semiconductors. In this work, the thermoelectric performance of AgBiSe 2 was significantly improved by partial substitution of Ag + upon Mn 3+ ions. Electrical conductivity ( σ ) of Ag 1− x Mn x BiSe 2 ( x = 0, 0.015, 0.03, 0.045, 0.06) compounds increases from ∼39 S cm −1 ( x = 0, at 727 K) to ∼166 S cm −1 ( x = 0.06, at 733 K), while the total thermal conductivity ( κ t ) reduces from ∼0.44 W m −1 K −1 for x = 0 at 727 K to respective ∼0.38 and ∼0.36 W m −1 K −1 for x = 0.03 and 0.015, at 733 K. Accordingly, a maximum thermoelectric figure of merit ZT ( ZT max ) value of ∼0.80 is achieved at 733 K for both x = 0.03 and 0.015 samples, representing a substantial improvement by 74% in comparison with the pristine AgBiSe 2 ( ∼ 0.46 at 727 K).

Through systematic investigation, the combination of electrospun PI nanofiber membranes with microstructured PA fabrics maximizes the effective contact area and charge-transfer pathways. The results showed that the PI nanofiber/PA fabric pairing yields an open-circuit voltage of 76 V and a short-circuit current of 5.9 µA under a 20 N load at 3 Hz. The optimized device powered 56 light-emitting diodes and charged commercial capacitors with high efficiency. Additionally, an intelligent security system based on TENG technology was developed, underscoring its versatility for self-powered electronics and energy storage.

  abstract     = {Three kinds of alkaline-metal iodide salts (CsI, LiI, and KI) are blended in the carbon paste, which is then used to coat the carbon-electrode (CE) on perovskite (PVSK) layer, then the resultant CE based perovskite solar cells are treated in a damp chamber with relative humidity of 85%. It is observed that the salt treatment could raise the power conversion efficiency of the devices, and CsI treatment comes out with the fastest rising rate. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope studies observe that CsI treatment triggers secondary growth of PVSK, as well as the doping behavior at the A site of PVSK. Transient photovoltaic/photocurrent decay curve recording and Mott–Schottky study on the devices show that CsI treatment comes out with the longest lifetime of charge carriers, the shortest charge-extraction time, and the highest built-in potential. Accordingly, CsI blending upgrades the power conversion efficiency from 17.22% to 19.16% (on average, optimized to 19.89%), leading to an increment of 11%, compared to that of 7%,1% and 2% for LiI, KI, and control cases, respectively. Moisture stability is estimated. CsI blending comes out with a T 80 lifetime (time for efficiency dropping to 80% of the initial value) of ∼209 h, compared to that of ∼180h, ∼67h, and ∼90h for LiI, KI, and control cases, respectively. The observation is ascribed to the improved crystallization, and molar Gibbs free energy of hydration (Δ hyd G * ) for these alkaline-metal ions. Cs + owns the lowest Δ hyd G * , thus enhancing the hydrophobicity of the CE. Besides, Li + owns the highest Δ hyd G * , thus triggering the “slow-release effect” on H 2 O molecules from open air.},

  abstract     = {The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) necessitates maintenance-free, high-efficiency power sources. Organic solar cells (OSCs), offering superior spectral alignment with indoor lighting, are promising candidates for indoor energy harvesting. Here, we develop a fused carbazole-based polymer acceptor (designated as PCzT) with a tailored optical bandgap, rigid planar backbone, and enhanced electron-transporting properties. As a result, devices incorporating this acceptor achieve a power conversion efficiency of 8.15% under AM1.5G illumination and 11.63% under 3000 K, 1000 lux indoor lighting—outperforming state-of-the-art polymer acceptors in indoor applications. Crucially, we correlate nanoscale morphology (e.g., phase purity and domain size) with device performance, revealing that optimized interfacial packing enhances charge extraction and suppresses recombination. These findings provide a direct guideline for designing stable, high-performance polymer acceptors toward efficient indoor OSCs.},

  abstract     = {The building-up process of power conversion in carbon-electrode-based mesoscopic perovskite solar cells is monitored by prolonging the annealing period of the lead halide perovskite (PVSK) precursor in the mesoporous skeleton in open air. It is observed that power conversion occurs only after 20 min of annealing, though severe hysteresis is seen due to the existence of an intermediate phase. Meanwhile, the heterojunction structure evolves obviously in the device, from that formed between the electron transport layer (ETL) and PVSK precursor, to that formed between ETL and PVSK crystallites. As annealing time increases to 120 min, the intermediate phase is reduced, and the buried interface of PVSK is strengthened, leading to accelerated charge-extraction and retarded charge-recombination, as well as an upgraded built-in potential ( V bi ). Accordingly, the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) improves from 10.47% to 12.42%, with the hysteresis index sharply dropping from 19.19% to 1.06%. Increasing the carbon-electrode thickness and prolonging the annealing time could further improve the crystallization quality of PVSK, thus elevating the PCE up to 15.26%, as well as the T80 lifetime of ∼390 h for unsealed devices, during the quasi-maximum power point tracking test in open air.},

The largest degradation was observed after a 10 15 e/cm 2 radiation. Moreover, comparative studies indicated that increasing L and reducing t ox can further enhance the radiation tolerance, reducing the threshold voltage shift and subthreshold swing enlargement to −0.29 V and 2.1 mV/dec, respectively.

However, traditional growth of AlScN typically requires substrates such as sapphire, GaN, or SiC, which have complex fabrication processes and hinder their integration and application with mainstream complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. Here, we demonstrated ferroelectric Al 0.8 Sc 0.2 N grown on CMOS-compatible tungsten metal and further exhibited its memristor characteristics suitable for artificial electronic synapses. This memristor features a programmable multi-level configuration, excellent retention (>10 4 s) and nanosecond (∼36 ns) ultrafast opening speed, which can enable high-speed and multi-level storage and computation. In addition, biological synaptic plasticity, including spike timing dependent plasticity and the human brain's learning, forgetting, and relearning behavior, was simulated by electrical pulse modulation. Finally, we built an artificial neural network to recognize handwritten digits in the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, achieving 93.9% recognition accuracy. This study provides a feasible approach for integrating group III-nitride (AlScN) ferroelectric materials with mature CMOS technology and paves the way for the application of AlScN ferroelectric memristors in the next generation of artificial electronic synapse devices.},

In this work, we develop a multi-physical field microscopic imaging system, which is capable of achieving high spatiotemporal resolution characterization in an individual GaN Micro LED. By integrating fluorescence imaging, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, hyperspectral imaging, and time-correlated single-photon counting, our system enables real-time tracking of the evolution of defects under coupled optical, electrical, and thermal fields. Equipped with this system, we systematically analyze the spatial distribution and depth of defects introduced by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching. Two distinct regions are observed: a narrow fluorescence lifetime decrease zone (∼2 μ m) near the chip edges and a broader fluorescence intensity decrease zone (∼5 μ m). To explain this, we propose a physical model that describes the interplay between defect-induced non-radiative recombination and carrier diffusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that wet etching effectively mitigates these ICP-induced damages, leading to enhanced brightness across a wide range of Micro LED sizes. Notably, this passivation process enables a 3 μ m size blue Micro LED chip to achieve a peak external quantum efficiency of 27.6% with a current density of 33.7 A/cm 2 . These findings provide insights into the localized impact of plasma etching and highlight the potential of wet etching for enhanced performance in Micro LED.},

Although various encapsulated CNTs have been synthesized, modulation of their thermal transport properties remains largely uninvestigated, primarily due to the experimental challenges at the nanoscale. In addition, such modulation has not yet been archived in macroscopic CNT assemblies, such as fibers or films. In this study, we propose a direct encapsulation of inorganic clusters into highly aligned CNT microfibers and demonstrate the modulation of the electrical conductivity ( σ ) and thermal conductivity ( κ ) through the incorporation of Mo 4 S 4 nanoclusters. Commercially available CNT microfibers were used as the host material, and the encapsulation was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. As a result, both κ and σ were reduced by approximately 50% and 30%, respectively, compared to pristine microfibers at room temperature. This modulation contributes to an improvement in the thermoelectric figure of merit. The methodology indicates the potential of nanomaterial encapsulation for tuning the thermal transport properties of CNT-based bulk materials, offering a promising strategy for advanced thermal engineering applications.},

The results show that the SEB threshold voltage decreases with increasing LET, indicating a strong dependence on energy deposition. In addition, reverse bias is identified as a critical triggering condition for SEB, which occurs only when the applied voltage is high enough to initiate thermal runaway and cause irreversible damage. To further elucidate the failure mechanism, Kr ions were selected for detailed investigation. technology computer-aided design simulations combined with scanning electron microscopy-based failure analysis revealed that transient current surges can rapidly elevate the local temperature. Once the temperature reaches the melting point of Ga 2 O 3 material, SEB is triggered by irreversible thermal failure. Moreover, the failure sites were primarily located at the edge of the Schottky junction, indicating structural vulnerability in this region.

Using the unique low-temperature electrical properties of carbon nanotube materials, we fabricated a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNT-FET) that exhibits significantly reduced currents under cryogenic conditions. These carbon-based FETs were implemented to construct a carbon nanotube analog operating amplifier (CNT-OPA). Comprehensive experimental characterization across a wide temperature range (293–10 K) revealed that the CNT-OPA's quiescent power consumption decreases at cryogenic temperatures without any degradation in the gain performance. These results demonstrate the strong potential of carbon-based analog amplifiers for cryogenic electronic applications, particularly in superconducting quantum computing systems and space electronics where conventional silicon-based devices face fundamental limitations.},

Under tensile strain, the Schottky barrier height (SBH) at the Au/MoS 2 interface decreases and the interfacial binding energy increases, leading to a reduced van der Waals gap and enhanced electron tunneling probability. In contrast, compressive strain has the opposite effect, i.e., compressive strain increases the SBH and weakens the interface interaction. The SBH reduction under tensile strain gives rise to enhanced electron transfer from Au to MoS 2 , resulting in charge redistribution that effectively dopes MoS 2 with electrons and shifts its Fermi level closer to the conduction band minimum. The tunability of SBH and tunneling barriers via strain highlights a viable strategy for optimizing metal–2D semiconductor contacts in nanoelectronics applications.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have been regarded as promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronics devices. However, the intrinsically low carrier mobility severely limits device performance. In this work, we have systematically investigated the carrier transport in 2D hexangular InN based on the ab initio Boltzmann transport theory. The room-temperature carrier mobility is evaluated over a wide range of carrier concentration (n 2D ), with the free-carrier screening effect incorporated via the 2D homogeneous electron gas model. The high intrinsic electron mobility of InN is verified. At low n 2D , the electron mobility remains nearly a constant of 790 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , whereas a peak value of 1150 cm 2 V −1 s −1 is observed at high n 2D . Our mode-by-mode analysis of the scattering events demonstrates that the long-range electron–phonon couplings govern the electron transport. The high electron mobility is attributed to the exceptionally small effective masses in combination with the significant suppression of LO-phonon scattering. Furthermore, we show that applying biaxial tensile strain can significantly enhance the electron transport. At low n 2D = 1 × 10 10 cm −2 , 3% tensile strain makes the mobility increase by 186%. The further analysis has demonstrated that the mobility enhancement results from the increased band velocity and the reduced scattering rates. Our work not only sheds light on the carrier transport in 2D InN but also underscores its great promise for high-performance electronic devices. Moreover, the provided estimation of the gauge factor highlights the potential for strain-sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {Molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) has garnered significant attention among 2D materials, demonstrating great potential for electronics and optoelectronics. Although numerous growth techniques have been explored, a definitive solution for large-area film fabrication remains elusive. Moreover, comparing thin films obtained through different techniques is not straightforward. Particularly, analyzing grain size across samples is challenging, making it difficult to clearly correlate growth conditions with the resulting crystal structure. In this Letter, we developed an approach based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) morphology measurements to analyze nanograins in large-area thin films obtained through relevant growth techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and sputter deposition followed by pulsed laser annealing. To address the challenges in comparing thin films grown by different methods, we propose a robust approach based on statistical grain analysis. By combining well-established investigation tools, such as AFM, with advanced watershed-segmentation algorithms, we demonstrate a reliable method for identifying grains and grain boundaries. This approach allows for a robust and quantitative comparison of film morphology across different growth conditions, providing a crucial benchmark for evaluating and differentiating various growth methods.},

  abstract     = {The metallization of hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN) monolayer with a wide bandgap is crucial for unlocking its potential in various fields. Although carrier doping is the most straightforward way for achieving metallization, and it can be realized by interlayer charge transfer in a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure constructed with another two-dimensional material, current attempts such as graphene/ h- BN and α -In 2 Se 3 /h-BN vdW heterostructures fail in the h- BN metallization. In this work, a vdW heterostructure of graphene/ α -In 2 Se 3 / h − BN is proposed. Interestingly, with the negative (positive) charge side of α -In 2 Se 3 interfacing with h -BN (graphene), the polarization field of α -In 2 Se 3 pushes the valence band of h -BN to higher energy and the Dirac point of graphene to lower energy so that charge transfer mediated by α -In 2 Se 3 from h -BN to graphene becomes possible, driving h -BN to be metallic. In contrast, with the reversal of the ferroelectric polarization of α -In 2 Se 3 , no charge transfer from or to h -BN is allowed, and h -BN recovers its insulating feature. The nonvolatile resistance switching of h -BN by the graphene/In 2 Se 3 / h -BN vdW heterostructure will promote its practical applications, such as memory devices.},

  abstract     = {Achieving both high electrocaloric effect and broad working temperature span in ferroelectric materials is crucial for practical cooling applications, yet it remains a big challenge. In the present work, a large electrocaloric temperature change ( ΔT ) over a wide temperature range is obtained through disorder modulation of perovskite titanates, specifically by introducing an electric field-sensitive Bi 0.5 Na 0.5 TiO 3 (BNT) into Ba 0.6 Sr 0.4 TiO 3 (BST). Ceramic samples in the BST-100xBNT (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.28) solid solution system show typical characteristics of relaxor ferroelectrics with a high density of polar nano-regions due to short-range ordering of A-site cations. As the concentration of BNT (x) increases, the freezing temperature ( T f ) decreases and the Burns temperature ( T B ) increases, suggesting the extension of the temperature range of the relaxor in the ergodic state. Moreover, the field-induced polarization was found to increase along with x. The observed structurally induced changes in the relaxor behavior are proposed to contribute to the optimal electrocaloric performance of the BST-28BNT ceramic, with a maximum ΔT of 0.91 °C and a maximum working temperature span of 24.4 °C under an applied electric field of 5 kV/mm. The concept of the A-site disorder modulation provides an innovative strategy to develop high-performance electrocaloric materials from lead-free relaxor ceramics.},

However, the fundamental trade-offs between thickness scaling, endurance, and retention remain unresolved. Here, we systematically investigate W/ Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 /TiN capacitors with ferroelectric layer thicknesses from 5 to 10 nm, revealing a critical thickness-dependent performance crossover. While 6 and 8 nm films achieve optimal ferroelectric properties ( ⁠ 2 P r up to 41 μ C / cm 2 ⁠ ) and good endurance, they suffer from accelerated retention loss, suggesting that prominent (002) texture may enhance charge injection and time-dependent imprint. In contrast, a 5 nm film demonstrates a superior endurance–retention compromise. We attribute this to its significantly lower remanent polarization, which likely stems from a distinct nanocrystalline/amorphous microstructure, suppressing imprint development. Through quantitative imprint analysis, we establish that wake-up cycling simultaneously improves polarization while degrading retention—a fundamental constraint arising from the coupling between spontaneous polarization and charge injection dynamics. These findings reveal thickness-dependent design rules for achieving reliable scaled ferroelectric memories.},

However, solid-phase synthesis often yields secondary silicide phases that degrade performance. Here, we investigate the influence of substrate properties using two silicon-on-insulator architectures: one with a polycrystalline HfO 2 buried layer (group A) and the other with amorphous SiO 2 (group B). Both systems exhibit superconductivity consistent with V 3 Si formation, yet structural analysis reveals mixed-phase films in both cases. Crucially, only group A maintains an atomically sharp and chemically stable interface, a prerequisite for phase purity. Prolonged annealing in group A reduces the unwanted V 5 Si 3 phase but also leads to the emergence of Si-rich VSi 2 , likely due to localized substrate degradation. Preliminary atomic-resolution imaging suggests that HfO 2 crystallinity may promote local phase-selective nucleation. These findings highlight the importance of substrate design in promoting phase control and maintaining interfacial integrity in superconducting silicides.},

We investigate the spin transport in TBZGNRs by employing the non-equilibrium Green's functions method and reveal that the electric current is nonreciprocal and spin-polarized in non- PT symmetric TBZGNRs. Moreover, in PT symmetric TBZGNRs, the spin degenerate can be lifted by applying bias voltage. It shows unique nonreciprocal spin transport with opposite spin-polarization under positive and negative bias voltages.

However, here, we report the observation of asynchrony among sublattices by using typical CoGd ferrimagnets, where the antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices fail to remain synchronized during high-speed precession. By employing magnetic resonance, we demonstrate that the asynchrony occurs when the resonance frequency exceeds a critical value corresponding to the delay time ( τ d ) between the two sublattices under microwave excitations. The determined τ d is about 60 ps in CoGd, varies slightly with temperature and composition, but decreases sharply near magnetization and angular momentum compensation. These results demonstrate the speed limit of device performance relying on the antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices as a matter of fundamental principle, and also indicate that the antiferromagnetic attributes during high-speed operations cannot be described as statically coupled sublattices.},

  abstract     = {The encirclement of exceptional points (EPs) in parametric space has been realized in optical waveguides, microwave cavities, nitrogen-vacancy centers, and so on. However, it often suffers from complex gain–loss manipulation. An acoustic platform to realize the evolution encircling the EP is highly desirable. In this work, an unclosed evolution protocol is proposed, which consists of parallel coupling and buffering branches and evolves through five distinct stages. Buffering the variation of Hamiltonian, inducing the transition to a low energy state, the evolution with favorable adiabaticity guarantees the EP encircling no longer depends on the precise loss manipulation. A non-Hermitian acoustic waveguide coupler (AWC), which is composed of combined cavities and air slit arrays, is presented to realize the encirclement. Experimental results of chiral phase conversion in a 0.5 m long AWC, spanning a broad bandwidth from 9.5 to 17.5 kHz, confirm the simplicity and effectiveness of state evolution encircling the EP. This work paves the way for AWC as a platform for non-Hermitian topological physics and facilitates the practical deployment of acoustic devices.},

Following rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 550 °C for 30 s, all dielectrics are confirmed to exhibit the orthorhombic (111) phase by grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD). Electrical measurements reveal that the SL5 structure achieves an outstanding reduction in leakage current, decreasing from 0.936 A cm −2 (HZO) to 0.004 A cm −2 at 3 V, and exhibits the highest remanent polarization (2P r = 29.3 μ C cm −2 ), compared to 27.3 μ C cm −2 (HZO), 22.4 μ C cm −2 (SL10), and 17 μ C cm −2 (SL15). Moreover, the SL5 capacitor demonstrates excellent reliability, maintaining robust endurance up to 1 × 10 11 cycles at room temperature and 1 × 10 10 cycles at 150 °C without degradation and stable retention over 1 × 10 4 s. Importantly, interface state analysis reveals that after annealing, SL5 maintains the lowest and most stable interface trap density within the energy range of 0.25–0.45 eV. The trap state density (6.39 × 10 12 –7.11 × 10 12 cm −2 eV −1 ) is significantly lower than that of HZO in the same energy range. These results highlight the advantages of superlattice-engineered ferroelectric gate dielectrics for achieving high-quality interfaces, low leakage current, and stable ferroelectric performance, providing a promising route toward high-performance, enhancement-mode β−Ga 2 O 3 MOSFET devices for next-generation power electronics.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-wide bandgap beta-phase gallium oxide ( β -Ga 2 O 3 ) power devices hold great promise in space applications; however, their intrinsic vulnerability to heavy ion irradiation, particularly defect behavior and catastrophic burnout mechanisms, remains largely unexplored. By performing bias voltage-dependent multiple rounds of statistical experiments with 1.35 GeV high-energy Ta ion irradiation, this work identifies electron and hole traps before burnout in NiO/ β -Ga 2 O 3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs), among which the introduced hole trap H2 ( E V + 0.6 eV, 2.9 × 10 13 cm −3 ) is revealed to dominate the irrecoverable leakage degradation associated with device damage by deteriorating the junction barrier. This trap in Ga 2 O 3 is attributed to the electron energy loss along the ion incidence trajectory based on the “thermal spike” physics theory, possibly resulting in a localized amorphous latent track. Beyond device damage, the catastrophic burnout in irradiated HJD is identified in two distinct regions: Region I (p-NiO/n − -Ga 2 O 3 ) dominated by trap-assisted electric field breakdown, and Region II (n − -Ga 2 O 3 /n + -Ga 2 O 3 ) characterized by thermally driven damage from charge accumulation. Additionally, thermal effects also impact the active area of Region I along the carrier dissipation pathway. These findings provide insight into the damage and failure physics of β -Ga 2 O 3 devices under heavy-ion strikes and inform strategies for improved irradiation hardness.},

In this study, we demonstrate the BPV effects of GaAs wafers oriented along the [001], [−111], and [−110] directions, in addition to those of epitaxial GaAs/Al 0.2 Ga 0.8 As core–shell nanowires (NWs) grown along the [111] direction. Local photoexcitation and the excitation-power dependence indicate that the observed photocurrent originates from the shift current mechanism. Remarkably, the grown NWs, even with sub-micron active volumes, could generate short-circuit current densities and open-circuit voltage of several mA/cm 2 and several hundreds of mV, respectively, under white light illumination. These findings expand the range of BPV materials and offer orientation‐engineering strategies for use in developing interface‐free photovoltaic devices.},

Concurrently, magnetization evolves from localized superexchange interactions to conduction-mediated RKKY coupling beyond a critical defect density.

The development of two-dimensional (2D) MFE configurations could further enhance this technology, facilitating the advancement of next-generation microcontroller units. However, most reported 2D multiferroics rely on spatially separated ferromagnetic and ferroelectric layers, which introduce interfacial complexities and limit device scalability. Here, we design a van der Waals multiferroic tunneling junction using antiferromagnetic VSe 2 as a unified magnetic and ferroelectric layer, with 2D metallic TaS 2 and Au (intercalated by monolayer graphene, Gr) serving as the right and left electrodes, respectively. Through ab initio quantum transport simulations, we systematically investigate its electronic transport properties. Our results reveal that the device exhibits four switchable ferroelectric conductance states, which can be modulated via interlayer sliding. When the magnetization alignment of trilayer VSe 2 is additionally controlled, the number of distinguishable conductance states increases to 12. The conductance difference is quantified by tunneling magnetoresistance and tunneling electroresistance, which can maximally increase to 8000% and 4000%, respectively, under optimized bias voltages. Our research expands the application of 2D antiferromagnetic materials and provides a viable strategy for designing high-performance, multi-state memory devices.},

  abstract     = {Nitrogen passivation has been established as an effective method to decrease the interface state density (D it ) for silicon carbide (SiC) devices. However, the effect of nitrogen passivation on the carrier capture cross section distributions of SiC/SiO 2 interface defects is still unclear, which is another critical factor governing the interface recombination characteristics and device performances of SiC power devices. In this work, the local band bending is regulated in deep level transient spectroscopy characterizations to modulate the carrier capture and emission behaviors of interface defects in localized energy levels. Therefore, the distribution of carrier capture cross section is determined as a function of the interface state density. Surprisingly, it is found that nitrogen passivation leads to an increase in the capture cross sections of SiC/SiO 2 interface defects, especially for deeper interface states within the bandgap. Based on those findings, the mechanisms of the temperature dependence of leakage current characteristics are explored, where the leakage currents first decrease with rising temperature, reaching a minimum at 250 K, and subsequently increase further with elevated temperature. An interfacial defect-assisted Fowler–Nordheim tunneling mechanism is proposed to explain the temperature dependence of leakage currents, which is suggested to originate from the synergistic interplay between the energy-level dependent capture cross section and interface state densities.},

While in the classical physical paradigm, the causal relationships are deduced based on physical principles or via experiment, the rapid accumulation of observational data necessitates learning causal relationships between dissimilar aspects of material structure and functionalities based on observations. For this, it is essential to integrate experimental data with prior domain knowledge. Here, we demonstrate this approach by combining high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy data with insights derived from large language models (LLMs). By applying ChatGPT to domain-specific literature, such as arXiv papers on ferroelectrics, and combining the obtained information with data-driven causal discovery, we construct adjacency matrices for directed acyclic graphs that map the causal relationships between structural, chemical, and polarization degrees of freedom in Sm-doped BiFeO 3 . This approach enables us to hypothesize how synthesis conditions influence material properties and guides experimental validation. The ultimate objective of this work is to develop a unified framework that integrates LLM-driven literature analysis with data-driven discovery, facilitating the precise engineering of ferroelectric materials by establishing clear connections between synthesis conditions and their resulting material properties.},

Metal thiophosphates (MTPs), with their layered structures and tunable electronic properties, are of particular interest. However, the link between crystal symmetry, stacking order, and anisotropic optical behavior remains inadequately understood in MTPs. Herein, we synthesized high-quality, large-sized monoclinic phase of SnP 2 S 6 single crystals via the chemical vapor transport method. Structural analysis revealed that the monoclinic phase is featured by a unique bilayer stacking configuration with a 180° in-plane rotation of adjacent metal sites. This stacking arrangement disrupts the threefold rotational symmetry of the monolayer, resulting in in-plane structural anisotropy as revealed by polarized Raman spectroscopy and consequently optical birefringence. To showcase its application potential, photodetectors based on monoclinic SnP 2 S 6 were fabricated, exhibiting exceptional polarization-sensitive performance under 405 nm excitation. This work highlights the importance of interlayer stacking patterns on the structural and optical properties of van der Waals MTPs, delivering a unique strategy for property tailoring.},

Because the temperature field is primarily governed by the geometry of the conductive tracks, not the overall heater size, the same fabrication step can yield regions with different thermal outputs by adjusting local pattern dimensions such as linewidth and length. This ability to spatially program heating behavior within a thin, flexible film, where heat distribution can be reconfigured simply by changing the biasing direction, highlights its potential for applications in reconfigurable soft robotics, on-skin thermal therapy, and adaptive microfluidic control.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying energy dissipation in dissipative periodic discrete metamaterials remains a challenge, as traditional interpretations of metadamping, based on summing modal damping ratios, do not consistently reflect actual time-domain energy loss in multi-modal systems. The study addresses this critical gap by introducing a framework grounded in a consistent definition of the unit cell for discrete dissipative systems. A single-term exponential energy decay coefficient, obtained through least squares minimization of the transient response, is proposed as a robust descriptor of system-level dissipation. The coefficient approximately captures energy decay behavior in both phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials, offering a more physically meaningful measure than conventional damping metrics. The proposed meta-dissipation framework establishes a critical link between dispersion-based analysis and transient energy dissipation, enabling more effective design and optimization of metamaterials for vibration attenuation across a wide range of engineering applications.},

Balancing the advantages of high capillary force of the V-shape and low viscous resistance of the U-shape, long-distance wicking velocity of gradient designs efficiently improved over 40% than conventional V-shape designs. Leveraging the enhanced mechanism, segmental structures with maximized long-distance wicking velocity were further developed, reaching a 100% enhancement.

While traditional PO methods struggle to accurately model edge diffraction effects in orbital angular momentum (OAM)-carrying beams, especially for complex targets, we address this limitation by integrating the equivalent edge current (EEC) theory into the conventional PO framework. By decomposing the Bessel vortex wave into a spectrum of plane wave components, we independently compute the PO and EEC scattering contributions for each spectral element. The coherent superposition of these contributions yields the total scattered field, significantly improving modeling accuracy. Numerical results demonstrate a 20%–30% enhancement in radar cross section prediction accuracy over the standard PO method. The proposed hybrid PO and EEC algorithm offers a computationally efficient solution for vortex EM scattering analysis, with direct applications in OAM-based radar systems, computational imaging, and next-generation communications.},

However, experimental barriers such as TEM sample-preparation-induced artifacts, high coercive fields, and imaging constraints persist, especially for polycrystalline films.

  abstract     = {The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a quantum phenomenon arising from the breaking of chiral symmetry in relativistic Weyl fermions due to quantum fluctuations under parallel electric ( E ) and magnetic fields ( B ). Intuitively, Weyl fermions with opposite chirality, under the stimulus of parallel E and B , will have different chemical potentials that give rise to an extra current, whose role is like a chiral battery in solids. However, up until now, the experimental evidence for the chiral magnetic effect is the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance , rather than a chiral electric source. Here, different from previous reports, we observed a giant chiral magnetic effect evidenced by “negative” resistance and corresponding voltage–current curves located in the second-fourth quadrant in the type-II Weyl semimetal WP 2+δ . These phenomena occur under the following conditions: the misalignment angle between B and E is smaller than 20°, the temperature is below 40 K, the externally applied electrical current is less than 50 mA, and the magnetic field is larger than 3 T. Phenomenologically, based on the macroscopic Chern–Simons–Maxwell equation, this giant chiral magnetic effect observed in WP 2+δ is attributed to the chirality of Weyl fermions possessing a two-order longer coherent time than the Drude transport relaxation time. Our findings provide evidence of the giant chiral-magnetic/chiral-battery effect in Weyl semimetals.},

In this study, we report a significantly large interfacial DMI in La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 (LSMO) films grown on NdGaO 3 substrates, with a DMI coefficient of 1.96 pJ/m—one to two orders of magnitude higher than previously observed in oxide systems. Our experiments, coupled with first-principles calculations, reveal that enhanced spin–orbit coupling at the LSMO/NdGaO 3 interface, driven by a synergy between the 6 s electrons of Nd and the 4 f electrons, is the key to this large DMI.

Such explorations are pursued in the framework of femtosecond optical excitation with THz probes wherein either negative or positive photoconductivity manifests in metallic and insulating states, respectively. Co-existence of both states is highly desired but rarely observed. Here, a strategy is devised exploiting crystalline transport anisotropy and hetero-epitaxy in a multi-band nickelate to demonstrate switching of the positive to the negative sign of photoconductivity on a sub-picosecond timescale. This combines with a profound anisotropy of THz photoconductivity in unconventional (111) epitaxial films having preferential arrangement of oxygen vacancies along selective crystal axes—a framework that reversibly modulates the anisotropy of negative THz photoconductivity using oxygen content as a control parameter, and corroborated by theoretical calculations. Thus, ultrafast switching between negative, positive, and zero photoconductive states in timescales of a few picoseconds at room temperature, as demonstrated in this study, holds a remarkable prospect for creating multiple channels of information processing. A proof-of-concept experiment to utilize these photo-controlled states is proposed for a three-state THz communication system, which would transmit a larger volume of information vis-a-vis that of a binary communication system.},

Using three nonlinear optical cationic chromophores with different interionic assembly types, each combined with three molecular anions featuring different substituents (non-polar methyl or polar chloro and bromo groups), we investigated nine ionic crystals, including four reported here for the first time. The crystal members within each isomorphic crystal family show nearly identical crystal structures (i.e., isomorphic crystal structures), all of them achieving top-level macroscopic second-order optical nonlinearity and efficient ultrabroad THz wave generation capabilities. Remarkably, their physical (and terahertz) properties within each isomorphic crystal family differ dramatically according to a certain order of the introduced anions, and this ordering trend persists across all three isomorphic crystal families. These results provide a crucial advancement in the design and prediction of macroscopic properties in ionic organic THz and nonlinear optical crystals, marking an important step toward rational crystal design exhibiting enhanced physical properties.},

However, previous studies on silicon have not exhibited apparent frequency dependence despite its broad phonon distribution. Here, we report the frequency-dependent thermal transport in Al/Si with an atomically sharp interface, where the matched Debye temperatures preserve the temperature difference between low- and high-energy phonons in Si and contribute as additional non-equilibrium thermal resistance. The dependence vanishes in Al/SiO 2 /Si at room temperature, since the SiO 2 interlayer facilitates phonon scattering and destroys thermal non-equilibrium. At 80 K, frequency dependence reemerges in Al/SiO 2 /Si due to reduced interfacial phonon scattering, which is not sufficient to destroy the temperature difference between low- and high-energy phonons. The frequency dependence is weakened in the Al/Si sample at 500 K, originating from the enhanced phonon scattering rate in Si. Our findings highlight the significance of boundary conditions in frequency-dependent thermal conductivity.},

By exploiting the different spectral response of these detectors, transmitted data of different wavelengths can be effectively distinguished, making them promising candidates for wavelength division multiplexing to enhance optical communication transmission rates. Herein, we present a facile dual-wavelength demultiplexing strategy based on ZnO/PbSe wide-/narrow-bandgap heterojunction to achieve ultraviolet (UV)-infrared (IR) broadband detection by utilizing the photosensitive/dielectric properties of ZnO along with unique band alignment. The detector demonstrates a continuous photocurrent response in the UV region, while producing transient pulsed photocurrent in the IR region. It is first time reporting response wavelength extension of transient photodetectors from near-infrared (NIR) to mid-infrared (MIR). Additionally, the response bandwidth reaches 2 kHz in the UV and 0.7 MHz in the IR bands. The UV/IR dual-wavelength optical communication tests show the coexistence of transient pulsed and continuous photocurrents. By incorporating different filter modules at the output terminals, the transmitted data at both wavelengths can be extracted simultaneously. This study offers a facile and practical approach for broadband photodetection and wavelength demultiplexing, while also providing a novel route for extending the application of wide-bandgap semiconductors to IR optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Self-powered optoelectronic synaptic devices play an important role for the construction of neuromorphic computing systems. Nevertheless, these devices can only simulate optically excitatory synaptic behaviors, while mimicking optically inhibitory functions remains a challenge, arising from the photo-generated carriers that usually lead to the enhancement of conductivity in these devices. This limitation hinders the application development of the self-powered optoelectronic synaptic devices in neuromorphic computing. In this work, a self-powered optoelectronic synaptic device based on the tin dioxide and cesium silver bismuth bromide heterojunction is developed. Through utilizing the ion migration and photo-generated carrier transport behaviors in the heterojunction, self-powered optically inhibitory and excitatory synaptic behaviors are successfully mimicked under ultraviolet (365 nm) monochromatic all-optical modulation. On this basis, a convolutional neural network has been constructed with the software-based means to recognize images (the absence of real hardware-level image processing) in fashion MNIST dataset and an accuracy of 84.48% is obtained in this network, indicating broad application prospects of the all-optical self-powered systems in the neuromorphic computing.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) composed of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterostructures are proposed to be a plausible scheme to achieve larger tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) than the conventional MTJs. The spin transport across the interfaces is affected not only by the Brillouin zone (BZ) filtering but also by the interfacial bonds. This work focuses on studying the 2H Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS 2 ) van der Waals layers as the tunnel barrier, and Cobalt (Co) as the electrode. The TMR varies with different adsorption interfaces, yet none have achieved the desired levels because the momentum-resolved transmissions of Co and MoS 2 in the folded horizontal BZ do not match well, resulting in inefficient spin filtering and thereby a low TMR. The effects of interfacial bonds on spin transport and magnetic anisotropy are studied. The orientations of bonds determine the anisotropy of the interfacial Co. Vertical bonds stabilize the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), while non-vertical bonds cause in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). The layers below exhibit PMA, so both types of MTJs overall support PMA, while the physisorbed MTJ is stronger. The positive relation between the transmission and the electron density near the Fermi level is weakened by the bonds, as the scattering centers hold back the spin injection. Our work further strengthens the importance of BZ filtering in governing TMR and the design principle of MTJ, as well as how bonds affect the overall device performance.},

By suspending the 2D channels and inducing mechanical resonance modes in the 2D semiconducting membranes, they form 2D vibrating-channel-transistor (VCT) resonators with ultralow power consumption. Yet on-chip electronic detection and tuning of multimode resonances in these 2D VCT resonators have been challenging due to the ultrasmall vibration amplitudes and rich multimode dynamics at radio frequencies (RF). Here, we leverage the atomic-scale thickness, ultrahigh strain limit, as well as strain-engineering effects on band structure and carrier mobility of 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) sheets, and experimentally demonstrate multimode 2D MoS 2 VCT resonators. Using all-electronic signal transduction, we show single-, bi-, and tri-layer MoS 2 VCT resonators with up to the 14th resonance mode, thanks to the ultra-efficient electromechanical transduction enabled by internal multiphysics coupling. Measured gate dependency of multimode resonances exhibits frequency tuning ranges of Δ f / f 0 up to 326%. These 2D VCT resonators provide a unique platform for engineering on-chip integrated and ultra-scaled RF signal transduction, sensing, and analog computing elements with multimode and hyperspectral capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Exciton-polariton lasing is the spontaneous coherent emission resulting from exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), facilitated by polariton-polariton simulated scattering. This process does not require population inversion, unlike conventional photonic lasers. II-VI/III-V colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, known for their narrow emission linewidth and tunable emission wavelength, find broad applications in displays, LEDs, and detectors. However, achieving exciton-polariton lasing with these materials remains challenging. In this work, we investigate the exciton binding energy variations in CdSe colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) with different thicknesses and demonstrate the integration of CQWs in a face-down aligned configuration within a Fabry–Pérot cavity. This alignment enhances the exciton-photon coupling, leading to increased Rabi splitting energy and stronger coupling compared to randomly oriented CQWs, thereby facilitate exciton-polariton condensation. Due to the enhanced coupling with cavity fields and large exciton binding energy, we report the first observation of room-temperature exciton-polariton BEC and exciton-polariton lasing from CdSe CQWs. By systematically tuning the exciton-photon detuning, we achieve wavelength-tunable polariton lasing from 530 nm to 549 nm, including spectral regions without conventional optical gain, extending lasing beyond the intrinsic emission of 4 ML CQWs. These findings establish CdSe CQWs as effective platform for polariton-based optoelectronics.},

  abstract     = {The Maxwell-Garnett theory, dating back to James Clerk Maxwell-Garnett's foundational work in 1904, provides a simple yet powerful framework to describe the inhomogeneous structure as an effective homogeneous medium, which significantly reduces the overall complexity of analysis, calculation, and design. As such, the Maxwell-Garnett theory enables many practical applications in diverse realms, ranging from photonics, acoustics, mechanics, thermodynamics, to materials science. It has long been thought that the Maxwell-Garnett theory of light in impedance-mismatched periodic structures is valid only within the long-wavelength limit, necessitating either the temporal or spatial period of light to be much larger than that of structures. Here, we break this long-held belief by revealing an anomalous Maxwell-Garnett theory for impedance-mismatched photonic time crystals beyond this long-wavelength limit. The key to this anomaly lies in the Fabry–Pérot resonance. We discover that under the Fabry–Pérot resonance, the impedance-mismatched photonic time crystal could be essentially equivalent to a homogeneous temporal slab simultaneously at specific discrete wavelengths, despite the temporal period of these light being comparable to or even much smaller than that of photonic time crystals.},

  abstract     = {While the electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) have been predicted to strongly suppress phonon transport and lattice thermal conductivity ( κ L ) above room temperature, direct experimental validation remains challenging because the observed reduction of κ L in the doped materials is commonly a result of concurrent enhancement of EPIs and point-defect-induced phonon scattering (PDPS). Here, we circumvent this ambiguity through strategically designed aliovalent-alloying semiconductors (e.g., TiFe 0.5+ x Ni 0.5- x Sb, −0.25 ≤ x ≤ 0.25), where the compositional deviations from x = 0 amplify EPIs while weakening PDPS. Experimentally, we observed a pronounced EPI-driven κ L reduction of ∼50% at room temperature and ∼40% even at 1000 K as carrier concentration approaches 1 × 10 22 cm −3 . The carrier-induced phonon softening and the enhanced electron-phonon scattering rates collectively lead to this remarkable phonon transport attenuation. Our findings establish a quantitative framework for disentangling EPI effects on phonon transport in heavily doped semiconductors or metals, and provide insights into phonon engineering strategies for advanced thermal management materials design.},

  abstract     = {Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is an essential imaging system for observing biological samples with high contrast, low phototoxicity, and rapid image acquisition. Traditional LSFM utilizes Gaussian illumination with a limited system field of view (FOV) due to the short Rayleigh range. As one kind of the propagation-invariant light field, the Airy beam can inherently extend the FOV and enhance the axial resolution for microscopy. However, implementing an Airy-LSFM requires a complex illumination system. Here, we demonstrate that the Airy light-sheet is conveniently integrated into LSFM using a polarization-independent, Airy metasurface to achieve compact illumination, large system FOV, and high image quality. To verify the performance of the metasurface-based Airy LSFM (meta-Airy LSFM), ex vivo imaging of fluorescently labeled Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) embryos was conducted. The Richardson–Lucy deconvolution technique was applied to further improve the image quality. The experimental results show that the axial and lateral resolution of the meta-Airy LSFM is 2.3 and 0.69 μ m, respectively, while the FOV is significantly improved tenfold, up to 200 μ m. The tightly packed integration of the Airy light-sheet metasurface in LSFM enables wide-ranging biological applications and has great potential to be easily adapted across various LSFM modalities.},

Here, an inequivalent charge strategy is reported that simultaneously enhances the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic ordering in Bi 2 FeMnO 6 double perovskite thin films, effectively exploiting the tunability of chemical strain and valence. Abnormal lattice distortion and differential charge compensation ensure robust ferroelectricity (16.6–29.2 μ C/cm 2 ) and approximately sevenfold enhancement from 8.3 to 60 emu/cm 3 in ferromagnetism, with Curie temperatures of both ferroic orderings exceeding 800 K, which is the best high-temperature metrics for existing multiferroic systems. Since ferroelectricity originates from Bi ions and octahedral distortions, this effectively avoids small polarization and weak A–B site coupling. This mechanism is expected to reignite interest in type I multiferroics and prompt a reexamination of current schemes for overcoming the incompatibility of the multiple ferroic orderings. Our work provides an important technological path and experimental insight for the development of room-temperature multiferroics by leveraging the tunability of double perovskites.},

In this study, we demonstrate that oxygen vacancies can effectively enable the switching between flux-closure and center-type topological structures in PbTiO 3 (PTO) nano-island arrays. Supported by evidence from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning Kelvin probe microscopy, and piezoresponse force microscopy, we demonstrate that a high concentration of oxygen vacancies favors the formation of center-type domains, while the topological structure transitions to the flux-closure configuration following elimination of oxygen vacancies via in situ annealing under various gas atmospheres. This deterministic switching between the two polar topological structures highlights the critical role of charged defects and opens new avenues for the manipulation of polar topological structures in future applications.},

  abstract     = {Heterojunctions are indispensable for fabricating high-performance organic photodetectors. However, traditional structures—such as planar heterojunctions (PHJs) and bulk heterojunctions (BHJs)—face significant challenges. PHJs often suffer from limited exciton dissociation in thick films, while BHJs experience considerable charge transport barriers. Although quasi-planar heterojunctions have been proposed to address these issues, controlling their nanoscale interface remains complex and material-dependent, limiting their applications. Herein, we introduce novel interpenetrated heterojunctions (IPHJs), formed by penetrating a secondary organic semiconductor layer into a porous bottom layer during annealing. This innovative structure is revealed to possess efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. Remarkably, organic photodiodes (OPDs) featuring PM6:N2200 IPHJs demonstrate exceptional performance, achieving a responsivity (R) of 36.5 A/W, a specific detectivity (D * ) of 8.6 × 10 12 Jones, and a response time (τ) of 30 μ s, representing state-of-the-art performance for OPDs. Furthermore, extending the IPHJ concept to tri-layer interpenetrated heterojunctions (T-IPHJs) shows significant promise for organic phototransistor applications. The PM6:N2200 T-IPHJ devices exhibit a responsivity exceeding 44.7 A/W, a D * value reaching 5.23 × 10 14 Jones, and a τ of 70 ms. These results show the potential of IPHJs to advance the field of high-performance organic photodetectors and related devices.},

  abstract     = {Lithium tantalate (LiTaO 3 , LT), structurally similar to lithium niobate, possesses a broad spectrum of optoelectronic properties that hold significant promise for integrated photonics applications. Due to its larger bandgap and higher optical damage threshold, LT can be employed for efficient nonlinear optical frequency conversion in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelength range. Here, we report on fabrication of monolithic, high-quality LT metasurfaces, composed of periodic arrays of LT truncated square pyramids, created by partially etching of a LT thin film layer using a focused ion beam milling process. These pyramidal structures introduce discrete translational symmetry, which allows for the folding of guided-mode dispersion into the first Brillouin zone, leading to the formation of guided mode resonances with Q-factors that can be easily controlled by the height of LT pyramids. The measurements show a Q-factor up to approximately 640 at 786 nm. By leveraging the strong field localization of these high-Q resonances, we demonstrate enhanced second-harmonic generation at 393 nm with an absolute conversion efficiency of 0.042%, establishing a new benchmark for the UV harmonic generation in dielectric metasurfaces. Moreover, our fabrication technique can be readily adapted to a wide range of other material platforms, opening new avenues for the development of high-quality UV metasurfaces and advanced nonlinear photonic meta-devices.},

However, the stochastic nature of resistive switching (RS) in memristors often leads to poor device stability and uniformity, hindering the scalability required for real-world applications. Here, we present a novel phase segregation strategy to achieve uniformly distributed self-assembled Ni nanofilaments within a BaTiO 3 matrix, enabling local deterministic redox reactions for RS, as confirmed by comprehensive structural, local, and macroscopic RS studies. This approach yields drastic enhancement in cyclic performance and device uniformity, with the average cyclic variances of Set voltage and low resistance state down to 1.4% and 9.6%, respectively. The devices also exhibit excellent endurance (10 9 cycles) and ultrafast programming speed (down to 100 ns) and achieve over 5-bit level long-term memory states. The enhanced cyclic stability and device uniformity translate to high training and learning accuracies (95%) in a three-level deep neural network, with 1-bit inputs. Our phase segregation strategy provides a generic pathway to overcome the long-standing challenge of device variability in neuromorphic computing.},

  abstract     = {Red InGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit lower internal quantum efficiencies than violet, blue, and green InGaN LEDs due to a reduction in radiative recombination rates relative to non-radiative recombination rates as the Indium composition increases. Additionally, the larger polarization and band offset barriers between high indium content InGaN quantum wells and GaN quantum barriers increase the forward voltage. In blue and green LEDs, random alloy fluctuations and V-defects play a key role in reducing the forward voltage. When V-defects are present, either naturally or intentionally introduced, they create an alternative path for carrier injection into the MQWs through the V-defect sidewalls. This injection mechanism explains the turn-on voltages of green LEDs. However, in InGaN red LEDs, these two phenomena do not reduce the forward voltage as effectively as in blue and green LEDs, and consequently, the computed forward voltage remains significantly higher than the measured one. Furthermore, currents are observed at low voltages before the turn-on voltage ( ⁠ V < ℏ ω / e = 2.0 V ⁠ ) of red LEDs. To address this, we introduce dislocation-induced tail states in the modeling, suggesting that leakage current through these states may play a significant role both below and at turn-on voltages. The simulation also indicates that leakage carriers below turn-on accumulate, partially diffuse in the QWs, screen the polarization-induced barrier in the low injection regime, and further reduce the forward voltage. Despite these beneficial effects, a drawback of dislocation-induced tail states is the enhanced nonradiative recombination in the dislocation line region. This study provides a detailed analysis of device injection physics in InGaN QW red LEDs and outlines potential optimization strategies.},

While the relationship between CDWs and superconductivity has been extensively studied, the interplay between CDWs and magnetic order remains largely elusive. Kagome lattices, with their intrinsic nontrivial topology, charge order, and magnetism, provide a compelling framework for investigating these interactions. In this work, we unravel the orbital origins of magnetic moment modulation induced by CDW in the kagome magnet FeGe, a system exhibiting a unique coupling between CDW and magnetism. The combination of x-ray absorption spectroscopic experiments and first-principles calculations shed light on the temperature-dependent behavior of Fe3 d –Ge4 p orbital hybridization and corroborate its significant impact on the magnetic properties of FeGe. These findings introduce an orbital dimension to the correlation between charge and magnetic degrees of freedom, advancing our understanding of the intriguing quantum phases resulting from this interplay.},

While Ga 2 O 3 exhibits promising material characteristics for applications in harsh environments, its commercial viability remains under debate, particularly when compared to materials such as aluminum nitride (AlN) and diamond, which possess superior intrinsic properties. This perspective addresses the critical challenges that currently impede the widespread commercialization of Ga 2 O 3 -based devices. These challenges include a relatively immature technology base, the difficulty in achieving stable p-type conductivity, inherently low thermal conductivity, the presence of crystallographic defects (nano- and micro-voids), and elevated fabrication costs, all of which negatively impact device reliability and scalability. Mitigation strategies, such as heterojunction implementation, the development of thermal management solutions such as wafer bonding, and defect passivation approaches, are also under investigation. The near-term feasibility of commercially viable Ga 2 O 3 -based power electronic devices is a central focus of this discussion. The current status is that Ga 2 O 3 development is far advanced relative to either diamond or especially AlN power electronics but is hampered by lack of a broad base of substrate vendors and a compelling vision for device implementations that provide sufficient improvement over SiC power devices. There are strong geographic differences in device focus, with China prioritizing implementation in grid applications while the United States/Europe appear to consider Ga 2 O 3 devices more for defense and aerospace applications.},

While significant progress has been made, these methods are time-consuming, costly, and limited by the complexity of multicomponent catalysts and reaction systems. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as transformative tools for accelerating catalyst discovery and optimization.

The global Ni-MH market continues to grow steadily, reflecting their continued importance in applications demanding safety, environmental compatibility, and reliability. This review provides a critical analysis of electrochemical techniques used to investigate metal hydride electrodes for Ni-MH batteries. We examine the thermodynamic and kinetic phenomena of hydrogen storage in intermetallic compounds, focusing on the correlation between gas-phase hydrogen interactions and electrochemical processes. The review systematically analyzes various methods including cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, chronoamperometry, galvanostatic and potentiostatic intermittent titration techniques (GITT and PITT), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For each method, we discuss theoretical foundations, practical applications, and fundamental limitations when applied to metal hydride systems. Our analysis reveals significant challenges in the direct application of methodologies originally developed for liquid-phase electrochemical systems to solid-state metal hydride electrodes. This methodological transfer without appropriate modifications has resulted in inconsistent data interpretation and discrepancies in reported parameters, particularly for hydrogen diffusion coefficients determined by different techniques. We identify common methodological errors and provide guidelines for more accurate experimental design and data analysis. The critical examination presented in this review demonstrates the necessity for researchers to carefully consider the fundamental differences between liquid-phase and solid-state electrochemical processes when selecting and applying characterization methods. Given the continued importance of Ni-MH batteries in energy infrastructure, establishing reliable characterization protocols is important for advancing the fundamental understanding and technological development of metal hydride electrode materials.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) have exhibited significant application potential in magnetic sensors, magnetic random-access memory, spin-based logic gates, etc. However, conventional MTJ devices consisting of magnetic thin films usually suffer from interface defects and low scaling, severely compromising device performance. In contrast, all two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) MTJs offer an effective solution to avoid these problems, due to their atomically flat surfaces, suppressed interfacial mixing, and low dimensionality. In this review, we provide a systematic overview of recent advancements in all-2D vdW MTJs involving both spin-valve and spin-filter configurations. The discussed systems are classified according to the types of 2D magnetic materials. Then, the effective strategies for modulating the performance of MTJs are introduced, such as regulating the bias voltage/current, the thickness of the tunneling layer, and spin angles. Finally, the challenges and prospects for the future development of all-2D MTJs are discussed, highlighting the potential for realizing breakthroughs in this field.},

  abstract     = {Traditional hydrogen storage materials rely mainly on chemical adsorption (such as metal hydrides and chemical hydrides) or physical adsorption (such as metal–organic frameworks, activated carbon, zeolites, and other high-specific surface area materials) to achieve the storage and release of hydrogen. However, these materials struggle to simultaneously meet the technical requirements of high-capacity, rapid, and reversible hydrogen absorption and desorption under room temperature and atmospheric pressure. In recent years, both theoretical predictions and experimental research have indicated that nontraditional hydrogen storage materials based on hybrid adsorption mechanisms (such as physical adsorption, chemical adsorption, Kubas-type interactions, static electric polarization, and weak chemical adsorption)—namely, MXene materials—are promising for rapid and high-capacity hydrogen storage under normal conditions. This review aims to focus on the intrinsic principles of the diverse hybrid mechanisms of MXene materials and recent research progress of MXene as a hydrogen carrier. By detailed analysis of their structural characteristics, surface properties, and the specific mechanisms of interaction with hydrogen, it strives to deepen the understanding of the physicochemical principles of MXene materials as a hydrogen storage material.},

  abstract     = {The rise of high-performance functional devices has driven significant breakthroughs in various research fields, with ultrafast laser processing offering unprecedented opportunities for advanced device fabrication. This review summarizes recent progress and future prospects for ultrafast laser in fabricating functional optical, semiconductor, and sensor devices. Central to these advances is a deeper understanding of ultrafast laser–matter interaction physics, including nonlinear optical effects, multiphoton ionization, avalanche ionization, and laser-induced plasma dynamics. These phenomena govern carrier excitation, energy deposition, and subsequent structural modification. We further review how such interactions enable controlled refractive index changes, selective ablation, and nanoscale material structuring in photosensitive, dielectric, semiconductor, and metallic substrates. Key applications are then reviewed, including ultrafast laser fabrication of optical devices (e.g., optical waveguide devices, optical data storage elements, optical elements, and artificial compound eyes, integrated photonic devices), semiconductor devices (e.g., semiconductor light-emitting devices, photodiodes, solar cells, and photodetectors), and sensors (e.g., fiber optic sensors, flexible sensors, and biochemical sensors). Recent breakthroughs showcase ultrafast laser-induced precision in device miniaturization, improved optoelectronic characteristics, and integration of complex functions (e.g., topological photonic circuits fabricated via sub-100-nm laser writing, 5D optical data storage in glass with > 1 TB/cm 3 density, perovskite solar cells achieving 25.7% efficiency through laser-induced phase engineering, alongside plasmonic biosensors with 100× sensitivity enhancement, and stretchable graphene sensors for wearables). Finally, this review discusses core challenges, such as enhancing the scalability of ultrafast laser processes for industrial-scale production and optimizing laser-material interactions to improve device reliability and performance. Future efforts should address key challenges such as the limited scalability of ultrafast laser processing and the incomplete understanding of laser–matter interactions at ultrafast timescales. Integrating ultrafast lasers with AI-driven control, beam shaping, and advanced materials such as 2D heterostructures may enable smarter and more multifunctional device platforms. A unified theoretical framework is also needed to guide precise and efficient fabrication. These directions highlight critical opportunities for bridging current limitations and enabling transformative advances. While not exhaustive, this review lays a foundation for further research into the transformative potential of ultrafast laser in functional device fabrication.},

Electrokinetic multiphase hydrodynamics (EKmHD), dating back to the early 20th century, has regained prominence since the 2010s, supported by advanced methods spanning microfluidics, spectroscopy, molecular dynamics, phase-field-based modeling, coarse-grained analysis, and high-performance computing. After briefly sketching fundamental mechanisms, this review establishes a unified framework of experimental, theoretical, and numerical issues to consolidate the quantitative methodology of EKmHD, which is essential to uncover the underlying interfacial transport mechanisms. The systematic synthesis will not only advance predictive modeling methods for liquid–liquid electrokinetics but also propel the technological developments in multiphase-system-based energy conversion, bio-medical devices, and smart fluidics.},

However, the fast-growing developments in accelerated material synthesis via self-driving labs and established applications such as combinatorial spread libraries are poised to change this paradigm. Rapid synthesis demands matching capabilities to probe the structure and functionalities of materials on small scales and with high throughput. SPM inherently meets these criteria, offering a rich and diverse array of data from a single measurement. Here, we overview SPM methods applicable to these emerging applications and emphasize their quantitativeness, focusing on piezoresponse force microscopy, electrochemical strain microscopy, conductive, and surface photovoltage measurements.

Their disease and/or loss are most debilitating and afflict millions of Americans, reducing productivity and deteriorating quality of life. Due to limited treatments, scientists, engineers, and clinical doctors are investigating new tissue engineering solutions. In tissue engineering approaches, scaffolds are artificially designed temporary matrices that accommodate stem/progenitor cells and provide both physical and biological signals to guide cell differentiation and 3D tissue regeneration but eventually degrade and leave behind regenerated functional tissues or organs. Therefore, scaffolds often substantially benefit from mimicking certain features of the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) and designing certain engineered features to facilitate cell repopulation, mass transportation, and mechanical and biological cues for cells to regenerate tissue. This review article focuses on the design, synthesis, fabrication, and functionalization of nanofibrous materials to mimic the ECM, deliver biological signals, and integrate various engineering design features such as pore shape, size, connectivity, tissue architectures, and anatomic tissue/organ shapes to guide 3D tissue regeneration. In addition to biological and physical principles of scaffold design and fabrication, we also provide several examples of specific applications of these advanced nanofibrous scaffolds for bone, cartilage, and their associated composite tissue regeneration in osteochondral defects.

However, challenges such as high defect densities, small grain sizes, and unstable n-type conduction have limited their practical application. In this paper, we review the progress in the solid-phase crystallization of Ge thin films on insulating substrates. We first discuss conventional processes with excessive nucleation that lead to poor crystallinity and electrical properties. We then introduce advanced solid-phase crystallization strategies, highlighting the critical role of controlling the amorphous deposition temperature to control atomic density, increase grain size, and reduce acceptor defects. Additionally, the incorporation of tin (Sn) has been shown to passivate grain boundaries, while the modulation of film thickness and the introduction of interfacial layers have demonstrated the ability to mitigate carrier scattering at the substrate interface. This review also addresses impurity doping techniques for precise Fermi level control, strain engineering effects on grain boundary barrier energies, and metal-induced lateral crystallization for grain alignment. These innovations have culminated in achieving record-high carrier mobilities of 690 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for p-type and 450 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for n-type films, approaching single-crystal performance. The insights provided herein will pave the way for the development of high-performance Ge-based thin-film transistors and flexible electronic devices via low-temperature processing.},

  abstract     = {The field of 2D materials has grown dramatically in the past two decades. 2D materials can be utilized for a variety of next-generation optoelectronic, spintronic, clean energy, and quantum computing applications. These 2D structures, which are often exfoliated from layered van der Waals materials, possess highly inhomogeneous electron densities and can possess short- and long-range electron correlations. The complexities of 2D materials make them challenging to study with standard mean-field electronic structure methods such as density functional theory (DFT), which relies on approximations for the unknown exchange-correlation functional. To overcome the limitations of DFT, highly accurate many-body electronic structure approaches such as diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) can be utilized. In the past decade, DMC has been used to calculate accurate magnetic, electronic, excitonic, and topological properties in addition to accurately capturing interlayer interactions and cohesion and adsorption energetics of 2D materials. This approach has been applied to 2D systems of wide interest, including graphene, phosphorene, MoS 2 , CrI 3 , VSe 2 , GaSe, GeSe, borophene, and several others. In this review article, we highlight some successful recent applications of DMC to 2D systems for improved property predictions beyond standard DFT.},

  abstract     = {Mie scattering between incident light and nanoparticles (NPs) plays a vital role in improving the performance of optical and photonic devices, such as sensors, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. While traditional far-field spectroscopy and electromagnetic simulations have been used to study Mie scattering, these methods lack real-space imaging capabilities, limiting their ability to capture single-particle scattering phenomena. Scanning probe microscopy-based nanoscopy techniques have become essential for studying Mie scattering at the nanoscale to address this limitation. This review explores the theoretical foundations of Mie scattering and the role of near-field microscopy in bridging the gap between theory and experiment through high-resolution imaging. By focusing on real-space imaging, we highlight the practical aspects of Mie scattering and its applications in fields such as biosensing, photocatalysis, and materials science. Nanoscopy techniques allow for direct visualization of scattering processes in nanostructures, offering more profound insights into how NPs interact with light at the nanoscale. Additionally, we discuss the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance near-field analysis, providing more accurate interpretations of Mie scattering phenomena. In conclusion, combining advanced nanoscopy and AI-driven analysis will significantly advance our understanding of Mie scattering and its diverse applications in various scientific and technological fields. The synergy between cutting-edge imaging methods and computational simulation not only enriches our theoretical understanding of scattering phenomena but also accelerates the development of next-generation photonic devices, paving the way for a wide range of practical applications across scientific and technological domains.},

Quantum point contacts (QPCs) emerge as a promising solution, offering atomic-scale tunability, exceptional sensitivity to single-electron charges, and seamless compatibility with low-dimensional material platforms. Leveraging quantum effects such as quantum conductance, QPC-based sensing techniques harness the unique electronic behaviors at atomic scales, paving the way for next-generation ultra-miniaturized electronic devices. This review provides an in-depth analysis of QPCs, elucidating their fundamental physical properties, including quantum conductance and shot noise, while exploring traditional manipulation methods such as mechanical control, gate voltage adjustments, and the emerging nanoionics approach. Furthermore, the review highlights the application of QPCs in quantum sensing for molecular adsorption, light and heat detection, and their potential in information storage and quantum computing. Despite their promise, challenges related to stability and integrability remain critical hurdles. Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to accelerate advancements in quantum sensing technology, offering innovative pathways for the development of miniaturized, multifunctional integrated quantum sensors.

Combining a high-pressure apparatus with a low-temperature cryostat requires the design of a compact-scale high-pressure apparatus which generally results in reduced sample volume. In the magnetic measurements, this requires the use of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which is a highly sensitive magnetic device for detecting changes in minute magnetic fluxes. In this review, two types of SQUID magnetometers for pressure ( P ) of up to 30 GPa are reviewed. One is a commercial SQUID magnetometer with a miniature diamond anvil cell (DAC) covering a wide temperature range of 1.8–400 K, and the other is a vibrating-coil SQUID magnetometer equipped with DAC, which provides more accurate measurements. The former was used for oxygen molecules, molecule-based magnets, permanent magnets, organic radial ferromagnets, and lanthanide ferromagnets, whereas the latter was applied to organic radial ferromagnets, samarium (Sm), and an iron-based superconductor. Further developments of accurate magnetization measurements at high pressures are important for condensed matter studies on magnets and superconductors.},

Such high efficiencies are currently only possible using four or more junctions to partition the broad solar spectrum into bins where each subcell efficiently collects a narrow range of photon energies. High-efficiency, wide-bandgap (1.7–2.2 eV) absorbers play a crucial role in multi-junction solar cells by efficiently converting visible photons into electrons and delivering them at high voltage. Since all subcells are interconnected in series, the widest bandgap junction produces both the highest voltage and highest power in the stack. Wide-bandgap absorbers also present the greatest materials challenges in the stack, including high aluminum content, lattice mismatch, lack of heterojunction barriers, and the sensitivity of phosphides to defects such as vacancies and oxygen. We review the history, current status, and opportunities for wide-bandgap III-V solar cells, ranging from ∼1.7 eV for the top subcell of III-V/Si hybrid tandems to >2.2 eV for the top subcell of a 6+ junction stack.

Unlike electrostrictive and magnetostrictive effects, it does not involve complex circuits, therefore offering a promising prospect of accomplishing the advanced, compact, and remote-control devices. The key step to produce the light-induced strain of practical value is to design highly efficient photostrictive materials. Based upon the nature of the material systems to be explored for micro-optomechanical devices, the photostriction in inorganic–materials-based systems, including semiconductors, transition metal oxides, halide perovskites, and ferroelectrics in bulk and two-dimensions, are summarized herein. For each material, the feasible strategies of compositional engineering, processing conditions, and sample sculpturing, with a special focus on the meticulous tailoring of multiple phase boundaries in representative ferroelectric systems to produce significant photostriction, are given. Since ferroelectric photostriction is accounted as the superposition effect of photovoltaic and inverse piezoelectric effects, both effects are introduced and discussed.

  abstract     = {Acoustic techniques have emerged as a transformative approach in additive manufacturing, enabling contactless, high-precision manipulation of particles, droplets, and cells through acoustic wavefields. While acoustic patterning has demonstrated remarkable control over microscale spatial configurations, its scalability into three-dimensional (3D) fabrication has remained constrained by challenges in bonding limitations and vertical stacking. To solve this challenge, hybrid acoustic-assisted 3D printing integrates acoustophoresis with established methods, such as direct ink writing and stereolithography, enhancing material deposition accuracy, microstructure alignment, and porous structuring of 3D printed products. However, these hybrid systems remain tethered to layer-by-layer architectures, limiting the full potential of acoustic techniques. Recent breakthroughs in standalone acoustic 3D fabrication, leveraging levitation, focusing, and ejection, have unlocked potential in contactless, layerless, and flexible multi-material assembly. Acoustic levitation systems enable mid-air construction on non-planar surfaces, and focused ultrasound techniques facilitate deep-penetration polymerization and acoustic droplet ejection advances nozzle-free droplet-based bioprinting.

  abstract     = {Exploring many-body chemical systems on classical computers often involves solving the Schrödinger equation. However, this approach is frequently limited by the exponential increase in the dimensionality of the Hamiltonian as the number of degrees of freedom increases. In contrast, quantum computing, specifically through the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework, shows promise in overcoming this exponential cost. VQE can utilize the collective properties of quantum states to model the wavefunction in polynomial time. Despite the current limitations of quantum hardware, significant advances have been made in the development of VQE-based algorithms. In this review, we provide an overview of emerging protocols, focusing on their applications in simulating the ground state, excited state, and vibrational properties of chemical systems. By examining notable algorithmic advancements and applications, this review aims to shed light on the challenges and potential of VQE-based algorithms in addressing relevant chemical problems.},

Its malfunction is related to neurological disorders, including startle disease (hyperekplexia), which is characterized by exaggerated startle responses to sudden unexpected stimuli, such as noise or touch. Here, we unravel the molecular mechanisms of action of a specific mutation that is linked to startle disease: Asn46Lys (N46K). This residue, in the GlyR extracellular domain, is not directly involved in neurotransmitter binding but can disrupt the neurotransmitter pathway. To understand how, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the wild-type and mutated extracellular domain of a homomeric α 1 GlyR, assessing the effects of the Asn46Lys mutation. We then sampled multiple unbinding and binding events by means of metadynamics simulations, with a funnel restraint to limit the exploration in the solvent. By evaluating the binding free energy landscape, we observed a substantial reduction in neurotransmitter binding affinity, which is consistent with experiments. We suggest that such a reduction is linked to the interaction of its crucial glutamic acid residue with the lysine mutation competing with the glycine ligand.},

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we found that ROS primarily induce structural damage through dehydrogenation reactions and the cleavage of C–C and C–O bonds. Notably, the teichoic acid (TA) from S. aureus was found to be more susceptible to damage compared to that of S. pneumoniae , which exhibited stronger antioxidant properties due to its ring structure and chemical modifications. The efficiency of damage increased with ROS concentration, following the order, O > O 3 > OH, with a maximum of 22.22% C–C bond cleavage observed at the highest concentration. In addition, the patterns of damage in the TA of these two bacterial species were significantly different. In S. aureus , WTA damage was predominantly characterized by C–C and C–O bond cleavage in the repeating units, whereas LTA damage was primarily due to the cleavage of C–C bonds in the ring structure. In S. pneumoniae , damage to both WTA and LTA mainly occurred at the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) ring structure and the poly (RboP) site.

  abstract     = {Silver ions (Ag + ) are known to interact with DNA through nonspecific and specific mechanisms, inducing conformational and mechanical changes in the double helix. In this study, we investigate how varying Ag + concentrations affect the mechanical properties of DNA, in particular, contour length, persistence length, end-to-end distance, and area of occupation, using atomic force microscopy. At low Ag + concentrations, we observe localized stiffening and shortening of DNA molecules, which we attribute to the formation of monoadducts and biadducts with specific DNA bases. These interactions promote the emergence of secondary structures that contribute to DNA compaction and a reduction in contour length. At intermediate concentrations, accumulation of torsional stress and the formation of multiple metal-mediated contacts lead to a global conformational collapse, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the effective persistence length. At the highest Ag + concentration tested (1.5 mM), the uniform distribution of molecular area suggests a widespread structural collapse of DNA. These findings support previous reports of Ag + -induced DNA condensation and reveal a progressive structural transition from extended to globular conformations. The observed behavior provides insights into the biophysical consequences of metal–DNA interactions and may have implications for understanding the molecular basis of the antimicrobial activity of silver ions.},

Beyond their chemical composition, these polymers often exhibit spatial variations in physical properties. For instance, in biopolymers such as chromatin, the heterogeneity of extensibility arises from inherent molecular features as well as extensile or contractile active forces. In this article, we develop a theoretical framework that extends the physics of flexible polymers, a widely used tool for describing biopolymer dynamics, to incorporate spatially varying extensibility. Using this approach, we specifically analyze the structure and dynamics of flexible heteropolymers with periodic stepwise extensibility profiles. We find that this heterogeneity leads to qualitative deviations in dynamical observables, such as mean squared displacement, while also increasing structural anisotropy. Altogether, this framework provides a platform for interpreting heterogeneous extensibility from experimental data, especially for biopolymers, as well as for designing heteropolymers with tailored structural and dynamic properties.},

Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations, we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting.

Here, we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. In contrast, discrete-time simulations are slow to show this instability, particularly for large system sizes. For the remaining state space, we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations.

Despite the absence of surface charge on the (non-polarizable) channel walls and the associated electric double layer, we do observe robust ion selectivity. This selectivity favors the transport of cations from base to tip when the electric field is directed from base to tip, and anions from base to tip when the field direction is reversed. In addition, we observe a corresponding electro-osmotic water flow from base to tip, regardless of the electric field direction. Intriguingly, ion selectivity and electro-osmotic flow are conventionally associated with surface charge and electric double layers. Here, however, we uncover a novel mechanism for these phenomena in uncharged tapered nanoslits, where ion selectivity arises from the divergence of the heterogeneous water polarization.},

In response, surface-grafted polymers undergo a transition from an isotropic brush-layer in a good solvent to heterogeneous patches in CNS. To quantitatively describe this transition, we use the surface coverage θ as an additional order parameter and develop a theoretical model for its calculation, which is compared with the simulations. By further examining θ as a function of CNS concentration, we observe that PDNPs exhibit a collapse-reentry process similar to planar brushes, but with richer details of the two-step reentry behavior: angular isotropy recovery followed by radial expansion. We investigate how this CNS-induced collapse transition influences the reversible adsorption/exclusion of cargo nanoparticles on PDNPs, depending on the size of the cargo and the concentration of the cosolvent.},

This raises questions about how to correctly extract memory kernels from simulation data when this correlation is neglected and whether inverting the Volterra equation to obtain a memory kernel yields a physically meaningful result. In a recent work [Wolf et al. J. Chem. Phys. 162 , 054113 (2025)], we proposed an approximation to account for the cross correlation term. We demonstrate in this work that cross correlations play a significant role in the collapse transition of a hydrophobic polymer under various solvent conditions. In addition, we demonstrate that our proposed approximation yields an improved description of barrier crossing times. Notably, we find that this improvement has the same magnitude as the improvement gained by accounting for memory effects.},

  abstract     = {Periodic ab initio molecular dynamics simulations accelerated by machine learning were conducted to investigate the adsorption of benzene on graphene at a coverage of 0.11 ML and a temperature of 150 K. For this purpose, seven density functional approximations (DFAs) were used, differing in the exchange–correlation functional (PBE, SCAN, HSE06, and vdW-optB86b) and the long-range dispersion correction (D2, D3, D4, and MBD). Thermal effects on the structure, enthalpy (Δ ads H ), and Gibbs free energy (Δ ads G ) of adsorption were analyzed. The relatively fast surface diffusion of the adsorbate was identified as the dominant anharmonic effect causing an increase in Δ ads G of up to 50% compared to static harmonic calculations. In contrast, the anharmonic effect on Δ ads H was shown to be nearly negligible. The computed thermodynamic data were used to predict the desorption kinetics parameters, i.e., activation energy ( E a ), Arrhenius pre-factor ( ν ), and position of desorption maximum ( T max ). Among the DFAs tested, the PBE + D4 method was found to provide the best overall agreement with the experimental data. The SCAN + MBD, PBE + D3, and PBE + D2 methods predict E a values that agree with the experimentally determined value within the reported uncertainty but significantly underestimate T max .},

A database of vibrational modes and simulated infrared spectra was constructed, revealing distinct spectral features that serve as characteristic fingerprints for different bonding environments. By analyzing mode distributions with respect to coordination environments, we identify the distinct contributions of terminal and bridging hydrogen atoms to specific spectral regions. The results show that structural modifications, such as interlayer stacking and edge termination, have a significant influence on vibrational characteristics, particularly in the intermediate and high frequency regions. The vibrational database enables the precise interpretation of infrared spectra and offers a reliable reference for model selection and peak analysis in both experimental and theoretical studies on hydrogen boride sheets and related materials.},

The functionalization of graphene induces charge localization, while ring disorder disrupts the continuous flow of electrons.

While sodium is the dominant alkali metal in such systems, cesium often exhibits distinct bulk behavior relative to lighter alkali cations. Aqueous mixtures of cesium hydroxide and sodium nitrite were compared to alkali hydroxide analogs using small-angle x-ray scattering, revealing that cesium disrupts the sodium nitrite electrolyte structure, forming cesium-rich domains. This mesoscale segregation contrasts with the near-ideal mixing observed in other mixed hydroxide–nitrite systems. Raman spectroscopy indicates cesium–nitrite ion pairing, evidenced by vibrational shifts distinct from those associated with sodium. Multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy further supports cesium–nitrite and cesium–hydroxide association, revealing a distinct local environment for nitrite in cesium-containing solutions. Together, these findings show that cesium promotes a unique solution structure dominated by specific ion pairing within segregated domains.

One of the advantages of the present method is that it is applicable to deeply cooled and heavily compressed states where a CO 2 hydrate is formed. The experimental solubility curve against temperature is successfully recovered with an appropriate correction for the self-polarization energy implicitly embedded in the pairwise additive interaction model for water. The solubility of water in liquid CO 2 coexisting with an aqueous solution decreases upon cooling. It is found that the intervening hydrate steadily reduces the solubility of water compared to that assumed to be in direct contact with the aqueous phase. The significant decrease results from the decrease in the chemical potential of water in the hydrate, relocating the boundary from the water/hydrate to the hydrate/fluid. Liquid CO 2 loses its capacity to retain water upon cooling more seriously than that anticipated from the water/fluid boundary, and an excessive amount of water is precipitated into hydrate at low temperatures. The thermodynamic properties thus calculated provide valuable information on problems in the massive transport of CO 2 , specifically the blockage of pipelines and corrosion of vessels.},

  abstract     = {Modeling ionic activity is essential for understanding ion-specific effects in environmental and industrial systems. The microscopic interactions of heavy metal salts in aqueous solutions become increasingly complex with rising salt molality, posing significant challenges for accurately modeling ionic activity. This study applies, for the first time, an electrolyte version of the cubic-plus-association equation of state to calculate the mean ionic activity coefficients of several heavy metal salts in water at 298.15 K. Experimental data for four types of salts—nickel, cadmium, cobalt, and zinc salts—were compiled, and the ion–water binary interaction parameters are regressed from these measurements. The model successfully predicts water activity, osmotic coefficients, and mean ionic activity coefficients across most systems. Without explicit incorporation of ionic association, the average calculation relative average deviation of the mean ionic activity coefficient for nickel and cobalt salts is 5.9% and 6.3%, respectively, extending the applicable molality range up to 5.0 mol/kg water and 5.5 mol/kg water. For solutions of cadmium salts and zinc salts that have been confirmed to contain ion pairs, ion association was introduced into the model for calculation. The calculation results indicate that the consideration of ion association has significantly reduced the calculation deviations. Within the calculated salt molality ranges, the average relative deviation of the mean ionic activity coefficient for cadmium salts is all below 2.0%, while that for zinc salts is all less than 5.5%, respectively. This study provides valuable insights into the micro-level factors influencing activity coefficients and offers recommendations for improving model accuracy under complex conditions.},

We tested this protocol on three non-polarizable systems with different dielectric permittivities. We showed that it produces the same dielectric spectra as the standard method while being less sensitive to noise. The question of the decomposition of a dielectric spectrum into self and cross contributions is discussed in the context of both methods.

  abstract     = {We have generated SiNSi in supersonic free expansions and observed laser induced fluorescence (LIF) in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible regions. We measured two kinds of LIF excitation spectra from the X ̃ Π g 2 electronic state: one detecting UV fluorescence and the other detecting visible fluorescence. By exciting the vibronic bands observed in the LIF excitation spectra, we recorded dispersed fluorescence (DF) spectra from the single vibronic levels to the X ̃ Π g 2 state. The vibrational structures of the DF spectra are complicated due to the relatively large vibronic interactions in the X ̃ Π g 2 state. We were not able to analyze the structure using regular formulations derived from perturbational treatments that consider the Renner–Teller (R–T) and spin–orbit (SO) couplings and the anharmonicity of the ν 2 bending potential. Instead, we analyzed it by directly diagonalizing the vibronic Hamiltonian, including not only R–T, SO, and the anharmonicity but also Fermi resonance between the ν 1 symmetric stretching and ν 2 modes and anharmonicities, x 11 and x 12 . The vibronic analysis revealed two characteristics: a relatively large R–T parameter, ϵ = +0.51, and a SO constant close to the bending frequency, A ≈ 0.8 ω 2 . Both these characteristics bring about accidental proximity of the vibronic levels in the D ∞h system, and this proximity causes heavy mixing among the vibronic levels. The results can be applied to find weak vibrationally hot bands in the rotationally resolved LIF excitation spectra observed, and actually the Q 1 p band head of the hot band, C ̃ ( 0 1 1 0 ) Π g 2 − X ̃ ( 0 1 1 0 ) κ Σ g ( + ) 2 ⁠ , has been able to be assigned.

  abstract     = {Hydrogen bonds, crucial for the formation and stabilization of complex organic molecules, present intriguing possibilities for the existence of such molecular complexes in extraterrestrial environments. To investigate the microscopic hydrogen-bonding networks in nitrile–methanol clusters—potential candidates for interstellar organic complexes—we recorded infrared spectra of neutral XN-M (XN = nitriles; M = methanol) heterodimers in the 2600-3900 cm −1 range using infrared-vacuum ultraviolet (IR-VUV) spectroscopy. Quantum chemical calculations based on harmonic approximations are typically used to simulate such spectral peaks; however, they often fail to fully reproduce the experimental features. To overcome these limitations, we employed ab initio anharmonic algorithms and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Anharmonic algorithms successfully assigned elusive spectral features by accounting for vibrational couplings (e.g., Fermi resonances and combination bands), and AIMD proved essential for accurately assigning characteristically broad hydrogen-bonded OH bands unresolved by harmonic methods. Applying this integrated approach, we confirmed the distinct H-bonding preferences in the XN-M heterodimers: acetonitrile (ACN) and unsaturated aliphatic nitriles (e.g., 3-butene nitrile, 3BN; 4-pentene nitrile, 4PN) predominantly adopt linear N⋯H–O configurations, whereas acrylonitrile and benzonitrile favor cyclic double H-bonded structures. This study establishes a powerful framework that integrates advanced computational methodologies to decipher hydrogen-bonding motifs from complex spectral data, enabling the direct interpretation of both laboratory and astronomical infrared observations.},

  abstract     = {This work investigated the reaction mechanism of N 2 on Ta 2 N − via the photoelectron spectroscopy study of Ta 2 N 3 − , focusing on the activation of nitrogen molecules (N 2 ) by Ta 2 N − . The vertical detachment energy of Ta 2 N 3 − was determined to be 2.22 eV from the experimental photoelectron spectrum. Charge and bond order analyses reveal significant electron transfer from Ta to N and strong Ta–N bonding, supporting the relative stability and reactivity of the cluster. Energy decomposition analysis and natural orbitals for chemical valence analysis show that orbital interactions, especially π- and σ-donations from Ta 2 N − to N 2 , dominate the activation process of N 2 . Substantial charge transfer occurs from the Ta 2 N − fragment to the N 2 fragment, accompanied by noticeable polarization, which facilitates the breaking of the N≡N bond. The results highlight the importance of Ta–N bond coordination in stabilizing dissociated nitrogen atoms, making Ta 2 N − a potentially efficient species for N 2 activation.},

  abstract     = {The reactivity of nanoparticles is governed by their surface composition, which tends to vary significantly under reactive conditions. In this study, the impacts of temperature and the presence of a CO or O 2 atmosphere on the structures of Au 79 , Cu 19 Au 60 , Cu 39 Au 40 , Cu 60 Au 19 , and Cu 79 nanoparticles were investigated using a combination of global optimization, machine learning interatomic potentials, and density functional theory. We find that increasing gold content weakens CO and O adsorption and limits oxygen-induced structural changes, while copper-rich particles undergo pronounced oxidation and reconstruction. Bader charge analysis shows that, in bare nanoalloys, Au withdraws electron density from Cu due to their electronegativity difference. In oxidized Cu–Au nanoalloys, the charge on Cu atoms depends on the number of O neighbors and can reach values typical of Cu 2 O (0.6 e ) and CuO (1.1 e ). On average, the Cu atoms exhibit positive effective Bader charges of ∼0.9 e in these nanoalloys. Our results indicate that models of Cu–Au catalysts under oxidizing conditions must incorporate the full ensemble of metallic and oxidized configurations rather than a single most probable structure to predict true catalytic activity.},

  abstract     = {4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) is a widely utilized DNA sensor, renowned for its strong affinity for the AT minor groove. Despite its essential role as a fluorescent probe in molecular biology and biomedical research, the origins of DAPI’s intrinsic fluorescence and the mechanisms behind its fluorescence enhancement upon DNA sensing remain unresolved. This study provides a comprehensive investigation into the fluorescence dynamics of DAPI, both in solution and when bound to detect the AT minor groove of a self-complementary dodecamer duplex DNA. We employed an integrated approach combining femtosecond broadband time-resolved fluorescence, transient absorption, and supported by theoretical calculations. The results reveal an unprecedented ultrafast inter-solute–solvent three-state excited-state proton transfer pathway, which clarifies the root cause of low fluorescence yield and fluorescence dynamics of free form DAPI in aqueous solution. Irrespective of the structural heterogeneity and rotamer conformation of the ground state of DAPI, this involves deprotonation of the excited state at a rate of ∼2.4 ps, followed by proton reuptake by the resulting weakly emissive deprotonated state, leading to direct reformation of DAPI’s ground state at 139 ps. Binding to the DNA minor groove completely inhibits this proton transfer, accounting for the significant fluorescence enhancement observed in the DAPI-DNA complex. Furthermore, the broadband capacity of our time-resolved fluorescence approach enables, for the first time, direct tracking of the fluorescence dynamic Stokes shift of minor groove-bound DAPI, revealing significant dispersive collective solvation dynamics specific to the sensing site. These findings provide valuable insights into how microenvironments dictate DAPI fluorescence dynamics and may assist in the strategic design of light-up sensors for recognizing interior hydration dynamics and local residue motions of DNA.},

However, there is a need to improve the inclusion of electron–vibrational interaction, the exchange and correlation effects arising from electron–electron interactions, and non-Born–Oppenheimer coupling to enhance the predictive power of the theory and its agreement with experiments. In an attempt to overcome these difficulties, we advance in the present work a microscopic quantum mechanical treatment of CISS based on the relativistic Breit–Pauli many-particle Hamiltonian. In particular, we determine in this context the effect that including non-Born–Oppenheimer components arising in a Taylor expansion of the electron–nuclear potential has on the spin–orbit coupling term of this Hamiltonian. We also consider in this framework the electron–electron exchange and correlation effects and propose some practical approximations based on non-relativistic approaches. Finally, we extend the application of the Breit–Pauli Hamiltonian to describe nuclear–nuclear spin interactions and discuss the possibility of explaining enantiomeric selectivity in cross-polarization nuclear magnetic resonance experiments.},

  abstract     = {The mean back relaxation (MBR) relates the value of a stochastic process at three different time points. It has been shown to detect broken detailed balance under certain conditions. For experiments of probe particles in living and passivated cells, MBR was found to be related to the so-called effective energy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. In this paper, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters that enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding qualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the phenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of time parameters compared to previous work, allowing us to test it in systems with limited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in dependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in MBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in terms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum as a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data to a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process.},

In this study, we present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of one-dimensional transition metal mono-oxide chains (VO, CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO) using density functional theory (DFT), DFT+ U , and coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) calculations. The Hubbard U parameter for DFT+ U is determined using linear response theory. In all systems studied except MnO, the presence of multiple local minima—primarily due to the electronic degrees of freedom associated with the d -orbitals—leads to significant challenges for DFT, DFT+ U , and Hartree–Fock methods in finding the global minimum in ab initio calculations. Our results indicate that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state is energetically favored for all chains, except CrO, when using DFT+ U and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. Analysis of the band structures shows that while PBE often predicts metallic or half-metallic FM states, DFT+ U opens band gaps and correctly yields insulating behavior in all cases. Furthermore, we compared the energy differences between the AFM and FM states using DFT+ U and CCSD for CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO. Our findings indicate that CCSD predicts larger energy differences in some cases compared to DFT+ U , suggesting that the Hubbard U parameter obtained through linear response theory may be overestimated when used to calculate energy differences between different magnetic states. For CrO, CCSD predicts an AFM ground state, in contrast to the predictions from DFT+ U and PBE methods.},

Our methodology combines ab initio molecular dynamics with time-dependent density functional theory and a polarizable continuum model to characterize the ground- and excited-state potential energy surfaces of the rotor in cyclohexane. Time-resolved vibrational analysis based on wavelet transform enables the decomposition of the nuclear motion into time–frequency components. This approach allows us to follow the evolution of vibrational dynamics and their role in key relaxation pathways and spectroscopic signals. We propose that, although not directly observable, complex vibrational dynamics influence the emission by modulating both the transition energy and the emission dipole moment. These include C=C stretching, out-of-plane motions at the axle carbon, and rotor–stator torsional modes. For the first time, we assign and interpret low-frequency modes observed experimentally at ∼180 cm −1 in time-resolved fluorescence. We reproduce the extent and the dynamics of the pronounced red shift of the C=C stretching mode upon excitation, as observed in the femtosecond stimulated Raman spectrum (1585 cm −1 in the ground state vs 1350–1440 cm −1 in the excited state). Regarding the photoisomerization, we identify a clear correlated steric-relief mechanism of the two main relaxation coordinates: torsion about the C=C axle and pyramidalization at the stator–bridge carbon. This study demonstrates the power of transient vibrational analysis in unraveling complex photorelaxation mechanisms by establishing a direct link between experimental data and excited-state molecular dynamics simulations.},

These limitations pose significant challenges in scientific and engineering contexts, where generating exhaustive datasets is often impractical and the goal is to frequently discover novel solutions outside the training domain. In this work, we explore the use of dynamical data through a graph neural network-based simulator to enable efficient system-to-property learning and out-of-distribution prediction in the context of uniaxial compression of two-dimensional disordered elastic networks. We find that the simulator can learn the underlying physical dynamics from a small number of training examples and accurately reproduce the temporal evolution of unseen networks. Notably, the simulator is able to accurately predict emergent properties such as Poisson’s ratio and its dependence on strain, even though it was not explicitly trained for this task. In addition, it generalizes well across variations in system temperature, strain amplitude, and most significantly, Poisson’s ratios beyond the training range. These findings suggest that using dynamical data to train machine learning models can support more information efficient and generalizable approaches for materials and molecular design, especially in data-scarce settings.},

The computational complexity of this model scales identically to CC2 with molecular size. Conventional CC2 and its regularized BWs-CC2 variants, as well as conventional MP2 and two of its regularized BW-s2 variants, were assessed on a 535 element database spanning thermochemistry, non-covalent interactions, barrier heights, and isomerization energies. To ensure a well-defined model chemistry, the assessment was performed using internally stable spin-polarized Hartree–Fock (HF) orbitals in the finite aug-cc-pVQZ basis without counterpoise corrections. As a result of using stable orbitals, contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that CC2 substantially outperforms MP2 on molecules with significantly spin contaminated reference orbitals without a significant increase in error on systems with a spin-pure reference, showing the value of its single substitutions. While no single choice of regularization parameters can be optimal for all datasets, we find that BWs-CC2 generally outperforms both CC2 and BW-s2 with a single judicious parameter choice. Additional tests on dipole moments and bond lengths of diatomics provide further support for the utility of this choice. The main outliers and poorest performing cases are associated with large amounts of spin-contamination in the HF reference, which is indicative of systems with either strong correlation or extensive artificial symmetry breaking. Overall, these findings argue that the perception of the quality of the CC2 ground state should be reevaluated and that it can be further improved upon by the soundly based BWs-CC2 variant with the recommended parameter choice.},

  abstract     = {Forming new hybrid quasiparticles by strong light–matter coupling is a promising tool for tailoring the photophysics and photochemistry of molecules. Thus, the ultrafast dynamics of polaritons formed upon strong light–matter coupling has been extensively studied by pump–probe spectroscopy. Although it was predicted that the partial photonic character of polaritons should shorten their lifetime compared to purely molecular excited states, many studies do not observe this effect. So far, the unexpected longevity of the spectral signatures has been either explained by relaxation into a manifold of so-called dark states or by other uncontrolled effects that change the properties of cavity materials. In order to resolve these issues, we investigate here the dependence of the line shape of pump–probe spectra of polaritons on the ratio of photonic and molecular character. Furthermore, by phenomenologically including relaxation to dark states, we find that it is possible to spectrally resolve this relaxation process by observing a characteristic phase flip in the pump–probe signal. Our results show that the signatures of dark state relaxation and the influence of the cavity resonance energy and their contributions to the polariton dynamics can be disentangled from the spectral line shapes.},

This methodology was employed to compute and analyze the behavior of the reduced two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) and related two-particle density. It was shown that the region near the minimum of the correlation component of the 2RDM associated mainly with the Coulomb hole significantly affects the dispersion interaction energies of the systems concerned. As one of the consequences, the bond function approach to deal with the intermolecular correlation energies calculations was found to essentially and consistently enhance the convergence of the results with respect to the basis set size if the auxiliary functions were placed to cover the 2D minimum region. For asymmetric dimers, this general finding was further validated through a series of CCSD(T) calculations of the correlation energies.},

For a model of cis – trans isomerization in a protonated Schiff base, vibronic effects induced by intramolecular torsional and bond-length-alternation modes act concertedly with a collective environmental mode, which plays the role of an effective tuning mode. The latter is coupled to a residual environment, and the combination of the effective and residual modes conforms to an overdamped Brownian oscillator type spectral density. Thermal averages are included by the thermofield dynamics approach, in line with the thermal Hamiltonian developed in Paper I. The m-NN potentials, modeled according to the regularized diabatic states representation, permit an accurate representation of the vibronic coupling Hamiltonian beyond a linear vibronic coupling model. The initial excited-state dynamics is determined by the approach to a curved conical intersection seam, followed by a strongly dissipative phase leading to equilibration in the adiabatic ground state. The characteristic inertial time scale of the environment impacts not only the time of approach to the conical intersection seam but also the isomerization yield. The present study makes first steps toward extending the m-NN approach to a treatment of collective environmental non-equilibrium evolution on par with intramolecular excited-state nonadiabatic dynamics.},

Here, we show how neural network (NN) potentials can be adapted to a combination of intramolecular coordinates and collective environmental modes. Specifically, we use multiplicative NN (m-NN) potentials, which are fitted to a diabatic representation of regularized diabatic states type. These potentials are readily combined with multiconfigurational wave functions for high-dimensional quantum dynamics. The thermofield dynamics (TFD) approach is employed to include thermal averaging at the wave function level, and we formulate a thermal NN/TFD Hamiltonian that accommodates initial vibronic correlations and collective/residual-mode coupling in the environmental subspace. For a model system describing the isomerization of protonated Schiff bases in solution, the solvent is represented by an overdamped Brownian-oscillator spectral density. In a companion paper [B.

  abstract     = {Understanding the dynamic behavior of polar fluids is essential for modeling complex systems such as electrolytes and biological media. In this work, we develop and apply a stochastic density functional theory (SDFT) framework to describe the polarization dynamics in the Stockmayer fluid, a prototypical model of dipolar liquids consisting of Lennard-Jones particles with embedded point dipoles. Starting from the overdamped Langevin dynamics of dipolar particles, we derive analytical expressions for the intermediate scattering functions and dynamic structure factors of the longitudinal and transverse components of the polarization field, within linearized SDFT. To assess the theory’s validity, we compare its predictions with results from Brownian Dynamics simulations of the Stockmayer fluid. We find that SDFT captures the longitudinal polarization fluctuations accurately, while transverse fluctuations are underestimated due to the neglect of dipolar correlations. By incorporating the Kirkwood factor into a modified SDFT, we recover quantitative agreement for both components across a range of dipole strengths. This study highlights the utility of SDFT as a coarse-grained description of polar fluid dynamics and provides insights into the role of collective effects in polarization relaxation.},

  abstract     = {Dimensionality reduction represents a crucial step in extracting meaningful insights from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Conventional approaches, including linear methods such as principal component analysis as well as various autoencoder architectures, typically operate under the assumption of independent and identically distributed data, disregarding the sequential nature of MD simulations. Here, we introduce a physics-informed representation learning framework that leverages Gaussian processes combined with variational autoencoders to exploit the temporal dependencies inherent in MD data. Time-dependent kernel functions—such as the Matérn kernel—directly impose the temporal correlation structure of the input coordinates onto a low-dimensional space, preserving Markovianity in the reduced representation while faithfully capturing the essential dynamics. Using a three-dimensional toy model, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully identify and separate dynamically distinct states that are geometrically indistinguishable due to hidden degrees of freedom. Applying the framework to a 50 μ s-long MD trajectory of T4 lysozyme, we uncover dynamically distinct conformational substates that previous analyses failed to resolve, revealing functional relationships that become apparent only when temporal correlations are taken into account. This time-aware perspective provides a promising framework for understanding complex biomolecular systems, in which conventional collective variables fail to capture the full dynamical picture.},

  abstract     = {We present an efficient approach to simulate real-time quantum dynamics using projected variational quantum dynamics, where the computational cost is reduced by strategically optimizing only a subset of the variational parameters at each time step. Typically, the variational Ansatz consists of repeated blocks of parameterized quantum circuits, where all parameters are updated in a standard optimization procedure. In contrast, our method selectively optimizes one block at a time while keeping the others fixed, allowing for significant reductions in computational overhead. This semi-global optimization strategy ensures that all qubits are still involved in the evolution, but the optimization is localized to specific blocks, thus avoiding the need to update all parameters simultaneously. We propose different approaches for choosing the next block for optimization, including sequential, random, and fidelity-based updation. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods in a series of spin-lattice models with varying sizes and complexity. Our method preserves the accuracy of the time evolution with a much lower computational cost. This new optimization strategy provides a promising path toward high-fidelity simulation of the time evolution of complex quantum systems with reduced computational resources.},

  abstract     = {Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) has emerged as a groundbreaking advancement in the field of photoluminescence behavior. A thorough understanding of the AIE mechanism is essential for the rational design of innovative molecules exhibiting these exceptional properties. In this study, we report a quantum mechanical (QM) investigation through spin-flip time dependent density functional theory (SF-TDDFT) using optimally tuned range-separated hybrid (OT-RSH) functional to explore the cause of fluorescence quenching of the ethylene derivatives such as TPE-9CB, TPE-3CB, and tetraphenylethene-triphenylamine in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution. The fluorescence enhancement in the crystalline state of an ethylene derivative TPE-9CB is studied by adopting a QM:MM based approach using the SF-TDDFT method and RSH functional. It is observed that the OT-RSH functional delivers impressive results regarding photophysical properties. The twisting of the central C=C bond has been identified as the phenomenon that quenches the photoexcited state of the ethylene derivatives in THF solution. Notably, the minimum-gap point (MGP) along the α-torsional coordinate of the S 1 state in solution lies ∼0.1 eV below the Frank–Condon (FC) point for all the derivatives. Interestingly, all examined monomers exhibited nearly zero oscillator strength ( f values) near the point of minimum-gap, indicating minimal radiative transitions in the solution state. Conversely, the excited state deactivation channels, which involve the twisting of the central C=C bond in the solution phase, are effectively restricted in the solid state by steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion from the neighboring molecules. In the solid state, the MGP is 0.48 eV above the FC point, demanding high energy to prevent photoinduced rotary relaxation. This effectively blocks nonradiative deactivation pathways, resulting in a significant enhancement of the emission response. Our findings underscore the potential of AIE phenomena in advancing material design and applications.},

We propose a numerical framework for learning collective variables that respect translational, rotational, and permutational symmetries and for estimating transition rates and residence times. It combines a sort-based featurization, residence manifold learning in the feature space, and learning of collective variables with autoencoders whose loss function utilizes the orthogonality relationship [F. Legoll and T. Lelievre, Nonlinearity 23 , 2131–2163 (2010)]. The committor of the resulting reduced model is used as the reaction coordinate in the forward flux sampling and to design a control for sampling the transition path process. We offer two case studies, the Lennard-Jones-7 in 2D and the Lennard-Jones-8 in 3D. The transition rates and residence times computed with the aid of the reduced models agree with those obtained via brute-force methods.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the conformal Killing vector fields in Newtonian gauge space-time and analyze their properties in detail. We focus particularly on the structure of the associated conformal factors and examine several nontrivial special cases. By utilizing the symmetries of affine geometry, we construct an affine connection on the Newtonian gauge space-time without imposing common geometric constraints such as flatness, metric compatibility, or torsion-freeness. From this general connection, we derive a statistical connection, thereby establishing a statistical structure on the Newtonian gauge. Within this framework, we analyze the conformal symmetry of the tensor field K , defined as the difference between the statistical connection and the Levi–Cività connection. Moreover, we characterize the conditions under which a conformal Killing vector field on the underlying manifold also serves as a statistical conformal Killing vector field in the induced statistical geometry.},

First, we derive the infinite RCS model from the kinetic RCS model with non-compact support through the particle-in-cell method, and then we show that the diameter and radius of the velocity variable in the RCS model are non-increasing. Next, we construct a system of dissipative differential inequalities via the finite truncation of the proposed infinite RCS model. This overcomes the difficulty brought by the inaccessibility of infinite norms, which enables us to analyze the solution’s flocking behaviors. Finally, we establish the model’s classical limit and derive the optimal convergence rate in terms of the speed of light, which is the same as a finite-time classical limit.},

By analyzing the complexity function with given radial derivative and energy, we derive the convergence of the Hessian spectrum from the vanishing mean number of critical points. For the 1-RSB model, the ground state energy was explicitly computed in Huang and Sellke [arXiv:2311.15495 (2023)]. Combined with the complexity function of local maxima with given radial derivative obtained in Belius and Schmidt [arXiv:2207.14361 (2022)], this allows us to obtain the corresponding results more directly.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the geometric structure of a quasigeostrophic approximation to a recently introduced reduced-gravity thermal rotating shallow-water model that accounts for stratification. Specifically, it considers a low-frequency approximation of a model for flow above the ocean thermocline, governed by primitive equations with buoyancy variations in both horizontal and vertical directions. Like the thermal model, the stratified variant generates circulation patterns reminiscent of submesoscale instabilities visible in satellite images. An improvement is its ability to model mixed-layer restratification due to baroclinic instability. The primary contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that the model is derived from an Euler–Poincaré variational principle, culminating in a Kelvin–Noether theorem, previously established solely for the primitive-equation parent model. The model’s Lie–Poisson Hamiltonian structure, earlier obtained through direct calculation, is shown to result from a Legendre transform with the associated geometry elucidated by identifying the relevant momentum map. Another significant contribution of this paper is the identification of the Casimirs of the Lie–Poisson system, including a newly found weaker Casimir family forming the kernel of the Lie–Poisson bracket, which results in potential vorticity evolution independent of buoyancy details as it advects under the flow. These conservation laws related to particle relabeling symmetry are explicitly linked to Noether quantities from the Euler–Poincaré principle when variations are not constrained to vanish at integration endpoints. The dual Euler–Poincaré/Lie–Poisson formalism provides a unified framework for describing quasigeostrophic reduced-gravity stratified thermal flow, mirroring the approach used in the primitive-equation setting.},

In this paper, we first prove the corresponding dynamical system is a gradient system. By the abstract results about the existence of global attractor, we will establish a quasi-stability inequality by using the global L r -regularity ( r ≥ 2) in time of the nonlocal Balakrishnan-Taylor term under some suitable assumptions on the nonlinear damping term, which is sufficient to show the existence of a finite dimensional global attractor for such system.},

Despite its simplicity, it exhibits remarkably rich dynamical behavior, including the interplay between regular and chaotic orbital dynamics, resonances, and stochastic regions in phase space, which have inspired extensive research in nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we investigate the system’s solutions at small energy levels, deriving asymptotic constants of motion that remain valid over remarkably long timescales—far exceeding the range of validity of conventional perturbation techniques. Our approach leverages the system’s inherent two-scale dynamics, employing a novel analytical framework to uncover these long-lived invariants. The derived formulas exhibit excellent agreement with numerical simulations, providing a deeper understanding of the system’s long-term behavior.},

The problem of the optimal estimations for the sums of the first m eigenvalues of Sturm–Liouville operators can be transformed into the solvability of critical systems. Based on this relation, for p = 2 we can theoretically obtain the optimal potential from the integrability theory of Hamiltonian systems point of view.

These equations have certain applications in quantum control. By the Pontryagin maximum principle, we consider the explicit optimal control functions on the Lie algebra of S ( U (1) × U (1, 1)). Together with two-stage Gauss–Legendre approach and Newton iterative method, we study the numerical solutions of nonlinear and non-autonomous first-order differential equations. We conduct numerical experiments to verify our results. The global error analysis indicates that this method is effective and practical.},

In these applications, the tensor powers of the defining representation seem particularly important. The representation theory of these tensor powers is understood in two regimes. 1. For odd qudits in the case where the power t is not larger than the number of systems n : Here, a duality theory between the Clifford group and certain discrete orthogonal groups can be used to make fairly explicit statements about the occurring irreps (this theory is related to Howe duality and the η -correspondence ). 2. For qubits: Tensor powers up to t = 4 have been analyzed on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we provide a unified framework for the duality approach that also covers qubit systems. To this end, we translate the notion of rank of symplectic representations to representations of the qubit Clifford group, and generalize the η correspondence between symplectic and orthogonal groups to a correspondence between the Clifford and certain orthogonal-stochastic groups. As a sample application, we provide a protocol to efficiently implement the complex conjugate of a black-box Clifford unitary evolution.},

In the quantum information community, it is commonly believed that SIC-POVMs exist in all dimensions; however, the general proof of their existence is still an open problem. By mapping SIC-POVMs onto the generalized Bloch sphere, we prove two geometric existence statements associated with the SIC-POVM existence problem. First, we prove the Knaster’s conjecture for n vertices of an n -simplex and use that to prove the existence of a continuous family of general SIC-POVMs where the trace of the k th power of the operators is the same for ( n 2 − 1) of the elements. Furthermore, by using numerical methods, we show that in dimensions 3 and 4, a regular simplex can be constructed on the Bloch sphere such that all its vertices correspond to density matrices having the same trace of ρ 3 . In the three-dimensional Hilbert space, we generate 10 4 general SIC-POVMs for where all the elements have the same set of randomly chosen eigenvalues, indicating the continuous set of general SIC-POVMs can be constructed for all possible values of trace of ρ 3 .},

Under the condition that the embedded eigenvalue of the unperturbed operator lies away from the thresholds of the continuous spectrum, we show that the set of nearby potentials for which the embedded eigenvalue persists forms a smooth manifold of finite and even codimension. The proof employs tools from Floquet theory, exponential dichotomies, and Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction.

We establish the validity of this result for block-diagonalizable operators, i.e., those which have a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of generalized eigenvectors that form a Jordan Reisz basis of H ⁠ . This allows us to generalize the original proof of the equivalence of pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized P T -symmetry for diagonalizable operators to block-diagonalizable operators.

Here, we observe that mutually commuting, long-range interactions satisfy an enhanced LRB of the form t r − α for any α > 0, and this scaling is sharp. In particular, the linear light cone occurs at α = 1 in any dimension. Part of our motivation stems from quantum error-correcting codes. As applications, we derive enhanced bounds on ground state correlations and an enhanced local perturbations perturb locally principle for which we adapt a recent subharmonicity argument of Wang-Hazzard. Similar enhancements hold for commuting interactions with stretched exponential decay.},

This yields an explicit basis of the complete 27 ⊗ 27 color space (defined as the space of 27 ⊗ 27 → 27 ⊗ 27 color maps) in terms of orthogonal multiplets. This study shows that even complex color structures can be addressed, with the help of the birdtrack pictorial technique, using only elementary tools. In particular, we highlight the usefulness of the quadratic Casimir operator, whose eigenspaces allow efficient filtering of all projectors and transition operators, and of the permutation operators that further improve this filtering. The product 27 ⊗ 27 also has an interesting feature: three equivalent irreps 27 appear in the decomposition, two of which are symmetric and can therefore be distinguished neither by the quadratic Casimir operator nor by their symmetry under permutation. In this case, it is convenient to use Clebsch–Gordan coefficients to derive the two associated, symmetric projectors. The latter are not uniquely determined (only their sum is), and we give the set of all solutions. Finally, we explicitly derive the soft anomalous dimension matrix associated with 27 ⊗ 27 → 27 ⊗ 27 , whose block-diagonal main structure is easy to understand, but whose detailed spectrum properties remain intriguing. The approach presented for 27 ⊗ 27 → 27 ⊗ 27 could in principle be applied to any product of SU( N ) irreps, and eventually automated.},

For the delta shock wave, the generalized Rankine-Hugoniot relation and entropy condition are clarified. Under the impact of the friction term, the rarefaction waves and shock waves as well as delta shock wave are bent into parabolic curves.

  abstract     = {Whether smooth solutions of partially dissipative 2D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations develop singularities in finite time has been a long-standing open problem. Since the pioneering work by Cao and Wu [Adv. Math. 226 , 1803–1822 (2011)], such problem has garnered much more attention. When the magnetic field is close to an equilibrium state, the study of stability and large-time behavior provides a significant example of the stabilizing effects of the magnetic field on electrically conducting fluids. In this paper, we consider the global well-posedness for 2D partially dissipation MHD equations around a uniform magnetic field in R + 2 with no-slip boundary condition. An efficient Stokes estimate is developed, which can be used to obtain the global low order ( H 2 ) energy for the partially dissipative MHD system with physical boundary. In addition, we obtain an explicit decay rate for the linear system using spectral analysis methods. We also observe that the half-space shares some similarities with the Cauchy problem, but exhibits some differences, especially when considering spatial derivatives.},

Specifically, we consider the equation −Δ u = h ( x ) f ( u ) − c , where h is a real-valued function defined on the vertex set V , c ∈ R and f satisfies the asymptotic condition f ( t ) e t → 1 as t → ± ∞ . Different from the above studies, the main difficulty in this paper is to show that the Kazdan–Warner type equation has only three constant solutions, based on delicate analysis and the connectivity of graphs, which have not been extensively explored in previous literature.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss lattice energy minimization problems for various interacting potentials, including Born-Mayer, Coulomb, Lennard-Jones, and Rydberg potentials. The main methods and techniques used in this paper are derived from Bétermin, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 48 , 3236–3269 (2016). Based on this, we derive a more comprehensive attractive-repulsive model that can be understood in the sense of exponential decay. Our research leads to a new lower bound for the inverse density of the triangular lattice when the Lennard-Jones potential with exponential decay is minimal, which is a significant improvement over previous results. More specifically, in Bétermin, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 48 , 3236–3269 (2016), the degree of the lowest order term of the Lennard-Jones potential is to satisfy x 1 > 3/2, but our result covers the interval (1, 3/2], making it the optimal case with a lower bound of 1. We extend the results for Morse potential to derive the optimal attractive-repulsive correlation coefficient conditions, i.e., ln( b 2 : b 1 ) ≥ 2.3853 and ln( b 2 : b 1 ) ≥ 7.3069. Also, our findings provide the first-ever inverse density bound when the triangular lattice is optimal for the Coulomb and Rydberg potentials, while the former gives global optimality without density constraints, and the latter gives upper and lower bounds on the density interval for optimality. Finally, we present numerical estimates of the inverse density, and these findings have critical applications in improving numerical simulations of radiation defects in crystals, especially in the α -iron lattice, and better understanding the properties of rare gases. Our solutions and improved estimates will enable researchers to better understand lattice energy minimization.},

Specifically, we investigate the L 2 ( R ) -spectrum of the associated linearized operator, which in this case is an integro-differential operator with periodic coefficients, in a neighborhood of the origin in the spectral plane. Our analysis shows that such small-amplitude periodic solutions are spectrally unstable to long-wavelength perturbations if the wave number is greater than a critical value, bearing out the famous Benmajin-Feir instability for the Novikov equation. On the other hand, such waves with wave number less than the critical value are shown to be spectrally stable. Our methods are based on applying spectral perturbation theory to the associated linearization.},

The problem of the spectral stability of smooth periodic waves in the DGH equation is discussed. Within the functional-analytic framework, we obtain a criterion for the spectral stability of smooth periodic traveling waves in DGH equation.
