  abstract     = {Cardiac muscle contraction is driven by the cross-bridge cycle, where myosin heads generate force by cyclically attaching to and pulling on actin filaments using energy from ATP. Modeling this process is central to understanding cardiac sarcomere mechanics. In this study, we developed supervised machine learning (ML) models using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to simulate cross-bridge cycling and muscle behavior under isosarcometric, isometric, and isotonic conditions. Trained on synthetic data, the ANN captured nonlinear dependencies among calcium concentration, stiffness, sarcomere length, temperature, and force output. Error analysis through histograms and unity-line scatterplots validated prediction accuracy and identified underfitting and overfitting patterns. Comparisons across ANN architectures showed how hidden layer complexity affects model generalization. The present deep learning models accurately reproduced key physiological behaviors, including steady-state force–Ca 2+ relations, sarcomere length changes, and force–velocity relations, and matched theoretical results. This work demonstrates the potential of ML tools to enhance cardiac muscle modeling and exploit existing experimental datasets for improved prediction of cardiac muscle diseases.},

  abstract     = {Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) possess size/shape/surface-tunable optical and electronic properties, making them promising building blocks for optoelectronic applications. However, the fluorescence intermittency, also known as “blinking,” observed in individual QDs is a pervasive phenomenon. The dark state (trion state) in blinking experiences non-radiative recombination processes, such as trap-mediated recombination and Auger–Meitner recombination, which significantly diminish the quantum efficiency of the QDs. Despite efforts to mitigate blinking phenomena through chemical engineering of QDs structures and their environments, blinking continues to impede the application of single QDs, particularly in single photon sources. This study demonstrates that Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from green QDs (donor) to individual red QDs (acceptor) can effectively suppress fluorescence intermittency. The findings indicate that FRET facilitates the removal of excess charges from the charged state (dark state, trion state), allowing the QDs to transition from the lower quantum yield trion state to the higher quantum yield single-exciton state (bright state). Our research confirms that FRET can inhibit fluorescence intermittency by deactivating the charged state.},

In this study, we examine a two-mode cavity optomechanical system ( ⁠ J a ̂ † a ̂ † b + J a ̂ a ̂ b ̂ † ⁠ ) and a two-photon parametric drive ε p ( a ̂ † a ̂ † + a ̂ a ̂ ) ⁠ . When the detunings significantly exceed the dissipation rates of the cavity ( ⁠ | Δ a | , | Δ b | ≫ κ ⁠ ), the optimal condition for PB becomes independent of the coupling strength. This implies that photon antibunching effects can occur in both strong and weak regimes ( ⁠ J > κ and J < κ ⁠ ), even when J ∼ κ ⁠ , and we could achieve PB solely through the adjustment of detunings. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to the conversion between single photon and three photons ( ⁠ J a ̂ † 3 b + J a ̂ 3 b ̂ † ⁠ ) with a three-photon parametric drive ε p ( a ̂ † 3 + a ̂ 3 ) and arrive at nearly identical conclusions.

Here, we present the development of a high-frequency balanced photodetector with near-unity quantum efficiency, realized with off-the-shelf components. The detector operates in balanced mode up to approximately 500 MHz, above which the differential frequency response limits its performance. To obtain high sensitivity above 500 MHz, the detector can be efficiently used in an unbalanced homodyne detection scheme. We employ our detector in this unbalanced mode to measure a squeezing comb up to 6.4 GHz, achieving a squeezing level of up to 10.7 dB. By sharing our experience, specifically in identifying the unequal frequency response as a limiting factor, we aim to enable and advance further developments in the field.},

  abstract     = {AgBiS 2 , a typical I–V–VI 2 compound, has attracted widespread attention in the thermoelectric community due to its inherently ultra-low-thermal conductivity. However, its practical applications are limited by inferior electrical transport properties. Herein, we systematically investigate the origin of its low lattice thermal conductivity and propose effective strategies to enhance its thermoelectric performance. Theoretical calculations reveal that the intrinsic ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity of AgBiS 2 arises from multiple phonon transport features, including low-lying optical branches, rattler-like local vibration, and low phonon group velocity. Combining theoretical and experimental analyses, it is found that cation disorder suppresses cation doping effects, whereas anion doping, especially with Cl doping, is more effective in optimizing electrical performance. Furthermore, introducing additional Cu, unaffected by cation disorder, not only generates extra electrons to optimize electrical transport but also reduces thermal conductivity. Notably, Cu-doped sample achieves a significantly improved power factor of ∼3.64 μ W cm −1 K −2 at 823 K, with a maximum ZT of ∼0.53, a ∼22% enhancement compared to the pristine AgBiS 2 . This study not only uncovers the ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity mechanisms but also validates synergistic strategies to optimize thermoelectric properties, positioning AgBiS 2 -based materials as promising candidates for thermoelectrics.},

By adjusting the phase relationship between the pistons from leading to lagging, the prototype overcomes the limitation of compressor performance imposed by temperature, enabling a heating supply temperature exceeding 200 °C. Meanwhile, benefiting from the inherent configuration of the double-acting design, the four-cylinder arrangement further enhances the system's power density, thereby improving its suitability for industrial heating applications. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves a substantial temperature lift from 25 to 166 °C, and within a temperature difference of 74 °C (from 45 to 119 °C), it attains a maximum coefficient of performance (COP) of 1.68. When the ambient temperature rises to 67 °C, the system delivers a heating supply temperature of 214 °C, with the corresponding COP and relative Carnot efficiency reaching 1.5% and 45.2%, respectively. These findings verify the potential of this system for high-temperature heat pump applications and highlight its advantages under extreme operating conditions. This work thus provides a solution for industrial high-temperature heat pumps, offering unique benefits in achieving large temperature lifts and high-temperature heating.},

The optimal concentration of Hf doping atoms was obtained by controlling the power of dual targets InZnO and HfO 2 and comparing their performances with those of HfInZnO TFTs that were fabricated from a single target, thus achieving high-performance and highly stable HfInZnO TFTs. After optimization, high-performance HfInZnO (P IZO 70W-P HfO2 50W) TFTs with μ FE value of 26.1 cm 2 /V s, SS value of 0.251 V/dec., and V th value of 0.7 V were obtained. The results of experimental characterization indicate that co-sputtering with Hf doping reduced the oxygen vacancies, surface defects, and other trap densities of the device. Moreover, the co-sputtering prepared HfInZnO TFT exhibited the highest stability for small V th shifts of 0.8 (−0.9) and 1.2 (−1.6) V under the gate bias and light illumination stress tests. Furthermore, low-frequency noise measurements demonstrated that the optimal Hf doping concentration in the HfInZnO films was controlled by the dual-target co-sputtering method, resulting in a lower number of oxygen vacancies and a lower interface trap density of the devices, thus enhancing the stability of HfInZnO TFTs.

  abstract     = {The performance of perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) has advanced rapidly; however, the development of suitable hole transport layers (HTLs) for PeLEDs remains a critical challenge. This study introduces a multifunctional HTL of poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-(4,4′-(N-(4-[2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy]phenyl)diphenylamine))] (TFTEG), which features a backbone similar to that of the commercial hole transport material poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-(4,4′-(N-(4-sec-butylphenyl)diphenylamine))] (TFB), while its side chain is modified to include multiple ether groups. Theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations demonstrate that TFTEG not only significantly enhances hole injection but also effectively passivates uncoordinated Pb 2+ defects at the buried interface through Lewis acid–base interactions. This substantially improves the photoluminescence and electroluminescence (EL) quantum yields of perovskite quantum dots (QDs). Pure-red quantum-dot PeLEDs that employ TFTEG as the HTL achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 9.67%, which signifies a substantial enhancement over the 4.56% efficiency observed in control devices utilizing the commercial TFB HTL. Furthermore, TFTEG contributes to a reduced turn-on voltage, enhanced brightness (1741 vs 888 cd m −2 ), and a stable EL spectrum peaking at 650 nm.

  abstract     = {Integrating sensing and neuromorphic functions within a single low-power platform remains a key challenge in optoelectronic device design. We report a dual-modal perovskite photodetector by incorporating YbCl 3 as a dopant, which simultaneously achieves neuromorphic behavior and conventional optoelectronic properties. Systematic characterizations of doping manipulation reveal that 0.5% YbCl 3 can optimally modulate film crystallinity, enhance carrier transport, and tune charge dynamics. Notably, the 0.5% doped device exhibited distinct wavelength-dependent photoresponse, and hallmarks of depression-like neuromorphic behavior are were observed under pulsed 905 nm light excitation. This behavior is clearly supported by negative photoconductivity, gradual baseline modulation, and a prolonged post-illumination tail. However, these adaptive current dynamics are absent under 635 nm light illumination; the device instead demonstrated enhanced photoresponse, with responsivity increasing from 0.45 to 0.73 A/W and detectivity from 1.4 × 10 12 to 5.1 × 10 12 Jones. This spectral contrast originates from the wavelength-dependent activation of Yb 3+ -related trap states, confirmed by photoluminance measurements. These findings position YbCl 3 doping as a versatile strategy for advancing perovskite photodetectors toward dual-modal photodetection, with ongoing studies exploring broader applicability.},

  abstract     = {Topological quantum materials featuring multifold band crossings have opened unprecedented pathways in the exploration of exotic matter phases. These multifold crossings with three-, six-, and eightfold degeneracies hold exceptional significance, as they are ruled out in high-energy frameworks by Poincaré symmetry, making their realization in solids highly nontrivial. Notably, the coexistence of higher-fold fermionic (eightfold) and bosonic (sixfold) degeneracies in a single material is scarcely observed in literature. In this regard, we conducted a detailed investigation into the symmetry-protected topological characteristics of experimentally synthesized A15-type M 3 Sn (M = V, Nb) compounds using first-principles calculations. Our scrutiny unveils sixfold degeneracies in M 3 Sn compounds, which corresponds to the maximum allowed in bosonic systems along with threefold nodal points, while an eightfold and fourfold fermionic degeneracy are identified in V 3 Sn compound at the R- high-symmetry point protected by nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetry. The phonon and electronic surface states calculated from a tight-binding model further validate the multifold degeneracies and also represent complementary Dirac surface states at the Γ -point. The phononic Weyl nodal line along the Γ – R path exhibits nontrivial topology with ±π Berry phase. The synthesized compounds have been confirmed to theoretically exhibit both dynamic and thermal stabilities. Our findings offer a promising platform to explore exotic excitations within a single material, paving the way for deeper insights into complex quasiparticle behavior in these potential superconductors.},

By combining spectral heat current decomposition and spectral energy density analysis, we identify high-frequency optical phonons within 10–15 THz as the dominant heat carriers across interfaces—a selectivity arising from interfacial hydrogen termination that strengthens the coupling of these modes. Their lifetimes and coupling strengths are highly sensitive to structural configuration and mechanical modulation. Our results reveal that parallel stacking, increased pressure, and stronger interlayer coupling significantly enhance thermal conductivity by stabilizing optical modes and suppressing phonon scattering. In contrast, increasing the twist angle introduces structural incommensurability, which reduces phonon lifetimes and leads to substantial suppression of thermal transport. These findings underscore the pivotal role of optical phonons in governing interfacial thermal transport as well as establish an optimal strategy for engineering thermal conductivity in 2D vdW materials.},

We show that Be 1− x Mg x O alloys maintain structural stability in the wurtzite phase up to x = 0.83 and exhibit an ultrawide bandgap over 6.2 eV across all compositions, which provides high intrinsic breakdown fields (12–71 MV/cm).

Our results show that the incorporation of CeO 2 into BaTiO 3 matrix induces chemical and structural heterogeneity, which effectively suppresses hysteresis, achieving a large energy storage density U e of ∼37.6 J/cm 3 and a high efficiency η of ∼80% for 0.7BT-0.3C films grown on Nb-SrTiO 3 (001) substrates.

  abstract     = {Among magnetic thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), L 1 0 -ordered FePt has attracted significant attention because of its exceptionally strong PMA. However, the microscopic origin of its strong PMA has not been elucidated experimentally. We have investigated the contribution of the Fe 3 d electrons to its magnetic anisotropy energy by angle-dependent x-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Fe L 2 , 3 edge. By this technique, one can deduce the magnetic dipole moment m T ⁠ , which represents the anisotropic spatial distribution of spin-polarized electrons, and the orbital moment anisotropy (OMA) of Fe 3 d electrons. Detected finite m T indicates that the spin-polarized Fe 3 d electrons are distributed preferentially in the out-of-plane direction of the films. This m T of Fe overwhelms the positive contribution of OMA to PMA and reduces the PMA of L 1 0 -ordered FePt thin films, consistent with a previous first-principles calculation. The present result implies that a large positive contribution of the non-magnetic element Pt rather than Fe governs the PMA of L 1 0 -ordered FePt thin films.},

Recently, fully compensated ferrimagnet of 2D zero-net-magnetization magnets has already attracted attention, as it can exhibit global spin-splitting, magneto-optical response, and the anomalous Hall effect [Liu et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 134 , 116703 (2025)]. Therefore, it is very important to provide experimentally feasible strategies and materials to achieve fully compensated ferrimagnets. Here, we use the experimentally synthesized A-type PT -antiferromagnet [the joint symmetry ( PT ) of space inversion symmetry ( P ) and time-reversal symmetry ( T )] MnSe as the parent material to induce fully compensated ferrimagnetism through an out-of-plane electric field. This electric field can remove the P symmetry of the lattice, thereby breaking the PT symmetry and inducing spin-splitting. When considering spin–orbital coupling, MnSe with an out-of-plane magnetization can achieve the anomalous valley Hall effect. In addition, we also discuss inducing fully compensated ferromagnetism via Se vacancies and Janus engineering. Our works can promote the further development of 2D fully compensated ferrimagnets both theoretically and experimentally.},

Despite its known effects, the role of 4f-electron lanthanide oxides in influencing interfacial phenomena has remained largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the potential of f-electron lanthanide oxides, particularly at the Pt/DyO x interface, to enhance SOT. The gradient oxidation structure of the 4f-electron rare-earth oxide DyO x was confirmed through ultra-high-precision line scanning electron energy loss spectroscopy. By employing spin–torque ferromagnetic resonance, we achieve an extraordinary SOT efficiency of ξ FMR = 0.758 in the Pt/DyO x heterojunction, exceeding that of pure Pt by more than a factor of ten. This enhancement reduces the critical current density required for magnetization switching to 2.25–3.48 × 10 6 A·cm −2 , which is only 15% of the current density needed for pure Pt. Beyond improving SOT efficiency, the integration of 4f rare-earth oxides at the interface provides an advanced technical pathway for developing CMOS-compatible and energy-efficient spintronic technologies.},

  abstract     = {Nanoelectromechanical systems based on (Al,Ga)As/GaAs heterostructures with a two-dimensional electron gas can rely on both piezoelectric and electrostatic driving and detection. While this multifunctionality may be beneficial, disentanglement of these two physical mechanisms is important. In a multi-mode nanoelectromechanical system, we experimentally discern the electrostatic and piezoelectric effects in various configurations. A well-controlled system relying entirely on the electrostatic effect is demonstrated, where a field-effect transistor reads out the oscillations of its cantilevered side gate. We show that, apart from the two mentioned mechanisms, an additional time-delayed driving force arises due to the generation of bulk acoustic waves in the entire chip.},

An expression is obtained for the SAW gain G as a function of the frequency and intensity of microwaves, the electron drift velocity, and the parameters of the considered graphene/piezoelectric substrate hybrid structure. Our calculations show that in the presence of microwave radiation incident normally on the graphene layer and polarized along the direction of SAW propagation, the SAW gain G , measured in units of dB/cm, can be several times greater than in the presence of only an applied dc electric field causing electron drift. The results obtained indicate an effective way to improve the performance of ultra-compact graphene-based SAW amplifiers.},

  abstract     = {Group II–VI semiconductors, renowned for their direct band gaps, high carrier mobilities, and mature synthesis, are essential in optoelectronic applications. While scaling down to the two-dimensional (2D) limit could unlock enhanced and distinct functionalities, realizing stable intrinsic 2D phases remains challenging due to their nonlayered bulk structures, strong interlayer covalency, and high ionicity. Here, using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that II–VI compounds adopt stable 2D configurations distinct from both graphene-like sheets and bulk fragments. The most stable phases identified include tetragonal–triangle, double-layer honeycomb, planar honeycomb, and a non-conventional bilayer. Despite being isoelectronic, these compounds exhibit markedly different energetic landscapes. We propose that this diversity originates from a dual competing mechanism: the geometric stability imparted by favorable building blocks vs the long-range Coulomb interactions. Several predicted structures exhibit excellent electronic properties, with computed mobilities exceeding 29 000 cm 2 V −1 s −1 in CdS, highlighting their potential for nanoelectronic applications. Our findings provide both a structural design rule and a set of experimentally accessible targets, offering a pathway toward integrating II–VI semiconductors into the 2D material landscape.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen vacancies (V O ) are intrinsic defects in β -Ga 2 O 3 that significantly impact its device performance. These vacancies can donate electrons to the conduction band, leading to unintentional n-type conductivity in as-grown β -Ga 2 O 3 . In addition, V O associated localized states can act as electron traps, scatter free carriers, and consequently degrade carrier mobility and overall device performance. Therefore, removing V O is crucial for improving material properties, promoting the development of p-type β -Ga 2 O 3 and optimizing device performance. Currently, traditional methods for V O treatment, such as oxygen plasma treatment and thermal annealing, are effective but have high energy consumption, which is detrimental to carbon neutrality goals. This study presents a method for enhancing the removal of V O via hydrogen doping. β -Ga 2 O 3 thin films were grown under low-oxygen conditions using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition, followed by hydrogen pre-annealing. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cathodoluminescence characterizations of films treated under different annealing conditions confirmed the effectiveness of hydrogen doping in promoting V O elimination. Furthermore, ultraviolet photodetectors were fabricated using these films, and the analysis of their dark-state decay times provided additional evidence for reduced V O concentrations. Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory using a revised PBE functional and the climbing image nudged elastic band method reveal that hydrogen incorporation induces charge redistribution, facilitating VO migration, thus enhancing defect control.},

In this work, the surface and bulk states in CsPbBr 3 single crystals were investigated by polarization-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements. Onefold anisotropy of SHG intensity indicates that the polycrystalline Cs 4 PbBr 6 and CsPb 2 Br 5 phases dominate the surface, which exhibits C s symmetry. Moreover, an unpolarized and strong luminescence was observed induced by two-photon absorption, which displays a twofold symmetry. Br vacancies within the bulk were identified as the radiative recombination centers according to their energy level position.

Notably, piezoresponse force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy characterizations demonstrate stabilized polarization with a low decay exponent of 0.014.

However, challenges including imbalanced charge injection and defect-related nonradiative recombination at the interface, particularly at the hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite interface, hinder the development of efficient PeLEDs. This investigation systematically evaluates the effect of various dipolar molecules on the HTL/perovskite interface, aiming to enhance the efficiency of blue PeLEDs. The results indicate that the hole injection barrier of devices modified with diethyl difluoromethanephosphonate (DFMP) was significantly reduced due to the high polarity of DFMP, which maintains a balanced hole–electron mobility. Furthermore, the electron-rich P=O bond in DFMP effectively coordinates with the unsaturated Pb 2+ at the buried interface to passivate defects that contribute to radiative recombination. As a result, the DFMP-modified PeLEDs achieve a peak external quantum efficiency of 9.8% at 480 nm and a prolonged operational lifetime. The study paves the way for interfacial molecular buffer layers to interface modulation in quasi-2D PeLEDs.},

  abstract     = {The use of periodic materials for wave control and signal processing has been a focus of intensive research over the past two decades and continues to garner significant attention. Common signal processing mechanisms like switches and rectifiers often depend on magnetic fields and/or logic gates for their activation. We propose a metamaterial that enables the control of mechanical waves—surface acoustic waves—through an ON–OFF mechanism that switches the propagation of the waves through a tunable platform of elastic beams. In the OFF configuration, the beams remain in their undeformed state and resonate at a specific frequency range, creating a bandgap that stops wave propagation. Conversely, in the ON configuration, the beams undergo buckling, redistributing the vibration energy across multiple modes and eliminating the bandgap, thus allowing wave propagation. Analytical and numerical findings demonstrate the significant potential of this mechanism for controlling wave propagation in nonlinear periodic materials.

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals metal–semiconductor junctions (MSJs) with low-resistance contacts have great potential for designing high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, due to the quantum confinement effect, 2D metals exhibit layer-dependent conductivity that inevitably influences the contact properties of 2D MSJs, the underlying mechanism behind this effect is unclear. Herein, taking multilayer graphene and MoS 2 as examples, we systematically studied the effect of 2D metal layer number on the MSJs by non-equilibrium Green's function and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics methods. Compared with the trilayer-graphene/MoS 2 (Gr/MoS 2 ) MSJ (5.0 × 10 4 KΩ µm), the contact resistance of the monolayer-Gr/MoS 2 MSJ (7.6 × 10 3 KΩ µm) is reduced by one order of magnitude. Under a 0.6 V bias voltage, the reduced contact resistance results in the current increasing from 0.1 to 60 nA. The superior transport performance of monolayer-Gr/MoS 2 MSJ derives from the reduction in the Schottky barrier of the MSJ as the number of graphene layers decreases, whereas the tunneling barrier remains nearly constant. Meanwhile, monolayer-Gr/MoS 2 MSJ exhibits high photogenerated carrier gain, which is attributed to the ultrafast transfer (388 fs) of photogenerated electrons and long carrier lifetime (71 ns), resulting in superior optoelectronic performance. Our study presents a layer-number engineering strategy for optimizing contact properties in 2D MSJs.},

  abstract     = {Silicon crystallizes in the diamond structure with two atoms per unit cell and supports three optical phonon modes. However, due to the centrosymmetric nature of the lattice, these modes do not induce a net dipole moment and are therefore inactive in infrared absorption. Even in polar semiconductors, where optical phonons can be IR-active, conventional techniques such as infrared absorption and Raman spectroscopy are restricted to probing phonons at the Brillouin zone center (Γ-point). In this work, we demonstrate that time- and spectrally resolved pump–probe ellipsometry enables access to the coherent response of electron–phonon coupled states involving both valence and conduction bands. Following two-photon absorption induced by the femtosecond pump pulse, the electronic excitation relaxes and drives the generation of coherent longitudinal optical phonons along the X-direction of the Brillouin zone, followed by optical transitions of entangled electron–phonon states along the Λ-direction. This process results in a transient, strongly correlated electron–phonon state that persists for up to ≈ 300 fs. Within this coherent time window, the silicon crystal exhibits optical resonances at electronic transition energies modulated by quantized phonon contributions. Finally, we detect further sidebands in the ellipsometric spectrum, which are 81 meV apart and assign these to two-phonon-assisted electronic transitions.},

A reconfigurable grating unit based on a Bragg-grating-assisted Mach–Zehnder interferometer (GAMZI) is proposed as a versatile building block for programmable photonics. By integrating identical Bragg gratings into both arms of a thermo-optically tunable MZI, the device enables dynamic spectral reshaping—achieving bandwidth-tunable bandpass filters, phase-shifted gratings, and broadband filters with precise control over extinction ratios and bandwidths. The GAMZI architecture uniquely suppresses back-reflections while maintaining high port scalability, overcoming key limitations of conventional grating designs. Furthermore, a double-triangle recurrent network array using cascaded GAMZI units is demonstrated, enabling advanced functionalities such as ring-grating resonators, sampled gratings, and on-chip coarse wavelength division multiplexing.

  abstract     = {Biosensing plays a crucial role in precision biomarker detection, enabling real-time monitoring and physiological health analysis, particularly in early diagnosis. Traditional biosensing techniques, such as electrochemical, fluorescence, and colorimetric methods, have shown remarkable performance. However, their reliability is often susceptible to nonspecific interference, may produce false-positive results, and is typically limited to the detection of known targets, restricting their applicability in addressing ambiguous or unknown biological problems. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) offers a powerful alternative, combining ultra-high sensitivity and molecular specificity. By supporting both label-free and label-based strategies, SERS broadens the detection scope, making it a promising platform for next-generation biosensing. In this Perspective, we aim at specific problems, introduce why SERS can do biosensing, how to advance SERS-based biosensing, and what SERS can do for early diagnosis. Finally, we discuss strategies to bridge the gap between laboratory research and clinical applications, emphasizing the important role of standardization and artificial intelligence in driving the practical transformation of SERS-based biosensing. Through these advancements, we aim to address existing limitations and further propel the evolution of SERS in biosensing and early diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show that the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool, which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.},

To bridge this gap, we theoretically model and experimentally measure topologically protected disclination states in C 4 , C 5 , and C 7 -symmetric thermal crystalline lattices composed of aluminum disks. The temperature evolution is tied to an effective Hamiltonian hosting topological disclination modes, which have a diffusion rate that is robust against defects. Our findings extend topological disclination phases and the physics of fractional charges from Hermitian to anti-Hermitian systems, opening new avenues for future research in thermal information processing and temperature management processes that are robust against disturbances.},

  abstract     = {Scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM) has recently celebrated 30 years of existence when counting from the original patent of 1994. In this time, the technique has experienced an incredible journey with substantial evolutions that transformed SSRM from a small-scale experiment into a staple for chip manufacturing laboratories for physical analysis of materials, failure analysis, and process development of integrated circuits. As the nanoelectronics industry is ready for a new inflection point, with the introduction of nanosheet field-effect transistor to replace FinFETs and cell track scaling architectures such as the complementary field-effect transistors, SSRM is once again at a turning point. This review aims to highlight the state-of-the-art while discussing the emerging challenges introduced by the ever-increasing complexity in complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing. We start by illustrating the unique capability of the SSRM technique, its origin, and its evolution. Next, we continue by showing the considerable research effort that enabled SSRM to transition to a tomographic sensing method in support of FinFET transistors. Here, the high aspect ratio fin geometry and the complex contacts technology have imposed important modifications to the original method. Later, we elaborate on some of the key challenges introduced by the upcoming device transition from three-sided channel FinFETs into nanosheet FETs, i.e., offering a four-sided electrostatic control of the channel. Finally, we present the use of machine learning for automation in carrier calibration with increased accuracy. We close by introducing some of the concepts that we consider promising for further extension of SSRM to obtain sub-nm structural information and doping profiles in the area of advanced FinFETs and nanosheet FET technologies, including (a) correlative analysis flow, (b) liquid-assisted probing, and (c) top–down and bottom–up multi-probe sensing schemes to merge low- and high-pressure SSRM scans.},

Here, inter-dots/molecular excitonic and intra-dots/molecular electron-vibration couplings are employed to potentially explore the mechanism of aggregation-caused quenching and AIE of CQDs. In addition, the CQDs with AIE feature are classified into two categories, the CQDs possessing intrinsic AIE properties (AIE-CQDs) and the exogenous CQDs (endowed-AIE-CQDs). The detailed research progress on both types is also summarized. Furthermore, the documented applications of AIE-CQDs and endowed-AIE-CQDs in biomedical imaging, chemical analysis, and solid-state lighting are summarized based on their enhanced fluorescence and redshifted emission wavelengths upon aggregation.},

Although significant advances in optical microscopy have realized super-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratios, and high-speed imaging, these methods frequently require high-intensity illumination, potentially inducing photodamage and photobleaching in biological samples. Quantum-twinned photons, characterized by their unique properties of quantum entanglement, quantum correlation, and quantum interference at the single photon level, present transformative solutions to these limitations. Several imaging modalities have been developed that utilize quantum-twinned photons, encompassing quantum correlation imaging, quantum entanglement imaging, and quantum interference imaging. These techniques exhibit quantum-enhanced imaging capabilities that markedly outperform classical methods, with diverse applications in cellular, tissue, and organism imaging. Centered on this theme, here we present a comprehensive review of quantum biological imaging leveraging the three pivotal quantum properties of quantum-twinned photons.

Although they are currently playing crucial roles in applications such as mobile communication, space-to-ground communication, and the Internet of Thing, there are significantly stringent and challenging requirements demanded for their rapid and successful applications. Compared with conventionally adopted low-temperature co-fired ceramics, integrated passive device filters, and dielectric filters, acoustic wave filters have been regarded as the competitive choice, mainly attributed to their wide bandwidth, small size, and low insertion loss. This paper reviews the advances and outlines future perspectives of high frequency acoustic wave devices for RF communication, focusing on several critical issues including bandwidth, roll-off, frequency, power-handling, insertion loss, out-of-band rejection, tunability, and size/package. It is focused mainly on the extreme performance breakthroughs of RF acoustic wave filter, e.g., how to achieve acoustic devices with operating frequency above 8 GHz, bandwidth around 1 GHz, and quality factor exceeding 2000. Various principles, strategies, and technologies for achieving the superior performance of super-high frequency RF filters are discussed, e.g., applying advanced materials such as scandium-doped AlN or single crystals of AlN and LiNbO 3 , creating new topology structures such as hybrid filters, and generating new types of vibration modes of acoustic waves.},

A key hallmark is the strengthening of attraction between hydrophobic solutes with increasing temperature, a feature often attributed to entropy changes from disrupted hydrogen bonding in water. Here we present an alternative framework based on surface phase behavior, supported by extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Using metadynamics, we quantify the solvent-mediated effective potential between nanometer-scale hydrophobic solutes in the monatomic water (mW) model, the Simple Point Charge Extended water model, and a Lennard-Jones solvent. We develop a morphometric model which incorporates a scaling theory of critical drying, linking the range and strength of hydrophobic attraction to interfacial thermodynamics and proximity to vapor–liquid coexistence. The model reproduces the effective potential across diverse solute sizes, degrees of hydrophobicity, and thermodynamic states. Our simulations recover the inverse temperature dependence of hydrophobicity, showing it arises generically from rapid thermal expansion of the solvation shell.},

The device exhibits excellent memristive performance, with a high switching ratio (∼10 5 ), stable endurance (>10 4 cycles), and rapid switching speeds (turn-on/turn-off times of ∼23/21 µ s). Symmetric threshold voltages (±2 V) and low resistance variability highlight its reliability. Integrated into an oscillatory neuron circuit (R–C configuration), the memristor emulates spiking dynamics, demonstrating tunable frequency and energy efficiency (∼832 nJ/spike). Furthermore, the circuit successfully replicates biological motion detection and sound localization by processing spatiotemporal input differences, mimicking direction-selective ganglion cells and medial superior olive neurons. These results validate the memristor’s potential for bio-inspired sensory systems, offering a scalable, energy-efficient platform for neuromorphic computing and artificial perception.},

The model is applied in the context of all-optical resonant magnetization switching in two-dimensional magnetic materials, particularly reproducing the experimental findings for reverse magnetization by all-optical means for a monolayer CrI 3 .

  abstract     = {Understanding and predicting hydrogen adsorption energy is key to designing effective electrocatalysts. In this study, we develop a physically interpretable descriptor within a framework that decomposes atomic hydrogen adsorption energy into intuitive contributions, applied to 22 group IV and III–V 2D honeycomb materials. The density functional theory (DFT) calculated adsorption energy is decomposed into two components: bond energy, approximated by the integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP), and the energy cost of forming the additional bond, termed distortion energy E d . This decomposition facilitates analysis of adsorption trends beyond treating adsorption energy as a single quantity. We find that ICOHP correlates strongly with the adsorption site electronegativity ( R 2 = 0.86), improving to R 2 = 0.91 when electronegativity differences and structural parameters are included. E d shows moderate correlation with the unrelaxed vacancy energy E vac ( R 2 = 0.60) and can be accurately modeled ( R 2 = 0.92) using similar dependences on electronegativity and structural parameters. Notably, E vac can be expressed in terms of the sum of electronegativities, enabling a DFT-free formulation. Combining both components into an E ads descriptor, we achieve an R 2 score of 0.82 across both group IV and III–V systems. Further analysis reveals that increasing the adsorption site electronegativity weakens adsorption unless the lattice constant is sufficiently large. In addition, we identify a linear relationship between ICOHP and the zero-point energy change, allowing the descriptor to be extended to the free energy of hydrogen adsorption, a key indicator of hydrogen evolution reaction activity.},

In this study, we systematically investigate FeN 4 , CoN 4 , and NiN 4 active sites coordinated with a broad range of axial ligands to elucidate how ligand environments influence reaction energetics across different metal centers. Free energy analyses reveal that axial ligands can substantially modify key steps in the ORR pathway, including *OOH formation and *OH desorption, with distinct effects observed for each metal. FeN 4 exhibits tunable activity and selectivity depending on the ligand, balancing between 4 e − and 2 e − pathways. CoN 4 shows a pronounced preference toward the 2 e − pathway under specific ligand environments, highlighting its potential for selective H 2 O 2 production. In contrast, NiN 4 displays generally high energy barriers and limited ORR activity across all axial ligands. These results establish a comparative framework for understanding how axial ligand coordination governs ORR performance and provide guidance for the rational design of M–N–C SACs with tailored activity and selectivity.},

In this study, we aim to provide insight into which FH order to choose, in what temperature range the FH corrections are reliable, and whether they can be applied outside of equilibrium. We study argon, neon, hydrogen, and helium using accurate ab initio interaction potentials combined with FH corrections up to 14th order. By comparing to full quantum mechanical calculations, we find that the second virial coefficient is predicted within 2% with first-order FH corrections at temperatures above ≈ 10 K for argon and neon, and within 10% above 23 K for hydrogen. At cryogenic temperatures, first-order FH corrections offer a significant improvement compared to classical interaction potentials. Increasing to second-order FH corrections yields a small improvement in the case of neon and helium, while higher-order corrections give systematically less accurate predictions. At sufficiently low temperatures, the accuracy of the FH corrections deteriorates rapidly due to the increasingly relevant impact of the discretization of energy states when the thermal energy is small compared to the energy gaps between bound dimer states. By comparing to full quantum mechanical calculations, we show that FH corrections decrease the accuracy in the prediction of transport properties at infinite dilution. This shows that the qualitative picture of “quantum swelling” only applies when considering a large number of particles and not for binary collision dynamics.},

In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids. Here, we derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion–convection equation) with an energy barrier due to the crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in reasonable agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are compared with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids. The comparison suggests that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity.},

  abstract     = {Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture and storage using ionic liquids (ILs) is a promising research area within the broader issue of greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change. Here, we conducted a systematic molecular dynamics study to identify structural features that optimize CO 2 solubility in ILs. A total of 24 ILs, based on 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cations with varying alkyl chain lengths and paired with six different anions, were examined. Simulations were performed at 300 K and 1 atm, across 0%, 10%, and 30% CO 2 mole fractions. The void probability distribution functions revealed remarkable morphological similarities among the systems, with a strong correlation between the anion molar volume and the total number of voids in the liquid. The void network topology showed that spherical anions such as [BF 4 ] − and [PF 6 ] − promote narrow-channel connectivity, while bulkier anions significantly modify the interstitial network connecting the voids. Radial distribution functions highlighted that CO 2 is preferentially located near polar domains, particularly around anions, with minimal disruption to the overall packing. These localized perturbations in the IL structure were more pronounced for smaller anions, which are more tightly coordinated with the cations. Interaction energy analysis revealed that extending the cation alkyl chains does not enhance CO 2 solubility in molar terms, as the gas interacts mainly with polar regions. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of dispersion interactions in CO 2 uptake and suggest that ILs incorporating soft, bulky anions may be promising candidates for carbon capture, offering a balance between increased free volume near the polar domains and manageable viscosity.},

There still exist controversies over the lowest energy structure of OgF 4 . In this work, the CCSD(T) method with spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is employed for determining geometries, harmonic frequencies, and dissociation energies of these heavy and superheavy rare gas fluorides. Our results show that the lowest-energy structure for XF 2 is D ∞h and that for XF 4 is D 4h . In addition, a T d structure emerges for OgF 4 with SOC, lying about 2 kcal/mol above the D 4h structure. Moreover, a C 2v structure appears in scalar-relativistic calculations for XF 2 and XeF 4 ; however, the C 2v structure for OgF 2 vanishes when SOC is included. SOC increases both bond lengths and dissociation energies of these molecules and is essential for describing properties of RnF n and OgF n accurately. Furthermore, an atom-in-molecule (AIM) analysis program is developed to analyze electron densities of these systems with SOC. AIM and Mulliken population analyses reveal that the X–F bond exhibits a mixed ionic-covalent character. SOC diminishes the covalent character in these molecules, particularly for RnF n and OgF n , and relatively larger covalent character is observed in XF 4 than that in XF 2 .},

The rate coefficients at relatively low temperatures (<4000 K) are obtained by integrating the derived cross section model, and an accurate prediction of the vibrationally relaxation time of N 2 is achieved by solving the corresponding master equations. It is found that the rate coefficient from the first vibrational excited state to the ground state can be accurately fitted by a second-order Arrhenius formula, and below 2000 K, the vibrational relaxation times calculated by the two-state method are consistent with those of the full vibrational ladder method (Landau–Teller formula and the e-folding method).

  abstract     = {Microwave and millimeter-wave rotational spectra of 46 thiophene isotopologues are used to determine a new semi-experimental equilibrium ( r e SE ) structure for thiophene. The large dataset of isotopologues—roughly twice as large as any dataset used for a semi-experimental equilibrium structure determination for a molecule of this size—and the broad frequency coverage enable a detailed investigation concerning previously reported discrepancies between the structural parameters of the r e SE and r e structures of thiophene. The observation of rotational spectra for 23 new thiophene- d x isotopologues, many with additional 34 S or 13 C substitution at natural abundance, is made possible by the high sensitivity of the PARIS FTMW spectrometer in the microwave frequency region. Frequency coverage for thiophene and single heavy-atom isotopologues in the millimeter-wave region has been expanded to include the range of 82–750 GHz. Bond distances and bond angles of the new highly precise and accurate r e SE structure are determined with precisions of ≤0.0002 Å and ≤0.02°, respectively. This study provides strong evidence that the discrepancies can be addressed only by improvements to the theoretical r e structure and that the precision and accuracy of the semi-experimental equilibrium ( r e SE ) structural parameters are approaching the limit of structure determination.},

Utilizing the dissipaton equation-of-motion approach, we demonstrate that the differential conductance shows periodic behavior, and its periodicity depends on both the QD energy level and the MBS overlapping. A zero-bias peak (ZBP) emerges as a result of the balance between normal and anomalous tunneling processes, associated with the presence of a single MBS. Beyond the phase-dependent periodic behavior, the shot noise exhibits voltage-dependent transitions between sub-Poissonian ( F = 0.5), Poissonian ( F = 1), and super-Poissonian ( F > 1) regimes. Strikingly, we find a giant Fano factor ( F ≫ 1) emerging at the balance point, accompanied by a peak in the shot noise. This distinctive feature may serve as a supplementary signature for MBS detection. However, both ZBP in the differential conductance and shot noise peak are degraded by thermal effects.},

Phys. 159 , 154107 (2023)] and developed an open-source PIMD code repository. Numerical experiments show that for a system of 1600 interacting identical bosons in a harmonic trap, using a single GPU and a single CPU, it only takes two hours to achieve satisfactory simulation accuracy. With the increase in the number of identical particles, the advantage of GPU acceleration over CPU becomes more obvious, making it possible to simulate tens of thousands of identical particles from first principles using a single GPU. Our study shows that GPU acceleration can lay a solid foundation for the wide application of PIMD simulations for large-scale identical particle quantum systems with more than 10 000 particles in the presence of two-body interaction. Numerical experiments show that a 24 GB GPU can simulate up to 20 000 identical particles from first principles, and the GPU acceleration leads to a roughly linear relationship between the computation time and the number of identical particles. In addition, we have also successfully implemented simulations for fictitious identical particle thermodynamics using GPU to overcome the fermion sign problem, which makes it promising to efficiently and accurately simulate tens of thousands of fermions based on GPU when the recently proposed ξ -extrapolation method holds.},

We further discuss rolling friction for cylinders and spheres, as well as sliding friction for triangular sliders on dry and lubricated rubber surfaces. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results obtained using different materials, geometries, and environmental conditions, highlighting the importance of accounting for multiscale roughness. Open challenges, such as the role of adhesion enhancement, energy dissipation due to crack opening, and the physical origin of the short-distance roughness cutoff, are discussed.},

An important example of such landscape describes superposition of M plane waves with random amplitudes, directions of the wavevectors, and phases, further confined by a parabolic potential of curvature μ . Our main efforts are directed toward analyzing the landscape features in the limit N → ∞ , M → ∞ keeping α = M / N finite. In such a limit we find (i) the rates of asymptotic exponential growth with N of the mean number of all critical points and of local minima known as the annealed complexities and (ii) the expression for the mean value of the deepest landscape minimum (the ground-state energy). In particular, for the latter we derive the Parisi-like optimization functional and analyze conditions for the optimiser to reflect various phases for different values of μ and α : replica-symmetric, one-step and full replica symmetry broken, as well as criteria for continuous, Gardner and random first order transitions between different phases.},

Firstly, a stochastic representation of the solution is derived by the stochastic differential equation associated with a subordinated Brownian motion and a birth-death process, in which the drift term is the solution of the INSE on R d ( d ≥ 2 ) ⁠ . Regarding the existence of the birth-death semigroup in ℓ p ( π ) ( p ≥ 2), equipped with a positive weight measure π , it is proved via a perturbation theorem without requiring the boundedness of the birth and death rates. Then, relying on the regularity estimates of the solution for INSE and the properties of the birth-death semigroup, we prove that the stochastic representation is a unique local strong solution in ℓ p ′ ( π ) × L p ( R d ) ( p ′ ≥ 2 , p > d ) via spatial regularity analyses of the random flow. The Picard iteration is used to prove that it is both unique local mild and weak solution in ℓ 2 ( π ) × L 2 ( R d ) ⁠ .},

In our current study, we find that while these restrictions still apply, the introduction of Lyra’s geometry significantly influences the evolution of the Universe.

  abstract     = {Matrix Product Unitaries (MPUs) have emerged as essential tools for representing locality-preserving 1D unitary operators, with direct applications to quantum cellular automata and quantum phases of matter. A key challenge in the study of MPUs is determining when a given local tensor generates an MPU, a task previously addressed through fixed-point conditions and canonical forms, which can be cumbersome to evaluate for an arbitrary tensor. In this work, we establish a simple and efficient necessary and sufficient condition for a tensor M to generate an MPU of size N , namely, Tr ( E M N ) = Tr ( E T N ) = 1 ⁠ , where E M and E T denote the transfer matrices of M and T = MM † , respectively, with M † being the Hermitian adjoint of M with respect to the physical indices. This condition provides a unified framework for characterizing all uniform MPUs and significantly simplifies their evaluation. Furthermore, we show that locality preservation naturally arises when the MPU is generated for all system sizes. Our results offer new insights into the structure of MPUs, highlighting connections between unitary evolution, transfer matrices, and locality-preserving behavior, with potential extensions to higher-dimensions.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the averaging principle for the multi-scale fractional stochastic nonautonomous FitzHugh–Nagumo system on the whole Euclid space, where the drift term is a nonlinear function that has an arbitrary polynomial growth rate in its last argument, and the diffusion term is a family of globally Lipschitz continuous functions. Taking the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions as a state space, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of a periodic evolution system of measures for the fast equation when the slow component of the solution is fixed, and then establish the exponential ergodicity for the stochastic systems under certain conditions. By using the time discretization and variational methods, we finally show the strong rate of convergence for the slow component of the solution operator. The results of this paper are also valid when the fractional Laplace operator (−Δ) s with s ∈ (0, 1) becomes the standard Laplace operator −Δ.},

First, we provide a classification of general Benjamin-Ono type systems that admit solutions related to the Calogero-Moser system, including the perturbed Benjamin-Ono equation. Second, we demonstrate that this equation possesses a Lax pair. Third, we show that the equation can be transformed into a linear form through an appropriate change of the dependent variable. Finally, we derive both non-periodic and periodic solutions under suitable initial conditions.},

Firstly, the unique existence of subsonic and supersonic solutions of the damped radial isentropic Euler flow in a two-dimensional expansion and contraction nozzle are established. Then take the radial subsonic solution in a expansion nozzle as the background solution, the structural stability problem of the background solution under small perturbations of the inlet Bernoulli function, inlet velocity ratio, and outlet density is transformed into the unique existence problem of the solution to the boundary value problem of a nonlinear hyperbolic-elliptic coupled system. After performing a Lagrange transformation on the decoupled system, we transform it into a fixed boundary problem, linearize it, and construct a suitable iteration set and a iteration scheme. Finally the existence of a unique fixed point can be proved, which yields the structural stability of the background solution.},

We first prove the existence and uniqueness of pullback attractors for such equations. Second, we show that the existence and uniqueness of a family of invariant Borel probability measures supported on the pullback attractors. Third, we study the upper semicontinuity of pullback attractors as the delay time approaches to zero. Finally, we investigate the convergence of invariant measures as the delay time tends to zero. In this paper, we need to overcome two difficulties. On the one hand, due to the lack of higher regularity of solutions, we prove the asymptotic compactness of solutions using the spectrum decomposition method. On the other hand, we introduce an invertible function to solve the effect of the variable delay, and then establish the convergence of solutions for the delay system to the non-delay one.},

We establish the existence and uniqueness of three-dimensional smooth subsonic flows to the steady Zeldovich–von Neumann–Döring combustion equations by prescribing the Bernoulli’s quantity, the entropy, the fraction of unburned gas and the tangential velocity at the entrance and the pressure at the exit. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear boundary value problem for a hyperbolic-elliptic mixed system. The main difficulty is that all the physical quantities are coupled with each other due to the combustion process. One of the key points in the analysis is to utilize the deformation-curl decomposition to deal with the hyperbolic and elliptic modes. Another one is to solve the deformation-curl system for the velocity field with mixed boundary conditions.},
