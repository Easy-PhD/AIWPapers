Localized properties, including polarization, lattice parameter, and chemical composition, are parameterized from atomic-scale imaging, and their causal relationships are reconstructed using a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model. This approach is further extended to explore the spatial variability of the causal coupling using the sliding window transform method, which revealed that new causal relationships emerged at both the expected locations, such as domain walls and interfaces, and at additional regions forming clusters in the vicinity of the walls or spatially distributed features. While the exact physical origins of these relationships are unclear, they likely represent nanophase-separated regions in the morphotropic phase boundaries. Overall, we posit that an in-depth understanding of complex disordered materials away from thermodynamic equilibrium necessitates understanding not only the generative processes that can lead to observed microscopic states but also the causal links between multiple interacting subsystems.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the behavior of a fluid as it flows through porous media is critical for electrochemical devices and other scientific, industrial, and environmental applications. The main challenge lies in accurately capturing the complex, multi-scale fluid flow behavior through irregular porous microstructures, all while maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a multi-fidelity surrogate model that predicts the high-fidelity flow field state variables in explicit porous media microstructures with minimal computational cost. Our approach begins by collecting both low-fidelity and high-fidelity simulation data to train the surrogate model. The former low-fidelity data are obtained from numerical simulations of fluid flowing through macro-scale structures having homogenized effective material properties. On the other hand, the latter high-fidelity data include geometric details of the dehomogenized explicit porous media microstructure. This technique combines the detailed accuracy of high-fidelity data with the computational efficiency of low-fidelity data, thus enhancing the model performance. In addition, we integrate physics-informed neural networks into the surrogate modeling process, embedding physical laws derived from the Navier–Stokes equations that govern fluid flow. This multi-scale, multi-fidelity approach offers a precise and cost-effective solution for predicting the fluid flow velocity and pressure fields in the porous media. For relevant porous media fluid flow applications, we show a ∼ 1 0 3 × faster solution in terms of increased computational speed for a given model with reasonable representative accuracy of the solution, within a range of ∼5%–20% for velocity and ≤10% for pressure fields.},

However, studying these transitions typically requires large supercells to minimize constraints on atomic movements, significantly increasing computational time and cost. In this study, we developed a machine learning potential by fine-tuning the MACE-MP-0 model with a customized BTO database. The fine-tuned MACE model demonstrated high accuracy in reproducing the structural and dynamic characteristics of BTO systems. Notably, the model effectively represented changes in lattice constants and polarization during phase transitions (rhombohedral → orthorhombic → tetragonal → cubic). Furthermore, we employed the fine-tuned MACE model to investigate the melting point of BTO and subsequently generated liquid-phase and amorphous structures via thermal annealing, providing valuable insights into the high-temperature behavior of BTO.},

To improve crystal quality, the multi-point seed technique and the flux film coated technique have been developed, enabling the growth of low-dislocation GaN wafers via the Na-flux method. However, the coalescence boundary (CB) region, formed by the fusion of multiple growth fronts, exhibits complex structural variations that remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we investigate the CB region of FFC-GaN using synchrotron-based nanobeam x-ray diffraction (nanoXRD). To analyze the high-dimensional diffraction data without prior labeling, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning framework that combines Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with agglomerative clustering. This approach identifies six crystallographically distinct clusters that align well with growth sectors inferred from cathodoluminescence imaging. By further applying the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, we enhance the pixel-level interpretation of structural evolution during different growth stages of CB. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the combination of UMAP, clustering, and statistical testing enables direct, label-free crystallographic analysis of crystal growth sectors. This framework is believed to be generalizable to other high-dimensional experimental datasets, opening new avenues for uncovering hidden structural features in complex material systems.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian optimization (BO) has become an indispensable tool for autonomous decision-making across diverse applications from autonomous vehicle control to accelerated drug and materials discovery. With the growing interest in self-driving laboratories, BO of chemical systems is crucial for machine learning guided experimental planning. Typically, BO employs a regression surrogate model to predict the distribution of unseen parts of the search space. However, for the selection of molecules, picking the top candidates with respect to a distribution, the relative ordering of their properties may be more important than their exact values. In this paper, we introduce rank-based Bayesian optimization (RBO), which utilizes a ranking model as the surrogate. We present a comprehensive investigation of RBO’s optimization performance compared to conventional BO on various chemical datasets. Our results demonstrate similar or improved optimization performance using ranking models, particularly for datasets with rough structure–property landscapes and activity cliffs. Furthermore, we observe a high correlation between the surrogate ranking ability and BO performance, and this ability is maintained even at early iterations of BO optimization when using ranking surrogate models. We conclude that RBO is an effective alternative to regression-based BO, especially for optimizing novel chemical compounds.},

We first generate a scattering dataset by carrying out molecular dynamics simulations of the polydisperse hard spheres modeled by the truncated-shifted Lennard-Jones model, then analyze the scattering function dataset using singular value decomposition to confirm the feasibility of dimensional compression. Then, we split the dataset into training and testing sets and train our neural network on the training set only. Our generator model produces a scattering function with significantly higher accuracy compared to the traditional Percus–Yevick approximation and β correction, and the inferrer model can extract the volume fraction and polydispersity with much higher accuracy than traditional model functions.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of artificial-intelligence driven autonomous experiments demands physics-based modeling and decision-making processes, not only to improve the accuracy of the experimental trajectory but also to increase trust by allowing transparent human-machine collaboration. High-quality structural characterization techniques (e.g., x ray, neutron, or static light scattering) are a particularly relevant example of this need: they provide invaluable information but are challenging to analyze without expert oversight. Here, we introduce AutoSAS, a novel framework for human-aside-the-loop automated data classification. AutoSAS leverages human-defined candidate models, high-throughput combinatorial fitting, and information-theoretic model selection to generate both classification results and quantitative structural descriptors. We implement AutoSAS in an open-source package designed for use with the Autonomous Formulation Laboratory for x-ray and neutron scattering-based optimization of multi-component liquid formulations. In a first application, we leveraged a set of expert defined candidate models to classify, refine the structure, and track transformations in a model injectable drug carrier system. We evaluated four model selection methods and benchmarked them against an optimized machine learning classifier, and the best approach was one that balanced quality of the fit and complexity of the model. AutoSAS not only corroborated the critical micelle concentration boundary identified in previous experiments but also discovered a second structural transition boundary not identified by the previous methods. These results demonstrate the potential of AutoSAS to enhance autonomous experimental workflows by providing robust, interpretable model selection, paving the way for more reliable and insightful structural characterization in complex formulations.},

An example of this is the design of photonic metasurfaces by using their photoluminescent spectrum as the input data to predict their topology. One fundamental challenge of these systems is their ability to represent nonlinear relationships between sets of data that have different dimensionalities. Existing design methods often implement a conditional generative adversarial network in order to solve this problem, but in many cases, the solution is unable to generate structures that provide multiple peaks when validated. It is demonstrated that in response to the target spectrum, the bidirectional adversarial autoencoder is able to generate structures that provide multiple peaks on several occasions. As a result, the proposed model represents an important advance toward the generation of nonlinear photonic metasurfaces that can be used in advanced metasurface design.},

As a model system, we used the periodic precipitation of copper(II) hydroxide and targeted the synthesis of “Liesegang” precipitation bands with a well-defined spacing. Our workflow involved conducting high-throughput synthesis experiments, mapping the spatial distribution of the products as a function of initial reactant concentrations, and scalarizing the emerging patterns using empirical scaling laws. Subsequently, machine learning models were deployed to process the scalarized descriptors and inform the next round of experimental conditions in order to converge toward a target precipitation pattern, without human input. We anticipate that these results open pathways for autonomous materials synthesis via reaction–diffusion coupling to create complex products with user-defined chemistry, morphology, and spatial distribution within a reaction medium.},

We demonstrate that the new ML model accurately reproduces the energy bands and wavefunctions of structures outside the training set, closely matching first-principle calculations. This accuracy is achieved with significantly lower computational costs due to the elimination of self-consistency iterations and the reduced size of the plane-wave basis set.

  abstract     = {Significant advancements in machine learning have accelerated and improved structure–property predictions for materials discovery. However, data are often scarce due to large parameter spaces consisting of chemistry, structure, synthesis, and processing variables. At small data limits, theory can be leveraged to inform machine learning (ML) models with domain knowledge and improve generalization. Here, we determine how the accuracy of first-principles calculations affects theory-informed ML predictions of the experimental solvation free energy Δ G solv e x p in both “small” (10 1 –10 2 ) and “large” (10 3 –10 4 ) data size limits. We compare several existing theory-informed techniques to a baseline (no theory) model: feature-informed, difference, and ratio. At small data limits, all theory-informed models exhibit lower RMSE, reducing training data size by more than 65% compared to the baseline model. With larger training set sizes and as theory prediction accuracy declines, the difference and ratio models exhibit larger errors than the baseline model, indicating negative transfer occurs. No negative transfer is observed in the feature-informed model; however, the model is unable to extrapolate outside of the known Δ G solv e x p distribution, whereas the difference and ratio models exhibit lower extrapolation error. Finally, we employ each model in an active learning algorithm and compare two exploration acquisition functions: maximum difference and maximum variance. Sampling with the maximum difference policy reduces RMSE and variance of the feature-informed model faster than maximum variance early in the exploration campaign, as it identifies label bounds in fewer iterations. Our findings highlight the balance between leveraging theory and relying on data-driven models in high-throughput materials discovery.},

  abstract     = {We analyzed the application of quantum machine learning in histopathological cancer detection under adversarial attacks, demonstrating its potential to enhance diagnostic performance in adverse circumstances. Adversarial attacks are one of the major concerns in any image classification machine learning model and are responsible for perturbing the original input images, which, therefore, results in misclassification. To encounter this problem, we first developed the hybrid quantum transfer learning model by incorporating multiple transfer learning architectures such as ResNet-18, VGG-16, Inception-v3, and AlexNet with variational quantum circuits for histopathological cancer detection. Second, we introduced white-box adversarial attacks using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and DeepFool and projected gradient descent (PGD) methods in this model and evaluated each model’s performance against these adversarial attacks. We analyzed that the Hybrid Classical Quantum Deep Learning model (HCQ-DL) with ResNet-18 provides 78.05% accuracy compared to the Classical ResNet-18 model with the highest accuracy of 50.84% for FGSM attacks. Similarly, for DeepFool attacks, HCQ-DL with ResNet-18 performs 52.12% accurately compared to the Classical ResNet-18 model with the highest accuracy of 37.87% and for PGD attacks, HCQ-DL with ResNet-18 has 52.94% performance accuracy compared to the Classical Inception-V3 model with the highest accuracy of 32.05%. As a result, we observed that HCQ-DL models are more resilient to these adversarial attacks compared to classical deep learning models and show potential to achieve greater robustness when combined with additional defense techniques.},

  abstract     = {Metallic thin films offer a platform to experimentally study the dynamics of microstructural evolution, but the required transmission electron microscopy (TEM)-based imaging generates complex images that are challenging to segment and quantify. This work provides a comparative analysis of a new YOLOv8 model and an established U-Net model for bright-field TEM images of polycrystals, employing a framework leveraging physical observables to evaluate performance against two hand-traced benchmark datasets. This methodology obviates the comparison of large, diversely structured, and manually labeled datasets that are required to assess performance on a per-image/per-pixel basis. It is found that the YOLOv8 model, adapted for real-time instance segmentation, has up to 43× faster inferencing (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090) compared to U-Net and reconstructs hand-traced grain size distributions (GSDs) with excellent fidelity, finding mean diameter within 3% for grains near an optimal magnification; for grains that deviate from the optimal pixel-diameter, the size of small- (large)-diameter grains is systematically over- (under)-estimated. This is partially mitigated by including scale-aware augmentations during training. Moreover, when the bias is corrected post-inference by a rigid shift in distribution, the YOLOv8 model reproduces ground truth GSDs with exceptional fidelity, with statistical tests indicating <5% probability that the distributions are distinct. Based on ground truth data, calibration curves pertaining to this shift can be constructed for a given model. This issue is not present in the U-Net model’s results, indicating that for quantitative measurements where the true size of objects is of interest, special procedures must be implemented for YOLO-based models.},

  abstract     = {Materials informatics (MI), emerging from the fusion of materials science and data science, has the potential to greatly accelerate material development and discovery. Although MI relies on data from both computational and experimental studies, their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we addressed this challenge by training a machine learning model on experimental data and applying it to compositional entries in a computational database, thereby creating a unified dataset. In this study, we use these integrated datasets to construct material maps that visualize the relationships between material properties and structural features. The goal is to provide experimental researchers with a practical tool for exploring structurally similar compounds and thus their associated routes. We generate the materials map using the MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which represents crystal structures as graphs and employs deep learning for property prediction. Statistical analyses reveal that the MDL equipped with a message passing neural network (MPNN) architecture efficiently captures features related to the structural complexity of materials. Interestingly, this representational advantage does not always lead to higher accuracy in property prediction. We attribute this finding to the strong learning capacity of MPNN, which contributes primarily to the organization of data points within the materials map rather than to incremental gains in predictive precision.},

  abstract     = {We demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning for enhancing predictions of critical mechanical properties of membrane resonators. This approach benefits from robust pretrained features, which improve convergence and generalization even with large training datasets. By fine-tuning pretrained deep learning architectures—including VisionTransformer, ResNet152, and VGG19—we accurately predict eigenfrequencies, dilution coefficients, and buckling behaviors. Using a large dataset of 170 000 samples generated with COMSOL Multiphysics, our models capture complex physical phenomena, delivering performance comparable to traditional finite element methods but at significantly reduced computational cost. Specifically, eigenfrequency predictions across 15 eigenmodes consistently achieve low relative errors (1%–3%) with minimal variance. Dilution coefficient predictions remain accurate for lower eigenmodes, maintaining relative errors below 10% for the four lowest modes using static pruning thresholds. However, for higher modes, accuracy deteriorates—potentially due to the increased complexity and localized nature of higher-order mode shapes. In addition, our models exhibit robust performance in classifying membrane buckling behaviors in a binary setting, achieving over 95% accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Artificial neural networks (NNs) can be implemented using chemical reaction networks (CRNs), where the concentrations of species act as inputs and outputs. In such biochemical computing, noise-robust computing is crucial due to the intrinsic and extrinsic noise present in chemical reactions. Previously suggested CRNs for feed-forward networks often utilized the rectified linear unit or discrete activation functions. However, one concern in this case is the discontinuities of the derivatives of those non-smooth functions, which can cause significant noise disruption during backpropagation. In this study, we propose CRNs that perform both feed-forward and training processes using smooth activation functions to avoid discontinuities in the backpropagation. All reactions occur in a single pot, and the reactions for training are bimolecular. Our case studies on the XOR, Iris, MNIST datasets, and a non-linear regression model demonstrate that computation via the CRN (i) maintains accuracy despite noise in the reaction rates and the concentration of species and (ii) is insensitive to the choice of the running time and the magnitude of the noise in comparison to NNs with a non-smooth activation function. This work presents a noise-robust NN and backpropagation implemented by CRNs, paving the way for more stable and efficient biochemical computing systems.},

  abstract     = {Imaging techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), are used to understand the morphology and microstructure of material systems. However, large datasets are needed to relate the microstructure and composition of the material system to overall behavior. Depending on the complexity and cost of the material system and imaging techniques, accurate datasets are difficult to obtain. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can provide a framework to understand the relation between the morphology and microstructural behavior of material systems. Deep convolution GANs (DC-GANs) can be trained from experimentally characterized datasets to predict the morphology of various material systems. Hence, in this investigation, a limited dataset of 48 SEM images for PDMS with various weight fractions of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was obtained and used to train a DC-GAN. Iterative image augmentation techniques were then used to accurately extend the limited dataset. SEM micrographs of CNT-PDMS were then generated from the trained DC-GAN to predict the morphology and microstructure for different magnifications and weight fractions of CNTs. Error analysis approaches based on generator and discriminator losses were used to assess the accuracy and reliability of the trained sets. This proposed approach provides a verifiable framework for training experimentally obtained SEM microstructural datasets of any dimension that can be trained to understand the behavior of CNT-polymer systems and to augment experimental imaging predictions.},

  abstract     = {The flurry of news worldwide surrounding the launch of DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence (AI) tool, operating at ∼5% of OpenAI’s GPT models, has drawn significant attention to global competitiveness in the AI field. Greater efficiency in software design to lower costs is of clear benefit to AI customers. It is also, however, critical to acknowledge the urgent need to sustain the otherwise continuous growth of compute power needed for AI systems and to reduce the energy consumption of AI systems, both of which are generally growing exponentially. Hardware has a critical role to play here. Thus, in addition to software progress, fundamental innovations across the hardware stack—from functional materials and novel devices to efficient system architectures and new computing paradigms—are pressing needs. Considering the ongoing climate crisis, we argue for the urgent need for accelerated and connected government- and industry-funded research and development in the hardware domain. We believe that the route to sustainable energy efficiency of compute systems requires closely linked efforts between academia and industry, starting with the most fundamental level of the AI system stack.},
