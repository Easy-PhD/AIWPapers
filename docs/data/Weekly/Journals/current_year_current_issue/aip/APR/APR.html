  abstract     = {The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a quantum phenomenon arising from the breaking of chiral symmetry in relativistic Weyl fermions due to quantum fluctuations under parallel electric ( E ) and magnetic fields ( B ). Intuitively, Weyl fermions with opposite chirality, under the stimulus of parallel E and B , will have different chemical potentials that give rise to an extra current, whose role is like a chiral battery in solids. However, up until now, the experimental evidence for the chiral magnetic effect is the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance , rather than a chiral electric source. Here, different from previous reports, we observed a giant chiral magnetic effect evidenced by “negative” resistance and corresponding voltage–current curves located in the second-fourth quadrant in the type-II Weyl semimetal WP 2+δ . These phenomena occur under the following conditions: the misalignment angle between B and E is smaller than 20°, the temperature is below 40 K, the externally applied electrical current is less than 50 mA, and the magnetic field is larger than 3 T. Phenomenologically, based on the macroscopic Chern–Simons–Maxwell equation, this giant chiral magnetic effect observed in WP 2+δ is attributed to the chirality of Weyl fermions possessing a two-order longer coherent time than the Drude transport relaxation time. Our findings provide evidence of the giant chiral-magnetic/chiral-battery effect in Weyl semimetals.},

While skyrmions and the topological Hall effect have been widely studied in oxide films, experimental verification of interfacial DMI and its underlying mechanisms in oxide interfaces has remained largely unexplored. In this study, we report a significantly large interfacial DMI in La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 (LSMO) films grown on NdGaO 3 substrates, with a DMI coefficient of 1.96 pJ/m—one to two orders of magnitude higher than previously observed in oxide systems. Our experiments, coupled with first-principles calculations, reveal that enhanced spin–orbit coupling at the LSMO/NdGaO 3 interface, driven by a synergy between the 6 s electrons of Nd and the 4 f electrons, is the key to this large DMI. This breakthrough opens new avenues for controlling chiral spintronics in oxide-based materials, laying the groundwork for next-generation spintronic and magnonic devices.},

  abstract     = {The realization of multiple electronic states on ultrafast sub-picosecond timescales can be leveraged to develop energy-efficient terahertz (THz) photonic devices. Such explorations are pursued in the framework of femtosecond optical excitation with THz probes wherein either negative or positive photoconductivity manifests in metallic and insulating states, respectively. Co-existence of both states is highly desired but rarely observed. Here, a strategy is devised exploiting crystalline transport anisotropy and hetero-epitaxy in a multi-band nickelate to demonstrate switching of the positive to the negative sign of photoconductivity on a sub-picosecond timescale. This combines with a profound anisotropy of THz photoconductivity in unconventional (111) epitaxial films having preferential arrangement of oxygen vacancies along selective crystal axes—a framework that reversibly modulates the anisotropy of negative THz photoconductivity using oxygen content as a control parameter, and corroborated by theoretical calculations. Thus, ultrafast switching between negative, positive, and zero photoconductive states in timescales of a few picoseconds at room temperature, as demonstrated in this study, holds a remarkable prospect for creating multiple channels of information processing. A proof-of-concept experiment to utilize these photo-controlled states is proposed for a three-state THz communication system, which would transmit a larger volume of information vis-a-vis that of a binary communication system.},

This complexity makes it highly challenging to optimize crystals for efficient THz generation. Here, we introduce a design strategy based on isomorphic ionic organic crystal families to develop new organic nonlinear optical crystals that efficiently generate ultra-broadband THz waves extending up to 15 THz. Using three nonlinear optical cationic chromophores with different interionic assembly types, each combined with three molecular anions featuring different substituents (non-polar methyl or polar chloro and bromo groups), we investigated nine ionic crystals, including four reported here for the first time. The crystal members within each isomorphic crystal family show nearly identical crystal structures (i.e., isomorphic crystal structures), all of them achieving top-level macroscopic second-order optical nonlinearity and efficient ultrabroad THz wave generation capabilities. Remarkably, their physical (and terahertz) properties within each isomorphic crystal family differ dramatically according to a certain order of the introduced anions, and this ordering trend persists across all three isomorphic crystal families. These results provide a crucial advancement in the design and prediction of macroscopic properties in ionic organic THz and nonlinear optical crystals, marking an important step toward rational crystal design exhibiting enhanced physical properties.},

Among them, the frequency-dependent thermal conductivity has been extensively explored by pump-probe techniques, such as time-domain thermoreflectance, which is employed to probe the spectra of phonon mean free paths. However, previous studies on silicon have not exhibited apparent frequency dependence despite its broad phonon distribution. Here, we report the frequency-dependent thermal transport in Al/Si with an atomically sharp interface, where the matched Debye temperatures preserve the temperature difference between low- and high-energy phonons in Si and contribute as additional non-equilibrium thermal resistance. The dependence vanishes in Al/SiO 2 /Si at room temperature, since the SiO 2 interlayer facilitates phonon scattering and destroys thermal non-equilibrium. At 80 K, frequency dependence reemerges in Al/SiO 2 /Si due to reduced interfacial phonon scattering, which is not sufficient to destroy the temperature difference between low- and high-energy phonons. The frequency dependence is weakened in the Al/Si sample at 500 K, originating from the enhanced phonon scattering rate in Si. Our findings highlight the significance of boundary conditions in frequency-dependent thermal conductivity.},

The soft magnetoelectric skin (SMES) has been proposed here for multidirectional tactile sensing by imitating the structure and tactile hyperacuity of human skin. The SMES integrates a force–magnetic coupling layer with an electromagnetic induction layer, enabling it to detect vertical forces at 25 points and tangential forces in 12 directions using only 4 coils, showing its tactile hyperacuity. Both experimental and simulation results demonstrate its stable, self-powered multidirectional sensing mechanism. Additionally, a customized machine learning model achieves 96.01% accuracy in detecting 37 force directions, even under varying compression conditions. Combined with a real-time sensing system, its application potential for robotic tactile sensing and human–computer interfaces has been highlighted, showcasing its application versatility.

By exploiting the different spectral response of these detectors, transmitted data of different wavelengths can be effectively distinguished, making them promising candidates for wavelength division multiplexing to enhance optical communication transmission rates. Herein, we present a facile dual-wavelength demultiplexing strategy based on ZnO/PbSe wide-/narrow-bandgap heterojunction to achieve ultraviolet (UV)-infrared (IR) broadband detection by utilizing the photosensitive/dielectric properties of ZnO along with unique band alignment. The detector demonstrates a continuous photocurrent response in the UV region, while producing transient pulsed photocurrent in the IR region. It is first time reporting response wavelength extension of transient photodetectors from near-infrared (NIR) to mid-infrared (MIR). Additionally, the response bandwidth reaches 2 kHz in the UV and 0.7 MHz in the IR bands. The UV/IR dual-wavelength optical communication tests show the coexistence of transient pulsed and continuous photocurrents. By incorporating different filter modules at the output terminals, the transmitted data at both wavelengths can be extracted simultaneously. This study offers a facile and practical approach for broadband photodetection and wavelength demultiplexing, while also providing a novel route for extending the application of wide-bandgap semiconductors to IR optoelectronic devices.},

This limitation hinders the application development of the self-powered optoelectronic synaptic devices in neuromorphic computing. In this work, a self-powered optoelectronic synaptic device based on the tin dioxide and cesium silver bismuth bromide heterojunction is developed. Through utilizing the ion migration and photo-generated carrier transport behaviors in the heterojunction, self-powered optically inhibitory and excitatory synaptic behaviors are successfully mimicked under ultraviolet (365 nm) monochromatic all-optical modulation. On this basis, a convolutional neural network has been constructed with the software-based means to recognize images (the absence of real hardware-level image processing) in fashion MNIST dataset and an accuracy of 84.48% is obtained in this network, indicating broad application prospects of the all-optical self-powered systems in the neuromorphic computing.},

This work focuses on studying the 2H Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS 2 ) van der Waals layers as the tunnel barrier, and Cobalt (Co) as the electrode. The TMR varies with different adsorption interfaces, yet none have achieved the desired levels because the momentum-resolved transmissions of Co and MoS 2 in the folded horizontal BZ do not match well, resulting in inefficient spin filtering and thereby a low TMR. The effects of interfacial bonds on spin transport and magnetic anisotropy are studied. The orientations of bonds determine the anisotropy of the interfacial Co. Vertical bonds stabilize the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), while non-vertical bonds cause in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). The layers below exhibit PMA, so both types of MTJs overall support PMA, while the physisorbed MTJ is stronger. The positive relation between the transmission and the electron density near the Fermi level is weakened by the bonds, as the scattering centers hold back the spin injection. Our work further strengthens the importance of BZ filtering in governing TMR and the design principle of MTJ, as well as how bonds affect the overall device performance.},

Yet on-chip electronic detection and tuning of multimode resonances in these 2D VCT resonators have been challenging due to the ultrasmall vibration amplitudes and rich multimode dynamics at radio frequencies (RF).

Using all-electronic signal transduction, we show single-, bi-, and tri-layer MoS 2 VCT resonators with up to the 14th resonance mode, thanks to the ultra-efficient electromechanical transduction enabled by internal multiphysics coupling. Measured gate dependency of multimode resonances exhibits frequency tuning ranges of Δ f / f 0 up to 326%.

This process does not require population inversion, unlike conventional photonic lasers. II-VI/III-V colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, known for their narrow emission linewidth and tunable emission wavelength, find broad applications in displays, LEDs, and detectors. However, achieving exciton-polariton lasing with these materials remains challenging. In this work, we investigate the exciton binding energy variations in CdSe colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) with different thicknesses and demonstrate the integration of CQWs in a face-down aligned configuration within a Fabry–Pérot cavity. This alignment enhances the exciton-photon coupling, leading to increased Rabi splitting energy and stronger coupling compared to randomly oriented CQWs, thereby facilitate exciton-polariton condensation. Due to the enhanced coupling with cavity fields and large exciton binding energy, we report the first observation of room-temperature exciton-polariton BEC and exciton-polariton lasing from CdSe CQWs. By systematically tuning the exciton-photon detuning, we achieve wavelength-tunable polariton lasing from 530 nm to 549 nm, including spectral regions without conventional optical gain, extending lasing beyond the intrinsic emission of 4 ML CQWs.

As such, the Maxwell-Garnett theory enables many practical applications in diverse realms, ranging from photonics, acoustics, mechanics, thermodynamics, to materials science. It has long been thought that the Maxwell-Garnett theory of light in impedance-mismatched periodic structures is valid only within the long-wavelength limit, necessitating either the temporal or spatial period of light to be much larger than that of structures. Here, we break this long-held belief by revealing an anomalous Maxwell-Garnett theory for impedance-mismatched photonic time crystals beyond this long-wavelength limit. The key to this anomaly lies in the Fabry–Pérot resonance. We discover that under the Fabry–Pérot resonance, the impedance-mismatched photonic time crystal could be essentially equivalent to a homogeneous temporal slab simultaneously at specific discrete wavelengths, despite the temporal period of these light being comparable to or even much smaller than that of photonic time crystals.},

  abstract     = {While the electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) have been predicted to strongly suppress phonon transport and lattice thermal conductivity ( κ L ) above room temperature, direct experimental validation remains challenging because the observed reduction of κ L in the doped materials is commonly a result of concurrent enhancement of EPIs and point-defect-induced phonon scattering (PDPS). Here, we circumvent this ambiguity through strategically designed aliovalent-alloying semiconductors (e.g., TiFe 0.5+ x Ni 0.5- x Sb, −0.25 ≤ x ≤ 0.25), where the compositional deviations from x = 0 amplify EPIs while weakening PDPS. Experimentally, we observed a pronounced EPI-driven κ L reduction of ∼50% at room temperature and ∼40% even at 1000 K as carrier concentration approaches 1 × 10 22 cm −3 . The carrier-induced phonon softening and the enhanced electron-phonon scattering rates collectively lead to this remarkable phonon transport attenuation. Our findings establish a quantitative framework for disentangling EPI effects on phonon transport in heavily doped semiconductors or metals, and provide insights into phonon engineering strategies for advanced thermal management materials design.},

  abstract     = {Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is an essential imaging system for observing biological samples with high contrast, low phototoxicity, and rapid image acquisition. Traditional LSFM utilizes Gaussian illumination with a limited system field of view (FOV) due to the short Rayleigh range. As one kind of the propagation-invariant light field, the Airy beam can inherently extend the FOV and enhance the axial resolution for microscopy. However, implementing an Airy-LSFM requires a complex illumination system. Here, we demonstrate that the Airy light-sheet is conveniently integrated into LSFM using a polarization-independent, Airy metasurface to achieve compact illumination, large system FOV, and high image quality. To verify the performance of the metasurface-based Airy LSFM (meta-Airy LSFM), ex vivo imaging of fluorescently labeled Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) embryos was conducted. The Richardson–Lucy deconvolution technique was applied to further improve the image quality. The experimental results show that the axial and lateral resolution of the meta-Airy LSFM is 2.3 and 0.69 μ m, respectively, while the FOV is significantly improved tenfold, up to 200 μ m. The tightly packed integration of the Airy light-sheet metasurface in LSFM enables wide-ranging biological applications and has great potential to be easily adapted across various LSFM modalities.},

Benefiting from their strong photoexcitation under blue light, high PLQY, and good environmental stability, a high-performance white light-emitting diode was developed, achieving a commercial-level luminous efficiency of 101.6 lm W −1 , a high color rendering index of 87, and a record half-lifetime of 2352 h.

However, their Curie temperatures remain far below room temperature and/or the ferroelectric polarization is nearly vanishing. Here, an inequivalent charge strategy is reported that simultaneously enhances the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic ordering in Bi 2 FeMnO 6 double perovskite thin films, effectively exploiting the tunability of chemical strain and valence. Abnormal lattice distortion and differential charge compensation ensure robust ferroelectricity (16.6–29.2 μ C/cm 2 ) and approximately sevenfold enhancement from 8.3 to 60 emu/cm 3 in ferromagnetism, with Curie temperatures of both ferroic orderings exceeding 800 K, which is the best high-temperature metrics for existing multiferroic systems. Since ferroelectricity originates from Bi ions and octahedral distortions, this effectively avoids small polarization and weak A–B site coupling. This mechanism is expected to reignite interest in type I multiferroics and prompt a reexamination of current schemes for overcoming the incompatibility of the multiple ferroic orderings. Our work provides an important technological path and experimental insight for the development of room-temperature multiferroics by leveraging the tunability of double perovskites.},

In this study, we demonstrate that oxygen vacancies can effectively enable the switching between flux-closure and center-type topological structures in PbTiO 3 (PTO) nano-island arrays. Supported by evidence from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning Kelvin probe microscopy, and piezoresponse force microscopy, we demonstrate that a high concentration of oxygen vacancies favors the formation of center-type domains, while the topological structure transitions to the flux-closure configuration following elimination of oxygen vacancies via in situ annealing under various gas atmospheres.

However, traditional structures—such as planar heterojunctions (PHJs) and bulk heterojunctions (BHJs)—face significant challenges. PHJs often suffer from limited exciton dissociation in thick films, while BHJs experience considerable charge transport barriers. Although quasi-planar heterojunctions have been proposed to address these issues, controlling their nanoscale interface remains complex and material-dependent, limiting their applications. Herein, we introduce novel interpenetrated heterojunctions (IPHJs), formed by penetrating a secondary organic semiconductor layer into a porous bottom layer during annealing. This innovative structure is revealed to possess efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. Remarkably, organic photodiodes (OPDs) featuring PM6:N2200 IPHJs demonstrate exceptional performance, achieving a responsivity (R) of 36.5 A/W, a specific detectivity (D * ) of 8.6 × 10 12 Jones, and a response time (τ) of 30 μ s, representing state-of-the-art performance for OPDs. Furthermore, extending the IPHJ concept to tri-layer interpenetrated heterojunctions (T-IPHJs) shows significant promise for organic phototransistor applications. The PM6:N2200 T-IPHJ devices exhibit a responsivity exceeding 44.7 A/W, a D * value reaching 5.23 × 10 14 Jones, and a τ of 70 ms.

Here, we report on fabrication of monolithic, high-quality LT metasurfaces, composed of periodic arrays of LT truncated square pyramids, created by partially etching of a LT thin film layer using a focused ion beam milling process. These pyramidal structures introduce discrete translational symmetry, which allows for the folding of guided-mode dispersion into the first Brillouin zone, leading to the formation of guided mode resonances with Q-factors that can be easily controlled by the height of LT pyramids. The measurements show a Q-factor up to approximately 640 at 786 nm. By leveraging the strong field localization of these high-Q resonances, we demonstrate enhanced second-harmonic generation at 393 nm with an absolute conversion efficiency of 0.042%, establishing a new benchmark for the UV harmonic generation in dielectric metasurfaces. Moreover, our fabrication technique can be readily adapted to a wide range of other material platforms, opening new avenues for the development of high-quality UV metasurfaces and advanced nonlinear photonic meta-devices.},

However, the stochastic nature of resistive switching (RS) in memristors often leads to poor device stability and uniformity, hindering the scalability required for real-world applications. Here, we present a novel phase segregation strategy to achieve uniformly distributed self-assembled Ni nanofilaments within a BaTiO 3 matrix, enabling local deterministic redox reactions for RS, as confirmed by comprehensive structural, local, and macroscopic RS studies. This approach yields drastic enhancement in cyclic performance and device uniformity, with the average cyclic variances of Set voltage and low resistance state down to 1.4% and 9.6%, respectively. The devices also exhibit excellent endurance (10 9 cycles) and ultrafast programming speed (down to 100 ns) and achieve over 5-bit level long-term memory states. The enhanced cyclic stability and device uniformity translate to high training and learning accuracies (95%) in a three-level deep neural network, with 1-bit inputs.

  abstract     = {Red InGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit lower internal quantum efficiencies than violet, blue, and green InGaN LEDs due to a reduction in radiative recombination rates relative to non-radiative recombination rates as the Indium composition increases. Additionally, the larger polarization and band offset barriers between high indium content InGaN quantum wells and GaN quantum barriers increase the forward voltage. In blue and green LEDs, random alloy fluctuations and V-defects play a key role in reducing the forward voltage. When V-defects are present, either naturally or intentionally introduced, they create an alternative path for carrier injection into the MQWs through the V-defect sidewalls. This injection mechanism explains the turn-on voltages of green LEDs. However, in InGaN red LEDs, these two phenomena do not reduce the forward voltage as effectively as in blue and green LEDs, and consequently, the computed forward voltage remains significantly higher than the measured one. Furthermore, currents are observed at low voltages before the turn-on voltage ( ⁠ V < ℏ ω / e = 2.0 V ⁠ ) of red LEDs. To address this, we introduce dislocation-induced tail states in the modeling, suggesting that leakage current through these states may play a significant role both below and at turn-on voltages. The simulation also indicates that leakage carriers below turn-on accumulate, partially diffuse in the QWs, screen the polarization-induced barrier in the low injection regime, and further reduce the forward voltage. Despite these beneficial effects, a drawback of dislocation-induced tail states is the enhanced nonradiative recombination in the dislocation line region. This study provides a detailed analysis of device injection physics in InGaN QW red LEDs and outlines potential optimization strategies.},

  abstract     = {Interactions among various electronic states, such as charge density waves (CDWs), magnetism, and superconductivity, are pivotal in strongly correlated systems. While the relationship between CDWs and superconductivity has been extensively studied, the interplay between CDWs and magnetic order remains largely elusive. Kagome lattices, with their intrinsic nontrivial topology, charge order, and magnetism, provide a compelling framework for investigating these interactions. In this work, we unravel the orbital origins of magnetic moment modulation induced by CDW in the kagome magnet FeGe, a system exhibiting a unique coupling between CDW and magnetism. The combination of x-ray absorption spectroscopic experiments and first-principles calculations shed light on the temperature-dependent behavior of Fe3 d –Ge4 p orbital hybridization and corroborate its significant impact on the magnetic properties of FeGe. These findings introduce an orbital dimension to the correlation between charge and magnetic degrees of freedom, advancing our understanding of the intriguing quantum phases resulting from this interplay.},

  abstract     = {Gallium oxide (Ga 2 O 3 ) has been the subject of extensive research over the past decade due to its potential in next-generation power electronics and solar-blind ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors. While Ga 2 O 3 exhibits promising material characteristics for applications in harsh environments, its commercial viability remains under debate, particularly when compared to materials such as aluminum nitride (AlN) and diamond, which possess superior intrinsic properties. This perspective addresses the critical challenges that currently impede the widespread commercialization of Ga 2 O 3 -based devices. These challenges include a relatively immature technology base, the difficulty in achieving stable p-type conductivity, inherently low thermal conductivity, the presence of crystallographic defects (nano- and micro-voids), and elevated fabrication costs, all of which negatively impact device reliability and scalability. Mitigation strategies, such as heterojunction implementation, the development of thermal management solutions such as wafer bonding, and defect passivation approaches, are also under investigation. The near-term feasibility of commercially viable Ga 2 O 3 -based power electronic devices is a central focus of this discussion. The current status is that Ga 2 O 3 development is far advanced relative to either diamond or especially AlN power electronics but is hampered by lack of a broad base of substrate vendors and a compelling vision for device implementations that provide sufficient improvement over SiC power devices. There are strong geographic differences in device focus, with China prioritizing implementation in grid applications while the United States/Europe appear to consider Ga 2 O 3 devices more for defense and aerospace applications.},

  abstract     = {Green hydrogen (H 2 ) production via water electrolysis offers a sustainable pathway to decarbonize various industries, driven by its potential to replace fossil fuels and achieve carbon neutrality. Traditional approaches to catalyst development for H 2 production, such as electrochemical catalysis (EC), photoelectrochemical catalysis (PEC), and photocatalysis (PC), have predominantly relied on empirical, trial-and-error methods. While significant progress has been made, these methods are time-consuming, costly, and limited by the complexity of multicomponent catalysts and reaction systems. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as transformative tools for accelerating catalyst discovery and optimization. AI-driven approaches enable high-throughput screening of materials, prediction of catalyst performance, and real-time reaction mechanisms, offering a more efficient alternative to conventional experimentation. This review examines the current state of catalyst development for green H 2 production, highlighting the role of AI in optimizing hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER). We explore advancements in electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, and photocatalytic systems, emphasizing the potential of AI to revolutionize the field. By integrating AI with experimental techniques, researchers are poised to achieve breakthroughs in efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, accelerating the transition toward a sustainable, hydrogen-powered future.},

In the first category, microstructured surfaces enhance photovoltaic performance through improved sunlight steering and capture. In the second category, they enable passive radiative cooling by efficiently emitting heat as thermal radiation while transmitting or reflecting solar radiation. Compared to nanostructured coatings, microstructured designs offer distinct advantages for large-area applications, including compatibility with scalable fabrication techniques and precise, angle-selective optical control. The review covers both horizontal (roof- or ground-mounted) and vertical (building-integrated) configurations, underscoring how each configuration demands specialized microstructural strategies to address different incident sunlight conditions and thermal management challenges.

The global Ni-MH market continues to grow steadily, reflecting their continued importance in applications demanding safety, environmental compatibility, and reliability. This review provides a critical analysis of electrochemical techniques used to investigate metal hydride electrodes for Ni-MH batteries. We examine the thermodynamic and kinetic phenomena of hydrogen storage in intermetallic compounds, focusing on the correlation between gas-phase hydrogen interactions and electrochemical processes. The review systematically analyzes various methods including cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, chronoamperometry, galvanostatic and potentiostatic intermittent titration techniques (GITT and PITT), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For each method, we discuss theoretical foundations, practical applications, and fundamental limitations when applied to metal hydride systems. Our analysis reveals significant challenges in the direct application of methodologies originally developed for liquid-phase electrochemical systems to solid-state metal hydride electrodes. This methodological transfer without appropriate modifications has resulted in inconsistent data interpretation and discrepancies in reported parameters, particularly for hydrogen diffusion coefficients determined by different techniques. We identify common methodological errors and provide guidelines for more accurate experimental design and data analysis. The critical examination presented in this review demonstrates the necessity for researchers to carefully consider the fundamental differences between liquid-phase and solid-state electrochemical processes when selecting and applying characterization methods. Given the continued importance of Ni-MH batteries in energy infrastructure, establishing reliable characterization protocols is important for advancing the fundamental understanding and technological development of metal hydride electrode materials.},

  abstract     = {Traditional hydrogen storage materials rely mainly on chemical adsorption (such as metal hydrides and chemical hydrides) or physical adsorption (such as metal–organic frameworks, activated carbon, zeolites, and other high-specific surface area materials) to achieve the storage and release of hydrogen. However, these materials struggle to simultaneously meet the technical requirements of high-capacity, rapid, and reversible hydrogen absorption and desorption under room temperature and atmospheric pressure. In recent years, both theoretical predictions and experimental research have indicated that nontraditional hydrogen storage materials based on hybrid adsorption mechanisms (such as physical adsorption, chemical adsorption, Kubas-type interactions, static electric polarization, and weak chemical adsorption)—namely, MXene materials—are promising for rapid and high-capacity hydrogen storage under normal conditions. This review aims to focus on the intrinsic principles of the diverse hybrid mechanisms of MXene materials and recent research progress of MXene as a hydrogen carrier. By detailed analysis of their structural characteristics, surface properties, and the specific mechanisms of interaction with hydrogen, it strives to deepen the understanding of the physicochemical principles of MXene materials as a hydrogen storage material.},

  abstract     = {The rise of high-performance functional devices has driven significant breakthroughs in various research fields, with ultrafast laser processing offering unprecedented opportunities for advanced device fabrication. This review summarizes recent progress and future prospects for ultrafast laser in fabricating functional optical, semiconductor, and sensor devices. Central to these advances is a deeper understanding of ultrafast laser–matter interaction physics, including nonlinear optical effects, multiphoton ionization, avalanche ionization, and laser-induced plasma dynamics. These phenomena govern carrier excitation, energy deposition, and subsequent structural modification. We further review how such interactions enable controlled refractive index changes, selective ablation, and nanoscale material structuring in photosensitive, dielectric, semiconductor, and metallic substrates. Key applications are then reviewed, including ultrafast laser fabrication of optical devices (e.g., optical waveguide devices, optical data storage elements, optical elements, and artificial compound eyes, integrated photonic devices), semiconductor devices (e.g., semiconductor light-emitting devices, photodiodes, solar cells, and photodetectors), and sensors (e.g., fiber optic sensors, flexible sensors, and biochemical sensors). Recent breakthroughs showcase ultrafast laser-induced precision in device miniaturization, improved optoelectronic characteristics, and integration of complex functions (e.g., topological photonic circuits fabricated via sub-100-nm laser writing, 5D optical data storage in glass with > 1 TB/cm 3 density, perovskite solar cells achieving 25.7% efficiency through laser-induced phase engineering, alongside plasmonic biosensors with 100× sensitivity enhancement, and stretchable graphene sensors for wearables). Finally, this review discusses core challenges, such as enhancing the scalability of ultrafast laser processes for industrial-scale production and optimizing laser-material interactions to improve device reliability and performance. Future efforts should address key challenges such as the limited scalability of ultrafast laser processing and the incomplete understanding of laser–matter interactions at ultrafast timescales. Integrating ultrafast lasers with AI-driven control, beam shaping, and advanced materials such as 2D heterostructures may enable smarter and more multifunctional device platforms. A unified theoretical framework is also needed to guide precise and efficient fabrication. These directions highlight critical opportunities for bridging current limitations and enabling transformative advances. While not exhaustive, this review lays a foundation for further research into the transformative potential of ultrafast laser in functional device fabrication.},

While the electrified solid–liquid interface has been extensively studied, its multiphase counterpart involving immiscible liquid–liquid interfaces presents unique challenges due to the interacting behaviors of ion transport within the Debye layer and solvent mixing layer. Electrokinetic multiphase hydrodynamics (EKmHD), dating back to the early 20th century, has regained prominence since the 2010s, supported by advanced methods spanning microfluidics, spectroscopy, molecular dynamics, phase-field-based modeling, coarse-grained analysis, and high-performance computing. After briefly sketching fundamental mechanisms, this review establishes a unified framework of experimental, theoretical, and numerical issues to consolidate the quantitative methodology of EKmHD, which is essential to uncover the underlying interfacial transport mechanisms. The systematic synthesis will not only advance predictive modeling methods for liquid–liquid electrokinetics but also propel the technological developments in multiphase-system-based energy conversion, bio-medical devices, and smart fluidics.},

  abstract     = {For over three decades, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has been a key method for exploring material structures and functionalities at nanometer and often atomic scales in ambient, liquid, and vacuum environments. Historically, SPM applications have predominantly been downstream, with images and spectra serving as a qualitative source of data on the microstructure and properties of materials, and in rare cases of fundamental physical knowledge. However, the fast-growing developments in accelerated material synthesis via self-driving labs and established applications such as combinatorial spread libraries are poised to change this paradigm. Rapid synthesis demands matching capabilities to probe the structure and functionalities of materials on small scales and with high throughput. SPM inherently meets these criteria, offering a rich and diverse array of data from a single measurement. Here, we overview SPM methods applicable to these emerging applications and emphasize their quantitativeness, focusing on piezoresponse force microscopy, electrochemical strain microscopy, conductive, and surface photovoltage measurements. We discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead, asserting that SPM will play a crucial role in closing the loop from material prediction and synthesis to characterization.},

Their disease and/or loss are most debilitating and afflict millions of Americans, reducing productivity and deteriorating quality of life. Due to limited treatments, scientists, engineers, and clinical doctors are investigating new tissue engineering solutions. In tissue engineering approaches, scaffolds are artificially designed temporary matrices that accommodate stem/progenitor cells and provide both physical and biological signals to guide cell differentiation and 3D tissue regeneration but eventually degrade and leave behind regenerated functional tissues or organs. Therefore, scaffolds often substantially benefit from mimicking certain features of the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) and designing certain engineered features to facilitate cell repopulation, mass transportation, and mechanical and biological cues for cells to regenerate tissue. This review article focuses on the design, synthesis, fabrication, and functionalization of nanofibrous materials to mimic the ECM, deliver biological signals, and integrate various engineering design features such as pore shape, size, connectivity, tissue architectures, and anatomic tissue/organ shapes to guide 3D tissue regeneration. In addition to biological and physical principles of scaffold design and fabrication, we also provide several examples of specific applications of these advanced nanofibrous scaffolds for bone, cartilage, and their associated composite tissue regeneration in osteochondral defects. We also discuss the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary nature of these research directions, the importance of collaborations across disciplines, and the perspectives of future developments in the field.},

However, challenges such as high defect densities, small grain sizes, and unstable n-type conduction have limited their practical application. In this paper, we review the progress in the solid-phase crystallization of Ge thin films on insulating substrates. We first discuss conventional processes with excessive nucleation that lead to poor crystallinity and electrical properties. We then introduce advanced solid-phase crystallization strategies, highlighting the critical role of controlling the amorphous deposition temperature to control atomic density, increase grain size, and reduce acceptor defects. Additionally, the incorporation of tin (Sn) has been shown to passivate grain boundaries, while the modulation of film thickness and the introduction of interfacial layers have demonstrated the ability to mitigate carrier scattering at the substrate interface. This review also addresses impurity doping techniques for precise Fermi level control, strain engineering effects on grain boundary barrier energies, and metal-induced lateral crystallization for grain alignment. These innovations have culminated in achieving record-high carrier mobilities of 690 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for p-type and 450 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for n-type films, approaching single-crystal performance. The insights provided herein will pave the way for the development of high-performance Ge-based thin-film transistors and flexible electronic devices via low-temperature processing.},

  abstract     = {The field of 2D materials has grown dramatically in the past two decades. 2D materials can be utilized for a variety of next-generation optoelectronic, spintronic, clean energy, and quantum computing applications. These 2D structures, which are often exfoliated from layered van der Waals materials, possess highly inhomogeneous electron densities and can possess short- and long-range electron correlations. The complexities of 2D materials make them challenging to study with standard mean-field electronic structure methods such as density functional theory (DFT), which relies on approximations for the unknown exchange-correlation functional. To overcome the limitations of DFT, highly accurate many-body electronic structure approaches such as diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) can be utilized. In the past decade, DMC has been used to calculate accurate magnetic, electronic, excitonic, and topological properties in addition to accurately capturing interlayer interactions and cohesion and adsorption energetics of 2D materials. This approach has been applied to 2D systems of wide interest, including graphene, phosphorene, MoS 2 , CrI 3 , VSe 2 , GaSe, GeSe, borophene, and several others.

While traditional far-field spectroscopy and electromagnetic simulations have been used to study Mie scattering, these methods lack real-space imaging capabilities, limiting their ability to capture single-particle scattering phenomena. Scanning probe microscopy-based nanoscopy techniques have become essential for studying Mie scattering at the nanoscale to address this limitation. This review explores the theoretical foundations of Mie scattering and the role of near-field microscopy in bridging the gap between theory and experiment through high-resolution imaging. By focusing on real-space imaging, we highlight the practical aspects of Mie scattering and its applications in fields such as biosensing, photocatalysis, and materials science. Nanoscopy techniques allow for direct visualization of scattering processes in nanostructures, offering more profound insights into how NPs interact with light at the nanoscale. Additionally, we discuss the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance near-field analysis, providing more accurate interpretations of Mie scattering phenomena. In conclusion, combining advanced nanoscopy and AI-driven analysis will significantly advance our understanding of Mie scattering and its diverse applications in various scientific and technological fields. The synergy between cutting-edge imaging methods and computational simulation not only enriches our theoretical understanding of scattering phenomena but also accelerates the development of next-generation photonic devices, paving the way for a wide range of practical applications across scientific and technological domains.},

These platforms can be broadly categorized into electronic, photonic, magnetic, and multi-physical modalities, significantly expanding therapeutic strategies across medical disciplines. Electronic platforms encompass electrical stimulation-based therapies and electrical-actuated drug delivery, leveraging self-powered technologies for minimally invasive solutions. Photonic platforms harness the interactions between photons and biological tissues for cutting-edge disease treatment, addressing limitations in tissue penetration depth. Magnetic therapies exploit magnetic fluid hyperthermia effect, magneto-mechanical effect, and direct magnetic stimulation, with implantable platforms enhancing magnetic energy conversion and ensuring accurate target in treatments. In practical applications, various physical platforms exhibit overlapping functionalities while maintaining distinct advantages within their operational domains. The multi-physics platform synergistically integrates the complementary benefits of individual platforms, thereby significantly expanding its potential application scope.

Combining a high-pressure apparatus with a low-temperature cryostat requires the design of a compact-scale high-pressure apparatus which generally results in reduced sample volume. In the magnetic measurements, this requires the use of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which is a highly sensitive magnetic device for detecting changes in minute magnetic fluxes. In this review, two types of SQUID magnetometers for pressure ( P ) of up to 30 GPa are reviewed. One is a commercial SQUID magnetometer with a miniature diamond anvil cell (DAC) covering a wide temperature range of 1.8–400 K, and the other is a vibrating-coil SQUID magnetometer equipped with DAC, which provides more accurate measurements. The former was used for oxygen molecules, molecule-based magnets, permanent magnets, organic radial ferromagnets, and lanthanide ferromagnets, whereas the latter was applied to organic radial ferromagnets, samarium (Sm), and an iron-based superconductor. Further developments of accurate magnetization measurements at high pressures are important for condensed matter studies on magnets and superconductors.},

  abstract     = {III-V multi-junction solar cells have yielded the highest solar cell efficiencies for nearly three decades and recently achieved record efficiencies approaching 40% under standard conditions and 50% under concentrated sunlight. Such high efficiencies are currently only possible using four or more junctions to partition the broad solar spectrum into bins where each subcell efficiently collects a narrow range of photon energies. High-efficiency, wide-bandgap (1.7–2.2 eV) absorbers play a crucial role in multi-junction solar cells by efficiently converting visible photons into electrons and delivering them at high voltage. Since all subcells are interconnected in series, the widest bandgap junction produces both the highest voltage and highest power in the stack. Wide-bandgap absorbers also present the greatest materials challenges in the stack, including high aluminum content, lattice mismatch, lack of heterojunction barriers, and the sensitivity of phosphides to defects such as vacancies and oxygen. We review the history, current status, and opportunities for wide-bandgap III-V solar cells, ranging from ∼1.7 eV for the top subcell of III-V/Si hybrid tandems to >2.2 eV for the top subcell of a 6+ junction stack.

In coupled electron–phonon transport, we discuss the basics of electron–phonon interactions and their effects on phonon dynamics, thermalization, and nonequilibrium thermal transport. For the phonon–spin interaction, nonequilibrium transport formulation is introduced first, followed by the physics of spin thermoelectric effect and strategies to manipulate them. Contributions to thermal conductivity from magnons as heat carriers are also reviewed.

Unlike electrostrictive and magnetostrictive effects, it does not involve complex circuits, therefore offering a promising prospect of accomplishing the advanced, compact, and remote-control devices. The key step to produce the light-induced strain of practical value is to design highly efficient photostrictive materials. Based upon the nature of the material systems to be explored for micro-optomechanical devices, the photostriction in inorganic–materials-based systems, including semiconductors, transition metal oxides, halide perovskites, and ferroelectrics in bulk and two-dimensions, are summarized herein. For each material, the feasible strategies of compositional engineering, processing conditions, and sample sculpturing, with a special focus on the meticulous tailoring of multiple phase boundaries in representative ferroelectric systems to produce significant photostriction, are given. Since ferroelectric photostriction is accounted as the superposition effect of photovoltaic and inverse piezoelectric effects, both effects are introduced and discussed. Finally, perspectives on future research of photostrictive materials are added. We believe that this review will bring new insights in producing highly efficient photostrictive materials for the commercial production of upcoming state-of-the-art micro optomechanical devices.},

While acoustic patterning has demonstrated remarkable control over microscale spatial configurations, its scalability into three-dimensional (3D) fabrication has remained constrained by challenges in bonding limitations and vertical stacking. To solve this challenge, hybrid acoustic-assisted 3D printing integrates acoustophoresis with established methods, such as direct ink writing and stereolithography, enhancing material deposition accuracy, microstructure alignment, and porous structuring of 3D printed products. However, these hybrid systems remain tethered to layer-by-layer architectures, limiting the full potential of acoustic techniques. Recent breakthroughs in standalone acoustic 3D fabrication, leveraging levitation, focusing, and ejection, have unlocked potential in contactless, layerless, and flexible multi-material assembly. Acoustic levitation systems enable mid-air construction on non-planar surfaces, and focused ultrasound techniques facilitate deep-penetration polymerization and acoustic droplet ejection advances nozzle-free droplet-based bioprinting.
