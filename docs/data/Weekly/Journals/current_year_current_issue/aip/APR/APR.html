  abstract     = {Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) composed of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterostructures are proposed to be a plausible scheme to achieve larger tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) than the conventional MTJs. The spin transport across the interfaces is affected not only by the Brillouin zone (BZ) filtering but also by the interfacial bonds. This work focuses on studying the 2H Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS 2 ) van der Waals layers as the tunnel barrier, and Cobalt (Co) as the electrode. The TMR varies with different adsorption interfaces, yet none have achieved the desired levels because the momentum-resolved transmissions of Co and MoS 2 in the folded horizontal BZ do not match well, resulting in inefficient spin filtering and thereby a low TMR. The effects of interfacial bonds on spin transport and magnetic anisotropy are studied. The orientations of bonds determine the anisotropy of the interfacial Co. Vertical bonds stabilize the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), while non-vertical bonds cause in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). The layers below exhibit PMA, so both types of MTJs overall support PMA, while the physisorbed MTJ is stronger. The positive relation between the transmission and the electron density near the Fermi level is weakened by the bonds, as the scattering centers hold back the spin injection. Our work further strengthens the importance of BZ filtering in governing TMR and the design principle of MTJ, as well as how bonds affect the overall device performance.},

  abstract     = {Transistors based on two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have emerged as promising candidates for ultra-scaled computing devices. By suspending the 2D channels and inducing mechanical resonance modes in the 2D semiconducting membranes, they form 2D vibrating-channel-transistor (VCT) resonators with ultralow power consumption. Yet on-chip electronic detection and tuning of multimode resonances in these 2D VCT resonators have been challenging due to the ultrasmall vibration amplitudes and rich multimode dynamics at radio frequencies (RF). Here, we leverage the atomic-scale thickness, ultrahigh strain limit, as well as strain-engineering effects on band structure and carrier mobility of 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) sheets, and experimentally demonstrate multimode 2D MoS 2 VCT resonators. Using all-electronic signal transduction, we show single-, bi-, and tri-layer MoS 2 VCT resonators with up to the 14th resonance mode, thanks to the ultra-efficient electromechanical transduction enabled by internal multiphysics coupling. Measured gate dependency of multimode resonances exhibits frequency tuning ranges of Δ f / f 0 up to 326%. These 2D VCT resonators provide a unique platform for engineering on-chip integrated and ultra-scaled RF signal transduction, sensing, and analog computing elements with multimode and hyperspectral capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Exciton-polariton lasing is the spontaneous coherent emission resulting from exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), facilitated by polariton-polariton simulated scattering. This process does not require population inversion, unlike conventional photonic lasers. II-VI/III-V colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, known for their narrow emission linewidth and tunable emission wavelength, find broad applications in displays, LEDs, and detectors. However, achieving exciton-polariton lasing with these materials remains challenging. In this work, we investigate the exciton binding energy variations in CdSe colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) with different thicknesses and demonstrate the integration of CQWs in a face-down aligned configuration within a Fabry–Pérot cavity. This alignment enhances the exciton-photon coupling, leading to increased Rabi splitting energy and stronger coupling compared to randomly oriented CQWs, thereby facilitate exciton-polariton condensation. Due to the enhanced coupling with cavity fields and large exciton binding energy, we report the first observation of room-temperature exciton-polariton BEC and exciton-polariton lasing from CdSe CQWs. By systematically tuning the exciton-photon detuning, we achieve wavelength-tunable polariton lasing from 530 nm to 549 nm, including spectral regions without conventional optical gain, extending lasing beyond the intrinsic emission of 4 ML CQWs. These findings establish CdSe CQWs as effective platform for polariton-based optoelectronics.},

  abstract     = {The Maxwell-Garnett theory, dating back to James Clerk Maxwell-Garnett's foundational work in 1904, provides a simple yet powerful framework to describe the inhomogeneous structure as an effective homogeneous medium, which significantly reduces the overall complexity of analysis, calculation, and design. As such, the Maxwell-Garnett theory enables many practical applications in diverse realms, ranging from photonics, acoustics, mechanics, thermodynamics, to materials science. It has long been thought that the Maxwell-Garnett theory of light in impedance-mismatched periodic structures is valid only within the long-wavelength limit, necessitating either the temporal or spatial period of light to be much larger than that of structures. Here, we break this long-held belief by revealing an anomalous Maxwell-Garnett theory for impedance-mismatched photonic time crystals beyond this long-wavelength limit. The key to this anomaly lies in the Fabry–Pérot resonance. We discover that under the Fabry–Pérot resonance, the impedance-mismatched photonic time crystal could be essentially equivalent to a homogeneous temporal slab simultaneously at specific discrete wavelengths, despite the temporal period of these light being comparable to or even much smaller than that of photonic time crystals.},

  abstract     = {While the electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) have been predicted to strongly suppress phonon transport and lattice thermal conductivity ( κ L ) above room temperature, direct experimental validation remains challenging because the observed reduction of κ L in the doped materials is commonly a result of concurrent enhancement of EPIs and point-defect-induced phonon scattering (PDPS). Here, we circumvent this ambiguity through strategically designed aliovalent-alloying semiconductors (e.g., TiFe 0.5+ x Ni 0.5- x Sb, −0.25 ≤ x ≤ 0.25), where the compositional deviations from x = 0 amplify EPIs while weakening PDPS. Experimentally, we observed a pronounced EPI-driven κ L reduction of ∼50% at room temperature and ∼40% even at 1000 K as carrier concentration approaches 1 × 10 22 cm −3 . The carrier-induced phonon softening and the enhanced electron-phonon scattering rates collectively lead to this remarkable phonon transport attenuation. Our findings establish a quantitative framework for disentangling EPI effects on phonon transport in heavily doped semiconductors or metals, and provide insights into phonon engineering strategies for advanced thermal management materials design.},

  abstract     = {Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is an essential imaging system for observing biological samples with high contrast, low phototoxicity, and rapid image acquisition. Traditional LSFM utilizes Gaussian illumination with a limited system field of view (FOV) due to the short Rayleigh range. As one kind of the propagation-invariant light field, the Airy beam can inherently extend the FOV and enhance the axial resolution for microscopy. However, implementing an Airy-LSFM requires a complex illumination system. Here, we demonstrate that the Airy light-sheet is conveniently integrated into LSFM using a polarization-independent, Airy metasurface to achieve compact illumination, large system FOV, and high image quality. To verify the performance of the metasurface-based Airy LSFM (meta-Airy LSFM), ex vivo imaging of fluorescently labeled Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) embryos was conducted. The Richardson–Lucy deconvolution technique was applied to further improve the image quality. The experimental results show that the axial and lateral resolution of the meta-Airy LSFM is 2.3 and 0.69 μ m, respectively, while the FOV is significantly improved tenfold, up to 200 μ m. The tightly packed integration of the Airy light-sheet metasurface in LSFM enables wide-ranging biological applications and has great potential to be easily adapted across various LSFM modalities.},

Here, an inequivalent charge strategy is reported that simultaneously enhances the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic ordering in Bi 2 FeMnO 6 double perovskite thin films, effectively exploiting the tunability of chemical strain and valence. Abnormal lattice distortion and differential charge compensation ensure robust ferroelectricity (16.6–29.2 μ C/cm 2 ) and approximately sevenfold enhancement from 8.3 to 60 emu/cm 3 in ferromagnetism, with Curie temperatures of both ferroic orderings exceeding 800 K, which is the best high-temperature metrics for existing multiferroic systems. Since ferroelectricity originates from Bi ions and octahedral distortions, this effectively avoids small polarization and weak A–B site coupling. This mechanism is expected to reignite interest in type I multiferroics and prompt a reexamination of current schemes for overcoming the incompatibility of the multiple ferroic orderings. Our work provides an important technological path and experimental insight for the development of room-temperature multiferroics by leveraging the tunability of double perovskites.},

While manipulation techniques such as strain (via substrates), electric fields, and temperature are commonly employed, switching induced by charged defects between different polar topological structures remains a rarely observed phenomenon. In this study, we demonstrate that oxygen vacancies can effectively enable the switching between flux-closure and center-type topological structures in PbTiO 3 (PTO) nano-island arrays. Supported by evidence from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning Kelvin probe microscopy, and piezoresponse force microscopy, we demonstrate that a high concentration of oxygen vacancies favors the formation of center-type domains, while the topological structure transitions to the flux-closure configuration following elimination of oxygen vacancies via in situ annealing under various gas atmospheres. This deterministic switching between the two polar topological structures highlights the critical role of charged defects and opens new avenues for the manipulation of polar topological structures in future applications.},

  abstract     = {Heterojunctions are indispensable for fabricating high-performance organic photodetectors. However, traditional structures—such as planar heterojunctions (PHJs) and bulk heterojunctions (BHJs)—face significant challenges. PHJs often suffer from limited exciton dissociation in thick films, while BHJs experience considerable charge transport barriers. Although quasi-planar heterojunctions have been proposed to address these issues, controlling their nanoscale interface remains complex and material-dependent, limiting their applications. Herein, we introduce novel interpenetrated heterojunctions (IPHJs), formed by penetrating a secondary organic semiconductor layer into a porous bottom layer during annealing. This innovative structure is revealed to possess efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. Remarkably, organic photodiodes (OPDs) featuring PM6:N2200 IPHJs demonstrate exceptional performance, achieving a responsivity (R) of 36.5 A/W, a specific detectivity (D * ) of 8.6 × 10 12 Jones, and a response time (τ) of 30 μ s, representing state-of-the-art performance for OPDs. Furthermore, extending the IPHJ concept to tri-layer interpenetrated heterojunctions (T-IPHJs) shows significant promise for organic phototransistor applications. The PM6:N2200 T-IPHJ devices exhibit a responsivity exceeding 44.7 A/W, a D * value reaching 5.23 × 10 14 Jones, and a τ of 70 ms. These results show the potential of IPHJs to advance the field of high-performance organic photodetectors and related devices.},

  abstract     = {Lithium tantalate (LiTaO 3 , LT), structurally similar to lithium niobate, possesses a broad spectrum of optoelectronic properties that hold significant promise for integrated photonics applications. Due to its larger bandgap and higher optical damage threshold, LT can be employed for efficient nonlinear optical frequency conversion in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelength range. Here, we report on fabrication of monolithic, high-quality LT metasurfaces, composed of periodic arrays of LT truncated square pyramids, created by partially etching of a LT thin film layer using a focused ion beam milling process. These pyramidal structures introduce discrete translational symmetry, which allows for the folding of guided-mode dispersion into the first Brillouin zone, leading to the formation of guided mode resonances with Q-factors that can be easily controlled by the height of LT pyramids. The measurements show a Q-factor up to approximately 640 at 786 nm. By leveraging the strong field localization of these high-Q resonances, we demonstrate enhanced second-harmonic generation at 393 nm with an absolute conversion efficiency of 0.042%, establishing a new benchmark for the UV harmonic generation in dielectric metasurfaces. Moreover, our fabrication technique can be readily adapted to a wide range of other material platforms, opening new avenues for the development of high-quality UV metasurfaces and advanced nonlinear photonic meta-devices.},

  abstract     = {Memristor crossbar arrays, mimicking the human brain, hold immense potential for energy-efficient data-intensive computations in artificial intelligence applications such as image recognition and natural language processing. However, the stochastic nature of resistive switching (RS) in memristors often leads to poor device stability and uniformity, hindering the scalability required for real-world applications. Here, we present a novel phase segregation strategy to achieve uniformly distributed self-assembled Ni nanofilaments within a BaTiO 3 matrix, enabling local deterministic redox reactions for RS, as confirmed by comprehensive structural, local, and macroscopic RS studies. This approach yields drastic enhancement in cyclic performance and device uniformity, with the average cyclic variances of Set voltage and low resistance state down to 1.4% and 9.6%, respectively. The devices also exhibit excellent endurance (10 9 cycles) and ultrafast programming speed (down to 100 ns) and achieve over 5-bit level long-term memory states. The enhanced cyclic stability and device uniformity translate to high training and learning accuracies (95%) in a three-level deep neural network, with 1-bit inputs. Our phase segregation strategy provides a generic pathway to overcome the long-standing challenge of device variability in neuromorphic computing.},

  abstract     = {Red InGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit lower internal quantum efficiencies than violet, blue, and green InGaN LEDs due to a reduction in radiative recombination rates relative to non-radiative recombination rates as the Indium composition increases. Additionally, the larger polarization and band offset barriers between high indium content InGaN quantum wells and GaN quantum barriers increase the forward voltage. In blue and green LEDs, random alloy fluctuations and V-defects play a key role in reducing the forward voltage. When V-defects are present, either naturally or intentionally introduced, they create an alternative path for carrier injection into the MQWs through the V-defect sidewalls. This injection mechanism explains the turn-on voltages of green LEDs. However, in InGaN red LEDs, these two phenomena do not reduce the forward voltage as effectively as in blue and green LEDs, and consequently, the computed forward voltage remains significantly higher than the measured one. Furthermore, currents are observed at low voltages before the turn-on voltage ( ⁠ V < ℏ ω / e = 2.0 V ⁠ ) of red LEDs. To address this, we introduce dislocation-induced tail states in the modeling, suggesting that leakage current through these states may play a significant role both below and at turn-on voltages. The simulation also indicates that leakage carriers below turn-on accumulate, partially diffuse in the QWs, screen the polarization-induced barrier in the low injection regime, and further reduce the forward voltage. Despite these beneficial effects, a drawback of dislocation-induced tail states is the enhanced nonradiative recombination in the dislocation line region. This study provides a detailed analysis of device injection physics in InGaN QW red LEDs and outlines potential optimization strategies.},

Kagome lattices, with their intrinsic nontrivial topology, charge order, and magnetism, provide a compelling framework for investigating these interactions. In this work, we unravel the orbital origins of magnetic moment modulation induced by CDW in the kagome magnet FeGe, a system exhibiting a unique coupling between CDW and magnetism. The combination of x-ray absorption spectroscopic experiments and first-principles calculations shed light on the temperature-dependent behavior of Fe3 d –Ge4 p orbital hybridization and corroborate its significant impact on the magnetic properties of FeGe.

The global Ni-MH market continues to grow steadily, reflecting their continued importance in applications demanding safety, environmental compatibility, and reliability. This review provides a critical analysis of electrochemical techniques used to investigate metal hydride electrodes for Ni-MH batteries. We examine the thermodynamic and kinetic phenomena of hydrogen storage in intermetallic compounds, focusing on the correlation between gas-phase hydrogen interactions and electrochemical processes. The review systematically analyzes various methods including cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, chronoamperometry, galvanostatic and potentiostatic intermittent titration techniques (GITT and PITT), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For each method, we discuss theoretical foundations, practical applications, and fundamental limitations when applied to metal hydride systems. Our analysis reveals significant challenges in the direct application of methodologies originally developed for liquid-phase electrochemical systems to solid-state metal hydride electrodes. This methodological transfer without appropriate modifications has resulted in inconsistent data interpretation and discrepancies in reported parameters, particularly for hydrogen diffusion coefficients determined by different techniques. We identify common methodological errors and provide guidelines for more accurate experimental design and data analysis. The critical examination presented in this review demonstrates the necessity for researchers to carefully consider the fundamental differences between liquid-phase and solid-state electrochemical processes when selecting and applying characterization methods. Given the continued importance of Ni-MH batteries in energy infrastructure, establishing reliable characterization protocols is important for advancing the fundamental understanding and technological development of metal hydride electrode materials.},

  abstract     = {The rise of high-performance functional devices has driven significant breakthroughs in various research fields, with ultrafast laser processing offering unprecedented opportunities for advanced device fabrication. This review summarizes recent progress and future prospects for ultrafast laser in fabricating functional optical, semiconductor, and sensor devices. Central to these advances is a deeper understanding of ultrafast laser–matter interaction physics, including nonlinear optical effects, multiphoton ionization, avalanche ionization, and laser-induced plasma dynamics. These phenomena govern carrier excitation, energy deposition, and subsequent structural modification. We further review how such interactions enable controlled refractive index changes, selective ablation, and nanoscale material structuring in photosensitive, dielectric, semiconductor, and metallic substrates. Key applications are then reviewed, including ultrafast laser fabrication of optical devices (e.g., optical waveguide devices, optical data storage elements, optical elements, and artificial compound eyes, integrated photonic devices), semiconductor devices (e.g., semiconductor light-emitting devices, photodiodes, solar cells, and photodetectors), and sensors (e.g., fiber optic sensors, flexible sensors, and biochemical sensors). Recent breakthroughs showcase ultrafast laser-induced precision in device miniaturization, improved optoelectronic characteristics, and integration of complex functions (e.g., topological photonic circuits fabricated via sub-100-nm laser writing, 5D optical data storage in glass with > 1 TB/cm 3 density, perovskite solar cells achieving 25.7% efficiency through laser-induced phase engineering, alongside plasmonic biosensors with 100× sensitivity enhancement, and stretchable graphene sensors for wearables). Finally, this review discusses core challenges, such as enhancing the scalability of ultrafast laser processes for industrial-scale production and optimizing laser-material interactions to improve device reliability and performance. Future efforts should address key challenges such as the limited scalability of ultrafast laser processing and the incomplete understanding of laser–matter interactions at ultrafast timescales. Integrating ultrafast lasers with AI-driven control, beam shaping, and advanced materials such as 2D heterostructures may enable smarter and more multifunctional device platforms. A unified theoretical framework is also needed to guide precise and efficient fabrication. These directions highlight critical opportunities for bridging current limitations and enabling transformative advances.

This review explores the effects of mechanical fatigue on the electrochemical performance of flexible batteries, specifically analyzing fatigue in battery components and how it impacts the electrochemical parameters as key indicators of energy storage device lifetime. Distinct from electrochemical fatigue, mechanical fatigue in flexible batteries degrades their structural and functional stability. The review covers recent research on testing methods and advances in mechanical modeling and simulation that have been used to assess static and cyclic load impacts. Detailed attention is given to factors such as delamination, crack formation, wrinkling, and contact pressure, which influence the durability of flexible battery components. Microstructural analysis techniques are highlighted for investigating degradation at the interface of active materials and current collectors. Also, it was shown that machine learning is a promising tool for predicting the remaining useful life and improving the design of flexible batteries.},

While the electrified solid–liquid interface has been extensively studied, its multiphase counterpart involving immiscible liquid–liquid interfaces presents unique challenges due to the interacting behaviors of ion transport within the Debye layer and solvent mixing layer. Electrokinetic multiphase hydrodynamics (EKmHD), dating back to the early 20th century, has regained prominence since the 2010s, supported by advanced methods spanning microfluidics, spectroscopy, molecular dynamics, phase-field-based modeling, coarse-grained analysis, and high-performance computing. After briefly sketching fundamental mechanisms, this review establishes a unified framework of experimental, theoretical, and numerical issues to consolidate the quantitative methodology of EKmHD, which is essential to uncover the underlying interfacial transport mechanisms. The systematic synthesis will not only advance predictive modeling methods for liquid–liquid electrokinetics but also propel the technological developments in multiphase-system-based energy conversion, bio-medical devices, and smart fluidics.},

  abstract     = {For over three decades, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has been a key method for exploring material structures and functionalities at nanometer and often atomic scales in ambient, liquid, and vacuum environments. Historically, SPM applications have predominantly been downstream, with images and spectra serving as a qualitative source of data on the microstructure and properties of materials, and in rare cases of fundamental physical knowledge. However, the fast-growing developments in accelerated material synthesis via self-driving labs and established applications such as combinatorial spread libraries are poised to change this paradigm. Rapid synthesis demands matching capabilities to probe the structure and functionalities of materials on small scales and with high throughput. SPM inherently meets these criteria, offering a rich and diverse array of data from a single measurement. Here, we overview SPM methods applicable to these emerging applications and emphasize their quantitativeness, focusing on piezoresponse force microscopy, electrochemical strain microscopy, conductive, and surface photovoltage measurements. We discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead, asserting that SPM will play a crucial role in closing the loop from material prediction and synthesis to characterization.},

  abstract     = {Bone, cartilage, and their composites in various joints are the most important components that form the skeletal structure and enable motion and movements of the body. Their disease and/or loss are most debilitating and afflict millions of Americans, reducing productivity and deteriorating quality of life. Due to limited treatments, scientists, engineers, and clinical doctors are investigating new tissue engineering solutions. In tissue engineering approaches, scaffolds are artificially designed temporary matrices that accommodate stem/progenitor cells and provide both physical and biological signals to guide cell differentiation and 3D tissue regeneration but eventually degrade and leave behind regenerated functional tissues or organs. Therefore, scaffolds often substantially benefit from mimicking certain features of the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) and designing certain engineered features to facilitate cell repopulation, mass transportation, and mechanical and biological cues for cells to regenerate tissue. This review article focuses on the design, synthesis, fabrication, and functionalization of nanofibrous materials to mimic the ECM, deliver biological signals, and integrate various engineering design features such as pore shape, size, connectivity, tissue architectures, and anatomic tissue/organ shapes to guide 3D tissue regeneration. In addition to biological and physical principles of scaffold design and fabrication, we also provide several examples of specific applications of these advanced nanofibrous scaffolds for bone, cartilage, and their associated composite tissue regeneration in osteochondral defects. We also discuss the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary nature of these research directions, the importance of collaborations across disciplines, and the perspectives of future developments in the field.},

  abstract     = {Polycrystalline germanium (Ge) thin films have reemerged as promising materials for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices because of their superior electrical and optical properties. However, challenges such as high defect densities, small grain sizes, and unstable n-type conduction have limited their practical application. In this paper, we review the progress in the solid-phase crystallization of Ge thin films on insulating substrates. We first discuss conventional processes with excessive nucleation that lead to poor crystallinity and electrical properties. We then introduce advanced solid-phase crystallization strategies, highlighting the critical role of controlling the amorphous deposition temperature to control atomic density, increase grain size, and reduce acceptor defects. Additionally, the incorporation of tin (Sn) has been shown to passivate grain boundaries, while the modulation of film thickness and the introduction of interfacial layers have demonstrated the ability to mitigate carrier scattering at the substrate interface. This review also addresses impurity doping techniques for precise Fermi level control, strain engineering effects on grain boundary barrier energies, and metal-induced lateral crystallization for grain alignment. These innovations have culminated in achieving record-high carrier mobilities of 690 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for p-type and 450 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for n-type films, approaching single-crystal performance. The insights provided herein will pave the way for the development of high-performance Ge-based thin-film transistors and flexible electronic devices via low-temperature processing.},

  abstract     = {The field of 2D materials has grown dramatically in the past two decades. 2D materials can be utilized for a variety of next-generation optoelectronic, spintronic, clean energy, and quantum computing applications. These 2D structures, which are often exfoliated from layered van der Waals materials, possess highly inhomogeneous electron densities and can possess short- and long-range electron correlations. The complexities of 2D materials make them challenging to study with standard mean-field electronic structure methods such as density functional theory (DFT), which relies on approximations for the unknown exchange-correlation functional. To overcome the limitations of DFT, highly accurate many-body electronic structure approaches such as diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) can be utilized. In the past decade, DMC has been used to calculate accurate magnetic, electronic, excitonic, and topological properties in addition to accurately capturing interlayer interactions and cohesion and adsorption energetics of 2D materials. This approach has been applied to 2D systems of wide interest, including graphene, phosphorene, MoS 2 , CrI 3 , VSe 2 , GaSe, GeSe, borophene, and several others.

  abstract     = {Mie scattering between incident light and nanoparticles (NPs) plays a vital role in improving the performance of optical and photonic devices, such as sensors, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. While traditional far-field spectroscopy and electromagnetic simulations have been used to study Mie scattering, these methods lack real-space imaging capabilities, limiting their ability to capture single-particle scattering phenomena. Scanning probe microscopy-based nanoscopy techniques have become essential for studying Mie scattering at the nanoscale to address this limitation. This review explores the theoretical foundations of Mie scattering and the role of near-field microscopy in bridging the gap between theory and experiment through high-resolution imaging. By focusing on real-space imaging, we highlight the practical aspects of Mie scattering and its applications in fields such as biosensing, photocatalysis, and materials science. Nanoscopy techniques allow for direct visualization of scattering processes in nanostructures, offering more profound insights into how NPs interact with light at the nanoscale. Additionally, we discuss the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance near-field analysis, providing more accurate interpretations of Mie scattering phenomena. In conclusion, combining advanced nanoscopy and AI-driven analysis will significantly advance our understanding of Mie scattering and its diverse applications in various scientific and technological fields. The synergy between cutting-edge imaging methods and computational simulation not only enriches our theoretical understanding of scattering phenomena but also accelerates the development of next-generation photonic devices, paving the way for a wide range of practical applications across scientific and technological domains.},

  abstract     = {The recent advancements in implantable therapeutic platforms underscore their pivotal roles and broad applicability in medicine, particularly for treating internal organ disease. These platforms can be broadly categorized into electronic, photonic, magnetic, and multi-physical modalities, significantly expanding therapeutic strategies across medical disciplines. Electronic platforms encompass electrical stimulation-based therapies and electrical-actuated drug delivery, leveraging self-powered technologies for minimally invasive solutions. Photonic platforms harness the interactions between photons and biological tissues for cutting-edge disease treatment, addressing limitations in tissue penetration depth. Magnetic therapies exploit magnetic fluid hyperthermia effect, magneto-mechanical effect, and direct magnetic stimulation, with implantable platforms enhancing magnetic energy conversion and ensuring accurate target in treatments. In practical applications, various physical platforms exhibit overlapping functionalities while maintaining distinct advantages within their operational domains. The multi-physics platform synergistically integrates the complementary benefits of individual platforms, thereby significantly expanding its potential application scope. This review sheds light on the synergistic integration of multiple physical fields (combining electronic, photonic, or magnetic platforms) for advancing therapeutic outcomes, which is distinctive from previous reviews focusing on single-field therapies. In addition, this review aims to provide a systematic overview of the latest developments in implantable therapeutic platforms for treating internal organ diseases, covering technical principles, device designs, their clinical potential and challenges, and future directions in the field of multi-physical field integrated therapeutic platforms.},

  abstract     = {The crystal structures of the studied materials can be manipulated under a compression field. Combining a high-pressure apparatus with a low-temperature cryostat requires the design of a compact-scale high-pressure apparatus which generally results in reduced sample volume. In the magnetic measurements, this requires the use of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which is a highly sensitive magnetic device for detecting changes in minute magnetic fluxes. In this review, two types of SQUID magnetometers for pressure ( P ) of up to 30 GPa are reviewed. One is a commercial SQUID magnetometer with a miniature diamond anvil cell (DAC) covering a wide temperature range of 1.8–400 K, and the other is a vibrating-coil SQUID magnetometer equipped with DAC, which provides more accurate measurements. The former was used for oxygen molecules, molecule-based magnets, permanent magnets, organic radial ferromagnets, and lanthanide ferromagnets, whereas the latter was applied to organic radial ferromagnets, samarium (Sm), and an iron-based superconductor. Further developments of accurate magnetization measurements at high pressures are important for condensed matter studies on magnets and superconductors.},

  abstract     = {III-V multi-junction solar cells have yielded the highest solar cell efficiencies for nearly three decades and recently achieved record efficiencies approaching 40% under standard conditions and 50% under concentrated sunlight. Such high efficiencies are currently only possible using four or more junctions to partition the broad solar spectrum into bins where each subcell efficiently collects a narrow range of photon energies. High-efficiency, wide-bandgap (1.7–2.2 eV) absorbers play a crucial role in multi-junction solar cells by efficiently converting visible photons into electrons and delivering them at high voltage. Since all subcells are interconnected in series, the widest bandgap junction produces both the highest voltage and highest power in the stack. Wide-bandgap absorbers also present the greatest materials challenges in the stack, including high aluminum content, lattice mismatch, lack of heterojunction barriers, and the sensitivity of phosphides to defects such as vacancies and oxygen. We review the history, current status, and opportunities for wide-bandgap III-V solar cells, ranging from ∼1.7 eV for the top subcell of III-V/Si hybrid tandems to >2.2 eV for the top subcell of a 6+ junction stack.

In coupled electron–phonon transport, we discuss the basics of electron–phonon interactions and their effects on phonon dynamics, thermalization, and nonequilibrium thermal transport. For the phonon–spin interaction, nonequilibrium transport formulation is introduced first, followed by the physics of spin thermoelectric effect and strategies to manipulate them. Contributions to thermal conductivity from magnons as heat carriers are also reviewed. For coupled transport of heat and ions/molecules, we highlight the importance of local molecular configurations that determine the magnitude of the electrochemical gradient, which is the key to improving the efficiency of low-grade heat energy conversion.},

  abstract     = {Photostrictive effect exhibits a high potential to realize the smart micro-optomechanical devices, which can be operated at a simple principle of direct conversion of light energy into mechanical strain. Unlike electrostrictive and magnetostrictive effects, it does not involve complex circuits, therefore offering a promising prospect of accomplishing the advanced, compact, and remote-control devices. The key step to produce the light-induced strain of practical value is to design highly efficient photostrictive materials. Based upon the nature of the material systems to be explored for micro-optomechanical devices, the photostriction in inorganic–materials-based systems, including semiconductors, transition metal oxides, halide perovskites, and ferroelectrics in bulk and two-dimensions, are summarized herein. For each material, the feasible strategies of compositional engineering, processing conditions, and sample sculpturing, with a special focus on the meticulous tailoring of multiple phase boundaries in representative ferroelectric systems to produce significant photostriction, are given. Since ferroelectric photostriction is accounted as the superposition effect of photovoltaic and inverse piezoelectric effects, both effects are introduced and discussed. Finally, perspectives on future research of photostrictive materials are added. We believe that this review will bring new insights in producing highly efficient photostrictive materials for the commercial production of upcoming state-of-the-art micro optomechanical devices.},

While acoustic patterning has demonstrated remarkable control over microscale spatial configurations, its scalability into three-dimensional (3D) fabrication has remained constrained by challenges in bonding limitations and vertical stacking. To solve this challenge, hybrid acoustic-assisted 3D printing integrates acoustophoresis with established methods, such as direct ink writing and stereolithography, enhancing material deposition accuracy, microstructure alignment, and porous structuring of 3D printed products. However, these hybrid systems remain tethered to layer-by-layer architectures, limiting the full potential of acoustic techniques. Recent breakthroughs in standalone acoustic 3D fabrication, leveraging levitation, focusing, and ejection, have unlocked potential in contactless, layerless, and flexible multi-material assembly. Acoustic levitation systems enable mid-air construction on non-planar surfaces, and focused ultrasound techniques facilitate deep-penetration polymerization and acoustic droplet ejection advances nozzle-free droplet-based bioprinting. This review systematically evaluates the evolution of acoustics in additive manufacturing, addressing critical challenges in material compatibility, resolution, and scalability, while outlining the future of acoustics in additive manufacturing technology.},
