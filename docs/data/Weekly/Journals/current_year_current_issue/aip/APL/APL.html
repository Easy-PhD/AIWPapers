  abstract     = {The aerodynamic stability of large-scale birds, attributed to their covert feathers, has long fascinated biologists and bio-inspired design communities. However, existing theories cannot accurately describe the biological physics of coverts. Here, we propose a theory, based on their biological constraints, by defining covert behavior in terms of two modes: Mode Attach and Mode Deform. To validate the theory and to provide a greater understanding of the physics involved, we conduct a series of wind tunnel experiments using coverts on a man-made wing. Both the biological and physical aspects of this theory are well validated. The results show that in Mode Attach, the covert wake coincides with the wing-bound vortices, whereas in Mode Deform, it detaches from the wing wake vortices. The root constraint level affects the process of transitioning from Mode Attach to Mode Deform. Coverts positioned closer to the wing's leading edge result in smaller coherent turbulence structure scales exhibited in the wake region and higher shedding stability of the wake vortices. Furthermore, compared to those in the clean wing case, the nonlinear vortex packets attached to the wing's suction surface are modulated into self-sustaining attached vortices at multiple scales. Additional anechoic tunnel tests also demonstrated that this theory and definition provide a platform for studying both the aerodynamics and the aeroacoustics of coverts.},

In this Letter, we report the discharge similarities in steady-state CF 4 rf plasmas via fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations. The results show that the rf discharges of different dimensional scales obey the similarity law in both the striation mode and drift-ambipolar mode when the similarity conditions are fulfilled with the scaling factor k being relatively small (e.g., k ⩽ 2 ⁠ ). As the scaling factor k increases, violations caused by “nonlinear collisions” become important, and deviations from the similarity are observed. The nondimensional parameters, η ω and η n ⁠ , for characterizing the formation of the striation mode are evaluated for understanding the mode transitions under similar discharge conditions.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, I-V-VI 2 compounds have attracted significant scholarly attention due to their inherently low thermal conductivity. However, almost no n -type counterpart with a similar rock salt structure has been identified within the I-V-VI 2 family. It is worth noting that AgBiSe 2 synthesized via the high-temperature solid-state method stands out as one of the rare n -type semiconductors. In this work, the thermoelectric performance of AgBiSe 2 was significantly improved by partial substitution of Ag + upon Mn 3+ ions. Electrical conductivity ( σ ) of Ag 1− x Mn x BiSe 2 ( x = 0, 0.015, 0.03, 0.045, 0.06) compounds increases from ∼39 S cm −1 ( x = 0, at 727 K) to ∼166 S cm −1 ( x = 0.06, at 733 K), while the total thermal conductivity ( κ t ) reduces from ∼0.44 W m −1 K −1 for x = 0 at 727 K to respective ∼0.38 and ∼0.36 W m −1 K −1 for x = 0.03 and 0.015, at 733 K. Accordingly, a maximum thermoelectric figure of merit ZT ( ZT max ) value of ∼0.80 is achieved at 733 K for both x = 0.03 and 0.015 samples, representing a substantial improvement by 74% in comparison with the pristine AgBiSe 2 ( ∼ 0.46 at 727 K). These results demonstrate that the Mn 3+ ion doping should be a very promising strategy in designing medium-temperature n -type thermoelectric materials.},

In this work, an interfacial synergy strategy was proposed to overcome this limitation by integrating micro- and nanostructured interfaces between polyimide (PI) and polyamide (PA) materials. Through systematic investigation, the combination of electrospun PI nanofiber membranes with microstructured PA fabrics maximizes the effective contact area and charge-transfer pathways. The results showed that the PI nanofiber/PA fabric pairing yields an open-circuit voltage of 76 V and a short-circuit current of 5.9 µA under a 20 N load at 3 Hz. The optimized device powered 56 light-emitting diodes and charged commercial capacitors with high efficiency. Additionally, an intelligent security system based on TENG technology was developed, underscoring its versatility for self-powered electronics and energy storage. This work elucidates the pivotal role of coordinated micro-/nanostructural matching in enhancing triboelectric output and provides a generalizable approach for advancing TENG performance in sustainable energy, flexible electronics, and smart device applications.},

It is observed that the salt treatment could raise the power conversion efficiency of the devices, and CsI treatment comes out with the fastest rising rate. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope studies observe that CsI treatment triggers secondary growth of PVSK, as well as the doping behavior at the A site of PVSK. Transient photovoltaic/photocurrent decay curve recording and Mott–Schottky study on the devices show that CsI treatment comes out with the longest lifetime of charge carriers, the shortest charge-extraction time, and the highest built-in potential. Accordingly, CsI blending upgrades the power conversion efficiency from 17.22% to 19.16% (on average, optimized to 19.89%), leading to an increment of 11%, compared to that of 7%,1% and 2% for LiI, KI, and control cases, respectively. Moisture stability is estimated. CsI blending comes out with a T 80 lifetime (time for efficiency dropping to 80% of the initial value) of ∼209 h, compared to that of ∼180h, ∼67h, and ∼90h for LiI, KI, and control cases, respectively. The observation is ascribed to the improved crystallization, and molar Gibbs free energy of hydration (Δ hyd G * ) for these alkaline-metal ions. Cs + owns the lowest Δ hyd G * , thus enhancing the hydrophobicity of the CE. Besides, Li + owns the highest Δ hyd G * , thus triggering the “slow-release effect” on H 2 O molecules from open air.},

It is observed that power conversion occurs only after 20 min of annealing, though severe hysteresis is seen due to the existence of an intermediate phase. Meanwhile, the heterojunction structure evolves obviously in the device, from that formed between the electron transport layer (ETL) and PVSK precursor, to that formed between ETL and PVSK crystallites. As annealing time increases to 120 min, the intermediate phase is reduced, and the buried interface of PVSK is strengthened, leading to accelerated charge-extraction and retarded charge-recombination, as well as an upgraded built-in potential ( V bi ). Accordingly, the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) improves from 10.47% to 12.42%, with the hysteresis index sharply dropping from 19.19% to 1.06%. Increasing the carbon-electrode thickness and prolonging the annealing time could further improve the crystallization quality of PVSK, thus elevating the PCE up to 15.26%, as well as the T80 lifetime of ∼390 h for unsealed devices, during the quasi-maximum power point tracking test in open air.},

Finally, we built an artificial neural network to recognize handwritten digits in the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, achieving 93.9% recognition accuracy.

In this work, we develop a multi-physical field microscopic imaging system, which is capable of achieving high spatiotemporal resolution characterization in an individual GaN Micro LED. By integrating fluorescence imaging, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, hyperspectral imaging, and time-correlated single-photon counting, our system enables real-time tracking of the evolution of defects under coupled optical, electrical, and thermal fields. Equipped with this system, we systematically analyze the spatial distribution and depth of defects introduced by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching. Two distinct regions are observed: a narrow fluorescence lifetime decrease zone (∼2 μ m) near the chip edges and a broader fluorescence intensity decrease zone (∼5 μ m). To explain this, we propose a physical model that describes the interplay between defect-induced non-radiative recombination and carrier diffusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that wet etching effectively mitigates these ICP-induced damages, leading to enhanced brightness across a wide range of Micro LED sizes. Notably, this passivation process enables a 3 μ m size blue Micro LED chip to achieve a peak external quantum efficiency of 27.6% with a current density of 33.7 A/cm 2 . These findings provide insights into the localized impact of plasma etching and highlight the potential of wet etching for enhanced performance in Micro LED.},

In this study, we propose a direct encapsulation of inorganic clusters into highly aligned CNT microfibers and demonstrate the modulation of the electrical conductivity ( σ ) and thermal conductivity ( κ ) through the incorporation of Mo 4 S 4 nanoclusters. Commercially available CNT microfibers were used as the host material, and the encapsulation was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. As a result, both κ and σ were reduced by approximately 50% and 30%, respectively, compared to pristine microfibers at room temperature. This modulation contributes to an improvement in the thermoelectric figure of merit. The methodology indicates the potential of nanomaterial encapsulation for tuning the thermal transport properties of CNT-based bulk materials, offering a promising strategy for advanced thermal engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {We propose a metasurface design filled with porous medium inside Helmholtz resonators, which can project multiple predesigned images at different frequencies. It is easier to fabricate and more practical than the conventional multiplexed acoustic holographic metasurface of collateral Helmholtz resonators. Moreover, the amplitude and phase of the reflected acoustic wave it modulates have decoupled characteristics, which means there is no need to search for amplitude-phase space by algorithms. We theoretically, numerically, and experimentally demonstrate the meta-unit can achieve arbitrary amplitude-phase combinations at four frequencies. Then, the fourfold acoustic holographic images are numerically generated by one metasurface at 1180, 1490, 2340, and 3480 Hz, respectively. These proposed strategies significantly increase the degree of freedom of the classical metasurfaces, which may open up additional avenues for multifunctional compact acoustic devices.},

Bi, Ta, and Kr ions with linear energy transfer (LET) values of 99.7, 75, and 37 MeV/(mg·cm 2 ), respectively, were used in the experiments. The results show that the SEB threshold voltage decreases with increasing LET, indicating a strong dependence on energy deposition. In addition, reverse bias is identified as a critical triggering condition for SEB, which occurs only when the applied voltage is high enough to initiate thermal runaway and cause irreversible damage. To further elucidate the failure mechanism, Kr ions were selected for detailed investigation. technology computer-aided design simulations combined with scanning electron microscopy-based failure analysis revealed that transient current surges can rapidly elevate the local temperature. Once the temperature reaches the melting point of Ga 2 O 3 material, SEB is triggered by irreversible thermal failure. Moreover, the failure sites were primarily located at the edge of the Schottky junction, indicating structural vulnerability in this region. These findings clarify the LET and reverse bias dependence of SEB in ultra-wide bandgap devices and provide insights into radiation-hardened design.},

This challenge becomes even more critical in cryogenic environments, such as superconducting quantum computing and space exploration applications, where ultralow quiescent power consumption is essential for maintaining reliable circuit operation at extremely low temperatures. Using the unique low-temperature electrical properties of carbon nanotube materials, we fabricated a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNT-FET) that exhibits significantly reduced currents under cryogenic conditions. These carbon-based FETs were implemented to construct a carbon nanotube analog operating amplifier (CNT-OPA). Comprehensive experimental characterization across a wide temperature range (293–10 K) revealed that the CNT-OPA's quiescent power consumption decreases at cryogenic temperatures without any degradation in the gain performance. These results demonstrate the strong potential of carbon-based analog amplifiers for cryogenic electronic applications, particularly in superconducting quantum computing systems and space electronics where conventional silicon-based devices face fundamental limitations.},

By systematically varying the strain conditions, we study how different strain configurations influence the electronic and interfacial properties of this two-dimensional (2D) material-based system. Under tensile strain, the Schottky barrier height (SBH) at the Au/MoS 2 interface decreases and the interfacial binding energy increases, leading to a reduced van der Waals gap and enhanced electron tunneling probability. In contrast, compressive strain has the opposite effect, i.e., compressive strain increases the SBH and weakens the interface interaction. The SBH reduction under tensile strain gives rise to enhanced electron transfer from Au to MoS 2 , resulting in charge redistribution that effectively dopes MoS 2 with electrons and shifts its Fermi level closer to the conduction band minimum. The tunability of SBH and tunneling barriers via strain highlights a viable strategy for optimizing metal–2D semiconductor contacts in nanoelectronics applications.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have been regarded as promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronics devices. However, the intrinsically low carrier mobility severely limits device performance. In this work, we have systematically investigated the carrier transport in 2D hexangular InN based on the ab initio Boltzmann transport theory. The room-temperature carrier mobility is evaluated over a wide range of carrier concentration (n 2D ), with the free-carrier screening effect incorporated via the 2D homogeneous electron gas model. The high intrinsic electron mobility of InN is verified. At low n 2D , the electron mobility remains nearly a constant of 790 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , whereas a peak value of 1150 cm 2 V −1 s −1 is observed at high n 2D . Our mode-by-mode analysis of the scattering events demonstrates that the long-range electron–phonon couplings govern the electron transport. The high electron mobility is attributed to the exceptionally small effective masses in combination with the significant suppression of LO-phonon scattering. Furthermore, we show that applying biaxial tensile strain can significantly enhance the electron transport. At low n 2D = 1 × 10 10 cm −2 , 3% tensile strain makes the mobility increase by 186%. The further analysis has demonstrated that the mobility enhancement results from the increased band velocity and the reduced scattering rates. Our work not only sheds light on the carrier transport in 2D InN but also underscores its great promise for high-performance electronic devices. Moreover, the provided estimation of the gauge factor highlights the potential for strain-sensing applications.},

Moreover, comparing thin films obtained through different techniques is not straightforward. Particularly, analyzing grain size across samples is challenging, making it difficult to clearly correlate growth conditions with the resulting crystal structure. In this Letter, we developed an approach based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) morphology measurements to analyze nanograins in large-area thin films obtained through relevant growth techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and sputter deposition followed by pulsed laser annealing. To address the challenges in comparing thin films grown by different methods, we propose a robust approach based on statistical grain analysis. By combining well-established investigation tools, such as AFM, with advanced watershed-segmentation algorithms, we demonstrate a reliable method for identifying grains and grain boundaries. This approach allows for a robust and quantitative comparison of film morphology across different growth conditions, providing a crucial benchmark for evaluating and differentiating various growth methods.},

Although carrier doping is the most straightforward way for achieving metallization, and it can be realized by interlayer charge transfer in a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure constructed with another two-dimensional material, current attempts such as graphene/ h- BN and α -In 2 Se 3 /h-BN vdW heterostructures fail in the h- BN metallization. In this work, a vdW heterostructure of graphene/ α -In 2 Se 3 / h − BN is proposed. Interestingly, with the negative (positive) charge side of α -In 2 Se 3 interfacing with h -BN (graphene), the polarization field of α -In 2 Se 3 pushes the valence band of h -BN to higher energy and the Dirac point of graphene to lower energy so that charge transfer mediated by α -In 2 Se 3 from h -BN to graphene becomes possible, driving h -BN to be metallic. In contrast, with the reversal of the ferroelectric polarization of α -In 2 Se 3 , no charge transfer from or to h -BN is allowed, and h -BN recovers its insulating feature. The nonvolatile resistance switching of h -BN by the graphene/In 2 Se 3 / h -BN vdW heterostructure will promote its practical applications, such as memory devices.},

  abstract     = {Achieving both high electrocaloric effect and broad working temperature span in ferroelectric materials is crucial for practical cooling applications, yet it remains a big challenge. In the present work, a large electrocaloric temperature change ( ΔT ) over a wide temperature range is obtained through disorder modulation of perovskite titanates, specifically by introducing an electric field-sensitive Bi 0.5 Na 0.5 TiO 3 (BNT) into Ba 0.6 Sr 0.4 TiO 3 (BST). Ceramic samples in the BST-100xBNT (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.28) solid solution system show typical characteristics of relaxor ferroelectrics with a high density of polar nano-regions due to short-range ordering of A-site cations. As the concentration of BNT (x) increases, the freezing temperature ( T f ) decreases and the Burns temperature ( T B ) increases, suggesting the extension of the temperature range of the relaxor in the ergodic state. Moreover, the field-induced polarization was found to increase along with x. The observed structurally induced changes in the relaxor behavior are proposed to contribute to the optimal electrocaloric performance of the BST-28BNT ceramic, with a maximum ΔT of 0.91 °C and a maximum working temperature span of 24.4 °C under an applied electric field of 5 kV/mm. The concept of the A-site disorder modulation provides an innovative strategy to develop high-performance electrocaloric materials from lead-free relaxor ceramics.},

While 6 and 8 nm films achieve optimal ferroelectric properties ( ⁠ 2 P r up to 41 μ C / cm 2 ⁠ ) and good endurance, they suffer from accelerated retention loss, suggesting that prominent (002) texture may enhance charge injection and time-dependent imprint.

We attribute this to its significantly lower remanent polarization, which likely stems from a distinct nanocrystalline/amorphous microstructure, suppressing imprint development. Through quantitative imprint analysis, we establish that wake-up cycling simultaneously improves polarization while degrading retention—a fundamental constraint arising from the coupling between spontaneous polarization and charge injection dynamics.

However, solid-phase synthesis often yields secondary silicide phases that degrade performance. Here, we investigate the influence of substrate properties using two silicon-on-insulator architectures: one with a polycrystalline HfO 2 buried layer (group A) and the other with amorphous SiO 2 (group B). Both systems exhibit superconductivity consistent with V 3 Si formation, yet structural analysis reveals mixed-phase films in both cases. Crucially, only group A maintains an atomically sharp and chemically stable interface, a prerequisite for phase purity. Prolonged annealing in group A reduces the unwanted V 5 Si 3 phase but also leads to the emergence of Si-rich VSi 2 , likely due to localized substrate degradation. Preliminary atomic-resolution imaging suggests that HfO 2 crystallinity may promote local phase-selective nucleation.

  abstract     = {Zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) with two antiferromagnetic coupled edges possess PT (combined spatial inversion and time reversal) symmetry and spin double degenerate electronic structures. By breaking PT symmetry via the structure design, we are able to generate spatial spin density in twisted bilayer ZGNRs (TBZGNRs) with different stacking configurations and twisted angles, forming a class of quasi-one dimensional carbon nanoribbon antiferromagnets. We investigate the spin transport in TBZGNRs by employing the non-equilibrium Green's functions method and reveal that the electric current is nonreciprocal and spin-polarized in non- PT symmetric TBZGNRs. Moreover, in PT symmetric TBZGNRs, the spin degenerate can be lifted by applying bias voltage. It shows unique nonreciprocal spin transport with opposite spin-polarization under positive and negative bias voltages. Our results indicate that TBZGNRs should be useful carbon-based materials exhibiting antiferromagnetic order and spin-polarized transport. Thus, this work provides a strategy to achieve spin transport in graphene nanoribbons and carbon-based spintronics via the structural design.},

  abstract     = {Antiferromagnets and ferrimagnets are two kinds of classic magnetic materials and are particularly important for modern magnonic and spintronic devices because of their steadily coupled antiferromagnetic sublattices, which result in chirality-dependent magnons, efficient charge-spin conversion, altermagnetism, and great scalability for high-density integration. However, here, we report the observation of asynchrony among sublattices by using typical CoGd ferrimagnets, where the antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices fail to remain synchronized during high-speed precession. By employing magnetic resonance, we demonstrate that the asynchrony occurs when the resonance frequency exceeds a critical value corresponding to the delay time ( τ d ) between the two sublattices under microwave excitations. The determined τ d is about 60 ps in CoGd, varies slightly with temperature and composition, but decreases sharply near magnetization and angular momentum compensation. These results demonstrate the speed limit of device performance relying on the antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices as a matter of fundamental principle, and also indicate that the antiferromagnetic attributes during high-speed operations cannot be described as statically coupled sublattices.},

The VPM combines a conventional pulse magnet and a vector magnet. The VPM can create vector-pulsed magnetic fields and swiftly rotating-pulsed magnetic fields. As a demonstration, the three-dimensional magnetoresistance measurement of a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite is carried out using the AC four-probe method at 4.5 K and 6 T. The two-dimensional electronic structure of graphite is visualized in the three-dimensional magnetoresistance data.

In this work, an unclosed evolution protocol is proposed, which consists of parallel coupling and buffering branches and evolves through five distinct stages. Buffering the variation of Hamiltonian, inducing the transition to a low energy state, the evolution with favorable adiabaticity guarantees the EP encircling no longer depends on the precise loss manipulation. A non-Hermitian acoustic waveguide coupler (AWC), which is composed of combined cavities and air slit arrays, is presented to realize the encirclement. Experimental results of chiral phase conversion in a 0.5 m long AWC, spanning a broad bandwidth from 9.5 to 17.5 kHz, confirm the simplicity and effectiveness of state evolution encircling the EP.

Following rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 550 °C for 30 s, all dielectrics are confirmed to exhibit the orthorhombic (111) phase by grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD). Electrical measurements reveal that the SL5 structure achieves an outstanding reduction in leakage current, decreasing from 0.936 A cm −2 (HZO) to 0.004 A cm −2 at 3 V, and exhibits the highest remanent polarization (2P r = 29.3 μ C cm −2 ), compared to 27.3 μ C cm −2 (HZO), 22.4 μ C cm −2 (SL10), and 17 μ C cm −2 (SL15). Moreover, the SL5 capacitor demonstrates excellent reliability, maintaining robust endurance up to 1 × 10 11 cycles at room temperature and 1 × 10 10 cycles at 150 °C without degradation and stable retention over 1 × 10 4 s. Importantly, interface state analysis reveals that after annealing, SL5 maintains the lowest and most stable interface trap density within the energy range of 0.25–0.45 eV. The trap state density (6.39 × 10 12 –7.11 × 10 12 cm −2 eV −1 ) is significantly lower than that of HZO in the same energy range.

  abstract     = {Ultra-wide bandgap beta-phase gallium oxide ( β -Ga 2 O 3 ) power devices hold great promise in space applications; however, their intrinsic vulnerability to heavy ion irradiation, particularly defect behavior and catastrophic burnout mechanisms, remains largely unexplored. By performing bias voltage-dependent multiple rounds of statistical experiments with 1.35 GeV high-energy Ta ion irradiation, this work identifies electron and hole traps before burnout in NiO/ β -Ga 2 O 3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs), among which the introduced hole trap H2 ( E V + 0.6 eV, 2.9 × 10 13 cm −3 ) is revealed to dominate the irrecoverable leakage degradation associated with device damage by deteriorating the junction barrier. This trap in Ga 2 O 3 is attributed to the electron energy loss along the ion incidence trajectory based on the “thermal spike” physics theory, possibly resulting in a localized amorphous latent track. Beyond device damage, the catastrophic burnout in irradiated HJD is identified in two distinct regions: Region I (p-NiO/n − -Ga 2 O 3 ) dominated by trap-assisted electric field breakdown, and Region II (n − -Ga 2 O 3 /n + -Ga 2 O 3 ) characterized by thermally driven damage from charge accumulation. Additionally, thermal effects also impact the active area of Region I along the carrier dissipation pathway. These findings provide insight into the damage and failure physics of β -Ga 2 O 3 devices under heavy-ion strikes and inform strategies for improved irradiation hardness.},

Remarkably, the grown NWs, even with sub-micron active volumes, could generate short-circuit current densities and open-circuit voltage of several mA/cm 2 and several hundreds of mV, respectively, under white light illumination.

  abstract     = {Multiferroic (MFE) systems with rich tunability encompassing multiple degrees of freedom like spin and dipole are competitive candidates for nonvolatile memory applications. The development of two-dimensional (2D) MFE configurations could further enhance this technology, facilitating the advancement of next-generation microcontroller units. However, most reported 2D multiferroics rely on spatially separated ferromagnetic and ferroelectric layers, which introduce interfacial complexities and limit device scalability. Here, we design a van der Waals multiferroic tunneling junction using antiferromagnetic VSe 2 as a unified magnetic and ferroelectric layer, with 2D metallic TaS 2 and Au (intercalated by monolayer graphene, Gr) serving as the right and left electrodes, respectively. Through ab initio quantum transport simulations, we systematically investigate its electronic transport properties. Our results reveal that the device exhibits four switchable ferroelectric conductance states, which can be modulated via interlayer sliding. When the magnetization alignment of trilayer VSe 2 is additionally controlled, the number of distinguishable conductance states increases to 12. The conductance difference is quantified by tunneling magnetoresistance and tunneling electroresistance, which can maximally increase to 8000% and 4000%, respectively, under optimized bias voltages. Our research expands the application of 2D antiferromagnetic materials and provides a viable strategy for designing high-performance, multi-state memory devices.},

  abstract     = {Nitrogen passivation has been established as an effective method to decrease the interface state density (D it ) for silicon carbide (SiC) devices. However, the effect of nitrogen passivation on the carrier capture cross section distributions of SiC/SiO 2 interface defects is still unclear, which is another critical factor governing the interface recombination characteristics and device performances of SiC power devices. In this work, the local band bending is regulated in deep level transient spectroscopy characterizations to modulate the carrier capture and emission behaviors of interface defects in localized energy levels. Therefore, the distribution of carrier capture cross section is determined as a function of the interface state density. Surprisingly, it is found that nitrogen passivation leads to an increase in the capture cross sections of SiC/SiO 2 interface defects, especially for deeper interface states within the bandgap. Based on those findings, the mechanisms of the temperature dependence of leakage current characteristics are explored, where the leakage currents first decrease with rising temperature, reaching a minimum at 250 K, and subsequently increase further with elevated temperature. An interfacial defect-assisted Fowler–Nordheim tunneling mechanism is proposed to explain the temperature dependence of leakage currents, which is suggested to originate from the synergistic interplay between the energy-level dependent capture cross section and interface state densities.},

While in the classical physical paradigm, the causal relationships are deduced based on physical principles or via experiment, the rapid accumulation of observational data necessitates learning causal relationships between dissimilar aspects of material structure and functionalities based on observations. For this, it is essential to integrate experimental data with prior domain knowledge. Here, we demonstrate this approach by combining high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy data with insights derived from large language models (LLMs). By applying ChatGPT to domain-specific literature, such as arXiv papers on ferroelectrics, and combining the obtained information with data-driven causal discovery, we construct adjacency matrices for directed acyclic graphs that map the causal relationships between structural, chemical, and polarization degrees of freedom in Sm-doped BiFeO 3 . This approach enables us to hypothesize how synthesis conditions influence material properties and guides experimental validation. The ultimate objective of this work is to develop a unified framework that integrates LLM-driven literature analysis with data-driven discovery, facilitating the precise engineering of ferroelectric materials by establishing clear connections between synthesis conditions and their resulting material properties.},

Metal thiophosphates (MTPs), with their layered structures and tunable electronic properties, are of particular interest. However, the link between crystal symmetry, stacking order, and anisotropic optical behavior remains inadequately understood in MTPs. Herein, we synthesized high-quality, large-sized monoclinic phase of SnP 2 S 6 single crystals via the chemical vapor transport method. Structural analysis revealed that the monoclinic phase is featured by a unique bilayer stacking configuration with a 180° in-plane rotation of adjacent metal sites. This stacking arrangement disrupts the threefold rotational symmetry of the monolayer, resulting in in-plane structural anisotropy as revealed by polarized Raman spectroscopy and consequently optical birefringence. To showcase its application potential, photodetectors based on monoclinic SnP 2 S 6 were fabricated, exhibiting exceptional polarization-sensitive performance under 405 nm excitation. This work highlights the importance of interlayer stacking patterns on the structural and optical properties of van der Waals MTPs, delivering a unique strategy for property tailoring.},

Using Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, we identify the formation of nanosized (200–500 nm) amorphous selenium clusters on the surface, evidenced by a distinct Raman mode at 250 cm −1 . Temperature-dependent studies reveal the thermally activated nature of this process, with an activation energy of 1.12 eV—significantly higher than in related dichalocogenide 1T-TiSe 2 , suggesting suppressed Se diffusion in NbSe 2 at elevated temperatures.

By tuning linewidth, gap, and electrode layout, discrete LIG elements can be activated individually or along predefined paths, delivering millimeter-scale, site-specific heating without mechanical reconfiguration. A 4 × 4 matrix heater offers programmable thermal pixels: switching two bias lines directs current, and consequently heat, along the shortest-resistance path, producing local temperatures from 25 to 150 °C. Representative tracks reach 165 °C at 5 V, while a 2 V bias yields an increase in ≥ 40 °C. Because the temperature field is primarily governed by the geometry of the conductive tracks, not the overall heater size, the same fabrication step can yield regions with different thermal outputs by adjusting local pattern dimensions such as linewidth and length. This ability to spatially program heating behavior within a thin, flexible film, where heat distribution can be reconfigured simply by changing the biasing direction, highlights its potential for applications in reconfigurable soft robotics, on-skin thermal therapy, and adaptive microfluidic control.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying energy dissipation in dissipative periodic discrete metamaterials remains a challenge, as traditional interpretations of metadamping, based on summing modal damping ratios, do not consistently reflect actual time-domain energy loss in multi-modal systems. The study addresses this critical gap by introducing a framework grounded in a consistent definition of the unit cell for discrete dissipative systems. A single-term exponential energy decay coefficient, obtained through least squares minimization of the transient response, is proposed as a robust descriptor of system-level dissipation. The coefficient approximately captures energy decay behavior in both phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials, offering a more physically meaningful measure than conventional damping metrics. The proposed meta-dissipation framework establishes a critical link between dispersion-based analysis and transient energy dissipation, enabling more effective design and optimization of metamaterials for vibration attenuation across a wide range of engineering applications.},

Balancing the advantages of high capillary force of the V-shape and low viscous resistance of the U-shape, long-distance wicking velocity of gradient designs efficiently improved over 40% than conventional V-shape designs. Leveraging the enhanced mechanism, segmental structures with maximized long-distance wicking velocity were further developed, reaching a 100% enhancement.

By decomposing the Bessel vortex wave into a spectrum of plane wave components, we independently compute the PO and EEC scattering contributions for each spectral element. The coherent superposition of these contributions yields the total scattered field, significantly improving modeling accuracy. Numerical results demonstrate a 20%–30% enhancement in radar cross section prediction accuracy over the standard PO method. The proposed hybrid PO and EEC algorithm offers a computationally efficient solution for vortex EM scattering analysis, with direct applications in OAM-based radar systems, computational imaging, and next-generation communications.},
