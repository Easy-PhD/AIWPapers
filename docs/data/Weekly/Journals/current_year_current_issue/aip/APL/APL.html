  abstract     = {Quantum random number generators play a vital role in securing communication and encryption. In the present work, we have produced bright twin beams using four-wave mixing in a double- Λ configuration in rubidium-85 vapor and generated two strings of highly correlated random numbers. The randomness originates from the probabilistic nature of the intensity fluctuations of the twin beams and the quantum correlations are certified by measuring the intensity-difference squeezing in the generated twin beams. At an analysis frequency of 2 MHz, we have measured 95% correlation between the random intensity fluctuations of the twin beams. We observe over 5 bits/sample of entropy from the quantum fluctuations of the twin beams. Furthermore, to extract identical strings of random numbers, post-selection of the binned data and hashing algorithms are used, leading to a binary string of random numbers at a rate of 6 Mbps that passes standard statistical tests from NIST and TestU01. Here, the simplicity of generating bright twin beams shows the potential of this method in quantum cryptography and quantum communication.},

By leveraging high-volume SiC technology, we achieve a substantial reduction in optical losses, reaching 3.5 dB/cm at 785 nm, thereby surpassing the performance of previously reported planar SiC waveguides. A comprehensive analysis of the signal mode profile yields valuable insights into the modal characteristics of the waveguides, enabling the optimization of N-doping profiles for the optimal incorporation of V2 silicon vacancy color centers, which possess unique optical and spin properties essential for quantum sensing applications. Notably, our platform demonstrates broadband capability, supporting the development of both multi-mode and single-mode waveguides. Furthermore, we minimize surface roughness of the coupling facets to an root mean square value of 0.2 nm, thereby reducing scattering losses and enhancing device performance while maintaining compatibility with high-volume manufacturing processes. V2 color centers are created within the waveguide through proton implantation, as evidenced by the detection of fluorescence light above 850 nm within the guided waveguide mode, highlighting the potential of our platform for highly sensitive and compact SiC-based quantum sensors.},

  abstract     = {Passive cooling strategies, such as radiative cooling and evaporation cooling, have attracted lots of interest in the heat dissipation of solar cells. However, how to evaluate the effect of these passive cooling strategies on the solar cell performance was lacking, which is critical for the passive cooling design of solar cells. In this work, an electricity-thermal model was built to discuss the solar cell performance under different passive cooling conditions. Compared with the common solar cell with a glass cover, the sky radiative cooling by improving mid-infrared thermal emittance or above- λ g (effective cutoff wavelength) reflectance in the solar spectrum had a slight effect on the temperature drop or power improvement under natural convection. The core point was to ensure the near-perfect sub- λ g transmittance using anti-reflection coatings, which played the main role in the solar cell performance. A low cell temperature did not mean a high cell outpower under the selective spectral cover, and the sub- λ g transmittance could not be suppressed to improve heat dissipation performance. After introducing an evaporation cooling layer, the output power could be enhanced greatly, showing the wide adaptability to cool the solar cell with little effect on solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency in sub- λ g spectra. These results could guide subsequent cooling structure design by integrating different cooling strategies to achieve a near-perfect passive cooling system.},

  abstract     = {Fe doping is widely known to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Ni-based electrocatalysts; however, the underlying mechanisms remain controversial, with interpretations focused on post-incorporation effects. Here, we uncover a previously overlooked pre-incorporation mechanism: Fe 3+ -mediated redox cycling in solution that directly generates high-valent Ni 3+ species, facilitating the formation of catalytically active Ni 2 O 3 H and nanostructures. Under hydrothermal conditions, spontaneous electron transfer occurs from Ni 2+ to Fe 3+ , yielding Ni 3+ , while simultaneous regeneration of Fe 2+ sustains a self-perpetuating redox cycle for continuous Ni 2+ oxidation. Remarkably, at ultra-low Fe 3+ concentrations, a hybrid morphology featuring both 2D and 1.5D structural characteristics emerges. Most Fe 3+ precipitates as colloidal Fe(OH) 3 without incorporation into the lattice, particularly near critical doping thresholds. The trace Fe-induced 2/1.5D nanostructures exhibit superior OER performance, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm −2 at an overpotential of merely 225 mV––comparable to that of heavily doped counterparts. Additionally, Fe doping synergistically activates both the lattice oxygen mechanism and the adsorbate evolution mechanism. These findings reveal a paradigm in Fe–Ni catalyst design, wherein controlled dopant-mediated redox chemistry and nanostructure play pivotal roles in optimizing electrocatalytic performance.},

  abstract     = {Air stability issues in layered oxides present significant challenges for sodium-ion batteries due to the high activity in humid air. The fundamental instability arises from inherently weak Na–O bonding, exacerbated by their wider interlayer spacing. Here, we propose that incorporating ions with high electronegativity can effectively modulate the Na + binding strength, thereby enhancing intrinsic air stability. As a case study, P'2-type Na 0.67 MnO 2 (NM), one of the promising cathodes that benefits from its cost-effectiveness and high specific capacity, was selected to verify the above-mentioned concept by introducing strongly electronegative Pb 4+ ions. To synergistically enhance structural stability, electrochemically inactive Mg 2+ ions were also incorporated, resulting in the P'2-type Na 0.67 Pb 0.04 Mg 0.08 Mn 0.88 O 2 (NMP4M8). As confirmed by x-ray diffraction, the reduced layer spacing in NMP4M8 effectively inhibits spontaneous Na + /H + exchange, resulting in excellent air stability. After 4-day air-exposure (20 °C, 50% RH), no significant hydrated phases were detected, whereas the unmodified NM exhibits clear structural degradation. After 7-day air-exposure, NMP4M8 achieved a capacity retention rate of 80.6% after 200 cycles, significantly higher than the 20.8% observed in aged NM. Density functional theory calculation revealed that Pb 4+ incorporation strengthened Na–O attraction, while Gibbs free energy analysis showed thermodynamically unfavorable degradation for NMP4M8. This co-doping strategy presents a promising pathway toward developing air-stable layered oxides.},

To evaluate their effectiveness, both numerical and experimental analyses of the conductive and convective behavior of Kresling origami fins are conducted. Experimental measurements are performed in a controlled wind tunnel environment, while numerical results are obtained using a three-dimensional transient model based on the fundamental conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy. The results indicate that the contracted Kresling fin achieves a 20% higher Nusselt number compared to the expanded configuration at low Reynolds numbers, along with improved temperature uniformity across the surface. These findings demonstrate the potential of Kresling origami as an efficient and reconfigurable thermal management solution, particularly for systems requiring adaptability.},

  abstract     = {Achieving superior carrier transport is critical in thermoelectric (TE) materials. However, traditional strategies, such as doping and alloying, always generate a trade-off between carrier concentration and mobility caused by the complex scattering of carriers, limiting the carrier transport properties. Herein, we report a unique high-pressure strategy without introducing scattering centers to optimize carrier transport properties by taking Bi 2 S 3 as an example. The layered nature of Bi 2 S 3 offers a strong response of band structures to pressure. It was found that a unique electronic topological transition emerged under ∼4 GPa revealed by the in situ high-pressure Raman spectra, leading to simultaneous increases in carrier concentration and mobility. This enabled significant enhancement of carrier transport property to boost the electrical conductivity while maintaining a high Seebeck coefficient due to the accompanied large enhancement in the density of states, resulting in a notably improved power factor. Separately, the relatively low thermal conductivity remained due to the preserved layered structure characteristic. Consequently, a record-high figure of merit of 1.05 was achieved at 5 GPa and 744 K, which is higher than those reported state-of-the-art Bi 2 S 3 -based thermoelectrics. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of pressure in optimizing carrier transport properties, providing profound insights of high pressure in designing high-performance thermoelectrics.},

Such a dual-field synergistic energy storage capacitor overcomes the limitations of conventional single-field systems, where the energy storage density and efficiency are severely constrained by dielectric losses and the intrinsic trade-off in ferroelectric materials under pure electric fields. Utilizing a hybrid fabrication technique combining cluster beam deposition with chemical solution deposition, the Sr 2 Bi 4 Ti 5 O 18 /TbFe 2 cluster composite film capacitor was fabricated on a flexible Pt/Mica substrate. Under external magnetic fields, the TbFe 2 cluster layer generates a giant magnetostrictive strain, which subsequently induces an electrical polarization signal in the ferroelectric Sr 2 Bi 4 Ti 5 O 18 layer via the piezoelectric response, achieving dual-field energy conversion and storage. At a magnetic field of 1 T, the energy storage density and efficiency of the flexible film capacitor increase by 19.2% and 5.5%, respectively.

The on/off ratio of the AlN memristors could be improved to 10 6 using one device cell, which consists of two memristors connected in parallel with a common bottom electrode. We identified space charge limited conduction in the low resistance state and Schottky emission in the high resistance state as the dominant conduction mechanisms. The AlN-based memristors could transform to volatile memory by reducing the interfacial barrier height. We further designed and fabricated a vertically integrated double barrier AlN memristor as a nonvolatile ReRAM on 2-in. sapphire and silicon wafers.

However, their low output saturation current ( I dsat ) remains a significant challenge. In this work, tunneling contact thin-film transistors (TC-TFTs) with a high-mobility indium tin oxide (InSnO) channel were fabricated, and the effect of oxygen partial pressure on their performance was systematically investigated. Compared to conventional InSnO transistors, InSnO TC-TFTs demonstrated a significant increase in intrinsic gain and a reduction in power consumption. Furthermore, by adjusting the oxygen partial pressure during the sputtering of InSnO, the output current of the TC-TFTs was improved to a level comparable to that of conventional InSnO transistors. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that the output current's dependence on oxygen partial pressure is attributable to variations in Schottky barrier height, which are induced by changes in carrier concentration. These results demonstrate the potential for fabricating high-performance InSnO TC-TFTs that combine large saturation current, high intrinsic gain, and low power consumption.},

  abstract     = {The ultraviolet (UV) response of a floating-base 4H-SiC n–p–n phototransistor is characterized before and after 10 MeV electron irradiation. The pristine device demonstrates visible-blind UV detection at 275 nm, achieving a UV/dark current ratio of ∼10 6 , a specific detectivity of 1.37 × 10 12 Jones, and a responsivity of 1.36 A/W. Responsivity monotonically increases with incident optical power density. After 500 kGy irradiation, responsivity degrades by 80%, with dose dependence following a double-exponential decay. Vacuum annealing at 800 K restores 79% of the pre-irradiation optical gain, confirming a partial reversibility of irradiation-induced defects. Deep level transient spectroscopy reveals defect evolution post-annealing, identifying corresponding energy levels, identities, and annihilation dynamics. High-temperature annealing primarily annihilates irradiation-induced point defects, enabling significant recovery, while thermally stable defect complexes prevent full restoration.},

The nitrogen atoms of pyridine and hydrazine (-NH-NH 2 ) as active sites can effectively drive coordination with unsaturated Pb 2+ ions by Lewis acid–base interaction and anchor iodine-related defects by forming hydrogen bond. This synergistic defect passivation strategy reduced trap-state density and suppressed the defect-induced charge recombination loss. Consequently, the optimal 2-HP-modified CsPbI 3 devices achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.08%, corresponding to a 12% enhancement over their unmodified counterparts.

In this study, we engineered a minimized topological electronic structure with controllable gaps in the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi 2 Te 4 , through a synergistic strategy combining bulk antimony (Sb) doping and surface potassium (K) modification. Systematic investigations were performed using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy at 80 K. Bulk Sb doping effectively induces the formation of topological surface state gaps, with their magnitude dramatically increasing from 10 meV in Mn(Bi 0.95 Sb 0.05 ) 2 Te 4 to 103 meV in Mn(Bi 0.76 Sb 0.24 ) 2 Te 4 , while simultaneously reducing carrier concentration and shifting the Dirac point toward the Fermi level. Subsequent K surface modification induces a non-monotonic Fermi level shift, accompanied by a distinctive “closure-reopening” evolution of the topological surface state gap. We attribute this phenomenon to the transition of surface termination types induced by low-dose K modification and surface potential reconstruction caused by high-dose K deposition. This synergistic doping strategy establishes an effective pathway to achieve the high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect.},

In this study, we introduce fluorination of C 3 N as an innovative strategy to create a monolayer that features a quasiflat band near the Fermi level. The absorption energy, molecular dynamics simulations, and calculations of mechanical constants indicate that it is energetically, dynamically, and mechanically stable. Additionally, the orbital-projected energy band structure analysis shows that the quasiflat band predominantly arises from the unfluorinated carbon atoms. Further calculations reveal that its quasiflat band is partially occupied when spin freedom is disregarded. According to the Stoner criterion, spin splitting and ferromagnetism would be induced if spin freedom is considered. Subsequent calculations indicate that the spin-up channel hosts a nontrivial second-order topological phase with spin-polarized corner states existing in the zero-dimensional nanodisk. It is suggested that the spin-polarized quasiflat band can be effectively preserved around the Fermi level when placed on the h-BN monolayer. Taking into account the experimentally synthesized C 3 N and experimentally achievable fluorination for 2D materials, our work introduces a material for investigating the fascinating properties of flat bands and spin-polarized second-order topological states.},

It is, thus, important to quantify potential gaps of the Dirac cone with meV precision. Yet, established band structure measurements are often challenged by their strict surface sensitivity or limited energy resolution. In this work, we use broadband, time-resolved THz magneto-spectroscopy to access the band structure of Dirac electrons in a buried HgTe quantum well by contact-free, all-optical measurements. Optical doping allows us to control the Fermi level without applying any electrical gate voltages. The background-free measurement of the cyclotron resonance of the Dirac system over 2.5 optical octaves, a broad range of magnetic field strengths, and different Fermi energies allows us to reconstruct the band structure near the Dirac point with sub-meV precision and to observe a crossover of Landau quantization from a quasi-classical to the relativistic regime.},

Throughput analysis of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) and the possible magnetic configurations show that most of them look like 2D Ising ferromagnets, while Cr 3 TeF 7 is like an XY ferromagnet. Moreover, Cr 3 TeBr 7 is an ideal candidate to verify the Mermin–Wagner theorem due to its negligible MAE. More interestingly, three neighboring magnetic moments capped by a Te atom in Cr 3 TeCl 7 are ferromagnetically coupled with each other, and then these trimers will form an inverse in-plane triangular spin configuration at an angle of 120° with S eff = 9/2. For Cr 3 XY 7 , their flatbands show very weak dispersion, and the Dirac cones will open a gap due to the breaking anisotropy. However, van Hove singularities at M point still remain intact. In addition, Berry curvatures of single isolated Dirac bands show the opposite and identical symbols at K and K′ points for Cr 3 SCl 7 and Cr 3 XCl 7 (X = Se and Te), respectively, further indicating that they are very promising candidates for valleytronics.},

Improving their ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and photoelectric properties is essential for expanding their functional scope. In this work, we report the application of ultrathin self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) for effective surface defect passivation in PZT film. By introducing [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)] phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz) as a SAM on the surface of PZT films, both Pb 0 surface states and oxygen vacancy defects are efficiently passivated. As a result, the remanent polarization ( P r ) is enhanced from 26 to 31 μ C/cm 2 , while the piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) increases significantly from 100–150 to 200–250 pm/V. Furthermore, the favorable energy level alignment between Me-4PACz and PZT contributes to improved polarization performance under illumination. These results underscore the potential of SAM-based strategies to enhance the functional performance of perovskite ferroelectric films and offer a promising route for integrating perovskite ferroelectric films into lightweight and portable electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Local dipoles significantly influence the properties of paraelectric perovskites. Potassium tantalate niobate (KTa 1− x Nb x O 3 , abbreviated as KTN) is a perovskite with excellent electro-optic and piezoelectric properties. Manipulating dipoles via electric fields in paraelectric KTN demonstrates significant application potential. Therefore, such dipole dynamics under electric fields are essential to research. In this work, we investigated dipole reorientation under electric fields in paraelectric KTN crystals. We found that, under an electric field of 10 kV/cm, local polarization opposing the direction of the applied field still exists in the KTa 0.62 Nb 0.38 O 3 ( T C = 13 °C) crystal. Additionally, a macroscopic piezoelectric coefficient of ∼40 pC/N was achieved in the paraelectric KTa 0.62 Nb 0.38 O 3 crystal by applying a 12.5 kV/cm electric field for 24 h. This phenomenon is attributed to the maintainable field-induced reorientation state of the dipoles after the removal of the electric field. Furthermore, since complete dipole reorientation requires strong fields, in the case of a KTa 0.61 Nb 0.39 O 3 crystal with a T C (23 °C) approaching room temperature, a field-induced phase transition (at 2.1 kV/cm) occurs prior to the complete switching of dipoles in the paraelectric phase. This results in a multi-domain state in the recently phase-transformed crystal. Our findings help in understanding the performance exhibited under electric fields and can facilitate the optimization of paraelectric perovskites.},

  abstract     = {Polar domain boundaries in non-polar antiferroelectric crystals exhibit emergent tunable polarity, yet some fundamental questions remain to be answered—particularly the origin of the domain boundaries. Here, in antiferroelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O 3 crystals, through temperature-dependent second-harmonic-generation microscopy and x-ray diffuse scattering, we reveal that the domain-wall characteristics change actively at temperatures more than 100 K lower than that of the antiferroelectric phase transition. This observation indicates that the previously considered domain wall can be a local object. Its occurrence is associated with the competition of polar and antipolar arrangements. These findings provide a better understanding of domain boundaries in antiferroelectrics and suggest a potential control strategy for engineering polar domain boundaries in non-polar crystals.},

The electron–phonon coupling constant is independent of the external magnetic field, while the spin–lattice dynamics are strongly influenced by the applied field. We demonstrate that the magnetic-field-induced modification of the spin–lattice interaction originates from a reduction in the magnetic entropy.

Currently, it is established that valley polarization in altermagnetism remains largely insensitive to spin–orbit coupling and spin. We select monolayer Cr 2 S 2 as a model altermagnetic system to investigate the mechanism through which an external field modulates valley polarization in altermagnetism. This effect arises from breaking the diagonal mirror symmetry M x y under uniaxial strain, which lifts the degeneracy of the X and Y valleys, inducing significant valley polarization. Crucially, biaxial strain preserves M x y symmetry and fails to induce polarization. Uniaxial strain simultaneously induces valley polarization and a nearly uniform Zeeman-like field in the reciprocal lattice space, reaching up to 118.39 T under 5% uniaxial strain. Moreover, the symmetry breaking in the monolayer Cr 2 S 2 leads to strong piezomagnetic effects, merging piezomagnetic and altermagnetic characteristics in two-dimensional materials.},

A synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) free layer configuration has been proposed to enhance the robustness of these devices against external magnetic field disturbance. Here, we systematically investigate the stochastic properties of SAF-based s-MTJs, with a particular focus on their size dependence. We demonstrate that decreasing the junction size from approximately 100 nm to around 40 nm reduces the relaxation time. Importantly, smaller junctions show markedly enhanced robustness against external magnetic fields, achieving susceptibility values below 0.1 mT −1 for sizes under 80 nm. Furthermore, we observe that smaller junctions exhibit enhanced insensitivity to bias voltage, with sensitivity values of around 0.5 V −1 at device sizes of approximately 40 nm, which is 100 times lower than that of conventional s-MTJs. These quantitative results provide clear guidelines for designing robust and scalable s-MTJ devices, essential for advancing spintronic probabilistic computing toward practical implementation.},

Here, using first-principles calculations and spin dynamic simulations, we demonstrate that the RuICl Janus structure exhibits a high Curie temperature (T c ) of 319 K, significant DMI, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), and spontaneous polarization. Interestingly, as tensile strain is progressively applied, RuICl transforms from the initial PMA to in-plane magnetic anisotropy, which leads to the evolution of spin texture through a sequence of transitions, progressing from a single-domain state to stripe domains, followed by a mixed state of domain walls and skyrmions, and ultimately transitioning to in-plane stripe domains. Furthermore, the synergistic application of tensile strain and an external magnetic field effectively induces skyrmions states. Spin texture modulation strongly depends on the magnetic field orientation. In addition, tensile strain significantly modulates the vertical polarization in the Janus RuICl monolayer. Our findings highlight the potential of the RuICl monolayer as a promising candidate for spintronic devices based on topological spin textures.},

However, it remains challenging. In this study, using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the spin-FET based on the altermagnetic monolayer Ca(CoN) 2 with spin–layer coupling can achieve perfect and controllable spin filtering depending on the transport direction. Notably, at zero gate voltage, the spin-FET exhibits a remarkable 100% spin-filtering efficiency (SFE) for spin-up and spin-down electrons along the [100] and [010] transport directions, respectively. Interestingly, due to the spin–layer coupling inherent in the monolayer Ca(CoN) 2 , the application of gate voltage can effectively modulate the SFE and improve the current in the [110] transport direction. Specifically, a positive (or negative) gate voltage enhances the SFE to 100% of spin-down (or spin-up) currents.

  abstract     = {Lead chalcogenides crystallizing in NaCl-type structure are known as excellent thermoelectric materials. Yet, they have suffered the long-standing issue of performance imbalance between n -type and p -type thermoelectric devices. In this work, we have explored a highly stable low-energy allotrope of those lead chalcogenides, namely rockseline phase. This phase is energetically close to the stable NaCl-type phase with a hull distance of only 50 meV/atom. It can be potentially realized by applying elevated pressure on an existing experimental phase. Compared with the NaCl-type structure containing solely octahedron units with an isotropic bonding network, the rockseline structure has alternatively stacked octahedron and triangular prism units, thus exhibiting the appealing feature of hierarchical bonds. This causes the lattice thermal conductivity in the rockseline structure being few times smaller than its NaCl-type counterpart, thanks to the softened phonon modes and concurrently enhanced anharmonicity. In addition, the rockseline structure favors superior electrical conductivity at n -type doping and an appealing valence band convergence feature, being beneficial for the pronounced Seebeck coefficient at p -type doping, causing balanced thermoelectric performances under different doping conditions. As an outstanding representative of the rockseline family, rockseline PbTe exhibits an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 0.8 W / ( m · K ) at room temperature and an excellent yet balanced figure of merit approaching 2 at both n -type and p -type doping and high temperatures. This work highlights the important role of crystal structure engineering in the design of thermoelectric materials with superior thermoelectric performances.},

  abstract     = {The ultrawide-bandgap gallium oxide (Ga 2 O 3 ) polymorphs have opened frontiers in high-power electronics and multifunctional devices. Among these, the orthorhombic phase (commonly referred to as κ-Ga 2 O 3 or ε-Ga 2 O 3 , hereafter denoted as ε-Ga 2 O 3 in this work) stands out with its exceptional spontaneous polarization and large piezoelectric coefficients, positioning it as a prime candidate for next-generation high-electron mobility transistors and radio frequency resonators. However, the epitaxial growth of high-quality ε-Ga 2 O 3 films remains challenging due to interfacial transition layers and limited crystallographic control. Herein, we demonstrate a pioneering Sn-assisted low-pressure mist chemical vapor deposition technique that enables the growth of single-phase ε-Ga 2 O 3 films on c-plane sapphire substrates with unprecedented crystalline quality. The resulting films exhibit a remarkably narrow x-ray diffraction rocking curve (full width at half maximum, FWHM = 0.08°) while achieving atomically smooth surfaces (root mean square, RMS roughness = 1.51 nm). Key innovations include the complete suppression of interfacial transition layers through Sn-mediated nucleation and the realization of true layer-by-layer growth under optimized low-pressure conditions. This synergistic approach combines the inherent cost-effectiveness of Mist-CVD with enhanced crystallographic precision, establishing a viable pathway for industrial-scale production of ε-Ga 2 O 3 -based quantum well devices and polarization-engineered heterostructures.},

By applying a moderate negative gate bias (−5 V) over a temperature range of 25–150 °C, we analyze the charge-trapping/detrapping dynamics at the Fin sidewall and dielectric interfaces. Activation energy (E a ) of 0.74 eV confirms the temperature-dependent nature of the trapping mechanisms. Furthermore, partial V TH recovery after stress removal highlights the presence of deep-level sidewall traps with a slow detrapping process. Additionally, by extrapolating time-dependent gate dielectric breakdown (TDDB) data across high-temperature stress conditions, the device demonstrates a 10-year lifetime at 150 °C under an operating voltage of approximately 8.22 V. Furthermore, the extracted E a ranging from 0.59 to 0.63 eV confirms the presence of deep-level traps within the AlGaN barrier layer, which contributes to the electron trapping during degradation, leading to the point-level defect generation, ultimately driving TDDB.},

Two electron emission signals have been detected in DLTS spectra of all Al x Ga 1− x N samples and the activation energy for electron emission relative to the conduction band edge ( E C ) from the first level shifts from E C –0.25 to E C –0.34 eV and that for the second level shifts from E C –0.6 to E C –0.68 eV upon changes of x from 0 to 0.063. In the L-DLTS spectra of the Al 0.063 Ga 0.937 N samples, the electron emission signals associated with the E C –0.34 eV donor and E C –0.68 eV acceptor levels split into individual components due to aluminum fluctuations in the nearest neighbor (NN) shells. The splitting patterns are nearly identical for both signals and the ratios of peak magnitudes are consistent with calculated probabilities of finding a given number of aluminum atoms in the second NN shell around a Ga lattice site. These findings provide strong evidence that the E C –0.34 and E C –0.68 eV trap states in Al 0.063 Ga 0.937 N are related to point defects in the Ga sub-lattice. Finally, a comprehensive scan of possible impurities and defect levels in GaN and Al x Ga 1−x N using first-principles calculations suggests that the E C –(0.25–0.34) eV electron trap in Al x Ga 1− x N (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.063) is most likely related to carbon or molybdenum donor states, specifically, C Ga (0/+) or Mo Ga (0/+).},

This study investigates the molecular beam epitaxy growth and transport properties of lattice-matched single- and multichannel AlScN/GaN heterostructures. A two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) forms at the AlScN–GaN interface with a lattice-matched AlScN barrier as thin as 2.5 nm and increases with AlScN thickness, exceeding 2.5 × 10 13 /cm 2 for a 10 nm barrier. Stacking of lattice-matched AlScN/GaN multilayers produces parallel 2DEGs whose total density scales linearly with the number of AlScN/GaN periods, reaching 1 × 10 14 /cm 2 for five-period structures, with moderate average electron mobility of 583 cm 2 /V.s and sheet resistance of 106 Ω / □ at 300 K. Structural analyses reveal that coherently strained epilayers with sub-nm surface roughness were achieved. The electron mobility in the lattice-matched AlScN/GaN single- and multichannel heterostructures is limited by alloy disorder and interface roughness scattering. Temperature-dependent Hall effect measurements confirm the presence of multiple conducting 2D carrier sheets with less than 15% carrier freeze out, carrier mobility of 851 cm 2 /V.s, and sheet resistance of 78 Ω / □ at 10 K.

  abstract     = {This work demonstrates an in situ etching technique for β-Ga 2 O 3 using solid-source metallic gallium (Ga) in a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) system, enabling clean, anisotropic, plasma damage-free etching. Etching behavior was systematically studied on ( ⁠ 2 ¯ 01) β-Ga 2 O 3 films and patterned (010) β-Ga 2 O 3 substrates as a function of temperature (1000–1100 °C), Ar carrier gas flow (80–400 sccm) and Ga source-to-substrate distance (1–5 cm). The process exhibits vapor transport- and surface-reaction-limited behavior, with etch rates reaching a maximum of ∼2.25 µm/h on (010) substrates at 1050 °C and 2 cm spacing. Etch rates decrease sharply with increasing source-to-substrate distance due to reduced Ga vapor availability, while elevated temperatures enhance surface reaction kinetics through increased Ga reactivity and suboxide formation, leading to enhanced etch rates. In-plane anisotropy studies using radial trench patterns reveal that the (100) orientation produces the most stable etch front, characterized by smooth, vertical sidewalls and minimal lateral etching, consistent with its lowest surface free energy. In contrast, orientations such as (101), which possess higher surface energy, exhibit pronounced lateral etching and micro-faceting. As the trench orientation progressively deviates from (100), lateral etching increases. Facet evolution is observed between (100) and ( ⁠ 1 ¯ 02), where stepped sidewalls composed of alternating (100) and ( ⁠ 1 ¯ 02) segments progressively transition into a single inclined facet, which stabilizes along (100) or ( ⁠ 1 ¯ 02) depending on the trench orientation. The (100)-aligned fins exhibit minimal bottom curvature, while (201)-aligned structures display increased under-etching and trench rounding. Collectively, these findings establish LPCVD-based in situ etching as a scalable, damage-free, and orientation-selective technique for fabricating high-aspect-ratio β-Ga 2 O 3 3D structures in next-generation power devices.},

However, the conductance states relaxation effect substantially narrows the operational window, thereby exacerbating the occurrence of data storage errors. This study investigates the relaxation characteristics of the high-resistance state collected from a 2 Kb RRAM array which was fabricated in 28 nm commercial foundry. Three distinct drift behaviors of the RRAM resistance states were observed: (1) transient conductance drift, (2) stair-stepping conductance drift, and (3) reversible conductance drift. A programming strategy based on electron release was proposed to identify unstable devices efficiently. The amplitude and width modulation of the release pulse reveals that amplitude modulation has a more significant effect due to a certain barrier height for trapped electrons to be released. A physical model based on the trap-assisted tunneling mechanism is proposed to fit the cumulative distribution function of unstable bits under different pulse amplitudes and widths. Compared to existing long pulse and delay verify programming strategies, the release verify method significantly reduces the impact of RRAM relaxation while maintaining programming efficiency.},

In this work, the thermal conductivity ( ⁠ κ l ⁠ ) of the BiOCl monolayer was studied using first-principles calculations and the linearized Boltzmann transport equation, in which four-phonon scattering processes are explicitly considered. Our results indicate that the predicted κ l is reduced from 7.1 to 5.2 W/(mK) after including four-phonon scattering (a 27% reduction). When introducing a tensile strain of 3%, the room temperature κ l can be further reduced by 77% as compared to that of the strain-free case. Such a huge reduction primarily arises from the flattening transverse acoustic branch and the densified low-frequency phonons in the strained BiOCl monolayer, which enables qualitative changes in the dominant mechanism of phonon scattering: from three-phonon scattering to four-phonon scattering. These findings provide deeper insights into the thermal transport behavior of the BiOCl monolayer and underscore the significant potential of strain engineering as a power tool to tailor high-order anharmonic effects for symmetry-breaking 2D materials.},

Two trap states were observed consistently and uniformly, with their trapping parameters quantified. Consistent with the high performance of these 1.55 μ m photodetectors, total trap concentrations were very low, in the order of 10 12 cm −3 . The activation energies of the two detected states were found to be E C - 0.21 eV and E C - 0.40 eV. The near mid-gap position of the E C - 0.40 eV state implies a role as an efficient recombination-generation center and could be an important lifetime-limiting defect for MBE-grown GaAs 0.51 Sb 0.49 . A comparison was made with an inferior performing GaAs 0.51 Sb 0.49 photodiode. DLTS measurements revealed the same defect states and spectra, implying that the sources of these defects are the same. However, trap concentrations were found to be substantially higher for the poorer-performing device. This correlation was further supported by comparing the minority carrier lifetimes of the two samples, measured using transient microwave reflectance (TMR). A significantly lower minority carrier lifetime was extracted for the lower performance device, consistent with higher trap concentrations. It was suggested that the near mid-gap trap detected at E C - 0.40 eV could be an important contributor to limiting the minority carrier lifetime within 1.55 μ m GaAs 0.51 Sb 0.49 photodetectors grown by MBE.},

  abstract     = {A wideband three-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic absorber with a large incidence angle is designed and experimentally investigated using a design methodology that integrates resistive frequency selective surfaces (RFSS) with three-dimensional metastructures (3D MS). The RFSS acts as a strong absorption layer, while dual 3D MSs (3D MS-I/II) with low loss characteristics synergistically broaden absorption bandwidth. Multi-interface exploitation optimizes angular stability, featuring resistive patch integration in 3D MS-II for compensation absorption under TE polarization and strategically positioned vertical metal patches in 3D MS-I extending the propagation distance of electromagnetic waves in 3D MS-I under TM polarization. Benefiting from the hybrid absorbing mechanism, the proposed absorbing material demonstrates over 90% absorptivity from 6.3 to 27.2 GHz with angular stability below 60°, covering full X/Ku bands (−20 dB bandwidth). Notably, 80% wideband absorption persists even at 70° oblique incidence.},

  abstract     = {This study designed and fabricated a flexible and transparent microwave metasurface absorber. The absorber adopts a three-layer structure, consisting of patterned indium tin oxide–polyethylene terephthalate conductive layers on the top and bottom, with a polyvinyl chloride dielectric layer in between. Through a genetic algorithm to assist in structural design and parameter optimization, the absorber simultaneously achieves ohmic loss and electromagnetic resonance effects, ensuring efficient dissipation of incident electromagnetic waves within the absorbing structure. Experimental results demonstrate that the absorber achieves over 90% absorption in the 50–70 GHz wide frequency band, with absorption exceeding 99% in the 50.8–67.2 GHz frequency range, under normal incidence. Notably, the absorber maintains over 90% absorption efficiency within a wide incident angle range of 0°–30°. These structural and absorption characteristics endow it with excellent performance in shielding electromagnetic interference. Moreover, its transparency and flexibility make it applicable to applications such as automotive glass and radomes.},

  abstract     = {The fabrication of carbon nanotube (CNT) field emitters usually involves a complicated process and shows poor adhesion to the substrate, which leads to inferior electron emission. Taking advantage of Ti 3 C 2 MXene in film-forming, we have prepared CNT/MXene field emitters on various substrates. The emitter on stainless steel achieves an outstanding continuous emission density of 125 mA cm −2 and a pulse emission up to 750 mA cm −2 . In addition, the arrayed CNT/MXene emitter on structured polydimethylsiloxane displays a current density of 73.9 mA cm −2 at a low field of 2.5 V µm −1 , as well as good stability for 13.8 h. Meanwhile, the CNT/MXene emitter could operate when powered by a triboelectric nanogenerator, and the result indicates that CNT/MXene emitter can be used as a generator for producing plasma in air.

However, the growth of atomically flat polar oxide MgO films with arbitrary thickness has been hindered by polarity issues. In this study, we analyze the interfacial structure and band alignment of MgO (111) thin films deposited on 6h-SiC (0001) by the molecular beam epitaxy method. An epitaxial growth of the MgO (111) thin film on SiC is demonstrated. We show that the interface is O-terminated by atomic-scale scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements. The insulating characteristics are preserved in the vicinity of the interface according to electronic structure calculations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show that the valence band offset is approximately 1.6 eV. Electronic structure calculations for a realistic model constructed using the atomically resolved electron microscopy images show an excellent agreement between the calculated and measured valence band offsets, further confirming the validity of the developed atomic interface model. These findings pave the way for further advancements in MgO-based electronic devices, considering the ability to tailor the interface atomic structure, which could be employed to engineer the overall electronic properties at the interface, including the valence band offset.},

SrFeO 2.5 films were grown on (001) oriented Nb:SrTiO 3 to enable high-quality interfaces and future integration with Si CMOS technologies. Post-growth vacuum annealing and growth pressure were used to control film orientations, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction measurements. Films grown with diffusion planes oriented in-plane had oxygen-rich, perovskite-like nanodomains spread throughout the film, and fabricated devices exhibited worse switching consistency and more stochasticity. In contrast, films grown with diffusion planes oriented out-of-plane had a more uniform oxygen-rich perovskite interfacial layer above the bottom electrode, and devices built from this film orientation showed significant statistical improvements in switching voltages and cycling consistency.},

For samples without the AlN interlayer, the defects in the GaN channel layer near the heterointerface were induced by the strain from the Al 1−x Ga x N barrier depending on the AlN mol fraction. The density of strain-induced defects was markedly increased near the conduction band minimum to 1 × 10 18 cm −3 peaked at a depth of ∼10 nm from the heterointerface for the Al 0.24 Ga 0.76 N/GaN sample. The AlN interlayer was confirmed to suppress the formation of strain-induced defects. The carrier mobility evaluated by magneto transport measurements was also improved clearly in samples with the AlN layer because of the reduction in the density of strain-induced defects leading to remote 2DEG scattering. We have clarified the correlation between the density of strain-induced defects and the 2DEG mobility for a comprehensive understanding of the carrier transport in strained heterostructures.},

In our experiments, femtosecond second harmonic generation (SHG) signals were temporally broadened to the nanosecond scale through an absorption-and-remission process facilitated by a highly efficient quantum dot material positioned in front of a photomultiplier tube. This process yielded a 77% increase in SHG SI, along with improved image quality. Furthermore, the enhancement in both SI and SBR was consistently observed throughout the full imaging depth of three-dimensional collagen fiber samples. This method not only boosts signal strength and SBR simultaneously but also reduces the risk of photodamage and enables faster imaging. Owing to its simplicity, compatibility with other intensity-enhancing techniques, and ease of integration, the proposed time-stretching strategy holds significant potential for advancing both fundamental research and industrial applications in NLM.},

This is in contrast to conventional vertical-field optoelectronic tweezers (VOETs). The impedance mismatch effects that cause issues for VOETs are shown to be absent in LOETs as the medium impedance appears as an element parallel to the photoconductor impedance instead of being in series. Results from the model are found to be in good agreement with electric field results obtained from full-wave numerical solvers. Demonstrating that LOETs do not suffer from the same impedance constraints as VOETs enables a broader range of suspension media and applications to be explored.},
