  abstract     = {Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) possess size/shape/surface-tunable optical and electronic properties, making them promising building blocks for optoelectronic applications. However, the fluorescence intermittency, also known as “blinking,” observed in individual QDs is a pervasive phenomenon. The dark state (trion state) in blinking experiences non-radiative recombination processes, such as trap-mediated recombination and Auger–Meitner recombination, which significantly diminish the quantum efficiency of the QDs. Despite efforts to mitigate blinking phenomena through chemical engineering of QDs structures and their environments, blinking continues to impede the application of single QDs, particularly in single photon sources. This study demonstrates that Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from green QDs (donor) to individual red QDs (acceptor) can effectively suppress fluorescence intermittency. The findings indicate that FRET facilitates the removal of excess charges from the charged state (dark state, trion state), allowing the QDs to transition from the lower quantum yield trion state to the higher quantum yield single-exciton state (bright state). Our research confirms that FRET can inhibit fluorescence intermittency by deactivating the charged state.},

  abstract     = {Traditionally, photon blockades (PB) are classified into two distinct categories—conventional and unconventional—based on their unique physical mechanisms. In relation to the cavity decay rate κ ⁠ , conventional photon blockade occurs under conditions of strong nonlinearity ( ⁠ J > κ ⁠ ), while unconventional photon blockade is observed in situations of weak nonlinearity ( ⁠ J < κ ⁠ ). In this study, we examine a two-mode cavity optomechanical system ( ⁠ J a ̂ † a ̂ † b + J a ̂ a ̂ b ̂ † ⁠ ) and a two-photon parametric drive ε p ( a ̂ † a ̂ † + a ̂ a ̂ ) ⁠ . When the detunings significantly exceed the dissipation rates of the cavity ( ⁠ | Δ a | , | Δ b | ≫ κ ⁠ ), the optimal condition for PB becomes independent of the coupling strength. This implies that photon antibunching effects can occur in both strong and weak regimes ( ⁠ J > κ and J < κ ⁠ ), even when J ∼ κ ⁠ , and we could achieve PB solely through the adjustment of detunings. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to the conversion between single photon and three photons ( ⁠ J a ̂ † 3 b + J a ̂ 3 b ̂ † ⁠ ) with a three-photon parametric drive ε p ( a ̂ † 3 + a ̂ 3 ) and arrive at nearly identical conclusions. This work presents a method for implementing a single-photon source, which holds significant potential for practical engineering applications due to its independence from coupling strength.},

There is significant interest in utilizing squeezed states at high MHz and GHz frequencies. However, past efforts to build suitable photodetectors at these frequencies have yet to yield the required high quantum efficiency. Here, we present the development of a high-frequency balanced photodetector with near-unity quantum efficiency, realized with off-the-shelf components. The detector operates in balanced mode up to approximately 500 MHz, above which the differential frequency response limits its performance. To obtain high sensitivity above 500 MHz, the detector can be efficiently used in an unbalanced homodyne detection scheme. We employ our detector in this unbalanced mode to measure a squeezing comb up to 6.4 GHz, achieving a squeezing level of up to 10.7 dB. By sharing our experience, specifically in identifying the unequal frequency response as a limiting factor, we aim to enable and advance further developments in the field.},

  abstract     = {AgBiS 2 , a typical I–V–VI 2 compound, has attracted widespread attention in the thermoelectric community due to its inherently ultra-low-thermal conductivity. However, its practical applications are limited by inferior electrical transport properties. Herein, we systematically investigate the origin of its low lattice thermal conductivity and propose effective strategies to enhance its thermoelectric performance. Theoretical calculations reveal that the intrinsic ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity of AgBiS 2 arises from multiple phonon transport features, including low-lying optical branches, rattler-like local vibration, and low phonon group velocity. Combining theoretical and experimental analyses, it is found that cation disorder suppresses cation doping effects, whereas anion doping, especially with Cl doping, is more effective in optimizing electrical performance. Furthermore, introducing additional Cu, unaffected by cation disorder, not only generates extra electrons to optimize electrical transport but also reduces thermal conductivity. Notably, Cu-doped sample achieves a significantly improved power factor of ∼3.64 μ W cm −1 K −2 at 823 K, with a maximum ZT of ∼0.53, a ∼22% enhancement compared to the pristine AgBiS 2 . This study not only uncovers the ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity mechanisms but also validates synergistic strategies to optimize thermoelectric properties, positioning AgBiS 2 -based materials as promising candidates for thermoelectrics.},

By adjusting the phase relationship between the pistons from leading to lagging, the prototype overcomes the limitation of compressor performance imposed by temperature, enabling a heating supply temperature exceeding 200 °C. Meanwhile, benefiting from the inherent configuration of the double-acting design, the four-cylinder arrangement further enhances the system's power density, thereby improving its suitability for industrial heating applications. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves a substantial temperature lift from 25 to 166 °C, and within a temperature difference of 74 °C (from 45 to 119 °C), it attains a maximum coefficient of performance (COP) of 1.68. When the ambient temperature rises to 67 °C, the system delivers a heating supply temperature of 214 °C, with the corresponding COP and relative Carnot efficiency reaching 1.5% and 45.2%, respectively. These findings verify the potential of this system for high-temperature heat pump applications and highlight its advantages under extreme operating conditions. This work thus provides a solution for industrial high-temperature heat pumps, offering unique benefits in achieving large temperature lifts and high-temperature heating.},

The optimal concentration of Hf doping atoms was obtained by controlling the power of dual targets InZnO and HfO 2 and comparing their performances with those of HfInZnO TFTs that were fabricated from a single target, thus achieving high-performance and highly stable HfInZnO TFTs. After optimization, high-performance HfInZnO (P IZO 70W-P HfO2 50W) TFTs with μ FE value of 26.1 cm 2 /V s, SS value of 0.251 V/dec., and V th value of 0.7 V were obtained. The results of experimental characterization indicate that co-sputtering with Hf doping reduced the oxygen vacancies, surface defects, and other trap densities of the device. Moreover, the co-sputtering prepared HfInZnO TFT exhibited the highest stability for small V th shifts of 0.8 (−0.9) and 1.2 (−1.6) V under the gate bias and light illumination stress tests. Furthermore, low-frequency noise measurements demonstrated that the optimal Hf doping concentration in the HfInZnO films was controlled by the dual-target co-sputtering method, resulting in a lower number of oxygen vacancies and a lower interface trap density of the devices, thus enhancing the stability of HfInZnO TFTs.

Theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations demonstrate that TFTEG not only significantly enhances hole injection but also effectively passivates uncoordinated Pb 2+ defects at the buried interface through Lewis acid–base interactions. This substantially improves the photoluminescence and electroluminescence (EL) quantum yields of perovskite quantum dots (QDs). Pure-red quantum-dot PeLEDs that employ TFTEG as the HTL achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 9.67%, which signifies a substantial enhancement over the 4.56% efficiency observed in control devices utilizing the commercial TFB HTL. Furthermore, TFTEG contributes to a reduced turn-on voltage, enhanced brightness (1741 vs 888 cd m −2 ), and a stable EL spectrum peaking at 650 nm.

We report a dual-modal perovskite photodetector by incorporating YbCl 3 as a dopant, which simultaneously achieves neuromorphic behavior and conventional optoelectronic properties. Systematic characterizations of doping manipulation reveal that 0.5% YbCl 3 can optimally modulate film crystallinity, enhance carrier transport, and tune charge dynamics. Notably, the 0.5% doped device exhibited distinct wavelength-dependent photoresponse, and hallmarks of depression-like neuromorphic behavior are were observed under pulsed 905 nm light excitation. This behavior is clearly supported by negative photoconductivity, gradual baseline modulation, and a prolonged post-illumination tail. However, these adaptive current dynamics are absent under 635 nm light illumination; the device instead demonstrated enhanced photoresponse, with responsivity increasing from 0.45 to 0.73 A/W and detectivity from 1.4 × 10 12 to 5.1 × 10 12 Jones. This spectral contrast originates from the wavelength-dependent activation of Yb 3+ -related trap states, confirmed by photoluminance measurements. These findings position YbCl 3 doping as a versatile strategy for advancing perovskite photodetectors toward dual-modal photodetection, with ongoing studies exploring broader applicability.},

  abstract     = {Topological quantum materials featuring multifold band crossings have opened unprecedented pathways in the exploration of exotic matter phases. These multifold crossings with three-, six-, and eightfold degeneracies hold exceptional significance, as they are ruled out in high-energy frameworks by Poincaré symmetry, making their realization in solids highly nontrivial. Notably, the coexistence of higher-fold fermionic (eightfold) and bosonic (sixfold) degeneracies in a single material is scarcely observed in literature. In this regard, we conducted a detailed investigation into the symmetry-protected topological characteristics of experimentally synthesized A15-type M 3 Sn (M = V, Nb) compounds using first-principles calculations. Our scrutiny unveils sixfold degeneracies in M 3 Sn compounds, which corresponds to the maximum allowed in bosonic systems along with threefold nodal points, while an eightfold and fourfold fermionic degeneracy are identified in V 3 Sn compound at the R- high-symmetry point protected by nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetry. The phonon and electronic surface states calculated from a tight-binding model further validate the multifold degeneracies and also represent complementary Dirac surface states at the Γ -point. The phononic Weyl nodal line along the Γ – R path exhibits nontrivial topology with ±π Berry phase. The synthesized compounds have been confirmed to theoretically exhibit both dynamic and thermal stabilities. Our findings offer a promising platform to explore exotic excitations within a single material, paving the way for deeper insights into complex quasiparticle behavior in these potential superconductors.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we systematically investigate the cross-plane thermal conductivity in stacked diamane via molecular dynamics simulations, focusing on the effects of stacking orientation, external pressure, interlayer coupling strength, and twist angle. By combining spectral heat current decomposition and spectral energy density analysis, we identify high-frequency optical phonons within 10–15 THz as the dominant heat carriers across interfaces—a selectivity arising from interfacial hydrogen termination that strengthens the coupling of these modes. Their lifetimes and coupling strengths are highly sensitive to structural configuration and mechanical modulation. Our results reveal that parallel stacking, increased pressure, and stronger interlayer coupling significantly enhance thermal conductivity by stabilizing optical modes and suppressing phonon scattering. In contrast, increasing the twist angle introduces structural incommensurability, which reduces phonon lifetimes and leads to substantial suppression of thermal transport. These findings underscore the pivotal role of optical phonons in governing interfacial thermal transport as well as establish an optimal strategy for engineering thermal conductivity in 2D vdW materials.},

We show that Be 1− x Mg x O alloys maintain structural stability in the wurtzite phase up to x = 0.83 and exhibit an ultrawide bandgap over 6.2 eV across all compositions, which provides high intrinsic breakdown fields (12–71 MV/cm).

Our results show that the incorporation of CeO 2 into BaTiO 3 matrix induces chemical and structural heterogeneity, which effectively suppresses hysteresis, achieving a large energy storage density U e of ∼37.6 J/cm 3 and a high efficiency η of ∼80% for 0.7BT-0.3C films grown on Nb-SrTiO 3 (001) substrates.

The frequency and thermal stability analyses revealed that the nanostructured BaTiO 3 -based films maintained stable energy storage performance across a wide frequency range from 20 Hz to 10 kHz, and temperature range from 25 to 160 °C.

  abstract     = {Among magnetic thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), L 1 0 -ordered FePt has attracted significant attention because of its exceptionally strong PMA. However, the microscopic origin of its strong PMA has not been elucidated experimentally. We have investigated the contribution of the Fe 3 d electrons to its magnetic anisotropy energy by angle-dependent x-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Fe L 2 , 3 edge. By this technique, one can deduce the magnetic dipole moment m T ⁠ , which represents the anisotropic spatial distribution of spin-polarized electrons, and the orbital moment anisotropy (OMA) of Fe 3 d electrons. Detected finite m T indicates that the spin-polarized Fe 3 d electrons are distributed preferentially in the out-of-plane direction of the films. This m T of Fe overwhelms the positive contribution of OMA to PMA and reduces the PMA of L 1 0 -ordered FePt thin films, consistent with a previous first-principles calculation. The present result implies that a large positive contribution of the non-magnetic element Pt rather than Fe governs the PMA of L 1 0 -ordered FePt thin films.},

Recently, fully compensated ferrimagnet of 2D zero-net-magnetization magnets has already attracted attention, as it can exhibit global spin-splitting, magneto-optical response, and the anomalous Hall effect [Liu et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 134 , 116703 (2025)]. Therefore, it is very important to provide experimentally feasible strategies and materials to achieve fully compensated ferrimagnets. Here, we use the experimentally synthesized A-type PT -antiferromagnet [the joint symmetry ( PT ) of space inversion symmetry ( P ) and time-reversal symmetry ( T )] MnSe as the parent material to induce fully compensated ferrimagnetism through an out-of-plane electric field. This electric field can remove the P symmetry of the lattice, thereby breaking the PT symmetry and inducing spin-splitting. When considering spin–orbital coupling, MnSe with an out-of-plane magnetization can achieve the anomalous valley Hall effect. In addition, we also discuss inducing fully compensated ferromagnetism via Se vacancies and Janus engineering. Our works can promote the further development of 2D fully compensated ferrimagnets both theoretically and experimentally.},

Simultaneously, we observe an excess polar magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) signal that increases beyond its value at saturation and is fully anticorrelated with the magnetization in its field dependency. We also find a very strong wavelength dependence of this excess polar MOKE signal that is very different from the MOKE behavior at saturation.

In this study, we investigate the potential of f-electron lanthanide oxides, particularly at the Pt/DyO x interface, to enhance SOT. The gradient oxidation structure of the 4f-electron rare-earth oxide DyO x was confirmed through ultra-high-precision line scanning electron energy loss spectroscopy. By employing spin–torque ferromagnetic resonance, we achieve an extraordinary SOT efficiency of ξ FMR = 0.758 in the Pt/DyO x heterojunction, exceeding that of pure Pt by more than a factor of ten. This enhancement reduces the critical current density required for magnetization switching to 2.25–3.48 × 10 6 A·cm −2 , which is only 15% of the current density needed for pure Pt. Beyond improving SOT efficiency, the integration of 4f rare-earth oxides at the interface provides an advanced technical pathway for developing CMOS-compatible and energy-efficient spintronic technologies.},

  abstract     = {This paper analyzes the effect of microwave irradiation on the amplification of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) by drifting electrons in graphene. An expression is obtained for the SAW gain G as a function of the frequency and intensity of microwaves, the electron drift velocity, and the parameters of the considered graphene/piezoelectric substrate hybrid structure. Our calculations show that in the presence of microwave radiation incident normally on the graphene layer and polarized along the direction of SAW propagation, the SAW gain G , measured in units of dB/cm, can be several times greater than in the presence of only an applied dc electric field causing electron drift. The results obtained indicate an effective way to improve the performance of ultra-compact graphene-based SAW amplifiers.},

  abstract     = {Group II–VI semiconductors, renowned for their direct band gaps, high carrier mobilities, and mature synthesis, are essential in optoelectronic applications. While scaling down to the two-dimensional (2D) limit could unlock enhanced and distinct functionalities, realizing stable intrinsic 2D phases remains challenging due to their nonlayered bulk structures, strong interlayer covalency, and high ionicity. Here, using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that II–VI compounds adopt stable 2D configurations distinct from both graphene-like sheets and bulk fragments. The most stable phases identified include tetragonal–triangle, double-layer honeycomb, planar honeycomb, and a non-conventional bilayer. Despite being isoelectronic, these compounds exhibit markedly different energetic landscapes. We propose that this diversity originates from a dual competing mechanism: the geometric stability imparted by favorable building blocks vs the long-range Coulomb interactions. Several predicted structures exhibit excellent electronic properties, with computed mobilities exceeding 29 000 cm 2 V −1 s −1 in CdS, highlighting their potential for nanoelectronic applications. Our findings provide both a structural design rule and a set of experimentally accessible targets, offering a pathway toward integrating II–VI semiconductors into the 2D material landscape.},

All the SBDs showed ideal n -type Schottky characteristics with excellent in-plane uniformity at room temperature. Temperature-dependent forward current density–voltage ( J – V – T) characteristics showed nearly constant ideality factors of 1.02 ± 0.01 from room temperature to 200 °C. The reverse breakdown V of the SBDs with PDA was about 100 V larger than those of the ones without PDA. Furthermore, reverse J – V – T characteristics of the PDA SBDs were well reproduced by the thermionic field emission model for the whole temperature range up to 200 °C.

  abstract     = {Oxygen vacancies (V O ) are intrinsic defects in β -Ga 2 O 3 that significantly impact its device performance. These vacancies can donate electrons to the conduction band, leading to unintentional n-type conductivity in as-grown β -Ga 2 O 3 . In addition, V O associated localized states can act as electron traps, scatter free carriers, and consequently degrade carrier mobility and overall device performance. Therefore, removing V O is crucial for improving material properties, promoting the development of p-type β -Ga 2 O 3 and optimizing device performance. Currently, traditional methods for V O treatment, such as oxygen plasma treatment and thermal annealing, are effective but have high energy consumption, which is detrimental to carbon neutrality goals. This study presents a method for enhancing the removal of V O via hydrogen doping. β -Ga 2 O 3 thin films were grown under low-oxygen conditions using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition, followed by hydrogen pre-annealing. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cathodoluminescence characterizations of films treated under different annealing conditions confirmed the effectiveness of hydrogen doping in promoting V O elimination. Furthermore, ultraviolet photodetectors were fabricated using these films, and the analysis of their dark-state decay times provided additional evidence for reduced V O concentrations. Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory using a revised PBE functional and the climbing image nudged elastic band method reveal that hydrogen incorporation induces charge redistribution, facilitating VO migration, thus enhancing defect control.},

In this work, the surface and bulk states in CsPbBr 3 single crystals were investigated by polarization-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements. Onefold anisotropy of SHG intensity indicates that the polycrystalline Cs 4 PbBr 6 and CsPb 2 Br 5 phases dominate the surface, which exhibits C s symmetry. Moreover, an unpolarized and strong luminescence was observed induced by two-photon absorption, which displays a twofold symmetry. Br vacancies within the bulk were identified as the radiative recombination centers according to their energy level position.

Herein, we report the fabrication of high-quality BFO films with enhanced crystallinity in a rhombohedral structure through the cost-effective chemical solution-immersion deposition method, which maintains compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies. Notably, piezoresponse force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy characterizations demonstrate stabilized polarization with a low decay exponent of 0.014. The out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization can still be reversed at ambient temperature, even when the film thickness is reduced to approximately 3 unit cells.

However, challenges including imbalanced charge injection and defect-related nonradiative recombination at the interface, particularly at the hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite interface, hinder the development of efficient PeLEDs. This investigation systematically evaluates the effect of various dipolar molecules on the HTL/perovskite interface, aiming to enhance the efficiency of blue PeLEDs. The results indicate that the hole injection barrier of devices modified with diethyl difluoromethanephosphonate (DFMP) was significantly reduced due to the high polarity of DFMP, which maintains a balanced hole–electron mobility. Furthermore, the electron-rich P=O bond in DFMP effectively coordinates with the unsaturated Pb 2+ at the buried interface to passivate defects that contribute to radiative recombination. As a result, the DFMP-modified PeLEDs achieve a peak external quantum efficiency of 9.8% at 480 nm and a prolonged operational lifetime. The study paves the way for interfacial molecular buffer layers to interface modulation in quasi-2D PeLEDs.},

Common signal processing mechanisms like switches and rectifiers often depend on magnetic fields and/or logic gates for their activation. We propose a metamaterial that enables the control of mechanical waves—surface acoustic waves—through an ON–OFF mechanism that switches the propagation of the waves through a tunable platform of elastic beams. In the OFF configuration, the beams remain in their undeformed state and resonate at a specific frequency range, creating a bandgap that stops wave propagation. Conversely, in the ON configuration, the beams undergo buckling, redistributing the vibration energy across multiple modes and eliminating the bandgap, thus allowing wave propagation. Analytical and numerical findings demonstrate the significant potential of this mechanism for controlling wave propagation in nonlinear periodic materials. This switching mechanism relies purely on mechanical processes, thereby eliminating the need for external fields.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals metal–semiconductor junctions (MSJs) with low-resistance contacts have great potential for designing high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, due to the quantum confinement effect, 2D metals exhibit layer-dependent conductivity that inevitably influences the contact properties of 2D MSJs, the underlying mechanism behind this effect is unclear. Herein, taking multilayer graphene and MoS 2 as examples, we systematically studied the effect of 2D metal layer number on the MSJs by non-equilibrium Green's function and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics methods. Compared with the trilayer-graphene/MoS 2 (Gr/MoS 2 ) MSJ (5.0 × 10 4 KΩ µm), the contact resistance of the monolayer-Gr/MoS 2 MSJ (7.6 × 10 3 KΩ µm) is reduced by one order of magnitude. Under a 0.6 V bias voltage, the reduced contact resistance results in the current increasing from 0.1 to 60 nA. The superior transport performance of monolayer-Gr/MoS 2 MSJ derives from the reduction in the Schottky barrier of the MSJ as the number of graphene layers decreases, whereas the tunneling barrier remains nearly constant. Meanwhile, monolayer-Gr/MoS 2 MSJ exhibits high photogenerated carrier gain, which is attributed to the ultrafast transfer (388 fs) of photogenerated electrons and long carrier lifetime (71 ns), resulting in superior optoelectronic performance. Our study presents a layer-number engineering strategy for optimizing contact properties in 2D MSJs.},

  abstract     = {Silicon crystallizes in the diamond structure with two atoms per unit cell and supports three optical phonon modes. However, due to the centrosymmetric nature of the lattice, these modes do not induce a net dipole moment and are therefore inactive in infrared absorption. Even in polar semiconductors, where optical phonons can be IR-active, conventional techniques such as infrared absorption and Raman spectroscopy are restricted to probing phonons at the Brillouin zone center (Γ-point). In this work, we demonstrate that time- and spectrally resolved pump–probe ellipsometry enables access to the coherent response of electron–phonon coupled states involving both valence and conduction bands. Following two-photon absorption induced by the femtosecond pump pulse, the electronic excitation relaxes and drives the generation of coherent longitudinal optical phonons along the X-direction of the Brillouin zone, followed by optical transitions of entangled electron–phonon states along the Λ-direction. This process results in a transient, strongly correlated electron–phonon state that persists for up to ≈ 300 fs. Within this coherent time window, the silicon crystal exhibits optical resonances at electronic transition energies modulated by quantized phonon contributions. Finally, we detect further sidebands in the ellipsometric spectrum, which are 81 meV apart and assign these to two-phonon-assisted electronic transitions.},

  abstract     = {Bragg gratings possess unique functional attributes as fundamental integrated photonic devices. A reconfigurable grating unit based on a Bragg-grating-assisted Mach–Zehnder interferometer (GAMZI) is proposed as a versatile building block for programmable photonics. By integrating identical Bragg gratings into both arms of a thermo-optically tunable MZI, the device enables dynamic spectral reshaping—achieving bandwidth-tunable bandpass filters, phase-shifted gratings, and broadband filters with precise control over extinction ratios and bandwidths. The GAMZI architecture uniquely suppresses back-reflections while maintaining high port scalability, overcoming key limitations of conventional grating designs. Furthermore, a double-triangle recurrent network array using cascaded GAMZI units is demonstrated, enabling advanced functionalities such as ring-grating resonators, sampled gratings, and on-chip coarse wavelength division multiplexing. This work establishes a scalable and reconfigurable platform for on-chip spectral engineering, paving the way for adaptive optical signal processing in next-generation programmable photonic circuits.},

  abstract     = {Biosensing plays a crucial role in precision biomarker detection, enabling real-time monitoring and physiological health analysis, particularly in early diagnosis. Traditional biosensing techniques, such as electrochemical, fluorescence, and colorimetric methods, have shown remarkable performance. However, their reliability is often susceptible to nonspecific interference, may produce false-positive results, and is typically limited to the detection of known targets, restricting their applicability in addressing ambiguous or unknown biological problems. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) offers a powerful alternative, combining ultra-high sensitivity and molecular specificity. By supporting both label-free and label-based strategies, SERS broadens the detection scope, making it a promising platform for next-generation biosensing. In this Perspective, we aim at specific problems, introduce why SERS can do biosensing, how to advance SERS-based biosensing, and what SERS can do for early diagnosis. Finally, we discuss strategies to bridge the gap between laboratory research and clinical applications, emphasizing the important role of standardization and artificial intelligence in driving the practical transformation of SERS-based biosensing. Through these advancements, we aim to address existing limitations and further propel the evolution of SERS in biosensing and early diagnosis.},
