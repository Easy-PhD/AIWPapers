  abstract     = {The Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) serves as a pivotal element within urban networks, offering decision support to users and connected automated vehicles through comprehensive information gathering, sensing, device control, and data processing. Presently, ITS predominantly relies on sensors embedded in fixed infrastructure, notably Roadside Units (RSUs). However, RSUs are confined by coverage limitations and may encounter challenges in prompt emergency responses. On-demand resources, such as drones, present a viable option to supplement these deficiencies effectively. This article introduces an approach where Software-Defined Networking and Mobile Edge Computing technologies are integrated to formulate a high-availability drone swarm control and communication infrastructure framework comprising the cloud layer, edge layer, and device layer. Drones confront limitations in flight duration attributed to battery limitations, posing a challenge in sustaining continuous monitoring of road conditions over extended periods. Effective drone scheduling stands as a promising solution to overcome these constraints. To tackle this issue, we initially utilized Graph WaveNet, a specialized graph neural network structure tailored for spatial-temporal graph modeling, for training a congestion prediction model using real-world dataset inputs. Building upon this, we further propose an algorithm for drone scheduling based on congestion prediction. Our simulation experiments using real-world data demonstrate that, compared to the baseline method, the proposed scheduling algorithm not only yielded superior scheduling gains but also mitigated drone idle rates.},

  abstract     = {As an advanced carrier of on-board sensors, connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) can be viewed as an aggregation of self-adaptive systems with monitor-analyze-plan-execute (MAPE) for vehicle-related services. Meanwhile, machine learning (ML) has been applied to enhance analysis and plan functions of MAPE so that self-adaptive systems have optimal adaption to changing conditions. However, most of ML-based approaches don’t utilize CAVs’ connectivity to collaboratively generate an optimal learner for MAPE, because of sensor data threatened by gradient leakage attack (GLA). In this article, we first design an intelligent architecture for MAPE-based self-adaptive systems on web 3.0-based CAVs, in which a collaborative machine learner supports the capabilities of managing systems. Then, we observe by practical experiments that importance sampling of sparse vector technique (SVT) approaches cannot defend GLA well. Next, we propose a fine-grained SVT approach to secure the learner in MAPE-based self-adaptive systems that uses layer and gradient sampling to select uniform and important gradients. At last, extensive experiments show that our private learner spends a slight utility cost for MAPE (e.g., \(0.77\%\) decrease in accuracy) defending GLA and outperforms the typical SVT approaches in terms of defense (increased by \(10\) – \(14\%\) attack success rate) and utility (decreased by \(1.29\%\) accuracy loss).},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the proliferation of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) has revolutionized the transportation industry. However, these vehicles often face limitations in terms of local computing resources, leading to the need for offloading interactive-intensive application tasks to servers for processing. Traditional paradigm has its limitations in meeting the demands of massive task processing. The combination of Web3.0 and edge computing offers users high-reliable, low-latency, and highly flexible services. Nevertheless, the new paradigm also presents its own challenges such as ensuring privacy data protection, and reducing the time and energy costs associated with task offloading. To tackle these challenges, an edge task offloading framework based on consortium blockchain for CAVs has been developed. Within this framework, a consortium blockchain-based interaction-intensive task offloading method, called CBIToMe, has been designed. CBIToMe specifically addresses the multi-stage nature of interactive-intensive CAV tasks and aims to minimize task completion time and offloading costs, particularly when the waiting time for interaction is uncertain. Additionally, CBIToMe effectively utilizes consortium blockchain technology to safeguard the CAV privacy data. Results from experiments conducted in various scenarios demonstrate that CBIToMe outperforms three representative methods, showcasing its superior performance.},

  abstract     = {Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) Driving, as a data-driven intelligent driving technology within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), presents significant challenges to the efficiency and security of real-time data management. The combination of Web3.0 and edge content caching holds promise in providing low-latency data access for CAVs’ real-time applications. Web3.0 enables the reliable pre-migration of frequently requested content from content providers to edge nodes. However, identifying optimal edge node peers for joint content caching and replacement remains challenging due to the dynamic nature of traffic flow in IoV. Addressing these challenges, this article introduces GAMA-Cache, an innovative edge content caching methodology leveraging Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). GAMA-Cache conceptualizes the cooperative edge content caching issue as a constrained Markov decision process. It employs a MARL technique predicated on cooperation effectiveness to discern optimal caching decisions, with GAT augmenting information extracted from adjacent nodes. A distinct collaborator selection mechanism is also developed to streamline communication between agents, filtering out those with minimal correlations in the vector input to the policy network. Experimental results demonstrate that, in terms of service latency and delivery failure, the GAMA-Cache outperforms other state-of-the-art MARL solutions for edge content caching in IoV.},

  abstract     = {Connected vehicles due to the high mobility and dynamic network topologies of connected vehicles require accurate QoS that includes high throughput and low latency to assess satisfactory QoE. Existing methods mainly focus on centralized QoS prediction while paying little attention to distributed mobile QoS prediction, making it challenging to protect user privacy information when invoking Web services. Moreover, even though some advanced centralized methods can be transformed into federated architectures, they often face difficulty in capturing latent feature representations of users and services and learning personalized prediction layers between them due to the heterogeneity of the QoS dataset. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework for distributed QoS prediction, called Combining Personalized Federated Hypernetworks and Shared Residual Learning for Distributed QoS Prediction (FHR-DQP) . FHR-DQP adopts the federated averaging (FedAvg) to aggregate location-aware residual shared feature information across all clients. Additionally, a hypernetwork is leveraged to generate personalized networks for user-service QoS prediction in each client. These components are integrated as a hybrid framework that performs training using a federated approach and makes personalized QoS predictions within each client. Extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world benchmark QoS dataset called WS-DREAM, containing nearly 2,000,000 historical QoS invocation records. Compared with both centralized and federated competing baselines, the results demonstrate that FHR-DQP achieves the highest performance for distributed QoS prediction, when it provides privacy-preserving of users’ QoS invocations.},

  abstract     = {Task offloading is recognized as a promising approach to enhance the computational performance of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Some applications of CAVs, such as metaverse applications, require substantial resources, posing significant challenges to CAVs with limited computing and storage capacities. CAVs can offload resource-intensive applications to the Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) server, which has strong computing capabilities. To fully utilize the resources in the CAV system, partial offloading is employed. However, the local computing resources are limited for continuously generated partial offloading tasks. This results in many partially locally executed tasks experiencing long processing times or being discarded, which is detrimental to delay-sensitive tasks on CAVs. This article proposes Lyapunov function-guided reinforcement learning for the CAVs task offloading computational framework, LyDRL. Specifically, LyDRL first uses the Lyapunov function to transform the long-term objective optimization problem into subproblems determined at each time slot. In each time slot, deep reinforcement learning is used to obtain the optimal task offloading decision while satisfying the constraints. Simulation results show that compared with the existing algorithms, the proposed strategy can ensure the stability of the CAVs system and achieve the lowest system overhead.},

  abstract     = {The Web 3.0 and metaverse can empower intelligent application of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). The adoption of edge computing can contribute to the low latency interaction between CAVs and the metaverse. Microservices are widely deployed on edge networks and the cloud nowadays. User’s requests from CAVs are typically fulfilled through the composition of microservices, which may be hosted by contiguous edge nodes. Requests may differ on their required resources at runtime. Consequently, when requests are continuously injected into edge networks, the usage of heterogenous resources, including CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, may not be the same, or differ significantly, on certain edge nodes. This happens especially when burst requests are injected into the network to be satisfied concurrently. Therefore, the usage of heterogenous resources provided by edge nodes should be co-optimized through re-scheduling microservices. To address this challenge, this article proposes a Web 3.0-enabled M icroservice R e- S cheduling approach (called MRS ), which is a migration-based mechanism integrating a placement strategy. Specifically, we formulate the MRS task as a multi-objective and multi-constraint optimization problem, which can be solved through a penalty signal-integrated framework and an improved pointer network. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets. Evaluation results show that our MRS performs better than the counterparts with improvements of at least 7.7%, 2.4%, and 2.2% in terms of network throughput, latency, and energy consumption, respectively.},

The system applies QKD to produce unbreakable quantum keys which defend vehicle communication networks and blockchain systems strengthen governing networks by decentralizing operations and ensuring transparency and credibility. This framework employs QKD together with blockchain technology through a structure that demonstrates adaptability to changing networking conditions and cyber dangers within CAV environments. The independent operational mindset allows for automatic security rule updates that result in steady improvements to the encryption standards and system protocols. The framework demonstrates its functionality through simulations performed on multiple traffic conditions featuring different speeds together with density levels. The analysis included evaluation of energy efficiency together with overhead ratio performance as well as QKD success rates and blockchain verification duration. The testing results demonstrate that this system performs effectively under different operational scenarios while demonstrating strong defense capabilities against Sybil and Wormhole security attacks. Under dense traffic scenarios, Quantum-Secured Trust Management Framework (QSTMF) delivered improved network throughput reaching 15% above current models while high-speed traffic circumstances led to 20% diminished blockchain verification times. Attack detection rate performance of the framework exceeded 90% throughout multiple attack simulations indicating its robust capabilities for vehicle communication protection.},

To address this deficiency, we introduce INSYTE, a multi-faceted framework that supports the classification of AI systems ranging from traditional rule-based systems to cutting-edge embodied AI and agentic systems. To that end, INSYTE considers the essential characteristics of an AI system across eight key dimensions grouped into four categories: system design ( underspecification and adaptiveness ); functionality ( breadth and depth ); operating environment ( diversity and dynamism ); and independence from human operational control ( intervention and oversight ). Different AI systems (or versions of systems) yield different ‘patterns’ on an eight-axis radar chart that INSYTE uses to provide an immediate visual summary of an AI system’s overall capability and a detailed representation of its individual characteristics. The INSYTE framework aligns with OECD’s definition of deployed AI systems, which is becoming the standard definition used by legislators and developers worldwide.},
