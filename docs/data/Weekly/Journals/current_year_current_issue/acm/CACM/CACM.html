  abstract     = {The widespread use of embedded systems has increased the risk of physical memory disclosure attacks. A notable example is the cold boot attack, where attackers exploit DRAM’s temperature-dependent data retention property. At low temperatures, DRAM cells temporarily retain their state after power loss, allowing sensitive data to be recovered. Cold boot attacks can expose system secrets, bypassing defenses like disk encryption. To counter this threat, developers store sensitive data in on-chip SRAM. Unlike DRAM, on-chip SRAM is isolated from external access and, due to its low capacitance, loses data almost immediately when powered off, making it robust against such attacks. While SRAM protects against traditional cold boot attacks, we show that there is another way to retain information in on-chip SRAM across power cycles. This paper presents Volt Boot , an attack that demonstrates a vulnerability of on-chip SRAM due to the physical separation common in modern system-on-chip power distribution networks. Volt Boot leverages asymmetrical power states (for example, on vs. off) to force SRAM state retention across power cycles, eliminating the need for traditional cold boot attack enablers, such as low-temperature or intrinsic data retention time. Using three modern ARM Cortex-A SOCs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack in caches, registers, and iRAMs. Unlike other forms of SRAM data retention attacks, Volt Boot retrieves data with 100% accuracy—without any complex post-processing.},

  abstract     = {When working to build machines that have a form of intelligence, it is natural to be inspired by human intelligence. Of course, humans are very different from machines, in their embodiment and myriad other ways. Humans exploit their bodies to experience the world, create an internal model of it, and use this model to reason, learn, and make contextual and informed decisions. Machines lack the same embodiment, but often have access to both more memory and more computing power. Despite these crucial disanalogies, it is still useful to leverage our knowledge of how the human mind reasons and makes decisions to design and build machines that demonstrate behaviors similar to that of a human. In this article, we present a novel AI architecture, Slow and Fast AI (SOFAI), that is inspired by the “thinking fast and slow” cognitive theory of human decision making. SOFAI is a multi-agent architecture that employs both “fast” and “slow” solvers underneath a metacognitive agent that is able to both choose among a set of solvers as well as reflect on and learn from past experience. Experimental results on the behavior of two instances of the SOFAI architecture show that, compared to using just one of the two decision modalities, SOFAI is markedly better in terms of decision quality, resource consumption, and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Problem: We address the challenge in responsible computing where an exploitable mobile app is misused by one app user (an abuser ) against another user or bystander ( victim ). We introduce the idea of a misuse audit of apps as a way of determining if they are exploitable without access to their implementation. Method: We leverage app reviews to identify exploitable apps and their functionalities that enable misuse. First, we build a computational model to identify alarming reviews (which report misuse). Second, using the model, we identify exploitable apps and their functionalities. Third, we validate them through manual inspection of reviews. Findings: Stories by abusers and victims mostly focus on past misuses, whereas stories by third parties mostly identify stories indicating the potential for misuse. Surprisingly, positive reviews by abusers, which exhibit language with high dominance, also reveal misuses. In total, we confirmed 156 exploitable apps facilitating the misuse. Based on our qualitative analysis, we found exploitable apps exhibiting four types of exploitable functionalities. Implications: Our method can help identify exploitable apps and their functionalities, facilitating misuse audits of a large pool of apps.},

  abstract     = {Formal specifications have numerous benefits for both designers and users of network protocols. They provide clear, unambiguous representations, which are useful as documentation and for testing. They can help reveal disagreements about what a protocol “is” and identify areas where further work is needed to resolve ambiguities or internal inconsistencies. They also provide a foundation for formal reasoning, making it possible to establish important security and correctness guarantees on all inputs and in every environment. Despite these advantages, formal methods are not widely used to design, implement, and validate network protocols today. Instead, Internet protocols are usually described in informal documents, such as IETF Requests for Comments (RFCs) or IEEE standards. These documents primarily consist of lengthy prose descriptions, accompanied by pseudocode, header descriptions, state machine diagrams, and reference implementations which are used for interoperability testing. So, while RFCs and reference implementations were only intended to help guide the social process used by protocol designers, they have evolved into the closest things to formal specifications the Internet community has. In this paper, we discuss the different roles that specifications play in the networking and formal methods communities. We then illustrate the potential benefits of specifying protocols formally, presenting highlights from several recent success stories. Finally, we identify key differences between how formal specifications are understood by the two communities and suggest possible strategies to bridge the gaps.},

Three of the main ones are the roles of a) impartial observer, b) a guide to what is good or bad, or c) an agent of change. In this article, I argue that the first one is impossible, the second is insufficient, and the third is important but also highly complex. Using AI ethics and the social media platform Twitter/X (X from here on out) as an example, I explore the nature and scope of a potential duty to act on one’s own research findings as an ethicist. I argue that there is a case to be made for such a duty if an ethicist identifies and recognizes a technology’s harmful potential and wishes to avoid complicity and hypocrisy.},
