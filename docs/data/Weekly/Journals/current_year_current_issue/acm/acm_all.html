  abstract     = {The widespread use of embedded systems has increased the risk of physical memory disclosure attacks. A notable example is the cold boot attack, where attackers exploit DRAM’s temperature-dependent data retention property. At low temperatures, DRAM cells temporarily retain their state after power loss, allowing sensitive data to be recovered. Cold boot attacks can expose system secrets, bypassing defenses like disk encryption. To counter this threat, developers store sensitive data in on-chip SRAM. Unlike DRAM, on-chip SRAM is isolated from external access and, due to its low capacitance, loses data almost immediately when powered off, making it robust against such attacks. While SRAM protects against traditional cold boot attacks, we show that there is another way to retain information in on-chip SRAM across power cycles. This paper presents Volt Boot , an attack that demonstrates a vulnerability of on-chip SRAM due to the physical separation common in modern system-on-chip power distribution networks. Volt Boot leverages asymmetrical power states (for example, on vs. off) to force SRAM state retention across power cycles, eliminating the need for traditional cold boot attack enablers, such as low-temperature or intrinsic data retention time. Using three modern ARM Cortex-A SOCs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack in caches, registers, and iRAMs. Unlike other forms of SRAM data retention attacks, Volt Boot retrieves data with 100% accuracy—without any complex post-processing.},

  abstract     = {When working to build machines that have a form of intelligence, it is natural to be inspired by human intelligence. Of course, humans are very different from machines, in their embodiment and myriad other ways. Humans exploit their bodies to experience the world, create an internal model of it, and use this model to reason, learn, and make contextual and informed decisions. Machines lack the same embodiment, but often have access to both more memory and more computing power. Despite these crucial disanalogies, it is still useful to leverage our knowledge of how the human mind reasons and makes decisions to design and build machines that demonstrate behaviors similar to that of a human. In this article, we present a novel AI architecture, Slow and Fast AI (SOFAI), that is inspired by the “thinking fast and slow” cognitive theory of human decision making. SOFAI is a multi-agent architecture that employs both “fast” and “slow” solvers underneath a metacognitive agent that is able to both choose among a set of solvers as well as reflect on and learn from past experience. Experimental results on the behavior of two instances of the SOFAI architecture show that, compared to using just one of the two decision modalities, SOFAI is markedly better in terms of decision quality, resource consumption, and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Problem: We address the challenge in responsible computing where an exploitable mobile app is misused by one app user (an abuser ) against another user or bystander ( victim ). We introduce the idea of a misuse audit of apps as a way of determining if they are exploitable without access to their implementation. Method: We leverage app reviews to identify exploitable apps and their functionalities that enable misuse. First, we build a computational model to identify alarming reviews (which report misuse). Second, using the model, we identify exploitable apps and their functionalities. Third, we validate them through manual inspection of reviews. Findings: Stories by abusers and victims mostly focus on past misuses, whereas stories by third parties mostly identify stories indicating the potential for misuse. Surprisingly, positive reviews by abusers, which exhibit language with high dominance, also reveal misuses. In total, we confirmed 156 exploitable apps facilitating the misuse. Based on our qualitative analysis, we found exploitable apps exhibiting four types of exploitable functionalities. Implications: Our method can help identify exploitable apps and their functionalities, facilitating misuse audits of a large pool of apps.},

  abstract     = {Formal specifications have numerous benefits for both designers and users of network protocols. They provide clear, unambiguous representations, which are useful as documentation and for testing. They can help reveal disagreements about what a protocol “is” and identify areas where further work is needed to resolve ambiguities or internal inconsistencies. They also provide a foundation for formal reasoning, making it possible to establish important security and correctness guarantees on all inputs and in every environment. Despite these advantages, formal methods are not widely used to design, implement, and validate network protocols today. Instead, Internet protocols are usually described in informal documents, such as IETF Requests for Comments (RFCs) or IEEE standards. These documents primarily consist of lengthy prose descriptions, accompanied by pseudocode, header descriptions, state machine diagrams, and reference implementations which are used for interoperability testing. So, while RFCs and reference implementations were only intended to help guide the social process used by protocol designers, they have evolved into the closest things to formal specifications the Internet community has. In this paper, we discuss the different roles that specifications play in the networking and formal methods communities. We then illustrate the potential benefits of specifying protocols formally, presenting highlights from several recent success stories. Finally, we identify key differences between how formal specifications are understood by the two communities and suggest possible strategies to bridge the gaps.},

In this article, I argue that the first one is impossible, the second is insufficient, and the third is important but also highly complex. Using AI ethics and the social media platform Twitter/X (X from here on out) as an example, I explore the nature and scope of a potential duty to act on one’s own research findings as an ethicist. I argue that there is a case to be made for such a duty if an ethicist identifies and recognizes a technology’s harmful potential and wishes to avoid complicity and hypocrisy.},

Thus encouraging the development of a comprehensive survey. Besides analyzing the models used in this context, we also discuss some tasks of definition and paradigm applied in AI multimedia. In addition, we investigate objective functions frequently used and discuss how audio-visual data is exploited in the optimization process, i.e., the different methodologies for representing knowledge in the audio-visual domain. In fact, we focus on how human-understandable mechanisms, i.e., structured knowledge that reflects comprehensible knowledge, can guide the learning process. Most importantly, we provide a summarization of the recent progress of ()avcl and discuss the future research directions.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent transportation systems are vital for modern traffic management and optimization, greatly improving traffic efficiency and safety. With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) technologies in areas like image generation and natural language processing, generative AI has also played a crucial role in addressing key issues in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), such as data sparsity, difficulty in observing abnormal scenarios, and in modeling data uncertainty. In this review, we systematically investigate the relevant literature on generative AI techniques in addressing key issues in different types of tasks in ITS tailored specifically for road transportation. First, we introduce the principles of different generative AI techniques. Then, we classify tasks in ITS into four types: traffic perception, traffic prediction, traffic simulation, and traffic decision-making. We systematically illustrate how generative AI techniques addresses key issues in these four different types of tasks. Finally, we summarize the challenges faced in applying generative AI to ITS, and discuss future research directions based on different application scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Differential privacy (DP), a rigorously quantifiable privacy preservation technique, has found widespread application within the domain of machine learning. As DP techniques are implemented in machine learning algorithms, a significant and intricate tradeoff between privacy and utility emerges, garnering extensive attention from researchers. In the pursuit of striking a delicate equilibrium between safeguarding sensitive data and optimizing its utility, researchers have introduced various variants of Relaxed Differential Privacy (RDP) definitions. These nuanced formulations, however, exhibit substantial diversity in their underlying principles and interpretations of the core concept of DP, thereby engendering a current void in the comprehensive synthesis of these related works. The principal objective of this article is twofold. Firstly, it aims to provide a comprehensive summary of pertinent research endeavors pertaining to RDP within the realm of machine learning. Secondly, it endeavors to empirically assess the impact on both privacy and utility stemming from machine learning algorithms founded upon these RDP definitions. Additionally, this article undertakes a systematic analysis of the foundational principles underpinning distinct variants of relaxed definitions, culminating in the development of a taxonomy that categorizes these RDP definitions.},

On the other hand, data-driven approaches have shown much promise in identifying manipulations in images and videos. However, most forensic tools ignore deep learning in favour of more traditional methodologies. This article thoroughly analyses the current state-of-the-art methods for detecting and localizing image alteration using classical and deep learning-based algorithms. In addition, this review includes the latest developments in the digital image forensics field, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), while incorporating insights from classical approaches and machine learning models. Furthermore, the most significant data-driven techniques to address the issue of image manipulation detection and localization are presented and segregated into four subtopics: copy-move, splicing, object removal, and contrast enhancement. This study provides an exhaustive and up-to-date survey of the field for researchers and practitioners working in this domain. In addition, it covers the current challenges and future directions in deep learning for image manipulation detection and localization. Finally, this review’s discussion of relevant approaches and experiments will aid future exploration and development in this field.},

As a key tool for realizing more cybersecure ecosystems, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have evolved tremendously in recent years by integrating machine learning (ML) techniques to detect increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks hidden in big data. However, traditional approaches rely on centralized learning, in which data from end nodes are shared with data centers for analysis. Recently, the application of federated learning (FL) in this context has attracted great interest to come up with collaborative intrusion detection approaches where data does not need to be shared. Due to the recent rise of this field, this work presents a complete, contemporary taxonomy for FL-enabled IDS approaches that stems from a comprehensive survey of the literature from 2018 to 2022. Precisely, our discussion includes an analysis of the main ML models, datasets, aggregation functions, as well as implementation libraries employed by the proposed FL-enabled IDS approaches. On top of everything else, we provide a critical view of the current state of the research around this topic, and describe the main challenges and future directions based on the analysis of the literature and our own experience in this area.},

  abstract     = {Neonatal biometrics, especially those based on fingerprint traits, can potentially improve early childhood identification with decisive applications in healthcare, identity management, and other critical social domains. Although many biometric approaches to human recognition exist, most of them cannot be directly applied to neonates. The main barrier is the reduced size of children’s biometric traits, which affects image quality as these traits are still developing. Another issue is the lack of child biometric databases, as a periodic recollection of images is a fundamental part of neonatal identification regarding the feasibility evaluation of temporal recognition. Several works can be found in the literature addressing some of these issues. However, there is still no systematic review allowing a general understanding of these solutions, discussing their links, gaps, comparisons, and open challenges. In this sense, this article presents a systematic literature review on neonatal biometrics. In total, 1,878 papers were screened and classified, resulting in 45 being selected to be analyzed in this study. We detail and compare the results of datasets, scanners, methods, and techniques to achieve and improve neonatal recognition.

However, their misuse introduces vulnerabilities, potentially leading to severe data breaches and substantial financial loss. Complex API design, inadequate documentation, and insufficient security training often lead to unintentional misuse by developers. The software security community has devised and evaluated several approaches to detecting security API misuse to help developers and organizations. This study rigorously reviews the literature on detecting misuse of security APIs to gain a comprehensive understanding of this critical domain. Our goal is to identify and analyze security API misuses, the detection approaches developed, and the evaluation methodologies employed along with the open research avenues to advance the state-of-the-art in this area. Employing the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology, we analyzed 69 research articles. Our review has yielded (a) identification of 6 security API types; (b) classification of 30 distinct misuses; (c) categorization of detection techniques into heuristic-based and ML-based approaches; and (d) identification of 10 performance measures and 9 evaluation benchmarks. The review reveals a lack of coverage of detection approaches in several areas. We recommend that future efforts focus on aligning security API development with developers’ needs and advancing standardized evaluation methods for detection technologies.},

To address this gap, we present a novel two-dimensional taxonomy that classifies gaze interactions by (1) the type of input , distinguishing between gaze-only and gaze-assisted modalities, and (2) the type of target , differentiating between those requiring absolute gaze coordinates and thus higher accuracy, and those using relative coordinates, which tolerate lower accuracy. Our taxonomy explicitly captures the required input accuracy and interface constraints of each technique, providing clearer guidance for designers of gaze-based interfaces. We apply this taxonomy to review and classify 125 studies of active gaze interactions on 2D displays. The findings highlight promising techniques and identify research opportunities to advance gaze interaction design.},

Integrating supervised deep learning techniques with EEG signals has recently facilitated automatic analysis across diverse EEG-based tasks. However, the label issues of EEG signals have constrained the development of EEG-based deep models. Obtaining EEG annotations is difficult and requires domain experts to guide collection and labeling, and the variability of EEG signals among different subjects causes significant label shifts. To solve the above challenges, self-supervised learning (SSL) has been proposed to extract representations from unlabeled samples through well-designed pretext tasks. This article concentrates on integrating SSL frameworks with temporal EEG signals to achieve efficient representations and proposes a systematic survey of the SSL for EEG signals. In this article, (1) We introduce the concept and theory of self-supervised learning and typical SSL frameworks. (2) We provide a comprehensive survey of SSL for EEG analysis, including taxonomy, methodology, and technical details of the existing EEG-based SSL frameworks, and discuss the differences between these methods. (3) We investigate the adaptation of the SSL approach to various downstream tasks, including the task description and related benchmark datasets, and further explore its application in large-scale pre-trained foundation models for EEG signals.

However, with the advent of microservice architectures and cloud-native technologies, root cause localization becomes an arduous task. Frequent updates in systems result in large-scale data and complex dependencies. Traditional analysis methods relying on manual experience and predefined rules have limited data processing and cannot learn new fault patterns from historical knowledge. Artificial Intelligence techniques have emerged as powerful tools to leverage historical knowledge and are now widely used in root cause localization. In this article, we provide a structured overview and a qualitative analysis of root cause localization in microservice systems. To begin with, we review the literature in this area and abstract a workflow of root cause localization, including multimodal data collection, intelligent root cause analysis, and performance evaluation. In particular, we highlight the role played by Artificial Intelligence techniques.

  abstract     = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries, offering new opportunities to manage and enhance innovation. However, these advancements bring significant challenges for scientists and businesses, with one of the most critical being the ‘trustworthiness” of AI systems. A key requirement of trustworthiness is transparency , closely linked to explicability . Consequently, the exponential growth of eXplainable AI (XAI) has led to the development of numerous methods and metrics for explainability. Nevertheless, this has resulted in a lack of standardized and formal definitions for fundamental XAI properties (e.g., what do soundness, completeness, and faithfulness of an explanation entail? How is the stability of an XAI method defined?). This lack of consensus makes it difficult for XAI practitioners to establish a shared foundation, thereby impeding the effective benchmarking of XAI methods. This survey article addresses these challenges with two primary objectives. First, it systematically reviews and categorizes XAI properties, distinguishing them between human-centered (relying on empirical studies involving explainees) or functionally-grounded (quantitative metrics independent of explainees). Second, it expands this analysis by introducing a hierarchically structured, functionally grounded benchmark framework for XAI methods, providing formal definitions of XAI properties. The framework’s practicality is demonstrated by applying it to two widely used methods: LIME and SHAP.},

In the present effort, while providing a taxonomy to distinguish between search-based versus learning-based approaches, we survey graph-based studies from the search-based category, motivated as they comprise the mainstream. We present a unifying and vetted overview of the various definitions in this realm, scrutinize assumptions, and identify shortfalls. We start by reviewing initial approaches to the Expert Team Formation problem to lay the conceptual foundations and set forth the necessary notions for a more grounded view of this realm. Next, we provide a detailed view of graph-based Expert Team Formation approaches based on the objective functions they optimize. We lay out who builds on whom and how algorithms have evolved to solve the drawbacks of previous works. Furthermore, we categorize evaluation schemas and elaborate on metrics and insights that can be drawn from each.

  abstract     = {Over the past decade, the integration of electromyography (EMG) techniques with machine learning has significantly advanced prosthetic device control. Researchers have developed sophisticated deep learning classifiers for gesture recognition and created EMG controllers capable of simultaneous proportional control across multiple degrees of freedom. However, the increasing complexity of these machine learning models demands greater computational power, creating challenges for real-time deployment on embedded prosthetic controllers. Various optimization techniques - including hyperdimensional computing, pruning, and quantization - have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing computational requirements while preserving system performance. Concurrently, biomedical research has explored muscle and task synergies as methods to simplify inputs for machine learning models. This review examines synergy extraction in upper limb prosthetics research and identifies the need for standardized hardware specifications to facilitate proper validation and comparison of research outcomes. Furthermore, it explores how optimization techniques from Internet of Things (IoT) applications could enhance EMG controllers in biomedical settings. The analysis identifies sensor fusion and high-density EMG as particularly promising approaches for achieving robust, generalized control of upper limb prosthetics.},

This article takes a pragmatic approach to reviewing recent advances in the field by focusing on the prevalent streaming paradigm that involves delivering long-form two-dimensional videos over the best-effort Internet with client-side adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms and assistance from content delivery networks (CDNs). To enhance accessibility, we supplement the survey with tutorial material. Unlike existing surveys that offer fragmented views, our work provides a holistic perspective on the entire end-to-end streaming pipeline, from video capture by a camera-equipped device to playback by the end user. Our novel perspective covers the ingestion, processing, and distribution stages of the pipeline and addresses key challenges such as video compression, upload, transcoding, ABR algorithms, CDN support, and quality of experience. We review over 200 papers and classify streaming designs by problem-solving methodology, whether based on intuition, theory, or machine learning. The survey further refines these methodology-based categories and characterizes each design by additional traits such as compatible codecs. We connect the reviewed research to real-world applications by discussing the practices of commercial streaming platforms. Finally, the survey highlights prominent current trends and outlines future directions in video streaming.},

  abstract     = {Graph deep learning methods have become popular tools to process collections of correlated time series. Unlike traditional multivariate forecasting methods, graph-based predictors leverage pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on graphs spanning the time series collection. The conditioning takes the form of architectural inductive biases on the forecasting architecture, resulting in a family of models called spatiotemporal graph neural networks. These biases allow for training global forecasting models on large collections of time series while localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (nodes) by accounting for correlations among them (edges). Recent advances in graph neural networks and deep learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing framework appealing and timely. However, most studies focus on refining existing architectures by exploiting modern deep-learning practices. Conversely, foundational and methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To fill this void, this tutorial paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological framework formalizing the forecasting problem and providing design principles for graph-based predictors, as well as methods to assess their performance. In addition, together with an overview of the field, we provide design guidelines and best practices, as well as an in-depth discussion of open challenges and future directions.},

Electroencephalography (EEG) microstate analysis emerges as a promising neurophysiological method to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain networks at high temporal resolution. An EEG microstate represents a unique topography of electric potentials over the multichannel EEG records. However, academia has neglected classifying published studies on EEG microstate analysis related to SE. Hence, a careful understanding of state-of-the-art studies remains limited and inconclusive. This article aims at classifying studies on the EEG microstate analysis in cognitive SE tasks. We conducted a systematic mapping study following well-established guidelines to answer ten research questions. After careful filtering, 54 primary studies (out of 1.545) were selected from 8 electronic databases. The main results are that most primary studies focus on revealing brain dynamics, exploring a wide range of EEG microstate application contexts and experimental tasks, running empirical studies in a controlled environment, using K -means as a clustering method, applying ICA-based strategy to filter artifacts, such as muscle activity and eye blinks. However, No study has applied EEG microstate analysis to SE, highlighting a significant gap and the need for further research.

If the predicted future events do not comply with this state, actions are taken towards achieving desirable future states. Evidently, event prediction is valuable in many application domains such as business and natural disasters. The diversity of application domains results in a diverse range of methods that are scattered across various research areas which, in turn, use different terminology for event prediction methods.

Beyond categorizing and synthesizing these studies, we identify important insights into ChatGPT’s potential impact on secure programming. Key findings indicate that while ChatGPT shows great promise as an aid in writing secure code, challenges remain. Its effectiveness varies across security tasks, depending on the context of experimentation (programming language, CWE, code length, etc.) and the benchmark used for comparison–whether against other LLMs, traditional analysis tools, or its own versions.

  abstract     = {Byzantine Broadcast (BB) is a central question in distributed systems, and an important challenge is to understand its round complexity. Under the honest majority setting, it is long known that there exist randomized protocols that can achieve BB in expected constant rounds, regardless of the number of nodes n . However, whether we can match the expected constant round complexity in the corrupt majority setting —or more precisely, when \(f \ge n/2 + \omega (1)\) —remains unknown, where f denotes the number of corrupt nodes. In this article, we are the first to resolve this long-standing question. We show how to achieve BB in expected \(O((n/(n-f))^2)\) rounds. Our results hold under a weakly adaptive adversary who cannot perform “after-the-fact removal” of messages already sent by a node before it becomes corrupt. We also assume trusted setup and the Decision Linear (DLIN) assumption in bilinear groups.},

  abstract     = {Small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) provide an invaluable resource for performing a variety of surveillance, search, and delivery tasks in remote or hostile terrains which may not be accessible by other means. Due to the critical role sUAS play in these situations, it is vital that they are well configured in order to ensure a safe and stable flight. However, it is not uncommon for mistakes to occur in configuration and calibration, leading to failures or incomplete missions. To address this problem, we propose a set of self-adaptive mechanisms and implement them into a self-adaptive framework, Controller Instability-preventing Configuration-Aware Drone Adaptation (CICADA). CICADA dynamically detects unstable drone behavior during flight and adapts to mitigate this threat. We have built a prototype of CICADA using a popular open source sUAS flight control software and experimented with a large number of different configurations in simulation. We then performed a case study with physical drones to determine if our framework will work in practice. Experimental results show that CICADA ’s adaptations reduce controller instability and enable the sUAS to recover from up to 33.8% of poor configurations. In cases where we cannot complete the intended mission, invoking alternative adaptations may still help by allowing the vehicle to loiter or land safely in place, avoiding potentially catastrophic crashes. These safety-focused adaptations can mitigate unsafe behavior in 52.9% to 64.7% of dangerous configurations. We further show that rule-based approaches can be leveraged to automatically select an appropriate adaptation strategy based on the severity of instability encountered, with up to a 14.2% improvement over direct adaptation. Finally, we introduce a variation of our primary adaptation strategy designed to allow more cautious adaptation with limited configuration information, which gets within 6.7% of our primary adaptation strategy despite not requiring an optimal knowledge base.},

  abstract     = {Generic controllers for self-adaptive systems can be configured parametrically according to system needs, even though their reuse is restricted because of the wide range of services that may be provided by each stage of a feedback control loop, like MAPE-K. Rainbow is a typical example of such a generic, monolithic controller. This article revisits and extends prior work that advocates structurally flexible controllers, as ensembles of micro-controllers each providing specific services. We experimented with our approach with three different architectural configurations for the controller—monolithic, decentralised and decentralised with a meta-controller. Our results indicate that despite the decentralised configuration with a meta-controller demanding more computational resources, it performed comparatively well compared to the other configurations, including when measuring the target system’s response time. Moreover, we found that variations of the control loop timing at the different layers of the controller impact the stability of the target system. We have also evolved the controller by adding a new micro-controller, which caused no impact on the other micro-controllers, and mostly kept the target system’s performance. We conclude that a multi-layered controller design, based on micro-controllers, provides the basis for defining structurally flexible controllers at operational-time and may promote reuse at development-time.},

However, the uncertainty related to selecting a specific system model over plausible alternatives has received limited attention. Our work focuses on self-adaptation, exploring methods to tackle uncertainty in model selection. This includes scenarios where one model is chosen over competing alternatives to encapsulate the system’s understanding and anticipate future observations. Our proposed solution augments the conventional feedback loop of self-adaptive systems by combining Bayesian model averaging to mitigate uncertainty and many-objective optimization to take into account multiple, possibly many, dependability requirements at the same time. We carry out an empirical evaluation to study the effectiveness, cost, and scalability of the proposed approach using two case studies with increasing structural complexity and number of dependability requirements. Results show that our approach based on model averaging is significantly better than model selection in terms of satisfied requirements after adaptation (adaptation success frequency). We also show that our approach can deal with large model spaces ( \(\sim 10^{19}\) ) using efficient sampling methods rather than exhaustive model space exploration.},

  abstract     = {Microservice architectures are increasingly used to modularize IoT applications and deploy them in distributed and heterogeneous edge computing environments. Over time, these microservice-based IoT applications are susceptible to performance anomalies caused by resource hogging (e.g., CPU or memory), resource contention, etc., which can negatively impact their Quality of Service and violate their Service Level Agreements. Existing research on performance anomaly detection for edge computing environments focuses on model training approaches that either achieve high accuracy at the expense of a time-consuming and resource-intensive training process or prioritize training efficiency at the cost of lower accuracy. To address this gap, while considering the resource constraints and the large number of devices in modern edge platforms, we propose two clustering-based model training approaches: (1) intra-cluster parameter transfer learning (ICPTL)-based model training and (2) cluster-level model (CM) training. These approaches aim to find a tradeoff between the training efficiency of anomaly detection models and their accuracy. We compared the models trained under ICPTL and CM to models trained for specific devices (most accurate, least efficient) and a single general model trained for all devices (least accurate, most efficient). Our findings show that ICPTL’s model accuracy is comparable to that of the model per device approach while requiring only 40% of the training time. In addition, CM further improves training efficiency by requiring 23% less training time and reducing the number of trained models by approximately 66% compared to ICPTL, yet achieving a higher accuracy than a single general model.},

The VDI-LSTM model is designed, incorporating graph convolution and attention mechanisms to capture vehicle interactions using trajectory data and dynamic information. Specifically, a dynamics encoder is designed to capture the dynamic information, a dynamic graph is employed to represent vehicle interactions, and an attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the performance of LSTM and graph convolution. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, extensive experiments are conducted, including comparisons with several baselines and ablation studies on real-world highway datasets. Experimental results show that VDI-LSTM outperforms other baselines compared, which obtains a 3% improvement on the average RMSE indicator over the five prediction steps.},

  abstract     = {Many operations in workflow systems are dependent on database tables. The classical workflow nets and their extensions (e.g., workflow nets with data) cannot model these operations, so that they cannot find some related errors. Recently, workflow nets with tables (WFT-nets) were proposed to remedy such a flaw. However, existing methods for constructing the reachability graph of the WFT-nets can generate pseudo states because they do not take into account the guards that constrain the enabling and firing of transitions. Additionally, only the soundness property of WFT-nets is considered that represents a single design requirement, while many other requirements, especially those related to tables, cannot be analyzed. In this article, we re-define the formalism of WFT-nets by augmenting the constraints of guards to them and re-name them as workflow nets with tables and constraints (WFTC-nets). We propose a new method to generate the state reachability graph (SRG) of WFTC-nets such that the SRG can avoid pseudo states by considering the guard constraints. To represent design requirements related to database operations, we define database-oriented computation tree logic (DCTL). We design the model checking algorithms of DCTL based on the SRG of WFTC-nets and develop a tool. Experiments on several public benchmarks show the usefulness of our methods.},

Therefore, we propose a TSN cache scheme for the GPU platform. This scheme employs distinct management strategies for data with varying reusability in the cache, effectively leveraging the locality of these different data types. In addition, the TSN cache scheme can also reduce the probability of cache thrashing caused by low-reuse data.

  abstract     = {Popular big data frameworks commonly run atop Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and rely on garbage collection (GC) mechanism to automatically allocate/reclaim in-memory objects. Existing garbage collectors are designed based on the hypothesis that most objects are short lived. However, big data frameworks usually generate many long-lived data objects, which can cause heavy GC overhead. Recent approaches have reduced GC overhead in big data frameworks but still suffer from heavy human efforts, additional runtime overhead, or suboptimal GC efficiency. This article describes the design of BridgeGC , a big-data-friendly garbage collector that significantly reduces GC overhead introduced by long-lived data objects. BridgeGC follows a cross-level co-design. At the big data framework level, BridgeGC provides two annotations for framework developers to denote the creation and release of data objects. Based on the annotations, BridgeGC tracks the lifecycles of annotated data objects and optimizes their allocation/reclamation at the GC level. At the GC level, we design a label-based allocator that stores data objects separately from other objects and balances their memory usage in the same JVM, leading to fewer GC cycles. We further design an efficient collector to eliminate unnecessary marking and copying of data objects during GC cycles, lowering the GC time. We have integrated BridgeGC into OpenJDK ZGC. The extensive evaluation, using two popular big data frameworks (Flink and Spark) and a key–value database (Cassandra), shows that BridgeGC achieves 31–82% GC time reduction compared to the baseline ZGC. BridgeGC also outperforms other traditional and academic garbage collectors in end-to-end performance.},

  abstract     = {Securing systems’ main memory is important for building trusted data centers. To ensure memory security, encryption and integrity verification techniques update the security metadata (e.g., encryption counters and integrity trees) during memory data writes. Existing studies are optimistic about the effect of data writes on system performance since they regard all data writes as background operations. However, we show that security metadata updates significantly increase data write latency. High-latency data writes frequently fill up write buffers in the system, forcing the system to perform the writes in the critical path. As a result, performance-critical data reads need to wait for the execution of these writes, which increases data read latency and degrades system performance. In this article, we propose SEED that improves the performance of secure memory systems by speculatively updating security metadata in the background before data writes arrive. To enable speculative updates, SEED predicts which dirty cache lines will be written to memory through natural evictions. We find that cache evictions depend on multiple factors. To decouple the dependencies for accurate predictions, we devise a two-step eviction prediction method based on our observation that the next eviction victim rarely changes in a set. The first step predicts which cache sets will evict cache lines, whereas the second step predicts which cache lines will be evicted by finding the next eviction victims in the sets. For predicted evictions, we develop a speculative updater to perform speculative updates. We analyze the invariants that must be followed by the updater to ensure the correctness of speculative updates. The updater rolls back the speculatively updated security metadata of inaccurate predictions. To reduce the rollback overhead, we devise a rollback batching and an update pausing optimization for the updater. Experimental results show that SEED reduces data write latency by 39.8%, data read latency by 44.9%, and improves performance by 40.0% on average compared with the state-of-the-art secure memory design.},

  abstract     = {In CPU-parsimonious environments, such as disaggregated memory systems, the limited CPU power on the memory side constrains the ability to perform more operations. Thus, reducing CPU usage and enhancing concurrency performance are critical for indexing key-value storage in these scenarios. Current hash indexes support one-sided RDMA access and lock-free concurrency control with good performance but lack range query support. In contrast, existing tree indexes support range query but only implement expensive locks for concurrency control. Therefore, designing a tree index that supports lock-free concurrent access and one-sided RDMA is a significant challenge. To address these issues, this paper proposes a lock-free tree index based on the van Emde Boas (vEB) tree, called vBoost. vBoost inherits the vEB tree’s characteristics of index nodes without splitting or merging, and simplifies concurrency control by managing changes at a single node. It redesigns tree nodes with an 8-byte compact data structure, allowing each key-value pair to support RDMA_CAS atomic operations for lock-free concurrency. Additionally, vBoost leverages the RDMA Doorbell technique to reduce RTTs, enhancing range query and write performance. Evaluation results show that, vBoost achieves up to 3.85× higher throughput and better scalability under YCSB workloads compared to state-of-the-art tree indexes.},

  abstract     = {Pipeline parallelism is a crucial technique for large-scale model training, enabling parameter splitting and performance enhancement. However, creating effective pipeline schedules often requires significant manual effort and coding skills, leading to practical inconveniences and complex debugging. Major frameworks such as DeepSpeed and ColossalAI simplify the process by adopting predefined pipeline schedule strategies, such as GPipe and 1F1B. The use of predefined schedules offers limited flexibility and suboptimal training efficiency, as the limited number of manually set candidates cannot provide the optimal strategy for arbitrary model training. To deal with the issue, this article aims to automatically search for the optimal strategy with high efficiency. Since current frameworks only support a limited set of fixed strategies, lacking the technical capability to create a comprehensive strategy search space, we first design a novel domain-specific language (DSL) for pipeline schedule development. The DSL exhibits great understandability, agility, and reusability, supporting the development of all known pipeline schedule strategies and their variants. Second, we are the first to model the complete pipeline schedule strategy space via the DSL, enabling an automated end-to-end globally optimal pipeline schedule searching, while past work may get stuck in a local optimum. Finally, we propose to optimize pipeline performance by modeling and solving the pipeline schedule as a Binary-Tree-Traversing (BTT) optimization problem. Based on the formalization, we further adopt a Dynamic Try-Test Genetic Algorithm to search for the best pipeline schedule strategy, which overwhelms a variety of pre-defined ones. Experimental results show that Koala achieves an enhanced performance by up to \(1.53\times\) over state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, the pipeline schedule strategy searched by Koala outperforms pre-defined pipeline schedule strategies by \(1.10\times \sim 1.55\times\) . Moreover, Koala has superior scalability and effectiveness in combining with data parallelism and tensor parallelism.},

Given the diversity of sparse matrices, designing a tailored program for each matrix is challenging. To address this, we propose SRSparse, 1 a program generator that creates tailored programs by automatically combining program designing methods to fit specific input matrices. It provides two components: the problem definition configuration , which declares the computation, and the scheduling language , which can be leveraged by an auto-tuner to specify the program designs.

We evaluate SRSparse on four representative sparse kernels and three format conversion routines.

  abstract     = {Graph attention networks (GATs) have advanced performance in various application domains by introducing the attention mechanism into the graph neural networks (GNNs). The inefficiency of running GATs on CPUs or GPUs necessitates specialized hardware designs. Unfortunately, previous specialized architecture designs have focused on either the GNN architecture or the attention mechanism, resulting in limited performance and leaving ample room for improvement. This article presents Gator , a joint optimization approach with software–hardware co-designs for GAT inference. On the software level, Gator leverages degree-weighted graph partitioning and parameter-adaptive feature selection techniques to preprocess the input graph data, mining subgraph-level parallelism and mitigating the computation bottleneck of the dedicated dataflow. On the hardware level, Gator designs a unified processing engine to support various kernels by extracting a common computation pattern and a dimension-aware microarchitecture for efficient partial sum reduction. Extensive experiments show that our approach can achieve 11.5× more efficiency compared to NVIDIA RTX 4090 and provide a speedup of 3× to 9.4×, along with a 2.6× to 4.7× reduction in memory traffic, when compared to six state-of-the-art methods, with minimal accuracy loss.},

  abstract     = {Sampling-based methods, such as SimPoint, are widely used for efficient pre-silicon μ Arch evaluations, where the costs are the number of simulation points multiplied by the number of evaluated μ Arch designs. However, these costs keep growing with an increasing number of simulation points and expanding μ Arch design space. Although techniques have been developed to accelerate the μ Arch design space exploration, less attention has been given to further reducing the simulation budget of each μ Arch evaluation. Common strategies like reducing simulation coverage or sampling fewer simulation points typically compromise estimation accuracy. Therefore, further reducing the simulation budget without compromising estimation accuracy remains a critical research problem. In this work, we propose SnsBooster to enhance sampling-based μ Arch evaluation efficiency, based on two insights: (a) large portions of simulation points’ performance changes are typically insensitive to the evaluated μ Arch changes, and (b) simulation points’ performance sensitivities under specific μ Arch change correlate with their inherent characteristics. By online building a μ Arch-specific performance sensitivity classifier via progressive simulation and continuous validation, SnsBooster can identify and selectively evaluate only performance-sensitive points, thus reducing the simulation budget without compromising estimation accuracy. When applied across various μ Arch changes, SnsBooster achieves an average simulation budget reduction of 39.04% with an accuracy loss of only 0.14%, compared to simulating all the sampled points. Under the same accuracy loss, SnsBooster’s simulation budgets are only 64.73% and 65.60% of those required by methods of reducing simulation coverage or sampling fewer points. Besides, under identical simulation budgets, the average accuracy losses of these methods are 1.41% and 1.23%, which is substantially higher than that of SnsBooster.},

  abstract     = {Automatic code optimization enables developers to write high-level code relying on compilers to optimize it and generate efficient code for target hardware. State-of-the-art methods for automatic code optimization leverage deep learning to build cost models that predict the impact of code optimizations on execution time. However, these models are typically limited in terms of the size and complexity of the programs they support. This research presents a novel approach to developing deep learning-based cost models that address these limitations. Our approach introduces a new program representation that efficiently represents programs with complex structures and large sizes such as varying loop depths, buffer numbers, and dimensions. Furthermore, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, that can handle this dynamic program representation. This allows the model to work on larger and more complex programs than those it was trained on. We implemented this model in Tiramisu, a state-of-the-art compiler. Our evaluation shows that our proposed model can generalize to programs larger than those seen during training, while the original Tiramisu cost model cannot. We also show that such generality does not lead to a significant increase in our proposed model’s Mean Absolute Percentage Error or a decrease in the quality of code optimizations found when the model is used for automatic code optimization. In contrast, our proposed model on average achieves a 41.89% improvement in speed compared to the original cost model when both models are trained on the same dataset, showing better generalization over unseen programs. This is a significant advantage over previous approaches, which typically do not support program sizes beyond those seen during the training.},

This article proposes an innovative solution called the elastic-barrier , where threads that arrive early at a barrier can execute iterations of the parallel-loop from the next phase, thereby reducing the idle time, and reduce load imbalance. The approach guarantees safety by ensuring that before executing any work W from the subsequent phase, all the works in the current phase that W depends on have been executed.

An efficient memory hierarchy is mandatory for such hardware systems. While the memory architectures of general-purpose processors (e.g., CPU or GPUs) are based on cache systems, dedicated accelerators have mostly adopted the DMA (Direct Memory Access) concept due to the application field of image processing. DMA features like 2D data transfers or data padding can optimize the memory accesses of image processing. However, DMA lacks the capability to exploit temporal and spatial data reuse, a feature common in cache systems, particularly when multiple DMAs operate in parallel. This article proposes a novel Direct Cached Memory Access (DCMA) architecture, combining both DMA and cache methodologies and their respective advantages. Optimized for image-based AI algorithms, the DCMA architecture facilitates enhanced memory access by integrating multiple, parallel DMA ports with caching capabilities. This design allows for efficient data reuse and parallel memory access. Optimal parameters for the DCMA are determined through a comprehensive design space exploration. The DCMA is evaluated on a state-of-the-art Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGA board coupled with a massive-parallel vertical vector co-processor, called V 2 PRO. The results show the mitigation of the vector processor’s memory bottleneck. By using the proposed DCMA, speedups of up to ×17 for the ResNet-50 CNN can be achieved.},

  abstract     = {Modern accelerators like GPUs increasingly execute independent operations concurrently to improve the device’s compute utilization. However, effectively harnessing it on GPUs for important primitives such as general matrix multiplications (GEMMs) remains challenging. Although modern GPUs have significant hardware and software GEMM support, their kernel implementations and optimizations typically assume each kernel executes in isolation and can utilize all GPU resources. This approach is highly efficient when kernels execute in isolation, but causes significant resource contention and slowdowns when kernels execute concurrently. Moreover, current approaches often only statically expose and control parallelism within an application, without considering runtime information such as varying input size and concurrent applications—often exacerbating contention. These issues limit performance benefits from concurrently executing independent operations. Accordingly, we propose GOLDYLOC, which considers the global resources across all concurrent operations to identify performant GEMM kernels, which we call globally optimized (GO)-Kernels. GOLDYLOC also introduces a lightweight dynamic logic which considers the dynamic execution environment for available parallelism and input sizes to execute performant combinations of concurrent GEMMs on the GPU. Overall, GOLDYLOC improves the performance of concurrent GEMMs on a real GPU by up to 2× (18% geomean per workload) versus the default concurrency approach and provides up to 2.5× (43% geomean per workload) speedup over sequential execution.},

  abstract     = {Transformer-based large language model (LLM) inference serving is now the backbone of many cloud services. LLM inference consists of a prefill phase and a decode phase. However, existing LLM deployment practices often overlook the distinct characteristics of these phases, leading to significant interference. To mitigate interference, our insight is to carefully schedule and group inference requests based on their characteristics. We realize this idea in ShuffleInfer through three pillars. First, it partitions prompts into fixed-size chunks so that the accelerator always runs close to its computation-saturated limit. Second, it disaggregates prefill and decode instances so each can run independently. Finally, it uses a smart two-level scheduling algorithm augmented with predicted resource usage to avoid decode scheduling hotspots. Results show that ShuffleInfer improves time-to-first-token (TTFT), job completion time (JCT), and inference efficiency in terms of performance per dollar by a large margin, e.g., it uses 38% less resources all the while lowering average TTFT and average JCT by 97% and 47%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Homomorphic encryption (HE) represents an encryption technology that allows for direct computation on encrypted data without requiring decryption. However, the substantial computational complexity and significant latency associated with HE has impeded its broader adoption in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose a GPU-based acceleration framework, namely HEngine, tailored for homomorphic encryption tasks. Specifically, we first propose a warp shuffle-based optimization method for two key phases, i.e., inverse Chinese Remainder Theorem (ICRT) and number theoretic transformation (NTT), to mitigate synchronization overhead in homomorphic encryption. Secondly, we propose to fuse the NTT kernel with the inner product kernel to address the imbalance between memory access and computation. Thirdly, considering the potential difference in the amount of tasks of users in the real-world, we design two different encoding methods for small batch and large batch inference tasks to improve computational efficiency. Finally, experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves a 218× speedup on homomorphic multiplication tasks compared with the CPU-based SEAL library. In addition, for convolutional neural network inference tasks on shallow network structures, our proposed framework achieves amortized inference performance at the millisecond level and sub-millisecond level on small batch and large batch data, respectively. For convolutional neural network inference tasks on deeper network structures (i.e., ResNet-20), our proposed framework achieves second-level inference.},

  abstract     = {As the complexity of real-world server applications continues to grow, performance optimizations for large-scale applications are becoming increasingly challenging. The success of online optimization offered by OCOLOS and Dynimize proves that binary rewriting based on edge profiling data can significantly accelerate these applications. However, no similar online binary optimizer is currently available on the AArch64 platform. In response to the growing adoption of the AArch64 platform, this article introduces AOBO, a fast-switching online binary optimizer specifically designed for AArch64. In addition to providing practical and efficient engineering support for AArch64-specific features, AOBO overcomes the challenge of lacking hardware counters for edge profiling on most commercially available AArch64 servers. In particular, AOBO embraces a novel edge weight estimation scheme to deliver more accurate edge estimation, which in turn allows AOBO’s binary rewriter to generate more efficient code. Furthermore, time spent on AOBO’s online code replacement stage is optimized to work at a subsecond level, thus enabling a fast switch from running the original binary to running the optimized one. We evaluate AOBO with CINT2017, GCC, MySQL and MongoDB, measuring the accuracy and coverage of the estimated edge weights, the performance improvements of the optimized binaries, and the online optimization cost. To make a fair comparison, we are using the performance data of the binaries generated by the default compilation scripts in the software packages as a baseline. Experimental data shows that AOBO can offer a more accurate edge weight estimation and generate binaries with superior performance. Furthermore, AOBO achieves online optimization with a very small overhead and significantly improves the performance of large-scale applications. Compared with the baselines, AOBO’s online optimization can achieve 24.7% and 31.11% performance improvement respectively for MySQL and MongoDB. Notably, application pause time is reduced from 1,599.8 milliseconds to 462.1 milliseconds for MySQL, and from 1,765.9 milliseconds to 507.1 milliseconds for MongoDB.},

  abstract     = {Graph pattern mining is essential for deciphering complex networks. In the real world, graphs are dynamic and evolve over time, necessitating updates in mining patterns to reflect these changes. Traditional methods use fine-grained incremental computation to avoid full re-mining after each update, which improves speed but often overlooks potential gains from examining inter-update interactions holistically, thus missing out on overall efficiency improvements. In this article, we introduce Cheetah, a dynamic graph mining system that processes updates in a coarse-grained manner by leveraging exploration domains . These domains exploit the community structure of real-world graphs to uncover data reuse opportunities typically missed by existing approaches. Exploration domains, which encapsulate extensive portions of the graph relevant to updates, allow multiple updates to explore the same regions efficiently. Cheetah dynamically constructs these domains using a management module that identifies and maintains areas of redundancy as the graph changes. By grouping updates within these domains and employing a neighbor-centric expansion strategy, Cheetah minimizes redundant data accesses. Our evaluation of Cheetah across five real-world datasets shows it outperforms current leading systems by an average factor of 2.63×.},

We propose a scalable and lightweight data structure exploration flow for supporting data type refinement based on access pattern analysis, enhanced with a weighted-based data placement decision support for multi-objective exploration and optimization. The evaluation of the methodology was performed both on emulated and real DRAM/NVM hardware for different applications and data placement algorithms. The experimental results show up to 58.7% lower execution time and 48.3% less energy consumption compared with the results obtained by the initial versions of the applications. Moreover, we observed 72.6% less NVM write operations, which can significantly extend the lifetime of the NVM memory. Finally, thorough evaluation shows that the methodology is flexible and scalable, as it can integrate different data placement algorithms and NVM technologies and requires reasonable exploration time.},

  abstract     = {To improve the performance and energy efficiency of deep learning (DL) applications, recent edge computing platforms have built-in heterogeneous accelerators, such as general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) and neural processing units (NPUs). For example, widely used NVIDIA Jetson platforms contain CPU, GPU, and deep learning accelerator (DLA), a type of NPU. It is non-trivial to map DL workloads to suitable accelerators to improve performance, energy efficiency, or even both. This article presents JDIMO, 1 a Jetson-aware deep-learning inference workload mapping optimization framework, to simultaneously improve energy efficiency and performance. JDIMO first measures energy-performance data of the fundamental nodes and the sub-networks with energy-efficiency improvement potential according to the topology structure of a DL network. Then, under the guidance of an analytical energy-performance model, the framework exploits an algorithm based on the variable-length sliding window to find the optimal mapping configuration and the optimal number of CUDA streams. We evaluate JDIMO by applying it to seven DL applications on a Jetson Orin NX (16GB) platform. JDIMO saves 47.5% EDP (energy delay product) and 22.6% energy and improves 138.3% QPS (queries per second) on average compared to the DLA-possible configuration. JDIMO saves 22.5% EDP and 12.6% energy and improves 13.5% QPS on average compared to JEDI, the most similar work to ours. Meanwhile, JDIMO also reduces 93.8% optimization time on average compared to JEDI.},

Using pixel value distribution analysis, images were classified by luminance contrast, and 24 participants evaluated 15 images using 54 Turkish atmosphere adjectives on a 5-point semantic differential scale. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the responses revealed three components based on 43 adjectives related to perceived atmosphere. Notably, the second component was significantly correlated with luminance contrast, indicating that variations in light, color, and materials—and the resulting changes in luminance contrast—can influence atmospheric perception. The first and third components captured atmospheric qualities beyond luminance contrast. These findings provide valuable insights into how image attributes, particularly luminance contrast, impact aesthetic evaluations of indoor environments, contributing to the broader understanding of atmospheric perception in built spaces.},

  abstract     = {The Pulfrich effect, a visual phenomenon where a neural delay in one eye produces a depth misperception, has been directly studied on flat-panel displays but not in virtual reality (VR) environments. Through a series of three experiments, we investigated the relationship between luminance and contrast on the Pulfrich effect in VR and on the perception of motion. In two of our experiments, we found that low-reflectance stimuli produce a stronger Pulfrich effect than high-reflectance stimuli in VR, a result further accentuated by background luminance. Furthermore, the primary experiment showed that nullifying helix rotation motion is a powerful way to study the magnitude of the Pulfrich effect. With data from the first experiment, we developed a compelling VR illusion in which changing the color of a helix reverses the direction of perceived motion. Our second experiment extends the first with a discrimination task and a larger number of observers, confirming that low-contrast low-luminance conditions produce distinct perceptual effects. Experiment 3 elaborated that low-reflectance stimuli only produce a stronger Pulfrich effect than high-reflectance stimuli when the stimulus is moving away from the delayed eye. Data from the first and third experiments were successfully captured by power law function fits and linearized by plotting Pulfrich effect strength against logit-Michelson contrast. We use the power law as a basis for a fifth section discussing a potential model that may explain computationally how luminance and contrast contribute to the magnitude of the Pulfrich effect. All three experiments and the modeling section in tandem show that investigating well-known visual illusions such as the Pulfrich effect in VR has the potential to reveal insights into visual perception as well as inform us about the effects of contrast and asymmetric lighting in spatial computing.},

In practical applications it may be possible to guess solutions that are better than random ones. We start a mathematical runtime analysis for such situations. We observe that different algorithms profit to a very different degree from a better initialization. We also show that the optimal parameterization of an algorithm can depend strongly on the quality of the initial solutions. To overcome this difficulty, self-adjusting and randomized heavy-tailed parameter choices can be profitable. Finally, we observe a larger gap between the performance of the best evolutionary algorithm we found and the corresponding black-box complexity. This could suggest that evolutionary algorithms better exploiting good initial solutions are still to be found. These first findings stem from analyzing the performance of the \((1+1)\) evolutionary algorithm and the static, self-adjusting, and heavy-tailed \((1+(\lambda,\lambda))\) genetic algorithms on the OneMax benchmark. We are optimistic that the question of how to profit from good initial solutions is interesting beyond these first examples.},

This article describes a set of methods for explaining hyper-heuristics decisions in both online and offline scenarios using selection hyper-heuristics as an example. These methods help to explain various aspects of the function of hyper-heuristics both at a particular juncture in the optimisation process and through time. Visualisations of each method acting on sequences provide an understanding of which operators are being utilised and when, and in which combinations to produce a greater understanding of the algorithm-problem nexus in hyper-heuristic search. These methods are demonstrated on a range of problems including those in operational research and water distribution network optimisation. They demonstrate the insight that can be generated from optimisation using selection hyper-heuristics, including building an understanding of heuristic usage, useful combinations of heuristics and heuristic parameterisations. Furthermore the dynamics of heuristic utility are explored throughout an optimisation run and we show that it is possible to cluster problem instances according to heuristic selection alone, providing insight into the perception of problems from a hyper-heuristic perspective.},

Various methods have therefore been developed to interpret black-box models after training. This article advocates an alternative approach where the models are transparent and explainable to begin with. This approach, EVOTER, evolves rule-sets based on extended propositional logic expressions. The approach is evaluated in several prediction/classification and prescription/policy search domains with and without a surrogate. It is shown to discover meaningful rule-sets that perform similarly to black-box models. The rules can provide insight into the domain and make hidden biases explicit. It may also be possible to edit the rules directly to remove biases and add constraints. EVOTER thus forms a promising foundation for building trustworthy AI systems for real-world applications in the future.},

The exploitation–exploration tradeoff is challenging; excessive focus on exploitation can stagnate the search, while too much exploration can slow convergence. Multi-objectivisation has been explored as an effective approach to mitigate the exploitation–exploration tradeoff problem. Along this line, in this article, we propose a Multi-Objectivisation-Based Adaptive Exploitation–Exploration Tradeoff Framework (MOEE) to balance exploitation and exploration in BO. MOEE considers the nondominated front formed by the exploitation and exploration objectives and adaptively switches the focus on exploration and exploitation on the basis of the search status. We verify our method on the 19 synthetic and practical problem instances with 1–20 dimensions, and the results show that our proposed multi-objectivisation framework can achieve a good balance between exploitation and exploration.},

  abstract = {Benchmarking heuristic algorithms is vital to understand under which conditions and on what kind of problems certain algorithms perform well. In most current research into heuristic optimization algorithms, only a very limited number of scenarios, algorithm configurations and hyper-parameter settings are explored, leading to incomplete and often biased insights and results. This article presents a novel approach that we call explainable benchmarking. We introduce the IOHxplainer software library, for systematic analysing the performance of various optimization algorithms and the impact of their different components and hyperparameters. We showcase the methodology in the context of two modular optimization implementations. Through this library, we examine the impact of different algorithmic components and configurations, offering insights into their performance across diverse scenarios. We provide a systematic method for evaluating and interpreting the behaviour and efficiency of iterative optimization heuristics in a more transparent and comprehensible manner, aiming to improve future benchmarking and algorithm design practices.},

  abstract = {While population-based metaheuristics have proven useful for refining and improving explainable AI systems, they are seldom the focus of explanatory approaches themselves. This stems from their inherently stochastic, population-driven searches, which complicate the use of standard explainability techniques. In this article, we present a method to identify which decision variables have the greatest impact during an algorithm’s trajectory from random initialsation to convergence. We apply Principal Component Analysis to project each population onto a lower-dimensional space, then introduce two metrics—Mean Variable Contribution and Proportion of Aligned Variables—to identify the variables most responsible for guiding the search. Using four different population-based methods (Particle Swarm Optimisation, Genetic Algorithm, Differential Evolution, and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) on 24 BBOB benchmark functions in 10 dimensions, we find that these metrics highlight meaningful variable relationships and provide a window into each method’s search dynamics. By comparing the features extracted across algorithms and problems, we illustrate how certain variable subsets consistently drive major improvements in solution quality. In doing so, new evolutionary algorithm variants can be designed to take advantage of these influential variables, while also identifying underutilised variables that may benefit alternative search strategies.},

This study explores how ML practitioners with limited experience in bias understand and apply bias definitions, detection measures, and mitigation methods. Through a take-home task, exercises, and interviews with 22 participants, we identified five key themes: sources of bias, selecting bias metrics, detecting bias, mitigating bias, and ethical considerations. Participants faced unresolved conflicts, such as applying fairness definitions in practice, selecting context-dependent bias metrics, addressing real-world biases, balancing model performance with bias mitigation, and relying on personal perspectives over data-driven metrics. While bias mitigation techniques helped identify biases in two datasets, participants could not fully eliminate bias, citing the oversimplification of complex processes into models with limited variables. We propose designing bias detection tools that encourage practitioners to focus on the underlying assumptions and integrating bias concepts into ML practices, such as using a harmonic mean-based approach, akin to the F1 score, to balance bias and accuracy.},

Large-scale language models play an important role in current NLP. However, the challenges of explainability and complexity come along with the development of language models. One way is to introduce logical relations and rules into NLP models, such as making use of Automated Planning. Automated planning (AI planning) focuses on building symbolic domain models and synthesizing plans to transit initial states to goals based on domain models. Recently, there have been plenty of works related to those two fields, which have the abilities to generate explicit knowledge, e.g., preconditions and effects of action models, and learn from tacit knowledge, e.g., neural models, respectively. Integrating AI planning and NLP effectively improves the communication between human and intelligent agents. This article outlines the commons and relations between AI planning and NLP, and it argues that each of them can effectively impact the other one in six areas: (1) planning-based text understanding, (2) planning-based NLP, (3) text-based human–robot interaction, (4) planning-based explainability, (5) evaluation metrics, and (6) applications. We also explore some potential future issues between AI planning and NLP. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first that addresses the deep connections between AI planning and NLP.},

However, it is challenging to achieve autonomous and robust monitoring in such systems, given the dynamic environmental situations, the limited capabilities, and the unbalanced load of the UAVs. For instance, the monitoring activity levels at different locations might vary, which leads to an unbalanced monitoring load for the corresponding UAVs. Moreover, the UAVs require regular recharging/maintenance and can have malfunctions that will disrupt the monitoring task. In this article, we develop a novel proactive and robust Edge-UAV framework named PREUS to enable autonomous and efficient monitoring of dynamic environments when faced with dynamic environment situations and various UAV workload stresses that can jeopardize the monitoring performance. PREUS features a unique design to handle the varying UAV workload stress of the monitored area. It incorporates novel spatial, temporal, and proactive exploration vs. exploitation planning to balance the UAVs’ workloads in various locations with fluctuating activities. In addition, PREUS includes novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) design specialized to maximize coverage in the complex environments and provides faster and stabler decision-making capabilities than the existing methods. The positive impact brought by PREUS is demonstrated in terms of the achieved monitoring performance, including coverage and balanced UAV load.},

Grounding FMs by adapting them to domain-specific tasks or augmenting them with domain-specific knowledge enables us to exploit the full potential of FMs. However, grounding FMs faces several challenges, stemming primarily from constrained computing resources, data privacy, model heterogeneity, and model ownership. Federated Transfer Learning (FTL), the combination of federated learning and transfer learning, provides promising solutions to address these challenges. Recently, the need for grounding FMs leveraging FTL, coined FTL-FM, has arisen strongly in both academia and industry. Motivated by the strong growth in FTL-FM research and the potential impact of FTL-FM on industrial applications, we propose an FTL-FM framework that formulates problems of grounding FMs in the federated learning setting, construct a detailed taxonomy based on the FTL-FM framework to categorize state-of-the-art FTL-FM works, and comprehensively overview FTL-FM works based on the proposed taxonomy. We also establish correspondence between FTL-FM and conventional phases of adapting FM so that FM practitioners can align their research works with FTL-FM. In addition, we overview advanced efficiency-improving and privacy-preserving techniques because efficiency and privacy are critical concerns in FTL-FM. Last, we discuss opportunities and future research directions of FTL-FM.},

However, capturing patterns from different behavior sequences and modeling the complex inter-correlation between them are non-trivial tasks, as the high sparsity of type-related interactions, multi-seasonality of individual behaviors, and time-variant dependency of multi-type activities make it really challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that aims to model the M ulti-Seasonal M ulti-Behavior Dep endencies (MMDep) both within and across the multi-type behavior sequences. In the proposed model, an item co-occurrence matrix factorization strategy is introduced to alleviate the sparsity issue in type-related behavior sequences. And a temporal dependency module that incorporates multi-scale EMA mechanism is utilized to capture the multi-seasonal dependencies within individual sequences. Moreover, a cross-behavior dependency module is employed to learn the time-variant dependency among different behaviors. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed MMDep performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art baselines. And it may provide some new insights and tools on how to leverage multi-behavior data for better temporal recommendation.},

While classical recommender systems have used various imputation and data augmentation mechanisms to address data sparsity, these methods have not been extensively explored in the POI recommendation domain. In this work, we propose a generic imputation framework to study the use of data augmentation techniques to generate synthetic check-ins and analyze their effects on the POI recommendation scenario. Our main goal is to enhance the performance of various traditional recommenders by increasing the training set interactions, considering specific characteristics of the domain, such as geographical information. We apply these techniques in six different cities from a global Foursquare check-in dataset, as well as in two additional cities from the Gowalla dataset, and a separate dataset from Yelp, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation across multiple data sources. Our imputation approach evidences improvements for most models. In several cases, these improvements exceeded 100% for ranking accuracy, measured in terms of nDCG, without considerably compromising novelty or diversity.

To solve this problem, we propose a novel network which integrates hybrid transformer and multi-receptive feature extraction mechanism into score-based diffusion model. We used score-based diffusion model to reconstruct the clean ECG signals from noisy ones. The experiment was conducted on the QT Database and the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database to verify the feasibility of our method. Baseline methods are used for comparison. The evaluation results show that our method can achieve an outstanding performance on four distance-based evaluation metrics by at least 26% overall improvement in the comparison with the best baseline method. The study demonstrates that the signal denoising and reconstruction method based on the self-designed score-based diffusion model can effectively remove the interferences in the ECG signals, thereby facilitating the subsequent diagnosis in real-world situation. It also has huge potential for establishing the ECG intelligent analysis system.},

  abstract     = {Our article introduces a novel defense mechanism against black-box attacks, where attackers exploit the victim model as an oracle to craft adversarial examples. Unlike traditional pre-processing defenses that rely on sanitizing input samples, our stateless strategy directly counters the attack process itself. For each query, we evaluate a counter-sample, an optimized version of the original sample, designed to thwart the attacker’s objective. By responding to every black-box query with a targeted white-box optimization, our strategy introduces a strategic asymmetry that significantly advantages the defender. Our approach proves to be highly effective against state-of-the-art black-box attacks, outperforming existing defenses on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Specifically, our method achieves an average Attack Failure Rate (AFR) of 74.7% (up from 13%) on ImageNet and 67.7% (up from 3.5%) on CIFAR-10 when tested against 10 state-of-the-art query-based black-box attacks. Moreover, it maintains the model’s performance on legitimate inputs, with accuracy (ACC) reduced by only 0.7% on ImageNet and 0.9% on CIFAR-10. This is in stark contrast to other defenses tested, which can cause accuracy drops of up to 50%. Such a modest decrease ensures negligible performance degradation on legitimate tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our defense exhibits superior robustness across datasets and attack scenarios, including adaptive attacks specifically designed to try to bypass our method. This robustness highlights the strength and adaptability of our approach in countering adversarial threats.},

  abstract     = {While accuracy has long been prioritized as the primary metric for Recommender Systems (RSs), it is increasingly accepted that the system’s overall quality is not solely determined by this factor. Reachability, the ease with which users can navigate the whole content catalog through recommendations, emerges as a pivotal yet under-explored concept: not only it ensures a smooth experience for users, but it also provides more equitable exposure for the items, avoiding that only a small fraction of popular items get the bulk of the attention. Despite its importance, the few existing studies analyze reachability without attempting a proper optimization. In this article, we study the problem of optimizing the overall reachability of a RS while maintaining high-quality recommendations. We model a user browsing session as a random walk on a recommendation graph, where the links and the transition probabilities are defined based on the relevance score of the recommendation list that the user gets at every step. In this setting, reachability is modeled as the expected length of a path to reach a given item. We introduce two optimization problems, one discrete and one continuous, and characterize their theoretical properties. We then devise two algorithms that outperform non-trivial baseline methods in enhancing reachability while maintaining a high Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) score. Our experimental results show that, in some settings, our methods are able to improve the reachability metric by 80% while only compromising nDCG by 5%. Moreover, our empirical analysis shows that optimizing for reachability provides positive effects also on other prevalent “beyond-accuracy” metrics.},

  abstract     = {Cold-start recommendation is a well-known problem in practical application scenarios. Generating reliable recommendations can be challenging when interactions are typically sparse. To mitigate the cold-start problem, some methods incorporate auxiliary information about users and items, and others adopt meta-learning to improve recommendation accuracy. However, these approaches overlook the fact that items are interdependent and likely to be related or similar. Moreover, user preference distributions in the meta-training and meta-testing phases are different in the cold-start scenario. To address these problems, we present a novel strategy called Causal Meta-learning with Multi-view Graphs (CausalMMG). Specifically, we first construct multi-view item-item graphs to explore the correlations and similarities between items from multiple perspectives. A multi-view item representer is then used to learn item representations, exploiting graph convolution neural networks to capture the structure of these different item–item graphs. We then resort to the structural causal models of causal inference and further develop a causality-enhanced bi-level adaptive meta-learner to eliminate bias caused by the different distributions of user preferences. Moreover, the meta-learner learns the user preferences for items in different orders through hierarchical and task-level adaptations. Finally, we evaluate CausalMMG on several real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in various scenarios. The results show that the proposed CausalMMG is significantly superior to competitive baseline methods for cold-start recommendation on all datasets, highlighting the importance of incorporating the multiple relationships between items and modeling different user preference distributions in recommender systems.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection in attributed graph data has been widely applied in real applications. However, the intricate topology of graph data, high-dimensional attributes, and class imbalance inherent in anomaly detection tasks render attributed graph anomaly detection a challenging task. To detect anomalies using the intricate topology information of graph data, a dual-masked autoencoders is proposed for attributed graph anomaly detection, denoted as MAGAD. Specifically, in the MAGAD, the class imbalance in attributed graph data is dealt with by randomly masking the original graph data to obtain masked graph data for the anomaly detection task. And then, a latent representation of the graph data is obtained by training dual autoencoders, where one autoencoder is developed for reconstructing the original graph data, and another for reconstructing randomly masked graph data. This assists in identifying abnormal nodes in the attributed graph data. Subsequently, to capture anomalous information from relevant features, MAGAD uses a random re-masking strategy for latent representations learned from the masked graph. Finally, the anomaly scores of the nodes are calculated using the learned latent representations from the decoders of the dual autoencoders. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that the MAGAD algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are extensively used in recommendation systems and information retrieval but often suffer from incompleteness. A popular solution to this problem is multi-hop inference through a reinforcement learning framework, which provides an interpretable path for predicting missing links in KGs. Most previous work focuses on improving the performance of multi-hop link prediction. However, it has been observed that many multi-hop paths generated by these methods are irrational; they often fail to reasonably explain the predicted answer entities. To address this challenge, we introduce the Joint Multi-hop Link Prediction (JMLP) framework. The framework consists of a relation attention network and an entity attention network, which collaboratively generate the reasoning paths. The relation attention module utilizes an induction network to encode historical paths and employs the graph self-attention mechanism to refine the interaction of relation contextual information. The entity attention module uses the graph attention mechanism to obtain the aggregated contextual features and leverages self-attention to strengthen the correlation between local and global contextual entity features. Extensive experiments on five datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements both in predictive performance and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

In this article, we present a propagation perspective to analyze weakly supervised EA and explain the existing aggregation-based EA models. Our theoretical analysis reveals that these models essentially seek propagation operators for pairwise entity similarities. We further prove that, despite the structural heterogeneity across different KGs, the potentially aligned entities within aggregation-based EA models exhibit isomorphic subgraphs, a fundamental yet underexplored premise of EA. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a potential isomorphism propagation operator to enhance the propagation of neighborhood information across KGs. We develop a general EA framework, PipEA, incorporating this operator to improve the accuracy of every type of aggregation-based model without altering the learning process. Extensive experiments substantiate our theoretical findings and demonstrate PipEA’s significant performance gains over state-of-the-art weakly supervised EA methods.

Therefore, it is of vital importance to impute the missing values to facilitate data analysis and decision-making for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) . However, existing imputation methods generally perform zero pre-filling techniques to initialize missing values, introducing inevitable noise. Moreover, we observe prevalent over-smoothed interpolations, falling short in revealing the intrinsic spatio-temporal correlations of incomplete traffic data. To this end, we propose Mask-Aware Graph Imputation Network (MagiNet) . Our method designs an adaptive mask spatio-temporal encoder to learn the latent representations of incomplete data, eliminating the reliance on pre-filling missing values. Furthermore, we devise a spatio-temporal decoder that stacks multiple blocks to capture the inherent spatial and temporal dependencies within incomplete traffic data, alleviating over-smoothed imputation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art imputation methods on five real-world traffic datasets, yielding an average improvement of 4.31% in RMSE and 3.72% in MAPE under Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) pattern.

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) has been widely adopted as a distributed machine learning paradigm aiming to derive a global model without transferring local data to the server. In the context of heterogeneous environments typical of many FL deployments, our research has identified the performance oscillation problem in existing FL methods, resulting in slow convergence and severe performance drop. In this article, we first investigate the global optimizing objective in FL and demonstrate that, due to data heterogeneity and partial client participation, the global updates in a single training epoch may diverge from the intended objectives of conventional FL methods. To address this problem, we introduce a triple-objective decomposition mechanism to decompose the overarching global objective into three distinct local objectives aimed at aligning client gradients. Subsequently, we propose a gradient trajectory smoothing technique known as FedGTS, which refines local updates by estimating a pseudo-gradient leveraging historical global update trajectories. This approach is designed to mitigate performance oscillations and enhance the stability of the learning process. We theoretically demonstrate that our approach reduces variance of local updates and achieves a guaranteed convergence rate. We experimentally show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines with faster convergence and higher accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across various heterogeneity settings. Our codes are publicly available at GitHub ( https://github.com/ZongHR/FedGTS ).},

  abstract     = {Text style transfer plays a vital role in online entertainment and social media. However, existing models struggle to handle the complexity of Chinese long texts, such as rhetoric, structure, and culture, which restricts their broader application. To bridge this gap, we propose a Chinese Article-style Transfer (CAT-LLM) framework, which addresses the challenges of style transfer in complex Chinese long texts. At its core, CAT-LLM features a bespoke pluggable Text Style Definition (TSD) module that integrates machine learning algorithms to analyze and model article styles at both word and sentence levels. This module acts as a bridge, enabling large language models (LLMs) to better understand and adapt to the complexities of Chinese article styles. Furthermore, it supports the dynamic expansion of internal style trees, enabling the framework to seamlessly incorporate new and diverse style definitions, enhancing adaptability and scalability for future research and applications. Additionally, to facilitate robust evaluation, we created 10 parallel datasets using a combination of ChatGPT and various Chinese texts, each corresponding to distinct writing styles, significantly improving the accuracy of the model evaluation and establishing a novel paradigm for text style transfer research. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CAT-LLM, combined with GPT-3.5-Turbo, achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a transfer accuracy F1 score of 79.36% and a content preservation F1 score of 96.47% on the “Fortress Besieged” dataset. These results highlight CAT-LLM’s innovative contributions to style transfer research, including its ability to preserve content integrity while achieving precise and flexible style transfer across diverse Chinese text domains. Building on these contributions, CAT-LLM presents significant potential for advancing Chinese digital media and facilitating automated content creation.

  abstract     = {With the increasing collection of electronic health records (EHRs), deep learning has become a crucial tool for real-time treatment analysis. However, due to patient privacy concerns, the scarcity of labeled data limits the end-to-end models that rely on large training data. Self-supervised pretraining offers a promising solution. Nevertheless, applying pretraining to EHRs faces two key issues: (1) EHRs exhibit multimodality, including monitoring data and recorded clinical note. For multimodal pretraining, designing a self-supervised task that can establish cross-modal associations while preserving all modal-unique information remains challenging. (2) Both modalities are sequential and irregular, with varying intervals between monitoring or records. Aligning monitoring times with recorded times poses a significant issue for fine-grained cross-modal pretraining. Existing pretraining models either focus on a single modality or only models regular data, failing to address them together. To fill this gap and fully utilize unlabel EHR data, we propose a p retraining model to learn patient r epresentation using unlabel i rregular m ultimodal E HRs, named PRIME. We first utilize a multi-element encoding module to extract patient condition snapshots from both modalities. Then, to construct multiple aligned cross-modal positive sample pairs that span the entire treatment process from irregular data, we employ patient condition alignment modules that integrate time-aware and feature-aware components to transfer snapshots to the aligned timestamps. Next, to preserve both shared and unique information of each modality, our decoupled representation learning strategy first uses a constraint matrix to separate shared information. We then employ contrastive-based cross-modal learning and reconstruction-based intra-modal learning to model shared and complete information, respectively. Extensive experiments on two real-world tasks demonstrate the superiority of PRIME over the state-of-the-art models, especially with limited labels.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of utility-driven patterns is a valuable and difficult research topic. It can extract significant and interesting information from specific and varied databases, increasing the value of the services provided. In practice, the utility measure is often used to reflect the importance, profit, or risk of an object or pattern. In the database, while utility is a flexible criterion for patterns, it is also a somewhat limited criterion due to the overlook of utility sharing. This leads to the derived patterns only exploring partial and local knowledge in the database. Utility occupancy considers the problem of mining with high utility but low occupancy. However, existing studies are focused on itemsets that cannot reveal the temporal relationship of object occurrences. Therefore, this article first defines the concept of utility occupancy of sequence data and raises the problem of High-Utility Occupancy Sequential Pattern Mining (HUOSPM). Three dimensions, including frequency, utility, and occupancy, are comprehensively evaluated in HUOSPM. An algorithm called Sequence Utility Maximization with Utility occupancy measure (SUMU) is proposed. Furthermore, two data structures for storing pattern-related information, including Utility-Occupancy-List-Chain (UOL-Chain) and Utility-Occupancy-Table (UO-Table), are designed, and six upper bounds are proposed to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the novel algorithm. A specific case study is provided, and the effects of different upper bounds and pruning strategies are analyzed. The comprehensive results suggest that the HUOSPM task is useful and efficient.},

Spatial decompositions assist in handling big spatial data, and they have been commonly used in the Differential Privacy (DP) literature for range query answering, spatial indexing, count-of-counts histograms, data summarization, and visualization. However, their applications under the emerging Local DP (LDP) notion are scarce. In this article, we study the problem of building hierarchical spatial decompositions under LDP, focusing on two methods: quadtrees and kd-trees. We develop two solutions for quadtrees: a baseline solution that is inspired by the centralized DP literature, and a proposed solution that utilizes a single data collection step from users, propagates density estimates to remaining nodes, and performs structural corrections to the quadtree. Since kd-trees rely on node medians which are data-dependent, we observe that it is not feasible to build kd-trees using a single data collection step. We therefore propose an iterative solution that constructs kd-trees in top-down fashion by utilizing a novel algorithm for estimating node medians at each tree depth. We experimentally evaluate our quadtree and kd-tree algorithms using four real-world spatial datasets, multiple utility metrics, varying privacy budgets, and tree parameters. Results demonstrate that our algorithms enable the building of accurate spatial decompositions that provide high utility in practice. Notably, our quadtrees and kd-trees achieve substantially lower errors in answering spatial density queries (up to 10-fold improvement) when compared with a state-of-the-art method.},

In addition, traditional KG-aware recommendation models based on GNNs fail to mine supervision signals from the perspective of user preferences and item attributes, which will result in a lack of effective supervision signals in the model. In this study, we utilize a combination of items and attributes behind the items to model user preferences at a fine-grained level, so as to achieve independence between different user preferences. Furthermore, we utilize the KG and the user–item interaction graph (UIIG) to construct the user-specific preference similarity view and the item-specific attribute correlation views, respectively, and then apply the contrastive learning framework to effectively mine the association signals between users and between items. Based on this, we propose a novel model named Knowledge Graph Fine-grained Modeling Network with Contrastive Learning (KGFM-CL). Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that KGFM-CL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Inductive relation prediction, an important task for knowledge graph completion, is to predict the relations between entities that are unseen at the training stage. The latest methods use Pre-Trained Language Models (PLMs) to encode the paths between the head entity and tail entity and achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance. However, these methods cannot handle no-path scenarios well and lack the capability to learn comprehensive relation representations for distinguishing different relations. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel R elation- a ware k nowledg e r easoning model entitled Raker, which introduces an adaptive reasoning information extraction method to identify relation-aware reasoning neighbors of entities in the target triple to handle no-path scenarios and enables the PLM to better distinguish different relations via the relation-specific soft prompting. Raker is evaluated on three public datasets and achieves SOTA performance in inductive relation prediction when compared with the baseline methods. Notably, the absolute improvement of Raker is even more than 5% on the FB15k-237 dataset in the inductive setting. Moreover, Raker also demonstrates the superiority in transductive, few-shot, and unseen relation settings. The code of Raker is available at https://github.com/ADMIS-TONGJI/Raker .},

  abstract     = {Data science aims to solve real-world problems with the knowledge derived from data. Successfully tackling a data science problem requires practitioners to choose an appropriate solution, which potentially comprises various components such as pre-processing techniques, learning algorithms, hyper-parameters, and so on. Therefore, a problem-driven recommendation for the promising solution is invaluable, as it facilitates efficient and convenient problem-solving. However, existing solution recommendation approaches confront notable challenges when dealing with limited and sparse prior experience in practical applications. Learning from such prior easily leads to overfitting and poor generalization in solution recommendations. To address this issue, we propose a novel solution recommendation method that can predict a good-quality data science solution, including the pre-processing, the learning algorithm, and hyper-parameters, for a given problem. The foundation of our method is a carefully designed ranking model that exploits a weight-sharing structure and a newly proposed loss. The ranking model focuses on incorporating relative ranking information into the predicted performance score of each solution. With these techniques, our method can recommend the solution with the highest score and effectively mitigate the limitations of using sparse prior experience. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in predicting solutions with higher accuracy and rank, even trained on highly sparse historical performance records. It also reduces recommendation time significantly compared to the baselines, offering remarkable efficiency and convenience for practitioners.},

  abstract     = {Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) comprises several subtasks: aspect term extraction (ATE), opinion term extraction (OTE), aspect term sentiment extraction (ATSE), aspect-opinion pair extraction (AOPE), and aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE). Existing unified frameworks for ABSA rely heavily on large-scale annotated data, limiting scalability across domains. We propose UAOS, a double-layer unified span extraction framework that performs all five ABSA subtasks under weak supervision. Our approach first extracts aspect-opinion pairs using universal dependency-based rules from unannotated corpora. Sentiment labels for these pairs are generated via a novel zero-shot, domain-agnostic prompt-based method. The resulting weak labels train a unified span extraction architecture equipped with canonical correlation analysis for early stopping and a self-training mechanism to mitigate noise and bias in supervision. Extensive experiments on four ABSA benchmarks demonstrate that UAOS achieves competitive or superior performance compared to fully supervised baselines. It improves upon the state-of-the-art ODAO by +1.54 F1 for ATE, +0.56 for OTE, and +0.82 for AOPE. In ATSE and ASTE, where no weakly supervised baselines exist, UAOS outperforms several supervised models, setting new benchmarks. To assess domain generalizability, we evaluate UAOS on a psychology/education-domain dataset of student reflections spanning four instructional conditions. Without in-domain fine-tuning, it achieves macro F1 scores of 71.05 (ATE), 74.39 (OTE), 68.24 (AOPE), and 60.56 (ASTE). These results highlight the model’s ability to generalize to out-of-distribution, non-commercial text, underscoring its scalability for low-resource ABSA applications.},

Concretely, we first review the widely used ST ocean datasets and highlight their unique characteristics. Then, typical ST ocean data quality enhancement techniques are discussed. Next, we classify existing STDM studies for ocean science into four types of tasks, i.e., prediction, event detection, pattern mining, and anomaly detection, and elaborate the techniques for these tasks.

However, concerns regarding data privacy have emerged, especially when multiple stakeholders aim to collaboratively enhance LLMs using sensitive data. In this scenario, federated learning becomes a natural choice, allowing decentralized fine-tuning without exposing raw data to central servers. Motivated by this, we investigate how data privacy can be ensured in LLM fine-tuning through practical federated learning approaches, enabling secure contributions from multiple parties to enhance LLMs. Yet, challenges arise: (1) despite avoiding raw data exposure, there is a risk of inferring sensitive information from model outputs, and (2) federated learning for LLMs incurs notable communication overhead. To address these challenges, this article introduces DP-LoRA, a novel federated learning algorithm tailored for LLMs. DP-LoRA preserves data privacy by employing a Gaussian mechanism that adds noise in weight updates, maintaining individual data privacy while facilitating collaborative model training. Moreover, DP-LoRA optimizes communication efficiency via low-rank adaptation, minimizing the transmission of updated weights during distributed training. The experimental results across medical, financial, and general datasets using various LLMs demonstrate that DP-LoRA effectively ensures strict privacy constraints while minimizing communication overhead.},

  abstract     = {Occupation-specific job tasks (OSTs) refer to the duties, responsibilities, and activities associated with a particular occupation, which define the core functions and performance expectations for those engaged in that profession. Efficient recognition and extraction of OSTs from large-scale job description data are essential for establishing a continually updated occupational information system (OIS), such as O*NET, which serves as critical tools for advancing research in work and labor markets. However, this task presents substantial challenges due to its heavy reliance on domain experts for the labor-intensive annotation of job postings, rendering the process time-consuming and difficult to scale for large-scale implementation. To this end, in this article, we present COTR , a novel data-driven framework designed for the efficient recognition of OSTs from job postings, capable of continually identifying new tasks through class-incremental learning. Specifically, we first employ large language models (LLMs) and prompt learning to develop a three-phase process–“expansion, translation, and generation”–that addresses the critical challenge of the absence of predefined OSTs in non-English labor market data, leveraging O*NET as a foundational reference. Subsequently, we introduce a BERT-based model for OST recognition, incorporating a uniquely designed pair-wise loss function that distills valuable insights from ChatGPT or other LLMs, thereby substantially enhancing recognition performance. In addition, to achieve cost-effective training data annotation, we develop an LLM-based coarse-to-fine candidate OSTs generation algorithm, integrating contrastive active learning to optimize the annotation process through human-machine collaboration. Notably, we design a supervised fine-tuning strategy with a novel encoding technique to optimize LLMs, improving the recall rate of the generated candidate OSTs and achieving up to a 343-fold increase in annotation efficiency compared to traditional manual expert annotation in our experiments. Afterward, we propose an efficient class-incremental learning method that incorporates an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection module for identifying potential novel OSTs and a fine-tuning module to extend the model’s recognition capabilities to include newly discovered tasks. Finally, we construct two real-world datasets using job posting data collected from the labor markets of China and the United States, respectively. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, along with two publicly available datasets, have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed COTR. Furthermore, several case studies showcase the significant benefits of COTR for various downstream applications in labor market analysis, including analyzing the evolving demand for OSTs, assessing the value of OSTs, and recognizing the relationships between OSTs and associated skills.},

Specifically, we construct employment profiles of over 60,000 IT professionals, and form their career path sequences by chaining the job records in each profile. Then we simultaneously learn cluster-wise job embeddings and construct career path clusters. The resultant cluster-wise likelihoods of career paths can quantify their soft bonding with different clusters, and the job embeddings can reveal connections among job titles within each cluster. With both real and simulated data, we conduct extensive experiments with our framework to establish the modeling performance and great improvement over the traditional optimal matching analysis methods.

  abstract     = {Ability assessment is a critical task in talent recruitment that aims at identifying the most suitable job candidates by evaluating the alignment of their skills with job requirements. Indeed, traditional ability assessment involves multiple staffing processes with various forms of evaluation methods, such as written tests and face-to-face interviews, which usually result in fragmented, noisy, and inconsistent conclusions. Therefore, a long-standing challenge in talent recruitment is how to comprehensively evaluate candidates by integrating multi-source heterogeneous assessment results. To this end, in this article, we propose a holistic framework, JCD-TR ( J oint C ognitive D iagnosis for T alent R ecruitment), for enhancing the performance of ability assessment in talent recruitment by jointly modeling the multi-source heterogeneous assessment results. Specifically, we first construct a skill graph based on the co-occurrence relations of skills in multi-source recruitment data. Along this line, we can learn the skill representations that maintain both the semantic and structural information with graph embedding. Then, we design a multi-source candidate ability profiling module with the guidance of item response theory in psychometrics and the neural topic model. As a result, the candidates’ ability profiles can be explored from their resumes, written tests, and interview assessment data, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a joint cognitive diagnosis module by integrating those multi-view ability profiles and skill representations to assess the candidates’ skill proficiency state. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our JCD-TR.},

  abstract     = {We introduce the concept of compilation space as a new pivot for the comprehensive validation of just-in-time (JIT) compilers in modern language virtual machines (LVMs). The compilation space of a program encompasses a wide range of equivalent JIT-compilation choices, which can be cross-validated to ensure the correctness of the program’s JIT compilations. To thoroughly explore the compilation space in a lightweight and LVM-agnostic manner, we strategically mutate test programs with JIT-relevant but semantics-preserving code constructs, aiming to provoke diverse JIT compilation optimizations. We primarily implement this approach in Artemis , a tool for validating Java Virtual Machines (JVMs). Within three months, Artemis successfully discovered 85 bugs in three widely used production JVMs—HotSpot, OpenJ9, and the Android Runtime—where 53 were already confirmed or fixed and many of which were classified as critical. It is noteworthy that all reported bugs concern JIT compilers, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of our technique. Building on the promising results with JVMs, we experimentally applied our technique to a state-of-the-art JavaScript Engine (JSE) fuzzer called Fuzzilli, aiming to augment it to find mis-compilation bugs without significantly sacrificing its ability to detect crashes. Our experiments demonstrate that our enhanced version of Fuzzilli namely Apollo could achieve comparable code coverage with a considerably smaller number of generated programs with a similar number of crashes. Additionally, Apollo successfully uncovered four mis-compilations in JavaScriptCore and SpiderMonkey within seven days. Following Artemis ’ and Apollo ’s success, we are expecting that the generality and practicability of our approach will make it broadly applicable for understanding and validating the JIT compilers of other LVMs.},

This can be implemented using single-level store (SLS) through periodic checkpointing of ephemeral state to persistent devices. However, traditional SLSs suffer from two main issues on checkpointing efficiency and external synchrony, which are critical for low-latency services with persistence need. In this article, we note that the decentralized state of microkernel-based systems can be exploited to simplify and optimize state checkpointing. To this end, we propose TreeSLS, a whole-system persistent microkernel that simplifies the whole-system state maintenance to a capability tree and a failure-resilient checkpoint manager. TreeSLS further exploits the emerging non-volatile memory to minimize checkpointing pause time by eliminating the distinction between ephemeral and persistent devices. With efficient state maintenance, TreeSLS further proposes delayed external visibility to provide transparent external synchrony with little overhead. Evaluation on microbenchmarks and real-world applications (e.g., Memcached, Redis, and RocksDB) show that TreeSLS can complete a whole-system persistence in around 100 μs and even take a checkpoint every 1 ms with reasonable overhead to applications.},

At present, the synthesis tools fall short in conducting a thorough exploration of the optimization potential pertaining to cascading stateful logic gates within MCBA, and the optimization objectives are relatively simple. In this article, a suit of stateful logic synthesis kit, named ILOSSS, improved from the previous LOSSS tool is achieved. Such kit includes two kinds of stateful logic synthesis processes for latency (corresponding to the High Time-Efficiency Synthesis Process (HTESP)) and energy (corresponding to the Low-Energy Synthesis Process (LESP)) optimization, respectively. Both of the synthesis processes are achieved by improving an existing synthesis process of MAGIC (SIMPLER-MAGIC) to support multiple stateful logic gates and inserting a post-processing stage with a well-developed automated optimization algorithm to reduce the number of the gates of the netlist with a corresponding purpose. Comparing to the standard SIMPLER-MAGIC tool, the HTESP achieves arithmetic mean improvements of over 23% in performance, and over 34% in effective lifetime under the EPFL benchmark suit which is also better than the results reported by the state-of-the-art MAGIC synthesis process (X-MAGIC). Meanwhile, the energy-delay product (EDP) of LESP has decreased by an average of over 10% and 42% compared to SIMPLER-MAGIC and HTESP, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Design Space Exploration (DSE) aims at identifying Pareto optimal synthesis configurations. Previous works require microarchitecture samples with key labels, including power and clock cycles, to train their models. However, as the chip design space expands rapidly, the cost of sampling the design space has significantly increased, due to the growing number of samples and time-consuming Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) implementation flow. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable power in zero-shot learning tasks, presenting an innovative strategy for accomplishing DSE. Hence, this article presents ChatDSE, a zero-shot framework for DSE that is powered by the advanced capabilities of the LLM GPT4.0. Firstly, this framework analyzes the nature of the target microarchitecture and generates a corresponding system context to provide the prior knowledge of the microarchitecture. Secondly, a proposed sampling algorithm, PriorDC, identifies the most representative samples with pseudo labels. One of these samples is chosen as a baseline, whose power and clock cycles labels are set as 1, and the remaining sample labels are obtained by chatting with GPT4.0. Finally, ChatDSE engages in a dialogue with GPT4.0 to estimate the power and clock cycles of designs within the space, ultimately identifying the Pareto optimal design set. In the DSE for the RISC-V Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine (BOOM), experimental results show that ChatDSE is capable of identifying optimal designs and accelerates the exploration process by 574 times when compared to the state-of-the-art DSE methodologies.},

Using embedded configurable logic allows designers to completely hide the functionality of selected design portions from parties that do not have access to the configuration string (bitstream). However, the design space of redacted solutions is huge, with tradeoffs between the portions selected for redaction and the configuration of the configurable embedded logic. We propose ARIANNA, a complete flow that aids the designer in all the stages, from selecting the logic to be hidden to tailoring the bespoke fabrics for the configurable logic used to hide it. We present a security evaluation of the considered fabrics and introduce two heuristics for the novel bespoke fabric flow. We evaluate the heuristics against an exhaustive approach. We also evaluate the complete flow using a selection of benchmarks. Results show that using ARIANNA to customize the redaction fabrics yields up to 3.3× lower overheads and 4× higher eFPGA fabric utilization than a one-fits-all fabric as proposed in prior works.},

However, their deployment has been challenged by their substantial model size and computational requirements. Pruning is a effective approach to make the model parameters sparse, thereby acquire inference acceleration. While not everyone requires training or fine-tuning large models, the diverse range of applications necessitates the deployment of LLMs on different devices. Model pruning and compression have emerged as areas of deep research interest to address these challenges. In consideration of versatility and practicality, we have designed a hardware-aware pruning process for general-purpose hardware/edge devices to enable efficient deployment and inference of LLMs. Instead of considering sparse ratio alone, we are motivated to design a pruning framework that incorporates genuine inference speed-up sensitivity from each pruning structure. Moreover, our framework breaks the layer-by-layer pruning setting and fuse several layers into one pruning stage to allow cross-layer optimization. Apart from that, we hold pragmatism by conducting compilation optimization during pruning. This step is critical because most sparsity patterns barely show distinct speed acceleration with corresponding dataflow and memory optimization. Our process operates within a post-training framework, obviating the need for additional training and thereby reducing resource requirements, while ensuring diverse inference speed and accuracy requirements on hardware.},

Here, the performance space of analog ICs is modeled by PVT-aware neural networks and visualized with parallel coordinate plots. Such a responsive visualization gives insights into the relations of parameters through interactive exploration where any parameter can be the cause while all others show the immediate effect. Thus, complex decision-making problems based on the experience of seasoned designers, such as circuit sizing or topology selection, are transformed into intuitive perceptual problems. Through the responsiveness and immediacy of the implementation, designers are encouraged to explore the entire performance space instead of basing all decisions on previous designs, never leaving the beaten path. A data generation and training procedure for surrogate models is outlined. Models for three operational amplifiers in three different technologies illustrate the applicability and feasibility of the presented approach.

  abstract     = {The third-party Intellectual Property (IP) supply chain exposes System-on-Chip designs to malicious implants like Hardware Trojans (HTs). With extremely rare trigger conditions, some HTs can evade conventional and even machine learning-based validation methods. Current detection and mitigation approaches fall short, especially against HTs capable of creating detrimental effects on cache and Network-on-Chip (NoC) performance. In this article, we present a novel intermittent and robust HT called LOKI, which primarily operates within the Network Adapter (NA) but can simultaneously impact the performance of the NoC, the shared cache, and the cores. LOKI is implanted in a malicious IP’s NA and triggers packet duplication attacks, leading to increased latency and performance degradation across the system. This action has cascading effects on the system, including increased latency in the NoC, adversely impacting communication efficiency. The duplication also leads to increased cache misses and longer miss penalties, further degrading cache performance. Additionally, LOKI affects the Instruction-Per-Cycle (IPC) of the cores, thus influencing overall processing performance. Our evaluation demonstrates that LOKI causes a 3.53× increase in packet latency, a 15% increase in miss penalty, and a 10% decrease in overall IPC. To neutralize the effects of HT-induced packet duplication, we propose a ubiquitous mitigation framework called HULK. HULK is installed in the NA and monitors all messages going in and out of the NoC, allowing it to address anomalies occurring in the NA, routers, and links. Experimental evaluation shows that HULK can effectively mitigate LOKI’s impact, achieving baseline system-like performance with negligible hardware overhead. Unlike existing HT-specific mitigation proposals, HULK serves as a generic solution to neutralize all types of packet duplication attacks. To promote reproducibility and community adoption, we have open sourced the implementation at https://github.com/itsmanju/hulk .},

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art studies on quantum layout synthesis have proposed various approaches based on the assumption that the input circuit is only composed of single-qubit and two-qubit gates. This assumption greatly simplifies the layout synthesis problem, and thus they only require ensuring that all controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates satisfy the hardware constraints imposed by a given coupling graph. However, during the design of quantum circuits, multi-controlled Toffoli (MCT) gates are usually used to better characterize the function of the circuits. Directly decomposing them into single and two-qubit gates with a fixed routine ignores the flexibility and optimization opportunity provided by various decomposition (i.e., logic synthesis) possibilities and thus suffers from sub-optimal results. This article proposes a co-optimization approach for quantum logic and layout synthesis. The MCT gates are first decomposed into Toffoli gates, and an efficient qubit mapping checking process is proposed to optimally solve the SWAP-free layout synthesis problem by automatically determining the decomposition result of each Toffoli gate. If a SWAP-free result cannot be found, the proposed algorithm flow is then used to obtain a solution that minimizes the total cost that simultaneously counts the cost caused by the different decomposition methods for Toffoli gates and the cost induced by SWAP gates. Compared with a state-of-the-art method, the proposed approach reduces the number of additional CNOT gates by 16% with around 25X runtime speedup for the cases with SWAP-free solutions, which cannot be obtained without the co-optimization approach.},

  abstract     = {Approximate circuits have become ubiquitous in error-resilient applications. These circuits provide large reductions in area, power, and delay at the cost of erroneous computations. The error-resilient applications produce acceptable output quality, even after the introduction of erroneous computations. However, we observed that the error resilience of an application varies widely with respect to the applied inputs. Since prior works have mostly focused on using samples from a uniform distribution while designing the approximate circuits, they are unable to exploit input aware properties to design optimal circuits. Hence, in this work, we bridge this gap and propose Formally Verified Library of Input Data Aware Approximate Circuits (FV-LIDAC). FV-LIDAC is the first formally verified library of input distribution aware approximate arithmetic circuits. We use three of the most widely occurring distributions, namely uniform, normal, and exponential distributions, to show that optimal design sets are heavily dependent on the input data. FV-LIDAC chooses the best designs among millions of functional approximated adder and multiplier circuits, depending upon the inputs. Since there are no existing input-aware approximate circuit libraries, we compared FV-LIDAC against state-of-the-art input-unaware EvoApproxLib, to further highlight the need for FV-LIDAC. Additionally, we perform case studies on real-world applications to further highlight the improvement over state-of-the-art. We aim to make the Pareto-optimal designs available as open source to stimulate further research.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decades, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have become a choice for heterogeneous computing due to their flexibility, energy efficiency, and processing speed. OpenCL is used in FPGA heterogeneous computing for its high-level abstraction and cross-platform compatibility. Previous works have introduced optimization techniques in OpenCL for FPGAs to leverage FPGA-specific advantages. However, the multi-kernel pipeline technique, which can raise throughput and resource utilization, has not performed well. This article presents a CPU+FPGA heterogeneous platform with a novel execution model to optimize multi-kernel pipeline. Firstly, we extend OpenCL by introducing new APIs and additional functions to represent the execution model. Secondly, a hardware-software co-scheduling scheme is employed to manage execution. Thirdly, we design a holistic development flow and toolkit to facilitate the deployment of algorithms on the platform or the integration of RTL IP cores to the OpenCL environment. We validate the platform using a Range Doppler algorithm. The proposed development flow and integrated toolchain enhance the efficiency of integrating traditional RTL IP cores into the OpenCL environment. Experimental results demonstrate that, with a comparable processing speed (averaging 95%) to traditional RTL implementations, the platform successfully establishes the multi-kernel pipelines. Leveraging the multi-kernel pipeline, the platform achieves a significant improvement in multi-frame processing speed compared to traditional OpenCL.},

  abstract     = {Traditional supervised single-task learning models are used in timing-driven placement exploration to improve both effectiveness and efficiency by predicting wire length, wire delay, and cell delay separately. However, these metrics are interdependent, with the two delays being timing-based and wire length non-timing, which makes it difficult for single-task models to capture their complex relationships. Moreover, the limited existing multi-task learning methods can only predict either multiple timing or non-timing metrics. To address these limitations, this article introduces DLGNN, a novel multi-task graph learning model that simultaneously predicts these three metrics through an embedder-predictor architecture featuring two residual connections, a combination of both soft and hard parameter sharing, and a geometric loss strategy. Cross-design experimental results on the Nangate 45nm library demonstrate that DLGNN outperforms baseline models in terms of both predictive performance and time efficiency. Additionally, ablation studies emphasize the critical roles of the residual connections, the combination of soft and hard parameter sharing, and the geometric loss strategy in improving DLGNN’s predictive performance. The generalization experiment on the ASAP 7nm library further confirms DLGNN’s advantages for more advanced technology nodes.},

  abstract     = {Multiple importance sampling (MIS) is a vital component of most rendering algorithms. MIS computes a weighted sum of samples from many different techniques to achieve generalization, that is, to handle a wide range of scene types and lighting effects. A key factor to the performance of MIS is the choice of weighting function. The go-to default - the balance heuristic - performs well in many cases, but prior work has shown that it can yield unsatisfactory results. A number of challenges cause this suboptimal performance, including low-variance techniques, sample correlation, and unknown sampling densities. Prior work has suggested improvements for some of these problems, but a general optimal solution has yet to be found. We propose a general and practical weight correction scheme: We optimize, on-the-fly, a set of correction factors that are multiplied into any baseline MIS heuristic (e.g., balance or power). We demonstrate that this approach yields consistently better equal-time performance on two rendering applications: bidirectional algorithms and resampled importance sampling for direct illumination.},

  abstract     = {Low-discrepancy sequences, and more particularly Sobol' sequences are gold standard for drawing highly uniform samples for quasi-Monte Carlo applications. They produce so-called ( t,s )-sequences, that is, sequences of s -dimensional samples whose uniformity is controlled by a non-negative integer quality factor t. The Monte Carlo integral estimator has a convergence rate that improves as t decreases. Sobol' construction in base 2 also provides extremely fast sampling point generation using efficient xor-based arithmetic. Computer graphics applications, such as rendering, often require high uniformity in consecutive 2D projections and in higher-dimensional projections at the same time. However, it can be shown that, in the classical Sobol' construction, only a single 2D sequence of points (up to scrambling), constructed using irreducible polynomials x and x + 1, achieves the ideal t = 0 property. Reusing this sequence in projections necessarily loses high dimensional uniformity. We prove the existence and construct many 2D Sobol' sequences having t = 1 using irreducible polynomials p and p 2 + p + 1. They can be readily combined to produce higher-dimensional low discrepancy sequences with a high-quality t = 1, guaranteed in consecutive pairs of dimensions. We provide the initialization table that can be directly used with any existing Sobol' implementation, along with the corresponding generator matrices, for an optimized 692-dimensional Sobol' construction. In addition to guaranteeing the (1, 2)-sequence property for all consecutive pairs, we ensure that t ≤ 4 for consecutive 4D projections up to 2 15 points.},

Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves more accurate motion capture for both local poses and global motions. Furthermore, by deeply integrating physics, we can also estimate 3D contact, contact forces, joint torques, and interacting proxy surfaces.

Traditional construction methods for such structures often depend on dense scaffolding to stabilize their intermediate assembly steps, making the process both labor-intensive and time-consuming. This work utilizes multiple robots to collaboratively assemble structures, offering temporary support by holding parts in place without additional scaffolding. Precomputing the robotic assembly process to ensure structural stability involves a time-consuming offline process due to the combinatorial nature of its search space. However, the precomputed assembly plans may get disrupted during real-world execution due to unforeseen changes, such as setup modifications or delays in part delivery. Recomputing these plans using traditional offline methods results in significant project delays. Therefore, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach in which a neural network is trained to efficiently generate alternative assembly plans for a given structure online, enabling adaptation to external changes. To enable effective and efficient training, we introduce three key innovations: a GPU-based stability simulator for parallelizing simulations, a novel curriculum-based training scheme to address sparse rewards during training, and a new graph neural network architecture for efficiently encoding assembly geometry. We validate our approach by training reinforcement learning agents on various assemblies and evaluating their performance on unseen assembly tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in planning multi-robot assembly processes, effectively handling disruptions in both simulation and physical environments.},

This paper fills the gap by developing a novel daily-used solution with a co-located smartphone and flashlight video capture setting in a dim room. To enhance the quality, our key observation is to solve facial reflectance maps within the data distribution of studio-scanned ones. Specifically, we first learn a diffusion prior over the Light Stage scans and then steer it to produce the reflectance map that best matches the captured images. We propose to train the diffusion prior at the patch level to improve generalization ability and training stability, as current Light Stage datasets are in ultra-high resolution but limited in data size. Tailored to this prior, we propose a patch-level posterior sampling technique to sample seamless full-resolution reflectance maps from this patch-level diffusion model. Experiments demonstrate our method closes the quality gap between low-cost and studio recordings by a large margin, opening the door for everyday users to clone themselves to the digital world.},

We demonstrate that our approach combines the strengths of both spatial reduced order models (ROMs) as well as spectral decompositions. By optimizing for the operator that evolves a system state from one timestep to the next, rather than the system state itself, we gain both the compressive power of spatial ROMs as well as the intuitive physical dynamics of spectral methods. The latter property is of particular interest in graphics applications, where user control of fluid phenomena is of high demand. We demonstrate this in various applications including spatial and temporal modulation tools and fluid upscaling with added turbulence. We adapt DMD for graphics applications by reducing computational overhead, incorporating user-defined force inputs, and optimizing memory usage with randomized SVD. The integration of OptDMD and DMD with Control (DMDc) facilitates noise-robust reconstruction and real-time user interaction. We demonstrate the technique's robustness across diverse simulation scenarios, including artistic editing, time-reversal, and super-resolution. Through experimental validation on challenging scenarios, such as colliding vortex rings and boundary-interacting plumes, our method also exhibits superior performance and fidelity with significantly fewer basis functions compared to existing spatial ROMs. Leveraging the inherent linearity of the DMD formulation, we demonstrate a range of diverse applications.

Existing computer graphics works can only model heterogeneity using explicit structures or statistical parameters that describe a coarser level of detail. We extend the boundary by introducing a new model that describes the heterogeneous surfaces fully statistically at the microscopic level, with rich geometry and material details that are comparable to the wavelengths of light. We treat the heterogeneous surfaces as a mixture of stochastic vector processes. We adapt the well-known generalized Harvey-Shack theory to quantify the mean scattered intensity, i.e., the BRDF of these surfaces. We further explore the covariance statistic of the scattered field and derive its rank-1 decomposition. This leads to a practical algorithm that samples the speckles (fluctuating intensities) from the statistics, enriching the appearance without explicit definition of heterogeneous surfaces. The formulations are analytic, and we validate the quantities by comprehensive numerical simulations. Our heterogeneous surface model demonstrates various applications including corrosion (natural), particle deposition (man-made), and height-correlated mixture (artistic).

  abstract     = {Turbulent boundary layer represents one of the most complex but interesting phenomena in fluid flows. While the generation and alteration of sheared vortices in various interacting scales near the boundary are visually appealing, it is difficult to correctly replicate such phenomena by simulation, especially at high Reynolds numbers. Practical methodologies typically incorporate empirical wall modeling to substantially curtail the computational expenses while retaining physical consistency. Nevertheless, these are predominantly applicable to steady-state flow solvers. While complex scenarios involving dynamic fluid-solid interaction and its application to create time-dependent flow phenomena invariably necessitate unsteady flow solvers, the underlying wall modeling techniques are imprecise, leading to a different formation of near-wall vortices, especially for the highly efficient lattice Boltzmann solver operating on Cartesian grids. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid near-wall model for the lattice Boltzmann solver, which can handle turbulent boundary layer flows in a simple and efficient manner, inspired by measuring the degree of boundary layer separation. Our model comprises both macroscopic and mesoscopic algebraic models, which collaborate to let the low dissipation lattice Boltzmann solver naturally form the turbulent boundary layer appropriately. By leveraging the multi-resolution technique, accurate simulation outcomes can be obtained. Our model is parameterized to approximate different physical attributes of the solid surface that can potentially influence the boundary layer distribution, and comparable boundary layer flow behaviors can be simulated at various grid resolutions. Rigorous benchmark tests are carried out to validate our model at different grid resolutions by comparing with experimental data and visualizations. We showcase the applications of our new model in both facilitating computational design and generating visual animations, accompanied by specific examples and comparisons with actual experimental setups and photographic images. All demonstrations affirm the physical consistency of our solver even when simulated with a relatively coarse grid resolution.},

In this work, we study an inverse problem: given a target shape, find the poses of left and right hands that together best produce a shadow resembling the input. This problem is nontrivial, since the design space of 3D hand poses is huge while being restrictive due to anatomical constraints. Also, we need to attend to the input's shape and crucial features, though the input is colorless and textureless. To meet these challenges, we design Hand-Shadow Poser, a three-stage pipeline, to decouple the anatomical constraints (by hand) and semantic constraints (by shadow shape): (i) a generative hand assignment module to explore diverse but reasonable left/right-hand shape hypotheses; (ii) a generalized hand-shadow alignment module to infer coarse hand poses with a similarity-driven strategy for selecting hypotheses; and (iii) a shadow-feature-aware refinement module to optimize the hand poses for physical plausibility and shadow feature preservation. Further, we design our pipeline to be trainable on generic public hand data, thus avoiding the need for any specialized training dataset. For method validation, we build a benchmark of 210 diverse shadow shapes of varying complexity and a comprehensive set of metrics, including a novel DINOv2-based evaluation metric. Through extensive comparisons with multiple baselines and user studies, our approach is demonstrated to effectively generate bimanual hand poses for a large variety of hand shapes for over 85% of the benchmark cases.},

  abstract     = {3D creation has always been a unique human strength, driven by our ability to deconstruct and reassemble objects using our eyes, mind and hand. However, current 3D design tools struggle to replicate this natural process, requiring considerable artistic expertise and manual labor. This paper introduces BANG, a novel generative approach that bridges 3D generation and reasoning, allowing for intuitive and flexible part-level decomposition of 3D objects. At the heart of BANG is "Generative Exploded Dynamics", which creates a smooth sequence of exploded states for an input geometry, progressively separating parts while preserving their geometric and semantic coherence. BANG utilizes a pre-trained large-scale latent diffusion model, fine-tuned for exploded dynamics with a lightweight exploded view adapter, allowing precise control over the decomposition process. It also incorporates a temporal attention module to ensure smooth transitions and consistency across time. BANG enhances control with spatial prompts, such as bounding boxes and surface regions, enabling users to specify which parts to decompose and how. This interaction can be extended with multimodal models like GPT-4, enabling 2D-to-3D manipulations for more intuitive and creative workflows.

  abstract     = {Recovering high-quality 3D scenes from a single RGB image is a challenging task in computer graphics. Current methods often struggle with domain-specific limitations or low-quality object generation. To address these, we propose CAST (Component-Aligned 3D Scene Reconstruction from a Single RGB Image), a novel method for 3D scene reconstruction. CAST starts by extracting object-level 2D segmentation and relative depth information from the input image, followed by using a GPT-based model to analyze inter-object spatial relations. This enables understanding of how objects relate to each other within the scene, ensuring more coherent reconstruction. CAST then employs an occlusion-aware large-scale 3D generation model to independently generate each object's full geometry, using Masked Auto Encoder (MAE) and point cloud conditioning to mitigate the effects of occlusions and partial object information, ensuring accurate alignment with the source image's geometry and texture. To align each object with the scene, the alignment generation model computes the necessary transformations, allowing the generated meshes to be accurately placed and integrated into the scene's point cloud. Finally, CAST applies a physics-aware correction mechanism, which leverages a fine-grained relation graph to generate a constraint graph. This graph guides the optimization of object poses, ensuring physical consistency and spatial coherence. By utilizing Signed Distance Fields (SDF), the model effectively addresses issues such as occlusions, object penetration, and floating objects, ensuring that the generated scene accurately reflects real-world physical interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that CAST significantly improves the quality of single-image 3D scene reconstruction, offering enhanced realism and accuracy in scene understanding and reconstruction tasks. CAST has practical applications in virtual content creation, such as immersive game environments and film production, where real-world setups can be seamlessly integrated into virtual landscapes. Additionally, CAST can be leveraged in robotics, enabling efficient real-to-simulation workflows and providing realistic, scalable simulation environments for robotic systems.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a novel representation for learning and generating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models in the form of boundary representations (B-Reps). Our representation unifies the continuous geometric properties of B-Rep primitives in different orders (e.g., surfaces and curves) and their discrete topological relations in a holistic latent (HoLa) space. This is based on the simple observation that the topological connection between two surfaces is intrinsically tied to the geometry of their intersecting curve. Such a prior allows us to reformulate topology learning in B-Reps as a geometric reconstruction problem in Euclidean space. Specifically, we eliminate the presence of curves, vertices, and all the topological connections in the latent space by learning to distinguish and derive curve geometries from a pair of surface primitives via a neural intersection network. To this end, our holistic latent space is only defined on surfaces but encodes a full B-Rep model, including the geometry of surfaces, curves, vertices, and their topological relations. Our compact and holistic latent space facilitates the design of a first diffusion-based generator to take on a large variety of inputs including point clouds, single/multi-view images, 2D sketches, and text prompts. Our method significantly reduces ambiguities, redundancies, and incoherences among the generated B-Rep primitives, as well as training complexities inherent in prior multi-step B-Rep learning pipelines, while achieving greatly improved validity rate over current state of the art: 82% vs. ≈50%.},

As opposed to existing works, TokenVerse can handle multiple images with multiple concepts each, and supports a wide-range of concepts, including objects, accessories, materials, pose, and lighting. Our work exploits a DiT-based text-to-image model, in which the input text affects the generation through both attention and modulation (shift and scale). We observe that the modulation space is semantic and enables localized control over complex concepts. Building on this insight, we devise an optimization-based framework that takes as input an image and a text description, and finds for each word a distinct direction in the modulation space. These directions can then be used to generate new images that combine the learned concepts in a desired configuration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenVerse in challenging personalization settings, and showcase its advantages over existing methods.},

To facilitate the development of segment-based rendering methods, we introduce several segment sampling techniques and estimation strategies, including a highly-performant recursive estimator. One of our key contributions is a general-purpose segment sampling framework based on marginal multiple importance sampling (MMIS).

  abstract     = {In the realm of digital twin systems, establishing simulation environments for creating and testing virtual agents has garnered substantial attention across various applications. The obtained control policies endow virtual agents with more realistic behaviors and interactive capabilities, finding applications in both computer animation and robotic control. While rigid-body simulators are widely used for virtual agents, achieving similar feats in fluid environments presents formidable challenges due to high complexity and exorbitant costs. One major reason is that most fluid simulators feature a fixed domain, which struggles to enable agents to freely navigate in an unbounded, obstacle-filled space, especially when computational resources are limited, thus restricting their wide utility for creating virtual agents. In this paper, we introduce a novel fluid-solid interaction simulator grounded in an efficient lattice Boltzmann solver. A key feature of this simulator is a dynamically moving local domain that encircles the agent, offering greater flexibility for obtaining control policy while maintaining efficiency in simulation. Previous methods, which anchored a square moving local domain along with the agent, suffered from severe spurious flows when the agent underwent rapid acceleration especially when the domain had to rotate, such as during a U-turn. This led to inaccurate results and instability. Conversely, we propose a novel domain-tracking method that harnesses optimal control techniques to address this issue. Our approach not only bolsters local-domain simulation stability, but also improves efficiency by employing a slender domain, which broadens the application scope of direct fluid-solid interactions for virtual agents. We validate our method by comparing simulations to physical phenomena and obtaining control policies for various virtual agents to accomplish challenging tasks. This effort culminates in a series of animations that vividly demonstrate the efficacy of the entire framework potentially used in both computer animation and robotics.},

The extracted meshes are guaranteed to be watertight, two-manifold and intersection-free. The flexibility of TetWeave enables a resampling strategy that places new points where reconstruction error is high and allows to encourage mesh fairness without compromising on reconstruction error. This leads to high-quality, adaptive meshes that require minimal memory usage and few parameters to optimize. Consequently, TetWeave exhibits near-linear memory scaling relative to the vertex count of the output mesh — a substantial improvement over predefined grids.

To address these limitations, we present Phase-Field-FLIP (PF-FLIP), a hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian method for the fully physics-based simulation of very large-scale, highly turbulent multiphase flows at high Reynolds numbers and high fluid density contrasts. PF-FLIP transports mass and momentum in a consistent, non-dissipative manner and, unlike most existing multiphase approaches, does not require a surface reconstruction step. Furthermore, we employ spatial adaptivity across all critical components of the simulation algorithm, including the pressure Poisson solver. We augment PF-FLIP with a dual multiresolution scheme that couples an efficient treeless adaptive grid with adaptive particles, along with a fast adaptive Poisson solver tailored for high-density-contrast multiphase flows. Our method enables the simulation of two-phase flow scenarios with a level of physical realism and detail previously unattainable in graphics, supporting billions of particles and adaptive 3D resolutions with thousands of grid cells per dimension on a single workstation.},

This seemingly simple technique significantly improves the quality of recovered surface textures on a set of challenging inverse rendering problems. Our method automatically adapts to the render and texture resolutions, only incurs moderate computational cost and achieves better quality than prior work while using fewer hyperparameters. Second, we introduce a specialized gradient computation algorithm for textured, path-traced subsurface scattering, which facilitates faithful reconstruction of translucent materials. By using path tracing, we enable the recovery of complex appearance while avoiding the approximations of the previously used diffusion dipole methods. Third, we demonstrate the application of both these techniques to reconstructing the textured appearance of human faces from sparse captures.

We argue that such naive ordering methods are sub-optimal and there is room for improving sample quality through a better choice of order between graphic design elements. In this paper, we seek to explore the space of orderings to find the ordering strategy that optimizes the performance of graphic design generation models. For this, we propose a model, namely G enerative O rder L earner (GOL), which trains an autoregressive generator on design sequences, jointly with an ordering network that sort design elements to maximize the generation quality. With unsupervised training on vector graphic design data, our model is capable of learning a content-adaptive ordering approach, called neural order. Our experiments show that the generator trained with our neural order converges faster, achieving remarkably improved generation quality compared with using alternative ordering baselines. We conduct comprehensive analysis of our learned order to have a deeper understanding of its ordering behaviors. In addition, our learned order can generalize well to diffusion-based generative models and help design generators scale up excellently.},

It begins with a dense avalanche core moving fast down the mountain. During its evolution, the snow particles in the avalanche front mix with the air, forming a suspended turbulent cloud of snow dust surrounding the dense snow avalanche. This paper introduces a physically-based framework using the Finite Volume Method to simulate powder-snow avalanches under complex terrains. Specifically, the primary goal is to simulate the turbulent snow cloud dynamics within the avalanche in a visually realistic manner. Our approach relies on a multi-layer model that splits the avalanche into two main layers: dense and powder-snow. The dense-snow layer flow is simulated by solving a type of Shallow Water Equations suited for intricate basal surfaces, known as the Savage-Hutter model. The powder-snow layer flow is modeled as a two-phase mixture of miscible fluids and simulated using Navier-Stokes equations. Moreover, we propose a novel model for the transition layer, which is responsible for coupling the avalanche main layers, including the snow mass injected into the powder-snow cloud from the snow entrainment processes and its injection velocity. In brief, our framework comprehensively simulates powder-snow avalanches, allowing us to render convincing animations of one of the most complex gravity-driven flows.},

  abstract     = {A ruled surface is a shape swept out by moving a line in 3D space. Due to their simple geometric forms, ruled surfaces have applications in various domains such as architecture and engineering. In the past, various approaches have been proposed to approximate a target shape using developable surfaces, which are special ruled surfaces with zero Gaussian curvature. However, methods for shape approximation using general ruled surfaces remain limited and often require the target shape to be either represented as parametric surfaces or have non-positive Gaussian curvature. In this paper, we propose a method to compute a piecewise ruled surface that approximates an arbitrary freeform mesh surface. We first use a group-sparsity formulation to optimize the given mesh shape into an approximately piecewise ruled form, in conjunction with a tangent vector field that indicates the ruling directions. Afterward, we utilize the optimization result to extract seams that separate smooth families of rulings, and use the seams to construct the initial rulings. Finally, we further optimize the positions and orientations of the rulings to improve the alignment with the input target shape.

  abstract     = {We present a novel comprehensive construction algorithm of Apollonius diagrams designed for GPUs. Efficient and robust algorithms have been proposed for the computation of Voronoi diagrams or Power diagrams. In contrast, Apollonius cells are neither convex nor bounded by straight boundaries, making their computation complex, especially in more than two dimensions. Their parallel computation also represents a challenge because of the sequential nature of state-of-the-art algorithms. In this article, we tackle the computation of these diagrams from the geometry of their cells. Our strategy is based on a core cell topology update allowing the iterative insertion of new sites found through nearest neighbor queries. To benefit from the highly parallel environment of modern GPUs and fit their memory restriction, we define a lightweight data structure allowing the representation of the complex topology of Apollonius cells. Additionally, we provide several space exploration procedures for their efficient construction under both homogeneous and heterogeneous spatial distributions. Our method outperforms the fastest state-of-the-art CPU implementation while computing the complete geometry. As a possible use case, we show an application for molecular illustration.},

To ensure constraint satisfaction, we use an implicit integration scheme. For this purpose, we derive compatible dynamic equations expressed through the quaternion time derivative, adopting an additive approach to quaternion updates instead of a multiplicative one, while enforcing quaternion unit-length as a constraint. We support all joints between rigid bodies that restrict subsets of the three translational or three rotational degrees of freedom, including position- and force-based actuation. Their constraints are formulated such that Lagrange multipliers are interpretable as joint forces and torques. We discuss a unified solution strategy for systems with redundant constraints, overactuation, and passive degrees of freedom, by eliminating redundant constraints and navigating the subspaces spanned by multipliers. As our method uses a standard additive update, we can interface with unconditionally-stable implicit integrators. Moreover, the simulation can readily be made differentiable as we show with examples.},

Using this dataset, we propose a three-stage inverse modeling pipeline to infer solid wood textures using only exterior photographs. Our method begins by evaluating a neural model to localize year rings on the cube face photographs. We then extend these exterior 2D observations into a globally consistent 3D representation by optimizing a procedural growth field using a novel iso-contour loss. Finally, we synthesize a detailed volumetric color texture from the growth field. For this last step, we propose two methods with different efficiency and quality characteristics: a fast inverse procedural texture method, and a neural cellular automaton (NCA).

  abstract     = {Recent advances in cloud rendering have brought us a promising alternative for interactive photorealistic rendering on lightweight devices, which used to be only available on high-end platforms equipped with powerful graphic cards. This technique enables users to perform rendering-related creative tasks, such as 3D product visualization and lighting design, from the comfort of any location using handheld devices, rather than being confined to the front of a noisy heat-generating workstation. However, existing large-scale cloud rendering systems that stream path-traced frames from the server to the client present extremely high rendering costs and transmission bandwidth requirements, even with advanced path-tracing acceleration and video compression techniques. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel streaming-aware rendering framework that is able to learn a joint optimal model integrating two path-tracing acceleration techniques (adaptive sampling and denoising) and video compression technique. Our joint model can fully exploit the inherent connections between these techniques and thus achieve substantially reduced rendering costs and enhanced compression quality. We also introduce the collaboration of client rendering ability to assist the frame decoding by rendering G-buffers as the shared side information. We demonstrate that appropriately incorporating the geometry and material priors from G-buffers into a neural compression pipeline can significantly reduce the streaming bandwidth in a cloud rendering system, and lighten the compression module design for computation efficiency. Our experiments show that our method delivers the best quality at various bitrates compared to existing Monte Carlo rendering streaming schemes, while remaining lightweight and efficient for cross-platform thin clients, including mobiles and tablets.},

The proposed pin-pression gripper features a distinctive mechanism in which each finger integrates a 2D array of pins capable of independent extension and retraction. This unique design allows the gripper to instantaneously customize its finger's shape to conform to the object being grasped by dynamically adjusting the extension/retraction of the pins. In addition, the gripper excels in in-hand re-orientation of objects for enhanced grasping stability again via dynamically adjusting the pins. To learn the dynamic grasping skills of pin-pression grippers, we devise a dedicated reinforcement learning algorithm with careful designs of state representation and reward shaping. To achieve a more efficient grasp-while-lift grasping mode, we propose a curriculum learning scheme. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our design, together with the learned skills, leads to highly flexible and robust grasping with much stronger generality to unseen objects than alternatives. We also highlight encouraging physical results of sim-to-real transfer on a physically manufactured pin-pression gripper, demonstrating the practical significance of our novel gripper design and grasping skill.

The core insight of the partition is that smooth streamlines distant from singularities are more suitable as patch boundaries. This allows singularities to be enclosed within patches, resulting in straighter patch boundaries and reducing the distorting influence of singularities. Accordingly, we introduce a new patch quality control mechanism that keeps the patch boundaries inside regions with high field smoothness. Combined with other common metrics (e.g., aligning boundaries with field and feature lines), we develop a practical partition algorithm that first iteratively traces paths in field smoothness-controlled regions to form patches and then removes redundant paths to simplify the patch layout. We demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of our partitions by using them to generate quality quad meshes on a massive test data set. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach produces quad meshes with significantly enhanced quality while maintaining similar reliability, validating the core insight.

This complementarity motivates us to explore a hybrid solution that leverages data-driven paradigms to overcome the performance constraints of traditional methods. In this paper, we revisit the classic bilateral filter (BF) as a case study and identify three key limitations hindering its performance: excessive parameter tuning, suboptimal neighborhood quality, and fixed parameters across the entire model. To address them, we propose CustomBF, a novel framework for customizing BF components at a per-point level. CustomBF employs multigraph encoders and a mutual guidance strategy to analyze local patches, enabling the customization of BF components including center point normal, neighborhood point coordinates, Gaussian function parameters, and neighborhood radius for each point. Experimental results demonstrate that this component-customized bilateral filter outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves robust denoising even in complex scenarios. It highlights the potential of hybrid methods to extend the applicability and effectiveness of traditional techniques.},

Nonetheless, specular reflection and refraction continue to pose significant challenges due to the instability and incorrect overfitting of radiance fields to high-frequency light variations. Currently, even 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), as a powerful and efficient tool, falls short in recovering transparent objects with nearby contents due to the existence of apparent secondary ray effects. To address this issue, we propose TransparentGS, a fast inverse rendering pipeline for transparent objects based on 3D-GS. The main contributions are three-fold. Firstly, an efficient representation of transparent objects, transparent Gaussian primitives, is designed to enable specular refraction through a deferred refraction strategy. Secondly, we leverage Gaussian light field probes (GaussProbe) to encode both ambient light and nearby contents in a unified framework. Thirdly, a depth-based iterative probes query (IterQuery) algorithm is proposed to reduce the parallax errors in our probe-based framework. Experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our approach in recovering transparent objects from complex environments, as well as several applications in computer graphics and vision.},

This is particularly relevant for differentiable rendering, where the additional aspect of differentiablity w.r.t. scene parameters causes increased computational complexity while, on the other hand, in the common application of inverse rendering, the diverse effects of real image formation must be faithfully reproduced. An important effect in rendering is the attenuation of light as it travels through different media (visibility, shadows, transmittance, transparency). This can be modeled as an integral over non-negative functions and has been successfully approximated in forward rendering by so-called moments. We show that moment-based approximations are differentiable in the parameters defining the moments, and that this leads to efficient and practical methods for inverse rendering. In particular, we demonstrate the method at the examples of shadow mapping and visibility in volume rendering, leading to approximations that are similar in efficiency to existing ad-hoc techniques while being significantly more accurate.},

They are also one of the most delicate soft modules, with challenges arising from complex algorithmic flows and efficiency and accuracy issues, especially in extreme cases. Common issues encountered in processing complex models include low efficiency, missing results, and non-watertightness. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for efficient and accurate Boolean operations on B-Rep models. This is achieved by establishing a bijective mapping between B-Rep models and the corresponding triangle meshes with controllable approximation error, thus mapping B-Rep Boolean operations to mesh Boolean operations. By using conservative intersection detection on the mesh to locate all surface intersection curves and carefully handling degeneration and topology errors, we ensure that the results are consistently watertight and correct. We demonstrate the superior efficiency of the proposed method using the open-source geometry engine OCCT, the commercial engine ACIS, and the commercial software Rhino as benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Radiance field methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allow easy reconstruction from photos, enabling free-viewpoint navigation. Nonetheless, pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete. SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes. To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives, storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint. We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that it can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes we target. At the same time our method remains competitive - in speed, image quality, or both - with other methods that only handle specific capture styles or scene sizes.},

  abstract     = {Creative design is an inherently complex and iterative process characterized by continuous exploration, evaluation, and refinement. While recent advances in generative AI have demonstrated remarkable potential in supporting specific design tasks, there remains a critical gap in understanding how these technologies can enhance the holistic design process rather than just isolated stages. This paper introduces DesignManager, a novel AI-powered design support system that aims to transform how designers collaborate with AI throughout their creative workflow. Through a formative study examining designers' current practices with generative AI, we identified key challenges and opportunities in integrating AI into the creative design process. Based on these insights, we developed DesignManager as an interactive copilot system that provides node-based visualization of design evolution, enabling designers to track, modify, and branch their design processes while maintaining meaningful dialogue-based collaboration. The system offers two collaboration modes: DesignManager-guiding and Designer-guiding. Designers can engage in conversational interactions with the DesignManager to obtain design inspiration and tool recommendations, and proactively advance the design progress. The system employs an agent framework to manage decoupled contextual information emerged during the design process, facilitating deep understanding of designers' needs and providing context-aware assistance. Our technical evaluation validated the effectiveness of context decoupling and the use of agent framework, while the open-ended user study with experts demonstrated that DesignManager successfully supports intuitive intention expression, flexible process control, and deeper creative articulation. This work contributes to the understanding of how AI can evolve from task-specific tools to collaborative partners in creative design processes.},

By incorporating these objectives as loss functions, the framework ensures that the resultant composites exhibit optimized mechanical strength while remaining its manufacturability for filament-based multi-axis 3D printing across diverse hardware platforms.

  abstract     = {Orienting point clouds is a fundamental problem in computer graphics and 3D vision, with applications in reconstruction, segmentation, and analysis. While significant progress has been made, existing approaches mainly focus on watertight, object-level 3D models. The orientation of large-scale, non-watertight 3D scenes remains an underexplored challenge. To address this gap, we propose DACPO (Divide-And-Conquer Point Orientation), a novel framework that leverages a divide-and-conquer strategy for scalable and robust point cloud orientation. Rather than attempting to orient an unbounded scene at once, DACPO segments the input point cloud into smaller, manageable blocks, processes each block independently, and integrates the results through a global optimization stage. For each block, we introduce a two-step process: estimating initial normal orientations by a randomized greedy method and refining them by an adapted iterative Poisson surface reconstruction. To achieve consistency across blocks, we model inter-block relationships using an an undirected graph, where nodes represent blocks and edges connect spatially adjacent blocks. To reliably evaluate orientation consistency between adjacent blocks, we introduce the concept of the visible connected region , which defines the region over which visibility-based assessments are performed. The global integration is then formulated as a 0-1 integer-constrained optimization problem, with block flip states as binary variables. Despite the combinatorial nature of the problem, DACPO remains scalable by limiting the number of blocks (typically a few hundred for 3D scenes) involved in the optimization. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate DACPO's strong performance, particularly in challenging large-scale, non-watertight scenarios where existing methods often fail.

The rendering with GESs consists of two passes - surfels are first rasterized through a standard graphics pipeline to produce depth and color maps, and then Gaussians are splatted with depth testing and color accumulation on each pixel order independently. The optimization of GESs from multi-view images is performed through an elaborate coarse-to-fine procedure, faithfully capturing rich scene appearance. The entirely sorting-free rendering of GESs not only achieves very fast rates, but also produces view-consistent images, successfully avoiding popping artifacts under view changes. The basic GES representation can be easily extended to achieve antialiasing in rendering (Mip-GES), boosted rendering speeds (Speedy-GES) and compact storage (Compact-GES), and reconstruct better scene geometries by replacing 3D Gaussians with 2D Gaussians (2D-GES). Experimental results show that GESs advance the state-of-the-arts as a compelling representation for ultra-fast high-fidelity radiance field rendering.},

  abstract     = {Retouching is an essential task in post-manipulation of raw photographs. Generative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible to users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in unacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional procedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp, Lightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals. Unfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual procedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In this paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to critique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them with a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate that MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing operations, by training them to solve specially-designed visual puzzles. Subsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit sequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we synthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits and then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize reasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by construction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and resolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a variety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and identity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural alternatives.

We show that using suitable wave profiles and combination operators, our model is able to extend to 3D a number of Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises, including Gabor, by-example and Phasor noises, as well as generate novel cellular noises. Our versatile and controllable solid noise model is very compact, a key feature for complex power spectrum and animated noises.

To overcome the lack of such a dataset, recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven digital characters.},

Static global illumination is a crucial component of virtual scene rendering, leveraging precomputation and baking techniques to significantly reduce runtime computational costs. Unfortunately, many existing works prioritize visual quality by relying on extensive texture storage and massive pixel-level texture sampling, leading to large performance overhead. In this paper, we introduce an illumination reconstruction method that effectively reduces sampling in fragment shader and avoids additional render passes, making it well-suited for low-end platforms. To achieve high-quality global illumination with reduced memory usage, we adopt a spherical harmonics fitting approach for baking effective illumination information and propose an inverse probe distribution method that generates unique probe associations for each mesh. This association, which can be generated offline in the local space, ensures consistent lighting quality across all instances of the same mesh. As a consequence, our method delivers highly competitive lighting effects while using only approximately 5% of the memory required by mainstream industry techniques.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic calibration method for sparse inertial motion capture systems, which is the first to break the restrictive absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, i.e., the coordinate drift R G′ G and measurement offset R BS remain constant during the entire motion, thereby significantly expanding their application scenarios. Specifically, we achieve real-time estimation of R G′ G and R BS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for accurate estimation of R G′ G and R BS from a short history of IMU readings in real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired R G′ G , R BS matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e., seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture using sparse IMUs.

  abstract     = {Modern hexahedral mesh generation relies on integer-grid maps (IGM), which map the Cartesian grid of integer iso-surfaces to a structure-aligned and conforming hexahedral cell complex discretizing the target shape. The hexahedral mesh is formed by iso-surfaces of the map such that an extraction algorithm is needed to convert the implicit map representation into an explicit mesh. State-of-the-art algorithms have been designed with two goals in mind, i.e., (i) unconditional robustness and (ii) tolerance to map defects in the form of inverted or degenerate tetrahedra. Because of significant advancements in the generation of locally injective maps, the tolerance to map defects has become irrelevant. At the same time, there is a growing demand for efficiently handling significantly larger mesh complexities, unfortunately not well served by the state-of-the-art since the tolerance to map defects induces a high runtime cost. Consequently, we present HexHex, a novel (unconditionally robust) hexahedral mesh extraction algorithm for locally injective integer-grid maps designed for maximal performance and scalability. Key contributions include a novel and highly compact mesh data structure based on so-called propellers and a conservative rasterization technique, significantly reducing the number of required exact predicate tests. HexHex not only offers lower asymptotic runtime complexities from a theoretical perspective but also lower constants, enabling in practice a 30x speedup for medium-sized examples and a larger speedup for more complex inputs, specifically when the hex-to-tet ratio is large. We provide a C++ reference implementation, supporting multi-core parallelization and the extraction of curved (piecewise-linear) hexahedral mesh edges and faces, e.g., valuable for subsequent higher-order mesh generation.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, grid-free Monte Carlo methods have gained increasing popularity for solving fundamental partial differential equations. For a given point in the domain, the Walk-on-Spheres method solves a boundary integral equation by integrating recursively over the largest possible sphere. When the walks approach boundaries with Dirichlet conditions, the number of path vertices increases considerably, since the step size becomes smaller with decreasing distance to the boundary. In practice, the walks are terminated once they reach an epsilon-shell around the boundary. This, however, introduces bias, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and performance. Instead of using spheres, we propose to utilize geometric primitives that share more than one point with the boundary to increase the likelihood of immediately terminating. Along the boundary of those new geometric primitives a sampling probability is needed, which corresponds to the exit probability of a Brownian motion. This is known as a first passage problem. Utilizing that Laplace equations are invariant under conformal maps, we transform exit points from unit circles to the exit points of our geometric primitives, for which we describe a suitable placement strategy. With this, we obtain a novel approach to solve the Laplace equation in two dimensions, which does not require an epsilon-shell, significantly reduces the number of path vertices, and reduces inaccuracies near Dirichlet boundaries.},

The key to the success of these approaches is adherence to geometric constraints, i.e., avoiding intersections, which are the cause of most robustness problems in complex deformation simulation with contact. However, existing barrier-potential methods may lead to spurious forces and imperfect satisfaction of the geometric constraints. They may have strong resolution dependence, requiring careful adaptation of the potential parameters to the object discretizations. We present a systematic derivation of a continuum potential defined for smooth and piecewise smooth surfaces, starting from identifying a set of natural requirements for contact potentials, including the barrier property, locality, differentiable dependence on shape, and absence of forces in rest configurations. Our potential is formulated independently of surface discretization and addresses the shortcomings of existing potential-based methods while retaining their advantages. We present a discretization of our potential that is a drop-in replacement for the potential used in the incremental potential contact formulation [Li et al. 2020], and compare its behavior to other potential formulations, demonstrating that it has the expected behavior. The presented formulation connects existing barrier approaches, as all recent existing methods can be viewed as a variation of the presented potential, and lays a foundation for developing alternative (e.g., higher-order) versions.},

  abstract     = {Mesh reduction using quadric error metrics is the industry standard for producing level-of-detail (LOD) geometry for meshes. Although industry tools produce visually excellent LODs, mesh topology is often ruined during decimation. This is because tools focus on triangle simplification and preserving rendered appearance, whereas artists often produce quad dominant meshes with clean edge topology. Artist created manual LODs preserve both appearance and quad topology. Furthermore, most existing tools for quad decimation only accept pure quad meshes and cannot handle any triangles. The gap between quad and triangular mesh decimation is because they are built on fundamentally different operations, triangle simplification uses single edge collapses, whereas quad decimation requires that entire sets of edges be collapsed atomically. In this work, we demonstrate that single edge collapse can be used to preserve most input quads without degrading geometric quality. Single edge collapse quad preservation is made possible by introducing dihedral-angle weighted quadrics for every edge, allowing optimization to evenly space edges while preserving features. It is further enabled by explicitly ordering edge collapses with nearly equivalent quadric error in a way that preserves quad topology. In addition to quad preservation, we demonstrate that by introducing weights for quadrics on certain edges, our framework can be used to preserve symmetry and joint influences. To demonstrate our approach is suitable for skinned mesh decimation on triangle meshes, we show that QEM with attributes can preserve joint influences better than prior work. We implement and test our approach on 67 static and 19 animated meshes from Sketchfab. On both static and animated meshes, our approach consistently outperforms prior work with lower Chamfer and Hausdorff distance, while preserving more quad topology when present.},

  abstract     = {Contemporary path guiding employs an iterative training scheme to fit radiance distributions. However, existing methods combine the estimates generated in each iteration merely within image space, overlooking differences in the convergence of distribution fitting over individual light paths. This paper formulates the estimation combination task as a path reweighting process. To compute spatio-directional varying combination weights, we propose multiple importance reweighting , leveraging the importance distributions from multiple guiding iterations. We demonstrate that our proposed path-level reweighting makes guiding algorithms less sensitive to noise and overfitting in distributions. This facilitates a finer subdivision of samples both spatially and temporally (i.e., over iterations), which leads to additional improvements in the accuracy of distributions and samples. Inspired by adaptive multiple importance sampling (AMIS), we introduce a simple yet effective mixture-based weighting scheme with theoretically guaranteed consistency, demonstrating good practical performance compared to alternative weighting schemes. To further foster usage with high sample rates, we introduce a hyperparameter that controls the size of sample storage. When this size limit is exceeded, low-valued samples are splatted during rendering and reweighted using a partial mixture of distributions. We found limiting the storage size reduces memory overhead and keeps variance reduction and bias comparable to the unlimited ones. Our method is largely agnostic to the underlying guiding method and compatible with conventional pixel reweighting techniques. Extensive evaluations underscore the feasibility of our approach in various scenes, achieving variance reduction with negligible bias over state-of-the-art solutions within equal sample rates and rendering time.},

  abstract     = {Systematically simulating specular light transport requires an exhaustive search for triangle tuples containing admissible paths. Given the extreme inefficiency of enumerating all combinations, we significantly reduce the search domain by stochastically sampling such tuples. The challenge is to design proper sampling probabilities that keep the noise level controllable. Our key insight is that by bounding the irradiance contributed by each triangle tuple at a given position, we can sample a subset of triangle tuples with potentially high contributions. Although low-contribution tuples are assigned a negligible probability, the overall variance remains low. Therefore, we derive position and irradiance bounds for caustics casted by each triangle tuple, introducing a bounding property of rational functions on a Bernstein basis. When formulating position and irradiance expressions into rational functions, we handle non-rational parts through remainder variables to maintain bounding validity. Finally, we carefully design the sampling probabilities by optimizing the upper bound of the variance, expressed only using the position and irradiance bounds. The bound-driven sampling of triangle tuples is intrinsically unbiased even without defensive sampling. It can be combined with various unbiased and biased root-finding techniques within a local triangle domain. Extensive evaluations show that our method enables the fast and reliable rendering of complex caustics effects. Yet, our method is efficient for no more than two specular vertices, where complexity grows sublinearly to the number of triangles and linearly to that of emitters, and does not consider the Fresnel and visibility terms. We also rely on parameters to control subdivisions.},

  abstract     = {Physically based differentiable rendering has established itself as key to inverse rendering, in which scenes are recovered from images through gradient-based optimization. Taking the derivative of the rendering equation is made difficult by the presence of discontinuities in the integrand at object silhouettes. To obtain correct derivatives w.r.t. changing geometry, accounting e.g. for changing penumbras or silhouettes in glossy reflections, differentiable renderers must compute an integral over these silhouettes. Prior work proposed importance sampling of silhouette edges for a given shading point. The main challenge is to efficiently reject parts of the mesh without silhouettes during sampling, which has been done using top-down traversal of a tree. Inaccuracies of this existing rejection procedure result in many samples with zero contribution. Thus, variance remains high and subsequent work has focused on alternatives such as area sampling or path space differentiable rendering. We propose an improved rejection test. It reduces variance substantially, which makes edge sampling in a unidirectional path tracer competitive again. Our rejection test relies on two approximations to the triangle planes of a mesh patch: A bounding box in dual space and dual quadrics. Additionally, we improve the heuristics used for stochastic traversal of the tree. We evaluate our method in a unidirectional path tracer and achieve drastic improvements over the original edge sampling and outperform methods based on area sampling.},

Taking intuitions from recent advances in rectified flows we propose an algorithm that, while not resulting in optimal transport plans, produces transport plans from uniform densities to densities stored on grids that resemble the optimal ones in practice. Our algorithm has linear-time complexity with respect to the problem size and is embarrassingly parallel. It is also trivial to implement, essentially computing three summed-area tables and advecting particles with velocities easily computed from these tables using simple arithmetic. This already allows for applications such as stippling and area-preserving mesh parameterization. Combined with linearized transport ideas, we further extend our approach to match two non-uniform distributions. This allows for wider applications such as shape interpolation or barycenters, matching the quality of more complex optimal or approximate transport solvers while resulting in orders of magnitude speedups.

It is agnostic to the specific shape representation, requiring only an inside/outside indicator function that depends on shape parameters. Eigenfunctions are computed by minimizing a variational principle over nested spaces with orthogonality constraints. Since eigenvalues may swap dominance at points of multiplicity, we jointly train multiple eigenfunctions while dynamically reordering them based on their eigenvalues at each step. Through causal gradient filtering , this reordering is reflected in backpropagation. Our method enables applications to operate over shape space, providing a single ROM that encapsulates vibration modes for all shapes, including previously unseen ones.

While autoregressive models are typically used to generate sequential data, RigAnything extends its application to effectively learn and represent skeletons, which are inherently tree structures. To achieve this, we organize the joints in a breadth-first search (BFS) order, enabling the skeleton to be defined as a sequence of 3D locations and the parent index. Furthermore, our model improves the accuracy of position prediction by leveraging diffusion modeling, ensuring precise and consistent placement of joints within the hierarchy. This formulation allows the autoregressive model to efficiently capture both spatial and hierarchical relationships within the skeleton.

  abstract     = {Optical heterodyne detection (OHD) employs coherent light and optical interference techniques (Fig. 1-(A)) to extract physical parameters, such as velocity or distance, which are encoded in the frequency modulation of the light. With its superior signal-to-noise ratio compared to incoherent detection methods, such as time-of-flight lidar, OHD has become integral to applications requiring high sensitivity, including autonomous navigation, atmospheric sensing, and biomedical velocimetry. However, current simulation tools for OHD focus narrowly on specific applications, relying on domain-specific settings like restricted reflection functions, scene configurations, or single-bounce assumptions, which limit their applicability. In this work, we introduce a flexible and general framework for spectral-domain simulation of OHD. We demonstrate that classical radiometry-based path integral formulation can be adapted and extended to simulate the OHD measurements in the spectral domain. This enables us to leverage the rich modeling and sampling capabilities of existing Monte Carlo path tracing techniques. Our formulation shares structural similarities with transient rendering but operates in the spectral domain and accounts for the Doppler effect (Fig. 1-(B)). While simulators for the Doppler effect in incoherent (intensity) detection methods exist, they are largely not suitable to simulate OHD. We use a microsurface interpretation to show that these two Doppler imaging techniques capture different physical quantities and thus need different simulation frameworks. We validate the correctness and predictive power of our simulation framework by qualitatively comparing the simulations with real-world captured data for three different OHD applications—FMCW lidar, blood flow velocimetry, and wind Doppler lidar (Fig. 1-(C)).},

  abstract     = {In physics-based simulation of rigid or nearly rigid objects, collisions often become the primary performance bottleneck, particularly when enforcing intersection-free constraints. Previous simulation frameworks rely on primitive-level CCD algorithms. Due to the large number of colliding surface primitives to process, those methods are computationally intensive and heavily dependent on advanced parallel computing resources such as GPUs, which are often inaccessible due to competing tasks or capped threading capacity in applications like policy training for robotics. To address these limitations, we propose a sequential CCD algorithm for convex shapes undergoing constant affine motion. This approach uses the conservative advancement method to iteratively refine a lower-bound estimate of the TOI, exploiting the linearity of affine motion and the efficiency of convex shape distance computation. Our CCD algorithm integrates seamlessly into the ABD framework, achieving a 10-fold speed-up over primitive-level CCD. Its high single-threaded efficiency further enables significant throughput improvements via scene-level parallelism, making it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in domains with complex microparticle geometry that is impractical, or intractable, to model explicitly. Drawing inspiration from volume rendering, we propose tackling this problem by treating the domain as a participating medium that models microparticle geometry stochastically , through aggregate statistical properties (e.g., particle density). We first introduce the problem setting of PDE simulation in participating media. We then specialize to exponential media and describe the properties that make them an attractive model of microparticle geometry for PDE simulation problems. We use these properties to develop two new algorithms, volumetric walk on spheres and volumetric walk on stars , that generalize previous Monte Carlo algorithms to enable efficient and discretization-free simulation of linear elliptic PDEs (e.g., Laplace) in participating media. We demonstrate experimentally that our algorithms can solve Laplace boundary value problems with complex microparticle geometry more accurately and more efficiently than previous approaches, such as ensemble averaging and homogenization.},

  abstract     = {The Material Point Method (MPM) has become a cornerstone of physics-based simulation, widely used in geomechanics and computer graphics for modeling phenomena such as granular flows, viscoelasticity, fracture mechanics, etc. Despite its versatility, the original MPM suffers from cell-crossing instabilities caused by discontinuities in particle-grid transfer kernels. Existing solutions mostly mitigate these issues by adopting smoother shape functions, but at the cost of increased numerical diffusion and computational overhead due to larger kernel support. In this paper, we propose a novel C 2 -continuous compact kernel for MPM that achieves a unique balance in terms of stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Our method integrates seamlessly with Affine Particle-In-Cell (APIC) and Moving Least Squares (MLS) MPM, while only doubling the number of grid nodes associated with each particle compared to linear kernels. At its core is an innovative dual-grid framework, which associates particles with grid nodes exclusively within the cells they occupy on two staggered grids, ensuring consistent and stable force computations. We demonstrate that our method can be conveniently implemented using a domain-specific language, Taichi, or based on open-source GPU MPM frameworks, achieving faster runtime and less numerical diffusion compared to quadratic B-spline MPM. Comprehensive validation through unit tests, comparative studies, and stress tests demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in conserving both linear and angular momentum, handling stiff materials, and scaling efficiently for large-scale simulations. Our results highlight the transformative potential of compact, high-order kernels in advancing MPM's capabilities for stable, accurate, and high-performance simulations.},

Differently from existing approaches, we embed the input in a background mesh and insert a topological offset around the input with purely combinatorial operations. The topological offset is then inflated/deflated to match the user-prescribed distance while enforcing that no intersections or non-manifold configurations are introduced. We evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach on the Thingi10k dataset, and show that topological offsets are beneficial in multiple graphics applications, including (1) converting non-manifold surfaces to manifold ones, (2) creating layered offsets, and (3) reliably computing finite offsets.},

Automated texture generation offers significant acceleration, but prior methods, which fine-tune 2D diffusion models with multi-view input images, often fail to preserve pixel-level details. These methods primarily emphasize semantic and subject consistency, which do not meet the requirements of artwork-guided texture workflows. To address this, we present AlignTex , a novel framework for generating high-quality textures from 3D meshes and multi-view artwork, ensuring both appearance detail and geometric consistency. AlignTex operates in two stages: aligned image generation and texture refinement. The core of our approach, AlignNet , resolves complex misalignments by extracting information from both the artwork and the mesh, generating images compatible with orthographic projection while maintaining geometric and visual fidelity. After projecting aligned images into the texture space, further refinement addresses seams and self-occlusion using an inpainting model and a geometry-aware texture dilation method. Experimental results demonstrate that AlignTex outperforms baseline methods in generation quality and efficiency, offering a practical solution to enhance 3D asset creation in gaming and film production.},

  abstract     = {Quadrilateral mesh generation plays a crucial role in numerical simulations within Computer-Aided Design and Engineering (CAD/E). Producing high-quality quadrangulation typically requires satisfying four key criteria. First, the quadrilateral mesh should closely align with principal curvature directions. Second, singular points should be strategically placed and effectively minimized. Third, the mesh should accurately conform to sharp feature edges. Lastly, quadrangulation results should exhibit robustness against noise and minor geometric variations. Existing methods generally involve first computing a regular cross field to represent quad element orientations across the surface, followed by extracting a quadrilateral mesh aligned closely with this cross field. A primary challenge with this approach is balancing the smoothness of the cross field with its alignment to pre-computed principal curvature directions, which are sensitive to small surface perturbations and often ill-defined in spherical or planar regions. To tackle this challenge, we propose NeurCross , a novel framework that simultaneously optimizes a cross field and a neural signed distance function (SDF), whose zero-level set serves as a proxy of the input shape. Our joint optimization is guided by three factors: faithful approximation of the optimized SDF surface to the input surface, alignment between the cross field and the principal curvature field derived from the SDF surface, and smoothness of the cross field. Acting as an intermediary, the neural SDF contributes in two essential ways. First, it provides an alternative, optimizable base surface exhibiting more regular principal curvature directions for guiding the cross field. Second, we leverage the Hessian matrix of the neural SDF to implicitly enforce cross field alignment with principal curvature directions, thus eliminating the need for explicit curvature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeurCross outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of singular point placement, robustness against surface noise and surface undulations, and alignment with principal curvature directions and sharp feature curves.},

We observe that the user queries typically have one-to-one or many-to-many states, and in many cases, involve non-contiguous states. This necessitates a backend that solves a set-to-set problem with arbitrary combinations of past or future states. To this end, we repurpose video diffusion models to learn the set-to-set mapping with pretrained video priors. We implement the system with strong diffusion transformer backbones ( e.g. , CogVideoX and LTXVideo) and high-quality data processing ( e.g. , sampling short shots from long videos of real drawing records). Experiments show that the generated states are diverse in drawing contexts and resemble human drawing processes.

This work observes that fitting these fields is greatly improved by incorporating spatial stochasticity during training, and that this simple technique can replace or even outperform custom-designed hierarchies and frequency-space constructions. The approach is formalized as implicitly operating on a blurred version of the field, evaluated in-expectation by sampling with Gaussian-distributed offsets. Querying the blurred field during optimization greatly improves convergence and robustness, akin to the role of preconditioners in numerical linear algebra. This implicit, sampling-based perspective fits naturally into the neural field paradigm, comes at no additional cost, and is extremely simple to implement. We describe the basic theory of this technique, including details such as handling boundary conditions, and extending to a spatially-varying blur. Experiments demonstrate this approach on representations including coordinate MLPs, neural hashgrids, triplanes, and more, across tasks including surface reconstruction and radiance fields. In settings where custom-designed hierarchies have already been developed, stochastic preconditioning nearly matches or improves their performance with a simple and unified approach; in settings without existing hierarchies it provides an immediate boost to quality and robustness.},

It allows us to understand the shape variation of each shape in the context of neighboring shapes and also offers structure-preserving interpolations between the input shapes. We show how to extract these shape variations by recovering piecewise affine vector fields in the tangent space of each shape. These vector fields provide single-shape segmentation cues. We then derive shape correspondences by iteratively propagating AAAP deformations across a sequence of intermediate shapes. These correspondences are then used to aggregate single-shape segmentation cues into consistent segmentations.

The reverse process, which we refer to as DeFillet in this paper, is crucial for CAE analysis and secondary design phases. However, it presents significant challenges, particularly when the input data originates from surface reconstruction or discretization processes. Our DeFillet algorithm is inspired by the observation that the rolling-ball center defines an osculating sphere, while the Voronoi diagram of surface samples provides sufficiently many rolling-ball center candidates. By leveraging this insight, we compute a transformation between the Voronoi vertices and the surface samples, enabling the efficient identification of fillet regions. Subsequently, we formulate the reconstruction of sharp features as a quadratic optimization problem. Our method's effectiveness has been validated through extensive testing using self-constructed models and 100 filleted models selected from the Fusion 360 Gallery dataset. The code for this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/xiaowuga/DeFillet.},

  abstract     = {Storyboarding is widely used for creating 3D animations. Animators use the 2D sketches in storyboards as references to craft the desired 3D animations through a trial-and-error process. The traditional approach requires exceptional expertise and is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, there is a high demand for automated methods that can directly translate 2D storyboard sketches into 3D animations. This task is under-explored to date and inspired by the significant advancements of motion diffusion models, we propose to address it from the perspective of conditional motion synthesis. We thus present Sketch2Anim , composed of two key modules for sketch constraint understanding and motion generation. Specifically, due to the large domain gap between the 2D sketch and 3D motion, instead of directly conditioning on 2D inputs, we design a 3D conditional motion generator that simultaneously leverages 3D keyposes, joint trajectories, and action words, to achieve precise and fine-grained motion control. Then, we invent a neural mapper dedicated to aligning user-provided 2D sketches with their corresponding 3D keyposes and trajectories in a shared embedding space, enabling, for the first time , direct 2D control of motion generation. Our approach successfully transfers storyboards into high-quality 3D motions and inherently supports direct 3D animation editing, thanks to the flexibility of our multi-conditional motion generator. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  abstract     = {In recent years, reconstruction methods have been developed that can recover strand-level hair geometry from images. However, these methods recover a vast number of individual hair strands that are difficult to edit and simulate. Many methods also rely on neural priors to infer non-visible inner hair, which can result in poor inner hair structure for complex hairstyles, such as curly hair. We propose an inverse hair grooming pipeline that transforms the imperfect 3D strands from these reconstruction methods into procedural hair grooms that consist of a small set of guide strands and hair grooming operators, inspired by pipelines used by artists in popular 3D modeling tools such as Blender and Houdini. We take a probabilistic view of these hair grooms and design various optimization strategies and loss functions to optimize for the guide strands and operator parameters. Due to the proceduralism, our resulting grooms can naturally represent challenging hairstyles, have structurally sound inner hair, and are easily editable.},

  abstract     = {Facial aging is a complex process, highly dependent on multiple factors like gender, ethnicity, lifestyle, etc., making it extremely challenging to learn a global aging prior to predict aging for any individual accurately. Existing techniques often produce realistic and plausible aging results, but the re-aged images often do not resemble the person's appearance at the target age and thus need personalization. In many practical applications of virtual aging, e.g. VFX in movies and TV shows, access to a personal photo collection of the user depicting aging in a small time interval (20~40 years) is often available. However, naive attempts to personalize global aging techniques on personal photo collections often fail. Thus, we propose MyTimeMachine (MyTM), a method that combines a global aging prior with a personalized photo collection (ranging from as few as 10 images, ideally 50) to learn individualized age transformations. We introduce a novel Adapter Network that combines personalized aging features with global aging features and generates a re-aged image with StyleGAN2. We also introduce three loss functions to personalize the Adapter Network with personalized aging loss, extrapolation regularization, and adaptive w-norm regularization. Our method demonstrates strong performance on fair-use imagery of widely recognizable individuals, producing photorealistic and identity-consistent age transformations that generalize well across diverse appearances. It also extends naturally to video, delivering high-quality, temporally consistent results that closely resemble actual appearances at target ages—outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Computing derivatives of path integrals under evolving scene geometry is a fundamental problem in physics-based differentiable rendering, which requires differentiating discontinuities in the visibility function. Warped-area reparameterization is a powerful technique to compute differential visibility, and key is construction of a velocity field that is continuous in the domain interior and agrees with defined velocities on boundaries. Robustly and efficiently constructing such fields remains challenging. We present a novel velocity field construction for differential visibility. Inspired by recent Monte Carlo solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs), we formulate the velocity field via Laplace's equation and solve it with a walk-on-spheres (WoS) algorithm. To improve efficiency, we introduce a fixed-step WoS that terminates random walks after a fixed step count, resulting in a continuous but non-harmonic velocity field still valid for warped-area reparameterization. Furthermore, to practically apply our method to complex 3D scenes, we propose an efficient cone query to find the closest silhouettes on a boundary. Our cone query finds the closest point under the geodesic distance on a unit sphere, and is analogous to the closest point query by WoS to compute Euclidean distance. As a result, our method generalizes WoS to perform random walks on spherical caps over the unit sphere. We demonstrate that this enables a more robust and efficient unbiased estimator for differential visibility.},

Such rectangular parameterizations are needed for a broad range of tasks, from physical simulation to geometric modeling to computational fabrication. Our main contribution is a novel strategy for constructing frame fields that are perfectly orthogonal and exactly integrable, in the limit of mesh refinement. In contrast to past strategies for achieving integrability, we obtain maps that are less distorted and better preserve target field directions. The method supports user-defined distortion measures, sharp feature alignment, prescribed or automatic cone singularities, and direct control over boundary behavior (e.g., sizing or aspect ratio). By quantizing and contouring these maps we obtain high-quality anisotropic quad meshes, even without element-based optimization. Empirically, we outperform state-of-the-art research and commercial mesh generation algorithms in terms of element quality, accuracy, and asymptotic convergence rate in end-to-end simulation tasks, are competitive with the widely-used ZBrush package for automatic retopology, and provide Chebyshev nets of superior quality to methods specifically tailored to digital fabrication.},

Furthermore, existing curve-based scattering models are not suitable for this problem: they are either not naturally differentiable due to discrete fiber count parameters, or require a more detailed geometry representation, introducing extra complexity. In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting a novel pipeline that captures and digitizes physical threads and predicts the appearance of the fabric based on the weaving pattern. We develop a practical thread scattering model based on simulations of multiple fiber scattering within a thread. Using a cost-efficient multi-view setup, we capture threads of diverse colors and materials. We apply differentiable rendering to digitize threads, demonstrating that our model significantly improves the reconstruction accuracy compared to existing models, matching both reflection and transmission. We leverage a two-scale rendering technique to efficiently render woven cloth. We validate that our digital threads, combined with simulated woven yarn geometry, can accurately predict the fabric appearance by comparing to real samples. We show how our work can aid designs using diverse thread profiles, woven patterns, and textured design patterns.},

  abstract     = {Whenever the concept of high-performance cloth simulation is brought up, GPU acceleration is almost always the first that comes to mind. Leveraging immense parallelization, GPU algorithms have demonstrated significant success recently, whereas CPU methods are somewhat overlooked. Indeed, the need for an efficient CPU simulator is evident and pressing. In many scenarios, high-end GPUs may be unavailable or are already allocated to other tasks, such as rendering and shading. A high-performance CPU alternative can greatly boost the overall system capability and user experience. Inspired by this demand, this paper proposes a CPU algorithm for high-resolution cloth simulation. By partitioning the garment model into multiple (but not massive) sub-meshes or domains, we assign per-domain computations to individual CPU processors. Borrowing the idea of projective dynamics that breaks the computation into global and local steps, our key contribution is a new parallelization paradigm at domains for both global and local steps so that domain-level calculations are sequential and lightweight. The CPU has much fewer processing units than a GPU. Our algorithm mitigates this disadvantage by wisely balancing the scale of the parallelization and convergence. We validate our method in a wide range of simulation problems involving high-resolution garment models. Performance-wise, our method is at least one order faster than existing CPU methods, and it delivers a similar performance compared with the state-of-the-art GPU algorithms in many examples, but without using a GPU.},

  abstract     = {In parallel simulation, convergence and parallelism are often seen as inherently conflicting objectives. Improved parallelism typically entails lighter local computation and weaker coupling, which unavoidably slow the global convergence. This paper presents a novel GPU algorithm that achieves convergence rates comparable to fullspace Newton's method while maintaining good parallelizability just like the Jacobi method. Our approach is built on a key insight into the phenomenon of overshoot. Overshoot occurs when a local solver aggressively minimizes its local energy without accounting for the global context, resulting in a local update that undermines global convergence. To address this, we derive a theoretically second-order optimal solution to mitigate overshoot. Furthermore, we adapt this solution into a pre-computable form. Leveraging Cubature sampling, our runtime cost is only marginally higher than the Jacobi method, yet our algorithm converges nearly quadratically as Newton's method. We also introduce a novel full-coordinate formulation for more efficient pre-computation. Our method integrates seamlessly with the incremental potential contact method and achieves second-order convergence for both stiff and soft materials. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach delivers high-quality simulations and outperforms state-of-the-art GPU methods with 50× to 100× better convergence.},

This intricate geometry and the large number of geometric primitives present substantial challenges for achieving high-fidelity simulation and rendering in real-time applications. In this work, we introduce the first real-time framework that takes an animated stitch mesh as input and enhances it with yarn-level simulation and fiber-level rendering. Our approach relies on a knot-based representation to model interlocked yarn contacts. The knot positions are interpolated from the underlying mesh, and associated yarn control points are optimized using a physically inspired energy formulation, which is solved through a GPU-based Gauss-Newton scheme for real-time performance. The optimized control points are sent to the GPU rasterization pipeline and rendered as yarns with fiber-level details. In real-time rendering, we introduce several decomposition strategies to enable realistic lighting effects on complex knit structures, even under environmental lighting, while maintaining computational and memory efficiency. Our simulation faithfully reproduces yarn-level structures under deformations, e.g., stretching and shearing, capturing interlocked yarn behaviors. The rendering pipeline achieves near-ground-truth visual quality while being 120,000× faster than path tracing reference with fiber-level geometries. The whole system provides real-time performance and has been evaluated through various application scenarios, including knit simulation for small patches and full garments and yarn-level relaxation in the design pipeline.},

  abstract     = {GPUs can encounter memory capacity constraints, which pose challenges for achieving real-time rendering performance when processing large 3D models that exceed available memory. State-of-the-art out-of-core rendering frameworks have leveraged Level of Detail (LOD) and frame-to-frame coherence data management techniques to optimize memory usage and minimize CPU-to-GPU data transfer costs. However, the size of view-dependently selected data may still exceed GPU memory capacity, and data transfer remains the most significant bottleneck in overall performance costs. To address these, we introduce a new GPU out-of-core rendering approach that includes a LOD selection method that takes into account both memory and coherence constraints and a parallel in-place GPU memory management algorithm that efficiently assembles the data of the current frame with GPU-resident data from the previous frame and transferred data. Our approach bounds memory usage and data transfer costs, prioritizes and schedules the transfer of essential data, incrementally refining the LOD over subsequent frames to converge toward the desired visual fidelity. Our parallel memory management algorithm consolidates frame-different and reusable data, dynamically reallocating GPU memory slots for efficient in-place operations. Hierarchical LOD representations remain a core component, and we emphasize their role in supporting adaptive data transfer and coherence management, characterized by a uniform depth and near-equal patch size at all levels. Our approach adapts seamlessly to scenarios with varying levels of coherence by balancing real-time performance with visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves significant performance improvements, rendering scenes with billions of triangles in real-time, outperforming existing methods while maintaining consistent visual quality during dynamic interactions.},

Accounting for the complex interplay between body deformations and resulting motion, especially through interactions with the environment, poses significant challenges for the design of such pose sequences. We propose a computational framework to address these challenges in scenarios where the motion of a deformable body is entirely determined by dynamic changes of its shape. Complementing recent methods on the forward problem—mapping shape sequences to global motion trajectories based on a geometric formulation of locomotion—we address the inverse problem of optimizing shape sequences to achieve user-defined motion objectives. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of examples, producing realistic shape sequences that result in desired motion trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Online free-view navigation in volumetric videos requires high-quality rendering and real-time streaming in order to provide immersive user experiences. However, existing methods ( e.g. , dynamic NeRF and 3DGS) may not handle dynamic scenes with complex motions, and their models may not be streamable due to storage and bandwidth constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel 4D Gaussian Video (4DGV) approach that enables the creation and streaming of photorealistic, volumetric videos for dynamic scenes over the Internet. The core of our 4DGV is a novel streamable group of Gaussians (GOG) representation based on motion layering. Each GOG consists of static and dynamic points obtained via lifting 2D segmentation into 3D in motion layering, where the deformation of each dynamic point is represented as the temporal offset of its attributes. We also adaptively convert static points back to dynamic points to handle the appearance change, (e.g. , moving shadows and reflections), of static objects through optimization. To support real-time streaming of 4DGVs, we show that by applying quantization on Gaussian attributes and H.265 encoding on deformation offsets, our GOG representation can be significantly compressed (to around 6% of the original model size) without sacrificing the accuracy (PSNR loss less than 0.01dB). Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art volumetric video approaches, with superior rendering quality and minimum storage overheads.},

  abstract     = {We propose the adaptive hybrid particle-grid flow map method, a novel flow-map approach that leverages Lagrangian particles to simultaneously transport impulse and guide grid adaptation, introducing a fully adaptive flow map-based fluid simulation framework. The core idea of our method is to maintain flow-map trajectories separately on grid nodes and particles: the grid-based representation tracks long-range flow maps at a coarse spatial resolution, while the particle-based representation tracks both long and short-range flow maps, enhanced by their gradients, at a fine resolution. This hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian flow-map representation naturally enables adaptivity for both advection and projection steps. We implement this method in Cirrus , a GPU-based fluid simulation framework designed for octree-like adaptive grids enhanced with particle trackers. The efficacy of our system is demonstrated through numerical tests and various simulation examples, achieving up to 512 × 512 × 2048 effective resolution on an RTX 4090 GPU. We achieve a 1.5 to 2× speedup with our GPU optimization over the Particle Flow Map method on the same hardware, while the adaptive grid implementation offers efficiency gains of one to two orders of magnitude by reducing computational resource requirements.

However, BEM often generate dense and ill-conditioned linear systems that lead to poor computational scalability and substantial memory demands for large-scale problems, limiting their applicability and efficiency in practice. In this paper, we address these limitations by generalizing the Kaporin-based approach to asymmetric preconditioning: we construct a sparse approximation of the inverse-LU factorization of arbitrary BIE matrices in a massively parallel manner. Our sparse inverse-LU factorization, when employed as a preconditioner for the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method, significantly enhances the efficiency of BIE solves, often yielding orders-of-magnitude speedups in solving times.},

This is all the more surprising as torsion is a crucial component in the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry, which introduces the existence and uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection induced by the metric. In this paper, we extend the existing geometry processing toolbox by providing torsion control over discrete connections. Our approach consists in first introducing a new discrete Levi-Civita connection for a metric with locally-constant curvature to replace the hinge connection of a triangle mesh whose curvature is concentrated at singularities; from this reference connection, we define the discrete torsion of a connection to be the discrete dual 1-form by which a connection deviates from our discrete Levi-Civita connection. We discuss how the curvature and torsion of a discrete connection can then be controlled and assigned in a manner consistent with the continuous case.

  abstract     = {We propose the V ortex P article F low M ap (VPFM) method to simulate incompressible flow with complex vortical evolution in the presence of dynamic solid boundaries. The core insight of our approach is that vorticity is an ideal quantity for evolution on particle flow maps, enabling significantly longer flow map distances compared to other fluid quantities like velocity or impulse. To achieve this goal, we developed a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian representation that evolves vorticity and flow map quantities on vortex particles, while reconstructing velocity on a background grid. The method integrates three key components: (1) a vorticity-based particle flow map framework, (2) an accurate Hessian evolution scheme on particles, and (3) a solid boundary treatment for no-through and no-slip conditions in VPFM. These components collectively allow a substantially longer flow map length ( 3–12 times longer) than the state-of-the-art, enhancing vorticity preservation over extended spatiotemporal domains. We validated the performance of VPFM through diverse simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex vortex dynamics and turbulence phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Modern nanofabrication techniques have enabled us to manipulate the wave-front of light with sub-wavelength-scale structures, offering the potential to replace bulky refractive surfaces in conventional optics with ultrathin metasurfaces. In theory, arrays of nanoposts provide unprecedented control over manipulating the wavefront in terms of phase, polarization, and amplitude at the nanometer resolution. A line of recent work successfully investigates flat computational cameras that replace compound lenses with a single metalens or an array of metasurfaces a few millimeters from the sensor. However, due to the inherent wavelength dependence of metalenses, in practice, these cameras do not match their refractive counterparts in image quality for broadband imaging, and may even suffer from hallucinations when relying on generative reconstruction methods. In this work, we investigate a collaborative array of metasurface elements that are jointly learned to perform broadband imaging. To this end, we learn a nanophotonics array with 100-million nanoposts that is end-to-end jointly optimized over the full visible spectrum—a design task that existing inverse design methods or learning approaches cannot support due to memory and compute limitations. We introduce a distributed meta-optics learning method to tackle this challenge. This allows us to optimize a large parameter array along with a learned metaatom proxy and a non-generative reconstruction method that is parallax-aware and noise-aware. The proposed camera performs favorably in simulation and in all experimental tests irrespective of the scene illumination spectrum.},

We analyze necessary stability conditions for Progressive Dynamics integrators and introduce a novel, stable method that significantly improves temporal continuity, supported by a new quantitative measure.

  abstract     = {This paper explores the analysis and design of the resting configurations of a rigid body, without the use of physical simulation. In particular, given a rigid body in R 3 , we identify all possible stationary points, as well as the probability that the body will stop at these points, assuming a random initial orientation and negligible momentum. The forward version of our method can hence be used to automatically orient models, to provide feedback about object stability during the design process, and to furnish plausible distributions of shape orientation for natural scene modeling. Moreover, a differentiable inverse version of our method lets us design shapes with target resting behavior, such as dice with target, nonuniform probabilities. Here we find solutions that would be nearly impossible to find using classical techniques, such as dice with additional unstable faces that provide more natural overall geometry. From a technical point of view, our key observation is that rolling equilibria can be extracted from the Morse-Smale complex of the support function over the Gauss map. Our method is hence purely geometric, and does not make use of random sampling, or numerical time integration. Yet surprisingly, this purely geometric model makes extremely accurate predictions of rest behavior, which we validate both numerically, and via physical experiments. Moreover, for computing rest statistics, it is orders of magnitude faster than state of the art rigid body simulation, opening the door to inverse design—rather than just forward analysis.},

  abstract     = {We propose a coupled mesh-adaptation model and physical simulation algorithm to jointly generate, per timestep, optimal adaptive remeshings and implicit solutions for the simulation of frictionally contacting elastodynamics. To do so, we begin with Ferguson et al.'s [2023] recently developed in-timestep remeshing (ITR) framework, which proposes an Incremental Potential based objective for mesh refinement, and a corresponding, locally greedy remeshing algorithm to minimize it. While this initial ITR framework demonstrates significant improvements, its greedy remeshing does not generate optimal meshes, and so does not converge to improving physical solutions with increasing mesh resolution. In practice, due to lack of optimality, the original ITR framework can and will find mesh and state solutions with unnecessarily low-quality geometries and corresponding physical solution artifacts. At the same time, we also identify additional fundamental challenges to adaptive simulation in terms of both ITR's original remeshing objective and its corresponding optimization problem formulation. In this work, in order to extend the ITR framework to high-quality, optimal in-timestep remeshing, we first construct a new remeshing objective function built from simple, yet critical, updates to the Incremental Potential energy, and a corresponding constrained model problem, whose minimizers provide locally optimal remeshings for physical problems. We then propose a new in-timestep remeshing optimization that jointly solves, per-timestep, for a new locally optimal remeshing and the next physical state defined upon it. To evaluate and demonstrate our extension of the ITR framework, we apply it to the optimal r-adaptive ITR simulation of frictionally contacting elasto-dynamics and statics. To enable r-adaptivity we additionally propose a new numerical method to robustly compute derivatives of the L 2 -projection operator necessary for optimal mesh-to-mesh state mappings within solves, a constraint model to enable on-boundary node adaptivity, and an efficient Newton-type optimization method for practically solving each per-timestep r-adaptive ITR solution. We extensively evaluate our method on challenging large-deformation and frictionally contacting scenarios. Here we observe optimal r-adaptivity captures comparable and better accuracy than unadapted meshes orders-of-magnitude larger, with corresponding significant advantages in both computation speedup and decrease in memory usage.},

While existing kinematics motion generation with diffusion models offer intuitive steering capabilities with inference-time conditioning, they often fail to produce physically viable motions. In contrast, recent diffusion-based control policies have shown promise in generating physically realizable motion sequences, but the lack of kinematics prediction limits their steerability. Diffuse-CLoC addresses these challenges through a key insight: modeling the joint distribution of states and actions within a single diffusion model makes action generation steerable by conditioning it on the predicted states. This approach allows us to leverage established conditioning techniques from kinematic motion generation while producing physically realistic motions. As a result, we achieve planning capabilities without the need for a high-level planner. Our method handles a diverse set of unseen long-horizon downstream tasks through a single pre-trained model, including static and dynamic obstacle avoidance, motion in-betweening, and task-space control. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the traditional hierarchical framework of high-level motion diffusion and low-level tracking.},

  abstract     = {We give a method to simulate large deformations of 3D elastic rods under arbitrary nonlinear isotropic 3D solid materials. Rod elastic energies in existing graphics literature are derived from volumetric models under the small-strain linearization assumptions. While the resulting equations can and are commonly applied to large deformations, the material modeling has been limited to a single material, namely linear Hooke law. Starting from any 3D solid nonlinear isotropic elastic energy density function ψ , we derive our rod elastic energy by subjecting the 3D solid volumetric material to the limit process whereby rod thickness is decreased to zero. This enables us to explain rod stretching, bending and twisting in a unified model. Care must be taken to adequately model cross-sectional in-plane and out-of-plane deformations. Our key insight is to compute the three cross-sectional deformation modes corresponding to bending (in the two directions) and twisting, using linear theory. Then, given any ψ , we use these modes to derive an analytical formula for a 5D "macroscopic" large-deformation rod elastic energy function of the local longitudinal stretch, radial scaling, the two bending curvatures and torsion. Our model matches linear theory for small deformations, including cross-sectional shrinkage due to Poisson's effect, and produces correct bending and torsional constants. Our experiments demonstrate that our energy closely matches volumetric FEM even under large stretches and curvatures, whereas commonly used methods in graphics deviate from it. We also compare to closely related work from mechanics literature; we give an explicit expansion of all energy terms in terms of the rod cross-section diameter, allowing independent adjustment of stretching, bending and twisting. Finally, we observe an inherent limitation in the ability of rod models to control nonlinear bendability and twistability. We propose to "relax" rod physics to more easily control nonlinear bending and twisting in computer graphics applications.},

We introduce MoVer, a motion verification DSL based on first-order logic that can check spatio-temporal properties of a motion graphics animation. We identify a general set of such properties that people commonly use to describe animations (e.g., the direction and timing of motions, the relative positioning of objects, etc.). We implement these properties as predicates in MoVer and provide an execution engine that can apply a MoVer program to any input SVG-based motion graphics animation. We then demonstrate how MoVer can be used in an LLM-based synthesis and verification pipeline for iteratively refining motion graphics animations. Given a text prompt, our pipeline synthesizes a motion graphics animation and a corresponding MoVer program. Executing the verification program on the animation yields a report of the predicates that failed and the report can be automatically fed back to LLM to iteratively correct the animation. To evaluate our pipeline, we build a synthetic dataset of 5600 text prompts paired with ground truth MoVer verification programs. We find that while our LLM-based pipeline is able to automatically generate a correct motion graphics animation for 58.8% of the test prompts without any iteration, this number raises to 93.6% with up to 50 correction iterations.

  abstract     = {We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with composable hair and face components. Unlike previous work that entangles the modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D GAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image synthesis and composable 3D hairstyle editing.

Input points, or a sampling of the ribbons, form a conductive cage and shield the interior from external fields. The gradient of the maximum field strength over external field scenarios is used to estimate a normal at each input point or ribbon. The electrostatic effect is modeled with a simple Poisson system, accommodating intuitive user-driven sculpting via the specification of point charges and Faraday cage points. On inputs sampled from clean, watertight meshes, our method achieves comparable normal quality to existing methods tailored for this scenario. On inputs containing interior structures and artifacts, our method produces superior surfacing output when combined with Poisson Surface Reconstruction. In the case of ribbon sketches, our method accommodates sparser ribbon input while maintaining an accurate geometry, allowing for greater flexibility in the artistic process. We demonstrate superior performance to an existing approach for surfacing ribbon sketches in this sparse setting.},

  abstract     = {As AR/VR systems evolve to demand increasingly powerful GPUs, physically separating compute from display hardware emerges as a natural approach to enable a lightweight, comfortable form factor. Unfortunately, splitting the system into a client-server architecture leads to challenges in transporting graphical data. Simply streaming rendered images over a network suffers in terms of latency and reliability, especially given variable bandwidth. Although image-based reprojection techniques can help, they often do not support full motion parallax or disocclusion events. Instead, scene geometry can be streamed to the client, allowing local rendering of novel views. Traditionally, this has required a prohibitively large amount of interconnect bandwidth, excluding the use of practical networks. This paper presents a new quad-based geometry streaming approach that is designed with compression and the ability to adjust Quality-of-Experience (QoE) in response to target network bandwidths. Our approach advances previous work by introducing a more compact data structure and a temporal compression technique that reduces data transfer overhead by up to 15×, reducing bandwidth usage to as low as 100 Mbps. We optimized our design for hardware video codec compatibility and support an adaptive data streaming strategy that prioritizes transmitting only the most relevant geometry updates. Our approach achieves image quality comparable to, and in many cases exceeds, state-of-the-art techniques while requiring only a fraction of the bandwidth, enabling real-time geometry streaming on commodity headsets over WiFi.},

Our solution capitalizes on strong geometric priors to optimize through distributed processing and load balancing, enabling interactive, freely explorable 3D experiences. By dividing scene reconstruction into actor-centric and environment-specific tasks, we employ hierarchical coarse-to-fine optimization to rapidly and accurately reconstruct human actors based on pose data, refining their geometry and appearance with photometric loss. For static environments, we focus on view-dependent appearance changes, streamlining rendering efficiency and maximizing GPU performance. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce (and distribute) a synthetic benchmark dataset of basketball games, offering high visual fidelity as ground truth. In both our synthetic benchmark and publicly available benchmarks, LiveSplats consistently outperforms existing approaches.

  abstract     = {Parametrization is a key element of many geometric modeling tasks. Seamless parametrization, in particular, is needed as a starting point for many algorithms for quadrangulation and conversion to high-order patches, as well as for the construction of seamless texture maps and displacement maps. Seamless parametrizations are difficult to compute robustly, in part because, in general, it is not known if one exists for a given mesh connectivity or for a particular configuration of singularities. Recently, Penner-coordinate-based methods that allow for connectivity changes have been shown to achieve a perfect success rate on a widely used dataset (Thingi10k). However, previously proposed Penner coordinate methods do not support sharp feature alignment or soft alignment with preferred directions on the surface, both of which are important for practical applications, especially those involving models with sharp features. In this paper, we extend Penner coordinates to surfaces with sharp features to which the parametrization needs to be aligned. Our algorithm extends the holonomy signature description of seamless parametrizations to surfaces with marked feature curves. We describe sufficient conditions for obtaining feasible solutions and describe a two-phase method to efficiently enforce feature constraints or minimize residual errors when solutions are unattainable. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm works robustly on the Thingi10k dataset with automatic feature labeling, and the resulting seamless parametrizations can be optimized, quantized, and quadrangulated, completing the quad mesh generation pipeline.},

Previous work embeds impossible objects in 3D, cutting them or twisting/bending them in the depth axis. Cutting an impossible object changes its local geometry at the cut, which can hamper downstream graphics applications, such as smoothing, while bending makes it difficult to relight the object. Both of these can invalidate geometry operations, such as distance computation. As an alternative, we introduce Meschers, meshes capable of representing impossible constructions akin to those found in M.C. Escher's woodcuts. Our representation has a theoretical foundation in discrete exterior calculus and supports the use-cases above, as we demonstrate in a number of example applications. Moreover, because we can do discrete geometry processing on our representation, we can inverse-render impossible objects. We also compare our representation to cut and bend representations of impossible objects.},

We introduce a novel framework that transforms local contact handling into a global repair strategy through a combination of local signed tangent-point energies and their gradient diffusion. At the heart of our method is a key insight: rather than computing expensive global repulsive potentials, we can effectively approximate long-range interactions by diffusing energy gradients from local contacts throughout the mesh surface. In turn, resolving complex self-intersections reduces to simply propagating local repulsive energies through standard diffusion mechanics and iteratively solving tractable local optimizations. We further accelerate convergence through our momentum-based optimizer, which adaptively regulates momentum based on gradient statistics to prevent overshooting while maintaining rapid intersection repair. The resulting algorithm handles a variety of challenging scenarios, from shallow contacts to deep penetrations, while providing computational efficiency suitable for interactive applications.},

Traditional non-rigid Iterative Closest Point (ICP) methods rely on manually selected template meshes, which can result in inconsistent registrations when applied to diverse shape collections. This inconsistency arises particularly when the template lacks common shape features with the input instances or when landmark annotations are sparse. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel ICP framework that jointly optimizes a shared template shape and its instance-wise deformations. Our joint optimization framework assigns distinct roles to the shared template and instance-wise deformations: the template captures common shape features, while instance-wise deformations handle residual registration errors. We use stronger smoothness regularization on the instance-wise deformations in early iterations to prioritize the accumulation of common details on the template. Additionally, a distortion alignment energy minimizes interinstance map distortions, promoting consistent instance-wise deformations. On challenging 3D datasets with large shape variations, our method achieves state-of-the-art fitting accuracy and consistent results in shape averaging and deformation transfer. By removing the need for a carefully selected preset template, our method extends the capability of extrinsic non-rigid registration frameworks, offering a more robust and flexible solution for challenging registration scenarios.},

Through total internal reflection, light pipes have an advantage in guiding the full angular bandwidth regardless of its length. By modeling such kaleidoscopic guiding of the wavefront inside the light pipe and applying it to holographic image generation, we successfully separate the light engine from the image combiner, making the front of the device clear and lightweight. We experimentally validate that the proposed light pipe system delivers virtual images with high-quality and 3D depth cues. We further present a method to simulate and compensate for light pipe misalignment, enhancing the robustness and practicality of the proposed system.},

  abstract     = {3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced computer graphics by enabling high-quality 3D reconstruction and fast rendering speeds, inspiring numerous follow-up studies. However, 3DGS and its subsequent works are restricted to specific hardware setups, either on only low-cost or on only high-end configurations. Approaches aimed at reducing 3DGS memory usage enable rendering on low-cost GPU but compromise rendering quality, which fails to leverage the hardware capabilities in the case of higher-end GPU. Conversely, methods that enhance rendering quality require high-end GPU with large VRAM, making such methods impractical for lower-end devices with limited memory capacity. Consequently, 3DGS-based works generally assume a single hardware setup and lack the flexibility to adapt to varying hardware constraints. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flexible Level of Detail (FLoD) for 3DGS. FLoD constructs a multi-level 3DGS representation through level-specific 3D scale constraints, where each level independently reconstructs the entire scene with varying detail and GPU memory usage. A level-by-level training strategy is introduced to ensure structural consistency across levels. Furthermore, the multi-level structure of FLoD allows selective rendering of image regions at different detail levels, providing additional memory-efficient rendering options. To our knowledge, among prior works which incorporate the concept of Level of Detail (LoD) with 3DGS, FLoD is the first to follow the core principle of LoD by offering adjustable options for a broad range of GPU settings. Experiments demonstrate that FLoD provides various rendering options with trade-offs between quality and memory usage, enabling real-time rendering under diverse memory constraints. Furthermore, we show that FLoD generalizes to different 3DGS frameworks, indicating its potential for integration into future state-of-the-art developments.},

To try and overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that seeks to satisfy as many componentwise secant equations as necessary to define each row of the Hessian matrix. A naive application of this approach is too expensive for Hessian matrices that have some relatively dense rows but, by carefully taking into account the symmetry and connectivity of the Hessian matrix, we are able devise an approximation algorithm that is fast and efficient with scope for parallelism. Example sparse Hessian matrices from the CUTEst test collection for optimization illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.},

Evaluating a LUT can be as quick as using Horner’s method to evaluate a polynomial after looking up its coefficients. A common choice of LUT is a piecewise constant or piecewise linear function; however, high-degree interpolating polynomials can also be valuable. Here, we describe the functionality of FunC 2.0, a C++ library designed to streamline the process of building, comparing, and implementing univariate LUTs in practical applications. In particular, FunC 2.0 can build relatively small LUTs satisfying user-provided absolute and relative tolerances for error. Furthermore, FunC 2.0 can build nonuniform LUTs, it provides utilities to quickly determine reasonable LUT bounds and tolerances for error, and it provides a way to quickly profile a set of LUTs. We demonstrate FunC ’s utility in application by reducing the total runtime of a simulation performed by the Canadian Hydrological Model (CHM). This simulation modeled the snow mass distribution across Western Canada over 1 month. Now, the CHM can evaluate the mathematical function of interest about 28 times faster, allowing the necessary algorithm to finish two times faster, and the overall simulation is about 9% faster.},

To address these challenges, in this article, we propose the first approach of structural deobfuscation named JSimpo for JS programs with two novel techniques: slice symbolic execution and dynamic code execution. We implement our JSimpo approach and evaluate it on 2,000 JS programs from the top 100 JS projects on GitHub. The evaluation results show that JSimpo can effectively conduct structural deobfuscation, boosting the average structural similarity to 78.41% (from 39.33%) between obfuscated programs and their original programs, whereas the best of the state-of-the-art/practice deobfuscators can achieve only 62.64%. The results also show JSimpo's generalization ability over programs obfuscated by various obfuscators. Additionally, JSimpo preserves the semantics of deobfuscated programs by passing all test cases that obfuscated programs have passed.},

While prior studies have highlighted the advantages of fine-tuning LLMs, this process incurs high computational costs, making it impractical in resource-scarce environments, particularly for models with billions of parameters. To address these challenges, previous research explored in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as strategies to guide the LLM generative process with task-specific prompt examples. However, ICL and RAG introduce inconveniences, such as the need for designing contextually relevant prompts and the absence of learning task-specific parameters, thereby limiting downstream task performance. In this context, we foresee parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) as a promising approach to efficiently specialize LLMs to task-specific data while maintaining reasonable resource consumption. In this article, we deliver a comprehensive study of PEFT techniques for LLMs in the context of automated code generation. Our comprehensive investigation of PEFT techniques for LLMs reveals their superiority and potential over ICL and RAG across a diverse set of LLMs and three representative Python code generation datasets: Conala, CodeAlpacaPy, and APPS. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential for tuning larger LLMs and significant reductions in memory usage by combining PEFT with quantization. Therefore, this study opens opportunities for broader applications of PEFT in software engineering scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Recent code large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in generating standalone functions. However, they face limitations in repository-level code generation due to their lack of awareness of repository - level dependencies (e.g., user-defined attributes), resulting in dependency errors such as undefined-variable and no-member errors. In this work, we introduce ToolGen , an approach that integrates autocompletion tools into the code LLM generation process to address these dependencies. ToolGen comprises two main phases: Trigger Insertion and Model Fine-tuning (Offline), and Tool-integrated Code Generation (Online). During the offline phase, ToolGen augments functions within a given code corpus with a special mark token, indicating positions to trigger autocompletion tools. These augmented functions, along with their corresponding descriptions, are then used to fine-tune a selected code LLM. In the online phase, ToolGen iteratively generates functions by predicting tokens step-by-step using the fine-tuned LLM. Whenever a mark token is encountered, ToolGen invokes the autocompletion tool to suggest code completions and selects the most appropriate one through constrained greedy search. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate ToolGen ’s effectiveness in repository-level code generation across three distinct code LLMs: CodeGPT, CodeT5, and CodeLlama. To facilitate this evaluation, we create a benchmark comprising 671 real-world code repositories and introduce two new dependency-based metrics: Dependency Coverage and Static Validity Rate . The results demonstrate that ToolGen significantly improves Dependency Coverage by 31.4% to 39.1% and Static Validity Rate by 44.9% to 57.7% across the three LLMs, while maintaining competitive or improved performance in widely recognized similarity metrics such as BLEU-4, CodeBLEU, Edit Similarity, and Exact Match. On the CoderEval dataset, ToolGen achieves improvements of 40.0% and 25.0% in test pass rate (Pass@1) for CodeT5 and CodeLlama, respectively, while maintaining the same pass rate for CodeGPT. ToolGen also demonstrates high efficiency in repository-level code generation, with latency ranging from 0.63 to 2.34 seconds for generating each function. Furthermore, our generalizability evaluation confirms ToolGen ’s consistent performance when applied to diverse code LLMs, encompassing various model architectures and scales.},

Similar to traditional software engineering, effective test case generation methods are needed by industry to enhance the quality and robustness of these DL components. To this end, we propose a novel automatic software testing technique, Fuzz-testing via T ransferable A dversarial E xamples ( TAEFuzz ), which aims to automatically assess and enhance the robustness of image-based DL systems based on test cases generated by transferable adversarial examples. TAEFuzz alleviates the over-fitting problem during optimized test case generation and prevents test cases from prematurely falling into local optima. In addition, TAEFuzz enhances the visual quality of test cases through constraining perturbations inserted into sensitive areas of the images. For a system with low robustness, TAEFuzz trains a low-cost denoising module to reduce the impact of perturbations in transferable adversarial examples on the system. Experimental results demonstrate that the test cases generated by TAEFuzz can discover up to 46.1% more errors in the targeted systems and ensure the visual quality of test cases. Compared to existing techniques, TAEFuzz also enhances the robustness of the target systems against transferable adversarial examples with the perturbation denoising module.},

  abstract     = {Design of cyber-physical systems (CPS) typically involves dataflow modeling. The structure of dataflow models differs from the traditional software, making standard coverage metrics not appropriate for measuring the thoroughness of testing. To address this limitation, this article proposes signal feature coverage as a new coverage metric for systematically testing CPS dataflow models. We derive signal feature coverage by leveraging signal features. We developed a testing framework in Simulink, a popular dataflow modeling and simulation environment, that automates the generation and execution of test cases based on the defined coverage metric. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach by carrying out experiments on five Simulink models tested against ten Signal Temporal Logic specifications. We compared our coverage-based testing approach to adaptive random testing, falsification testing, output diversity-based approaches, and testing using MathWorks’ Simulink Design Verifier. The results demonstrate that our coverage-based testing approach outperforms the conventional techniques regarding fault detection capability.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computing (QC) promises polynomial and exponential speedups in many domains, such as unstructured search and prime number factoring. However, quantum programs yield probabilistic outputs from exponentially growing distributions and are vulnerable to quantum-specific faults. Existing quantum software testing (QST) approaches treat quantum superpositions as classical distributions. This leads to two major limitations when applied to quantum programs: (1) an exponentially growing sample space distribution and (2) failing to detect quantum-specific faults such as phase flips. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a QST approach, which applies a reduction algorithm to a quantum program specification. The reduced specification alleviates the limitations (1) by enabling faster sampling through quantum parallelism and (2) by performing projective measurements in the mixed Hadamard basis. Our evaluation of 143 quantum programs across four categories demonstrates significant improvements in test runtimes and fault detection with our reduction approach. Average test runtimes improved from 169.9 s to 11.8 s, with notable enhancements in programs with large circuit depths (383.1 s to 33.4 s) and large program specifications (464.8 s to 7.7 s). Furthermore, our approach increases mutation scores from \(54.5\%\) to \(74.7\%\) , effectively detecting phase flip faults that non-reduced specifications miss. These results underline our approach's importance to improve QST efficiency and effectiveness.},

In this work, we present our Phylogenetics-aware SBSE approach. Our approach introduces a novel Phylogenetic Operation to promote results which are sufficiently aligned (in terms of lineage) with a certain reference given by the domain expert. Our approach is evaluated in two heterogeneous industrial case studies: Procedural Content Generation from Game Software Engineering, and Feature Location from Software Maintenance. The results are analyzed using quality-of-the-solution and acceptance-by-developers measurements. We performed a statistical analysis to determine whether the impact on the results is significant compared to baselines that do not leverage Phylogenetics. The results show that our approach significantly outperforms two baselines in both case studies. Furthermore, two focus groups confirmed the acceptance of our approach and stressed that solution acceptance may make the difference in industrial environments.

  abstract     = {Automated Program Repair (APR) has garnered significant attention due to its potential to streamline the bug repair process for human developers. Recently, LLM-based APR methods have shown promise in repairing real-world bugs. However, existing APR methods often utilize patches generated by LLMs without further optimization, resulting in reduced effectiveness due to the lack of program-specific knowledge. Furthermore, the evaluations of these APR methods have typically been conducted under the assumption of perfect fault localization, which may not accurately reflect their real-world effectiveness. To address these limitations, this article introduces an innovative APR approach called G iant R epair . Our approach leverages the insight that LLM-generated patches, although not necessarily correct, offer valuable guidance for the patch generation process. Based on this insight, G iant R epair first constructs patch skeletons from LLM-generated patches to confine the patch space, and then generates high-quality patches tailored to specific programs through context-aware patch generation by instantiating the skeletons. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we conduct two large-scale experiments. The results demonstrate that G iant R epair not only effectively repairs more bugs (an average of 27.78% on Defects4J v1.2 and 23.40% on Defects4J v2.0) than using LLM-generated patches directly, but also outperforms state-of-the-art APR methods by repairing at least 42 and 7 more bugs under perfect and automated fault localization scenarios, respectively.},

While prior research has largely concentrated on predicting change-prone files and classes—an approach less favored by practitioners—this article shifts focus to predicting highly change-prone methods, aligning with the preferences of both practitioners and researchers. We analyzed 774,051 source code methods from 49 prominent open source Java projects. Our findings reveal that approximately 80% of changes are concentrated in just 20% of the methods, demonstrating the Pareto 80/20 principle. Moreover, this subset of methods is responsible for the majority of the identified bugs in these projects. After establishing their critical role in mitigating software maintenance costs, our study shows that machine learning models can effectively identify these highly change-prone methods from their inception. Additionally, we conducted a thorough manual analysis to uncover common patterns (or concepts) among the more difficult-to-predict methods.

Despite the profound influence of LLMs, to the best of our knowledge, these challenges have not been thoroughly investigated in previous empirical studies.

  abstract     = {Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operators, mostly based on mathematical linear computations, are of vital importance to developing CNN-based software. Existing studies reveal that these operators are prone to floating-point precision problems (FPPs). In a CNN-based application, such problems can be propagated and result in catastrophic consequences. Thus, it is highly desired to detect and repair the FPPs in CNN operators. Considering the FPPs in CNN operators are mainly caused by accumulated floating-point errors and diverse floating-point tensors instead of wrong codes or bad implementations, it requires much time cost and is difficult to tackle these FPPs. In this article, we propose the first method for the automated detection and repair of FPPs in CNN operators from the perspective of floating-point tensors. To generate diverse tensors with floating-point numbers, we design two levels of mutation rules, namely computation-level mutation and input-level mutation, containing a total of five mutation methods. To detect the FPPs caused by the accumulated floating-point errors, our method uses a weight matrix to guide the progressive mutation. To repair the detected FPPs, our method transforms the error-prone floating-point tensors based on the mathematical rewriting of the floating-point linear computational properties without destroying the original computation. Experimental results show that our methods can detect and repair FPPs in CNN operators effectively and efficiently and could reduce 93.32% to 100% of the FPPs in CNN operators. We conduct a case study on six different widely used CNN models and confirm that the proposed FPP method is generalizable and effective across a variety of tasks and architectures. Our detection and repair method offers an intuitive way to handle FPPs during development, allowing users to continue building and fine-tuning their models without being slowed down by numerical precision errors. We believe that our method could open up a new way to enhance the quality of CNN operators and CNN-based software.},

  abstract     = {Given the increasing adoption of modern AI-enabled control systems, ensuring their safety and reliability has become a critical task in software testing. One prevalent approach to testing control systems is falsification, which aims to find an input signal that causes the control system to violate a formal safety specification using optimization algorithms. However, applying falsification to AI-enabled control systems poses two significant challenges: (1) it requires the system to execute numerous candidate test inputs, which can be time-consuming, particularly for systems with AI models that have many parameters, and (2) multiple safety requirements are typically defined as a conjunctive specification, which is difficult for existing falsification approaches to comprehensively cover. This article introduces Synthify , a falsification framework tailored for AI-enabled control systems, i.e., control systems equipped with AI controllers. Our approach performs falsification in a two-phase process. At the start, Synthify synthesizes a program that implements one or a few linear controllers to serve as a proxy for the AI controller. This proxy program mimics the AI controller’s functionality but is computationally more efficient. Then, Synthify employs the \(\epsilon\) -greedy strategy to sample a promising sub-specification from the conjunctive safety specification. It then uses a Simulated Annealing-based falsification algorithm to find violations of the sampled sub-specification for the control system. To evaluate Synthify , we compare it to PSY-TaLiRo , a state-of-the-art and industrial-strength falsification tool, on eight publicly available control systems. On average, Synthify achieves a 83.5% higher success rate in falsification compared to PSY-TaLiRo with the same budget of falsification trials. Additionally, our method is 12.8 \(\times\) faster in finding a single safety violation than the baseline. The safety violations found by Synthify are also more diverse than those found by PSY-TaLiRo , covering 137.7% more sub-specifications.},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their ability to perform tasks in the field of code generation. However, there is still a gap between LLMs being capable coders and being top-tier software engineers. The most recent trend is using LLM-based agents to iterate the code generation process. Based on the observation that top-level software engineers often ask clarifying questions to reduce Ambiguity in both requirements and coding solutions, we argue that the same should be applied to LLMs for code generation tasks. For this purpose, we define the communication skills of LLMs as “being able to ask clarifying questions when the description of the code generation problem has issues.” In this study, we restrict these issues to three matters from the software requirement engineering field: inconsistent requirements, ambiguous requirements, and incomplete requirements. By asking probing questions about the requirements of problem descriptions before generating the final code, the challenges of programming with LLMs such as unclear intent specification may be alleviated, resulting to a correct code in the initial iterations. In this work, we conducted an empirical study on the benchmark and analysis of the communication skills of LLMs for code generation. We created a new benchmark, HumanEvalComm, by modifying problem descriptions according to three issues mentioned above, Inconsistency , Ambiguity , and Incompleteness . We then experimented on HumanEvalComm with different Code LLMs, and a new LLM agent approach, Code Clarification and Generation Agent (Okanagan), to identify and ask questions in ambiguous parts from code and descriptions for further refining the generated code. In the evaluation, we introduced an LLM-based evaluator and created Communication Rate and Good Question Rate as the evaluation metrics to represent the ratio of questions asked and questions with good quality in responses. We found that more than 60% of responses from Code LLMs still generate code rather than ask questions when the problem descriptions are manually modified according to different clarification categories. The Pass@1 and Test Pass Rate of most Code LLMs drop by 35% — 52% and by 17% — 35%, respectively, with statistical significance in each category for over 75% numbers. Okanagan, as an LLM agent approach that uses LLM such as ChatGPT 3.5, effectively increases the Communication Rate and Good Question Rate by an absolute 58% and 38%, respectively. Thus, Okanagan boosts Pass@1 and Test Pass Rate by an absolute 8% and 7%, respectively, when the problem descriptions are modified based on given clarification categories. This result indicates the potential for achieving more effective communication capability using LLM agent.

While test selection methods alleviate manual labor by labeling and evaluating only a subset of data while meeting testing criteria, we observe that such methods with reported promising results are simply evaluated, e.g., testing on original test data. The question arises: are they always reliable? In this article, we explore when and to what extent test selection methods fail. First, we identify potential pitfalls of 11 selection methods based on their construction. Second, we conduct a study to empirically confirm the existence of these pitfalls. Furthermore, we demonstrate how pitfalls can break the reliability of these methods. Concretely, methods for fault detection suffer from data that are: (1) correctly classified but uncertain or (2) misclassified but confident. Remarkably, the test relative coverage achieved by such methods drops by up to 86.85%. Besides, methods for performance estimation are sensitive to the choice of intermediate-layer output. The effectiveness of such methods can be even worse than random selection when using an inappropriate layer.},

  abstract     = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive In-Context Learning (ICL) ability in code generation. LLMs take a prompt context consisting of a few demonstration examples and a new requirement as input, and output new programs without any parameter update. Existing studies have found that the performance of ICL-based code generation heavily depends on the quality of demonstration examples and thus arises research on selecting demonstration examples: given a new requirement, a few demonstration examples are selected from a candidate pool, where LLMs are expected to learn the pattern hidden in these selected demonstration examples. Existing approaches are mostly based on heuristics or randomly selecting examples. However, the distribution of randomly selected examples usually varies greatly, making the performance of LLMs less robust. The heuristics retrieve examples by only considering textual similarities of requirements, leading to sub-optimal performance. To fill this gap, we propose a L arge language model- A ware selection approach for I n-context- L earning-based code generation named LAIL. LAIL uses LLMs themselves to select examples. It requires LLMs themselves to label a candidate example as a positive example or a negative example for a requirement. Positive examples are helpful for LLMs to generate correct programs, while negative examples are trivial and should be ignored. Based on the labeled positive and negative data, LAIL trains a model-aware retriever to learn the preference of LLMs and select demonstration examples that LLMs need. During the inference, given a new requirement, LAIL uses the trained retriever to select a few examples and feed them into LLMs to generate desired programs. We apply LAIL to four widely used LLMs and evaluate it on five code generation datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LAIL outperforms the State-of-the-Art (SOTA) baselines by 11.58%, 3.33%, and 5.07% on CodeGen-Multi-16B, 1.32%, 2.29%, and 1.20% on CodeLlama-34B, and achieves 4.38%, 2.85%, and 2.74% improvements on Text-davinci-003 in terms of Pass@1 at MBJP, MBPP, and MBCPP, respectively. In addition to function-level code generation, LAIL improves the performance of LLMs on DevEval, a repository-level code generation dataset, which achieves 10.04%, 8.12%, and 4.63% improvements compared to the SOTA baselines at Pass@1, 3, and 5 on CodeLlama-7B. Human evaluation further verifies that the generated programs of LAIL are superior in correctness, code quality, and maintainability. Besides, LAIL has satisfactory transferability across different LLMs and datasets, where the retriever learned on one LLM (dataset) can be transferred to other LLMs (datasets).},

  abstract     = {Malware family labels and key features used for the decision-making of Android malware detection models fall short of precise comprehension of malicious behaviors due to their coarse granularity. To solve these problems, in this article, we first introduce the concept of the malicious behavior trajectory ( MBT ) and propose an innovative approach called ProMal . ProMal aims to automatically generate malware descriptions with fine granularity through extracted MBTs from malware for users. Specifically, a labeled dataset of MBTs is constructed through substantial human efforts to build a behavioral knowledge graph ( BxKG ). The BxKG is scalable and can be automatically updated using two strategies to ensure its completeness and timeliness: (1) taking into consideration the evolution of Android SDKs and (2) mining new MBTs by leveraging the widely-used malware datasets. We highlight that the knowledge graph is essential in ProMal , which can reason new MBTs based on existing MBTs because of its structured data representation and semantic relation modeling, and thus helps effectively extract real MBTs in Android malware. We evaluated ProMal on a recent malware dataset where researcher-crafted malware descriptions are available, and the Precision, Recall, and F1-Score of MBT identification based on BxKG reached 96.97%, 91.43%, and 0.94, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. Taking MBTs identified from Android malware as inputs, precise, fine-grained, and human-readable descriptions can be generated using the large language model, whose readability and usability are verified through a user study. The generated descriptions play a significant role in interpreting and comprehending malware behaviors.},

  abstract     = {Automated program repair (APR) has recently gained ground, with numerous research efforts being conducted in the area that have been adopted in the industry. One notable class of APR is neural program repair (NPR), which typically employs deep learning techniques that are trained on vast amounts of historical data to fix bugs that have not been seen in the past. To study the true effectiveness of NPR on existing limited datasets, recent work augments the evaluation data by employing semantics-preserving transformations to convert original buggy programs to semantically equivalent ones. Experiments show that NPR techniques are not robust; e.g., NPR cannot repair semantically equivalent counterparts of 20%–35% of bugs that they can repair in the original dataset. However, we found that many of these transformations are unnatural, that are unlikely to occur in real-world scenarios, leading to misleading conclusions about NPR effectiveness and misguide the improvement on unrobust behaviors, which have minimal real-world impact. In this article, we propose shifting the focus of robustness evaluation for NPR techniques towards naturally occurring data transformations. To accomplish this, we first examine the naturalness of semantic-preserving transformations through a two-stage human study. This study includes: (i) interviews with senior software developers to establish concrete criteria for evaluating the naturalness of these transformations and (ii) a survey involving 10 developers to assess the naturalness of 1,178 transformations, i.e., pairs of original and transformed programs, applied to 225 real-world bugs. Our findings show that only 60% of these transformations are considered natural, while 20% are considered unnatural, with strong agreement among the annotators. Moreover, the unnaturalness of these transformations significantly impacts both their applicability to benchmarks and the conclusions drawn from robustness testing. Next, we conduct natural robustness tests on NPR techniques to assess their true effectiveness against real-world data variations. Our experimental results reveal a substantial number of prediction changes in NPR techniques, leading to significant reductions in both plausible and correct patch rates when comparing performance on the original and transformed datasets. Furthermore, we observe notable differences in performance improvements between NPR techniques, suggesting potential biases in the evaluation of NPR introduced by limited datasets. Finally, we explore automating the assessment of transformation naturalness by developing a new naturalness metric, namely RNC, using large language models. This metric effectively evaluates naturalness with an AUC of 0.7, offering a promising direction for automating the naturalness assessment of code transformations.},

  abstract     = {Vulnerability disclosure is critical for ensuring the security and reliability of open source software (OSS). However, in practice, many vulnerabilities are reported and discussed on public platforms before being formally disclosed, posing significant risks to vulnerability management. Inadequate vulnerability disclosure can expose users to security threats and severely impact the stability and reliability of software systems. For example, prior work shows that over 21% of CVEs are publicly discussed before a patch is released. Despite its importance, we still lack clarity on the vulnerability disclosure practices adopted by open source communities and the preferences of practitioners regarding vulnerability management. To fill this gap, we analyzed the vulnerability disclosure practices of 8,073 OSS projects spanning from 2017 to 2023. We then conducted an empirical study by surveying practitioners about their preferences and recommendations in vulnerability disclosure management. Finally, we compared the survey results with the actual vulnerability practice observed within the OSS projects. Our results show that while over 80% of practitioners support Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD), only 55% of vulnerabilities conform to CVD in practice. Although only 20% of practitioners advocate discussions before disclosure, 42% of vulnerabilities are discussed in issue reports before their disclosure. This study reveals the vulnerability management practices in OSS, provides valuable guidance to OSS owners, and highlights potential directions to improve the security of OSS platforms.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL) models have proven to be highly successful and are now essential to our everyday routines. However, DL models, like traditional software, inevitably contain bugs that affect their performance in real-world scenarios. Effective software engineering techniques are necessary to ensure their dependability. In recent years, fault localization methods for DL models have gained significant attention as a valuable tool for improving the reliability of DL models. Owing to the data-driven programming paradigm, traditional fault localization techniques are challenging to apply directly to DL programs. Previous studies have shown that neuron errors within models can lead to abnormal behavior, and they fix the DL model errors from the perspective of neurons. Nonetheless, there remains a significant gap between the DL program statement and model errors. To tackle this problem, this article proposes a novel fault localization method for DL models, named weiGhted sUspIciousness anD balancEd aggRegation ( GUIDER ) that revisits the idea and challenge of spectrum-based fault localization in the context of DL models. For pre-trained DL models, GUIDER utilizes neuron coverage information and test case confidence to compute weighted neuron suspiciousness values and employs balanced aggregation methods to elevate these values from the neuron level to the layer level, which establishes a bridge between the DL model and the DL program, facilitating the developers’ debugging process. We evaluate GUIDER using 161 real model bugs collected from StackOverflow and five state-of-the-art fault localization methods for DL models as baselines. The results indicate that (a) our method successfully localizes 67% of the model bugs by ranking the buggy layer to the first place (i.e., top-1), significantly outperforming all five baselines, and (b) our method maintains an acceptable time overhead compared with all baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Code generation aims to automatically generate code snippets of specific programming language according to natural language descriptions. The continuous advancements in deep learning, particularly pre-trained models, have empowered the code generation task to achieve remarkable performance. One main challenge of pre-trained models for code generation is the semantic gap between developers’ natural language requirements and source code. To address the issue, prior studies typically adopt a retrieval-augmented framework for the task, where the similar code snippets collected by a retrieval process can be leveraged to help understand the requirements and provide guidance for the generation process. In a retrieval-augmented framework, similar data can be retrieved from the database using a retrieval algorithm, and original input data can be fused with retrieved data by different fusion strategies. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the application of this framework for code generation, including the impact of the final generated results and the specific usage of the framework. In this article, we choose three popular pre-trained code models, namely CodeGen, UniXcoder, and CodeT5, to assess the impact of the quality and utilization of retrieved code on the retrieval-augmented framework. Our analysis shows that the retrieval-augmented framework is beneficial for improving the performance of the existing pre-trained models. We also provide suggestions on the utilization of the retrieval-augmented code generation framework: BM25 and Sequential Integration Fusion are recommended due to their convenience and superior performance. Sketch Filling Fusion, which extracts a sketch of relevant code, could help the model improve its performance further. Additionally, we conduct experiments to investigate the influence of the retrieval-augmented framework on large language models for code generation, showing the effectiveness of the framework, and we discuss the tradeoff between performance improvement and computational costs in each phase within the framework.},

  abstract     = {Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a prominent application of smart contracts, representing a novel financial paradigm in contrast to centralized finance. While DeFi applications are rapidly emerging on mainstream blockchain platforms, their quality varies greatly, presenting numerous challenges, particularly in terms of their governance mechanisms. In this article, we present a comprehensive study of governance issues in DeFi applications. Initially, we collected 3,165 academic papers and numerous industry reports. After thorough screening, we selected 44 academic papers and 11 industry reports for detailed analysis. Drawing upon insights from industry reports and academic research articles, we develop a taxonomy to categorize these governance issues. We collect and build a dataset of 4,446 audit reports from 17 Web3 security companies, categorizing their governance issues according to our constructed taxonomy. We conducted a thorough analysis of governance issues and identified vulnerabilities in the governance design and implementation, e.g., voting sybil attack and proposal front-running. Our statistical analysis indicates that a significant portion (35.48%) of governance-related issues is classified as severe. Within these, ownership-related problems constitute the largest share (65.38%). Despite DeFi governance being essential for the long-term success of DeFi projects, our data shows that both auditors and development teams have not fully grasped its significance. Based on audit reports, we also analyzed common vulnerabilities and issues in the governance domain. Our research identifies two primary categories of DeFi governance issues: technology-centric and human-centric. Technology-centric issues can be addressed through technology updates and iterations, whereas human-centric issues are influenced not only by the development team’s technical skills but also by their understanding of DeFi governance. Data analysis reveals that design and implementation issues are frequently overlooked; although not directly associated with vulnerabilities, these issues can impact the equitable distribution of project benefits. Furthermore, our analysis of 104 projects’ tokenomics configurations, including 15 collected from DeFi platforms, uncovered 27 inconsistent configurations, with only two projects exhibiting no issues. This suggests that such issues are relatively common. We therefore advise project teams to ensure consistency between their tokenomics design and the actual code. Our study culminates in providing several key practical implications for various DeFi stakeholders, including developers, users, researchers, and regulators, aiming to deepen the understanding of DeFi governance issues and contribute to the robust growth of DeFi systems.},

What are the challenges in detecting and addressing them? This article takes the first step toward answering these questions by conducting a comprehensive study of FPGA synthesis tool bugs. We analyze 551 confirmed bugs in both commercial and open-source FPGA synthesis tools, i.e., Vivado, Quartus Prime, and Yosys, covering root causes, symptoms, bug-prone components, fix characteristics, and achieve 17 valuable findings. We find that, on average, around 46.2% of bugs result from Hardware Description Language (HDL) standard non-compliance across the three tools. However, it is hard for current formal validations to fully test HDL standards compliance. Additionally, on average, over 25.8% bugs show domain-specific optimization traits due to inappropriate optimization and mapping. Meanwhile, beyond 28% of bugs trigger unexpected behavior without clear signs, making the formulation of effective test oracles challenging. These findings help addressing FPGA synthesis tool bugs and guide further research.},

Hence, in this article, we conducted the first large-scale empirical study to characterize the evolution of smart contracts in Ethereum. For evolution identification, we presented a contract similarity-based search algorithm, digEvolution, and evaluated its effectiveness with five different search strategies. Then we applied this algorithm to 80,152 on-chain contracts we collected from Ethereum, to dig out the evolution among these contracts. We then explored three research questions. We first studied whether the evolution of smart contracts is common (RQ1), then we studied how do the Gas consumption (RQ2) and the vulnerability (RQ3) of smart contracts vary during the evolution. Our research results show that the evolution of smart contracts is not very common. There are some contract components that have vulnerability but still be called by users. The Gas consumption of most smart contracts doesn’t vary during the evolution, contract is Gas-efficient before and after the evolution. The vulnerability of most smart contracts doesn’t vary during the evolution, both are secure before and after the evolution.},

  abstract     = {Unit testing validates the correctness of the units of the software system under test and serves as the cornerstone in improving software quality and reliability. To reduce manual efforts in writing unit tests, some techniques have been proposed to generate test assertions automatically, including Deep Learning (DL)-based, retrieval-based, and integration-based ones. Among them, recent integration-based approaches inherit from both DL-based and retrieval-based approaches and are considered state-of-the-art. Despite being promising, such integration-based approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as retrieving assertions with lexical matching while ignoring meaningful code semantics and generating assertions with a limited training corpus. In this article, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Deep Assertion Generation (RetriGen) approach based on a hybrid assertion retriever and a Pre-Trained Language Model (PLM)-based assertion generator. Given a focal-test, RetriGen first builds a hybrid assertion retriever to search for the most relevant test–assert pair from external codebases. The retrieval process takes both lexical similarity and semantical similarity into account via a token-based and an embedding-based retriever, respectively. RetriGen then treats assertion generation as a sequence-to-sequence task and designs a PLM-based assertion generator to predict a correct assertion with historical test–assert pairs and the retrieved external assertion. Although our concept is general and can be adapted to various off-the-shelf encoder–decoder PLMs, we implement RetriGen to facilitate assertion generation based on the recent CodeT5 model. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate RetriGen against six state-of-the-art approaches across two large-scale datasets and two metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that RetriGen achieves 57.66% and 73.24% in terms of accuracy and CodeBLEU, outperforming all baselines with an average improvement of 50.66% and 14.14%, respectively. Furthermore, RetriGen generates 1,598 and 1,818 unique correct assertions that all baselines fail to produce, 3.71X and 4.58X more than the most recent approach EditAS . We also demonstrate that adopting other PLMs can provide substantial advancement, e.g., four additionally utilized PLMs outperform EditAS by 7.91%–12.70% accuracy improvement, indicating the generalizability of RetriGen. Overall, our study highlights the promising future of fine-tuning off-the-shelf PLMs to generate accurate assertions by incorporating external knowledge sources.},

As fully fine-tuning all parameters of PTMs can be computationally expensive, a potential solution is parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which freezes PTMs while introducing extra parameters. Although PEFT methods have been applied to SE tasks, researchers often focus on specific scenarios and lack a comprehensive comparison of PTMs from different aspects such as field, size, and architecture. To fill this gap, we have conducted an empirical study on six PEFT methods, eight PTMs, and four SE tasks. The experimental results reveal several noteworthy findings. For example, model architecture has little impact on PTM performance when using PEFT methods. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive discussion of PEFT methods from three perspectives. First, we analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of PEFT methods. Second, we explore the impact of the scaling factor hyperparameter. Finally, we investigate the application of PEFT methods on the latest open source large language model, Llama 3.2. These findings provide valuable insights to guide future researchers in effectively applying PEFT methods to SE tasks.},

  abstract     = {Changing software is essential to add needed functionality and to fix problems, but changes may introduce defects that lead to outages. This motivates one of the oldest software quality control techniques: a temporary prevention of non-critical changes to the codebase—code freeze. Despite its widespread use in practice, research literature is scant. Historically, code freezes were used as a way to improve software quality by preventing changes during periods before software releases, but code freezes significantly slow down development. To address this shortcoming, we develop and evaluate a family of code un-freeze (permitting changes) strategies tailored to different occasions and products at Meta. They are designed to un-freeze the maximum amount of code without compromising quality. The three primary dimensions to un-freeze involve (a) the exact timing of (and the reasoning behind it) the code freezes, (b) the parts of the organization or the codebase where the codebase freeze is applied to, and (c) the method of screening of the code diffs during the code freeze with the aim to allow low risk diffs and prevent only the most risky diffs. To operationalize the drivers of outages, we consider the entire network of interdependencies among different parts of the source code, the engineers that modify the code, code complexity, and the coordination dependencies and authors’ expertise. Since the code freeze is a balancing act between reducing outages and allowing software development to proceed unimpeded, the performance of the various approaches to code un-freeze is evaluated based on the fraction of flagged/gated changes to measure overhead and the fraction of all outage-causing changes contained within the set of flagged set of changes to measure the ability of the code un-freeze to delay (or prevent) outages. We found that taking into account the risk posed by modifying individual files and the properties of the change we could un-freeze 2 and 2.5 times more changes correspondingly. The change level model is used by Meta in production. For example, during the winter 2023 code freeze, we see that only 16% of changes are gated. Although 42% more changes landed (were integrated into the codebase) compared to the prior year, there was a 52% decrease in outages. This reduction meant less impact on users and less strain on engineers during the holiday period. The risk model has been enormously effective at allowing low-risk changes to proceed while gating high-risk changes and reducing outages.},

  abstract     = {Code generation models based on the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm have been increasingly attempted by both academia and industry, resulting in well-known industrial models such as Codex, CodeGen, and PanGu-Coder. After being pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of code, a model is further fine-tuned with datasets specifically for the target downstream task, e.g., generating code from natural language description. The target code being generated can be classified into two types: a standalone function, i.e., a function that invokes or accesses only built-in functions and standard libraries, and a non-standalone function, i.e., a function that invokes or accesses user-defined functions or third-party libraries. To effectively generate code especially non-standalone functions (largely ignored by existing work), in this article, we present Wenwang, an approach to improving the capability of a pre-trained model on generating code beyond standalone functions. Wenwang consists of two components: a fine-tuning dataset named WenwangData and a fine-tuned model named WenwangCoder. Compared with existing fine-tuning datasets, WenwangData additionally covers non-standalone functions. Besides the docstring and code snippet for a function, WenwangData also includes its contextual information collected via program analysis. Based on PanGu-Coder, we produce WenwangCoder by fine-tuning PanGu-Coder on WenwangData with our context-aware fine-tuning technique so that the contextual information can be fully leveraged during code generation. On CoderEval and HumanEval, WenwangCoder outperforms three state-of-the-art models with similar parameter sizes (at the scale of around 300 M), namely CodeGen, PanGu-Coder, and PanGu-FT. Although WenwangCoder does not outperform ChatGPT on HumanEval, WenwangCoder with smaller model parameter sizes can achieve similar effects to ChatGPT on CoderEval. Our experimental results also shed light on a number of promising optimization directions based on existing pre-trained models.},

  abstract     = {Testing Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) is critical for validating their safety in operational environments. High-fidelity simulators enable the testing of ADS through virtual driving scenarios, especially those that are hazardous to replicate in real-world settings. However, existing testing approaches suffer from inadequate coverage of real-world traffic situations due to over-simplified modeling of vehicle movements (e.g., insufficient diversity in driving styles), resulting in undetected critical ADS failures. In this article, we propose a testing framework to discover diverse failures of ADS in driving scenarios that embody real-world traffic complexity. The framework leverages advanced traffic simulation methods to encode vehicle movements and generates realistic yet safety-critical driving scenarios for ADS by mutating vehicle movements. To efficiently explore driving scenarios that pose different challenges for ADS and expose diverse ADS failures, this framework further leverages a dynamic prioritization mechanism that prioritizes vehicle movements likely to trigger unique ADS behaviors. Specifically, we propose a method to estimate the possibility based on encoded vehicle movements. We implement this framework and evaluate it with three representative ADS from the famous CARLA Leaderboard. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach discovers more unique failures of ADS than existing testing frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring data privacy is a major challenge for software developers, especially in chatbots, where balancing privacy protection with response quality is key, given the need for conversation-driven development and data protection regulations. This research identifies privacy requirements and techniques for chatbot development through a literature review, privacy policy analysis, and a practitioner survey. The methodology includes a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), an adapted Gray Literature Review (GLR), privacy requirement formulation, and validation via a survey. Based on the SLR and GLR, eight privacy requirements are proposed, covering personal information protection, user authentication, access control, secure communication, database safety, user rights empowerment, decentralized storage, and reliable infrastructure. Survey results highlight foundational measures like secure communication and scalable infrastructures as priorities, while advanced measures such as decentralized storage or privacy rights implementation scored lower due to complexity and cost. Practitioners also stressed clarity and verifiability, citing gaps in definitions, examples, and validation criteria as challenges to adoption.},
