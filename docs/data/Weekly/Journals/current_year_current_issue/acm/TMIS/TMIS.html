  abstract     = {Knowledge graphs have revolutionized the organization and retrieval of real-world knowledge, prompting interest in automatic natural language processing approaches for extracting medical knowledge from texts. However, the availability of high-quality Chinese medical knowledge remains limited, posing challenges for constructing Chinese medical knowledge graphs. As large language models like ChatGPT show promise in zero-shot learning for many natural language processing downstream tasks, their potential on constructing Chinese medical knowledge graphs remains uncertain. In this study, we create a Chinese medical knowledge graph by manually annotating textual data and using ChatGPT to automatically generate the graph. We refine the results using filtering and mapping rules to align with our schema. The manually generated graph serves as the ground truth for evaluation, and we explore different methods to enhance its accuracy through knowledge graph completion techniques. As a result, we emphasize the potential of employing ChatGPT for automated knowledge graph construction within the Chinese medical domain. While ChatGPT successfully identifies a larger number of entities, further enhancements are required to improve its performance in extracting more qualified relations.},

Despite their potential, existing LLMs face challenges in dealing with complex polypharmacy scenarios and often grapple with data lag issues. To address these limitations, we introduce an LLM-based Chinese medication guidance system, called ShennongMGS, specifically tailored for robust medication guidance and adverse drug reaction predictions. Our system transforms multi-source heterogeneous medication information into a knowledge graph and employs a two-stage training strategy to construct a specialized LLM (ShennongGPT). This method enables the simulation of professional pharmacists’ decision-making processes and incorporates the capability for knowledge self-updating, thereby significantly enhancing drug safety and the overall quality of medical services. Rigorously evaluated by medical professionals and artificial intelligence experts, our method demonstrates superiority, outperforming existing general and specialized LLMs in performance.},

In particular, the use of deep learning methods for depression detection from textual content posted on social media has garnered considerable attention. Conversely, there has been relatively limited evaluation of depression detection in clinical environments involving text generated from remote interviews. In this research, we review state-of-the-art feature-based ML, deep learning, and large language models for depression detection. We use a multidimensional analysis framework to benchmark various language models on a novel testbed comprising speech-to-text transcriptions of remote interviews. Our framework considers the impact of different transcription types and interview segments on depression detection performance. Finally, we summarize the key trends and takeaways from the review and benchmark evaluation and provide suggestions to guide the design of future detection methods.},

  abstract     = {The surge in interest and application of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a drive to fine-tune these models to suit specific applications, such as finance and medical science. However, concerns regarding data privacy have emerged, especially when multiple stakeholders aim to collaboratively enhance LLMs using sensitive data. In this scenario, federated learning becomes a natural choice, allowing decentralized fine-tuning without exposing raw data to central servers. Motivated by this, we investigate how data privacy can be ensured in LLM fine-tuning through practical federated learning approaches, enabling secure contributions from multiple parties to enhance LLMs. Yet, challenges arise: (1) despite avoiding raw data exposure, there is a risk of inferring sensitive information from model outputs, and (2) federated learning for LLMs incurs notable communication overhead. To address these challenges, this article introduces DP-LoRA, a novel federated learning algorithm tailored for LLMs. DP-LoRA preserves data privacy by employing a Gaussian mechanism that adds noise in weight updates, maintaining individual data privacy while facilitating collaborative model training. Moreover, DP-LoRA optimizes communication efficiency via low-rank adaptation, minimizing the transmission of updated weights during distributed training. The experimental results across medical, financial, and general datasets using various LLMs demonstrate that DP-LoRA effectively ensures strict privacy constraints while minimizing communication overhead.},

  abstract     = {Occupation-specific job tasks (OSTs) refer to the duties, responsibilities, and activities associated with a particular occupation, which define the core functions and performance expectations for those engaged in that profession. Efficient recognition and extraction of OSTs from large-scale job description data are essential for establishing a continually updated occupational information system (OIS), such as O*NET, which serves as critical tools for advancing research in work and labor markets. However, this task presents substantial challenges due to its heavy reliance on domain experts for the labor-intensive annotation of job postings, rendering the process time-consuming and difficult to scale for large-scale implementation. To this end, in this article, we present COTR , a novel data-driven framework designed for the efficient recognition of OSTs from job postings, capable of continually identifying new tasks through class-incremental learning. Specifically, we first employ large language models (LLMs) and prompt learning to develop a three-phase process–“expansion, translation, and generation”–that addresses the critical challenge of the absence of predefined OSTs in non-English labor market data, leveraging O*NET as a foundational reference. Subsequently, we introduce a BERT-based model for OST recognition, incorporating a uniquely designed pair-wise loss function that distills valuable insights from ChatGPT or other LLMs, thereby substantially enhancing recognition performance. In addition, to achieve cost-effective training data annotation, we develop an LLM-based coarse-to-fine candidate OSTs generation algorithm, integrating contrastive active learning to optimize the annotation process through human-machine collaboration. Notably, we design a supervised fine-tuning strategy with a novel encoding technique to optimize LLMs, improving the recall rate of the generated candidate OSTs and achieving up to a 343-fold increase in annotation efficiency compared to traditional manual expert annotation in our experiments. Afterward, we propose an efficient class-incremental learning method that incorporates an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection module for identifying potential novel OSTs and a fine-tuning module to extend the model’s recognition capabilities to include newly discovered tasks. Finally, we construct two real-world datasets using job posting data collected from the labor markets of China and the United States, respectively. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, along with two publicly available datasets, have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed COTR. Furthermore, several case studies showcase the significant benefits of COTR for various downstream applications in labor market analysis, including analyzing the evolving demand for OSTs, assessing the value of OSTs, and recognizing the relationships between OSTs and associated skills.},

However, various challenges arise in effectively analyzing self-reported career records. Inspired by recent advancements in neural networks and embedding models, we develop a novel career path clustering approach and apply it to uncover information technology (IT) career path patterns. Specifically, we construct employment profiles of over 60,000 IT professionals, and form their career path sequences by chaining the job records in each profile. Then we simultaneously learn cluster-wise job embeddings and construct career path clusters. The resultant cluster-wise likelihoods of career paths can quantify their soft bonding with different clusters, and the job embeddings can reveal connections among job titles within each cluster. With both real and simulated data, we conduct extensive experiments with our framework to establish the modeling performance and great improvement over the traditional optimal matching analysis methods. The empirical results from analyzing real data on career paths show that our approach can discover distinct IT career path patterns and reveal valuable insights.},

Indeed, traditional ability assessment involves multiple staffing processes with various forms of evaluation methods, such as written tests and face-to-face interviews, which usually result in fragmented, noisy, and inconsistent conclusions. Therefore, a long-standing challenge in talent recruitment is how to comprehensively evaluate candidates by integrating multi-source heterogeneous assessment results. To this end, in this article, we propose a holistic framework, JCD-TR ( J oint C ognitive D iagnosis for T alent R ecruitment), for enhancing the performance of ability assessment in talent recruitment by jointly modeling the multi-source heterogeneous assessment results. Specifically, we first construct a skill graph based on the co-occurrence relations of skills in multi-source recruitment data. Along this line, we can learn the skill representations that maintain both the semantic and structural information with graph embedding. Then, we design a multi-source candidate ability profiling module with the guidance of item response theory in psychometrics and the neural topic model. As a result, the candidates’ ability profiles can be explored from their resumes, written tests, and interview assessment data, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a joint cognitive diagnosis module by integrating those multi-view ability profiles and skill representations to assess the candidates’ skill proficiency state. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our JCD-TR.},
