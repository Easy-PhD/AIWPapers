  abstract     = {Traditionally, medicine has focused on treating disease after symptoms become apparent. Similarly, in patients with chronic diseases, treatment is usually updated in response to breakthrough symptoms or exacerbations. The rare exception to this approach is diabetes, for which continuous glucose monitors provide real-time information about the patient’s physiological state, allowing for rapid intervention. In a Review, Donnelly et al . discuss other diseases that may be amenable to continuous monitoring, such as cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders, and the technologies being developed to achieve this approach, such as monitoring of key protein concentrations. Depending on the state of clinical science for specific medical conditions, monitoring may be used to tailor lifestyle modifications, optimize clinical treatment, or advance research into the pathogenesis of various disease types. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Continuous biomarker monitoring is revolutionizing chronic disease management, with glucose monitoring for diabetes as the primary example. Given the success of this approach, a transition to continuous protein monitoring (CPM, a real-time, implantable or wearable technology) could similarly advance precision medicine. In this work, we review state-of-the-art CPM platforms and their prospective clinical impact across both chronic disorders—metabolic, cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative—and acute crises, such as sepsis and transplant dysfunction. We also highlight remaining barriers to widespread adoption, including sensor stability, robust machine learning models for live interpretation, and responsible data handling for patient privacy. With continued engineering and clinical validation, emerging biosensor technologies could transform disease management, facilitating earlier interventions and individualizing treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes.},

Zik et al . developed dual-transposon sequencing, a high-throughput method to systematically uncover genetic interactions. This approach uses the Cre-lox system to fuse two DNA barcodes identifying random transposon insertions within a single cell. Sequencing these recombined barcodes enabled parallel fitness assessment of millions of double mutants. Applied to Streptococcus pneumoniae , this revealed functions for previously uncharacterized genes across diverse biological pathways. This method offers a powerful tool to explore the vast genetic “dark matter” in microorganisms. —Di Jiang Gene redundancy complicates systematic characterization of gene function as single-gene deletions may not produce discernible phenotypes. We report dual transposon sequencing (dual Tn-seq), a platform for assaying the fitness of a comprehensive double mutant pool in parallel. Dual Tn-seq couples random barcode transposon site sequencing with the Cre- lox system, enabling deep sampling of 73% of the 1.3 million possible double gene deletions in Streptococcus pneumoniae . The genetic interactions identified span a wide range of biochemical processes, revealing new factors in presumably well-studied pathways, exemplified by a cytidine triphosphate synthase PyrJ. Moreover, this approach should permit further investigation of growth condition–specific genetic interactions. Because dual Tn-seq does not require the construction of a large array of single mutants, it should be readily adaptable to various microorganisms.},

  abstract     = {In eukaryotic cells, transcription and RNA splicing are tightly linked, but how these processes are coordinated remains unclear. Shao et al . found that the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal domain was not required for recruiting splicing factors during co-transcriptional splicing. Instead, the Pol II subunit RPB9 directly interacted with the splicing factor U2AF1, whereas U2AF2 operated independently. There is thus a dynamic “U2AF cycle” that separates splicing into two phases: an early Pol II–dependent phase and a later Pol II–independent phase. These findings reshape our understanding of how splicing is regulated during transcription, with implications for gene expression and disease mechanisms. —Di Jiang Distinguishing functional splice sites from abundant cryptic sites in precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) represents a fundamental challenge in decoding mammalian genomes. We demonstrate that the specific RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit RPB9 directly interacts with the 3′ AG dinucleotide binding factor U2AF1 to initiate 3′ splice site recognition. Combined with recent structural insights into Pol II–mediated 5′ splice site selection, these findings support a cotranscriptional mechanism to recognize paired 3′ and 5′ splice sites across individual exons. These initial exon definition events facilitate the recruitment of U2AF2 to heterodimerize with U2AF1, which also triggers U2AF1 release from elongating Pol II. Collectively, these results reveal dynamic U2AF cycling that partitions Pol II subunit–facilitated splice site recognition and subsequent Pol II–independent spliceosome assembly steps during cotranscriptional splicing.},

Hülse and Ridgwell report model results showing how high rates of organic carbon burial caused by elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, climate-sensitive phosphorous mineral weathering, and phosphate regeneration from marine sediments can turn warming events into ice ages. The juxtaposition of these conditions might help to explain the origins of past “snowball” climates such as those seen in the Neoproterozoic. —Jesse Smith Negative feedback between climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), mediated by the weathering of silicate minerals on land, is thought to provide the primary regulation of Earth’s climate on geological timescales. By contrast, we found that faster feedbacks involving organic matter are not only critical to Earth system recovery but can also create unexpected instability. Our Earth system model experiments show how sedimentary organic carbon burial, amplified by redox-sensitive phosphorus regeneration, can outweigh silicate weathering and paradoxically drive climate overcooling in response to massive CO 2 release. This instability depends on the initial balance between silicate weathering and organic carbon burial in addition to the state of global phosphorus cycling. It is most strongly expressed at intermediate ocean redox states, which may help us understand the timing of past ice ages.},

  abstract     = {Like leafcutter ants, fungus-farming termites ( Odontotermes obesus ) form a symbiotic relationship with a fungus ( Termitomyces ) that serves as a stable food source. An unknown feature of this relationship is how the termites prevent the nutritional “combs” they produce from being overtaken by other fungi such as filamentous Pseudoxylaria , which have been observed to overtake combs when termites are experimentally removed. Panchal et al . observed termites removing Pseudoxylaria and covering them with soil boluses, and fully encasing Pseudoxylaria successfully prevented its infection of combs (see the Perspective by Goes and Adams). Further experiments showed that soil boluses are effective because of the fungistatic properties of bacteria associated with the termites, which the termites selectively apply to the “weedy,” but not the crop, fungus. —Bianca Lopez The symbiotic agriculture of fungus-farming termites can collapse if they fail to prevent invading weeds. Previous studies suggest a role for symbiotic fungistatic microbes in bringing about weed control. However, how termites employ these microbes to suppress fungal weeds without affecting the fungal cultivar remains unknown. We show that the fungus-farming termite Odontotermes obesus uses specific behaviors to remove, isolate, and suppress the growth of the fungal weed Pseudoxylaria , primarily by encasing it with soil boluses containing fungistatic microbes. These behaviors efficiently suppress the weed without affecting the crop. This integration of specific behaviors with termite-derived microbes appears to be the proximate mechanism of how microbes are topically used by termites to confine the weed while keeping the crop unaffected.},

  abstract     = {For earthquake warnings, each second counts toward characterizing a fault’s rupture. Ruptures from large earthquakes, particularly those offshore, may have varying speed profiles that can only be resolved by dense arrays. In 2022, Atterholt et al . deployed a distributed acoustic sensing array along a 15-kilometer-long coastal telecommunications fiber with channels every 5 meters (see the Perspective by Brodsky and Ruiz). The array provided a second-by-second recording of the 2024 moment magnitude 7 earthquake offshore of Mendocino, California. Beam-forming analysis of P-wave arrivals showed that 8 seconds after the earthquake, the rupture slowed when it encountered the Mendocino Triple Junction and then jumped to supershear velocity before moving onshore. —Angela Hessler Fault structure and rupture physics are deeply intertwined, and observations of this coupling are critical for understanding earthquake behavior. Rupture propagation is observable at fine scales using dense seismic networks. Fiber-optic sensing allows for long-term deployments of ultradense arrays that enable high-resolution measurements of infrequent, large earthquakes. We recorded the 2024 moment magnitude ( M w ) 7 Mendocino Fault earthquake with a nearby fiber-optic array and imaged its behavior with seismic beamforming. The rupture propagated to the east at subshear velocity; stagnated near the Mendocino Triple Junction, a zone of structural complexity; and subsequently transitioned to supershear velocity. The correlation between source physics and structure shows how lithospheric heterogeneity affects first-order characteristics of earthquake ruptures. Our results also demonstrate the potential for fiber-optic sensing to improve real-time estimation of key parameters for early warning.},

  abstract     = {In some model organisms, starvation is known to induce epigenetic changes that extend the life span of progeny of the hungry parent. Zhang et al . investigated the mechanism of these effects in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans (see the Perspective by Bohnert). Their studies implicated an enzyme, lysosomal lipase-like 4 (LIPL-4), in the process. From there, the authors pieced together parts of a pathway in which increased activity of LIPL-4 activated signaling in intestinal lysosomes led to increased transcription and production of a variant of histone H3.3. Protein-tagging experiments indicated that the histone could be transferred to the germline, where it was modified by a methyltransferase and transmitted to progeny, thus extending their life span. —L. Bryan Ray The epigenome is sensitive to metabolic inputs and is crucial for aging. Lysosomes act as a signaling hub to sense metabolic cues and regulate longevity. We found that lysosomal metabolic pathways signal through the epigenome to regulate transgenerational longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans . Activation of lysosomal lipid signaling and lysosomal adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) or reduction of lysosomal mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling increased the expression of a histone H3.3 variant and increased its methylation on K79, leading to life-span extension across multiple generations. This transgenerational prolongevity effect required intestine-to-germline transportation of histone H3.3 and a germline-specific H3K79 methyltransferase and was recapitulated by overexpressing H3.3 or the H3K79 methyltransferase. Thus, signals from a lysosome affect the epigenome and link the soma and germ line to mediate transgenerational inheritance of longevity.},

SRO in metals has been linked to properties of mechanical deformation, and in ceramics has been linked to properties related to diffusion. In semiconductors, the concept of SRO has only rarely been studied beyond theoretical predictions linking SRO to important changes in electronic band structure. Using energy-filtered electron microscopy and complementary simulations, Vogl et al . confirmed the presence of SRO in a germanium-silicon-tin semiconductor and identified the actual atomic structure of the SRO motifs. Their work explores an exciting area for understanding and controlling SRO in semiconductors. —Yury Suleymanov Chemical short-range ordering is expected to be a key factor for tuning the electronic structure of semiconductors. However, experimental evidence of short-range ordering is still lacking due to the challenge of characterizing atomic-scale ordering motifs. Here, we determined the presence of short-range order in a ternary GeSiSn semiconductor system using advanced energy-filtered four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy and large-scale atomistic models generated by a machine learning neuroevolution potential of first-principles accuracy. This approach revealed preferred ordering of different atomic species with the dominant occurrence of Si–Ge–Sn triplets.

They found that camouflage was more beneficial when it was rarely used by prey and in low-light environments, whereas warning coloration was less beneficial in high-predation environments, where competition between predators may motivate them to sample aposematic insects. This comparative analysis helps to explain the distribution and evolution of antipredator coloration. —Bianca Lopez Natural selection has repeatedly led to the evolution of two alternative antipredator color strategies—camouflage to avoid detection and aposematism to advertise unprofitability—but we lack understanding of how ecological context favors one strategy over the other. We conducted a globally replicated predation experiment at 21 sites on six continents to test how predator community, prey community, and visual environment influenced the predation risk of 15,018 artificial paper “moth” prey with cryptic or warning coloration. Results indicated that aposematic strategies fare better in environments with low predation intensity, whereas camouflage strategies are advantaged when other camouflaged prey species are rare and when light levels are low.

  abstract     = {Understanding the properties of a system requires making measurements of a variable and then using that information to piece together a detailed understanding. As the system becomes more complex, the number of required measurements increases exponentially, placing fundamental limits on obtaining that information using classical means. Liu et al . demonstrated a quantum learning advantage in an optical system using entangled photons as probes to reduce the sampling complexity of the process by more than 11 orders of magnitude compared with classical probes. This result highlights a route to quantum enhanced learning protocols for machine learning and developing quantum technologies. — Ian S. Osborne Recent advances in quantum technologies have demonstrated that quantum systems can outperform classical ones in specific tasks, a concept known as quantum advantage. Although previous efforts have focused on computational speedups, a definitive and provable quantum advantage that is unattainable by any classical system has remained elusive. In this work, we demonstrate a provable photonic quantum advantage by implementing a quantum-enhanced protocol for learning a high-dimensional physical process. Using imperfect Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen entanglement, we achieve a sample complexity reduction of 11.8 orders of magnitude compared to classical methods without entanglement. These results show that large-scale, provable quantum advantage is achievable with current photonic technology and represent a key step toward practical quantum-enhanced learning protocols in quantum metrology and machine learning.},

  abstract     = {It is now well known that there were at one time many Homo lineages. Understanding of the differences among these lineages is largely dependent upon crania that are rare and often damaged and deformed by age. Feng et al . reconstructed the 1-million-year-old Yunxian 2 cranium using an approach that allowed for removal of much of the compression and distortion naturally present in the fossil. In doing so, they found that the cranium contained both primitive and derived traits and concluded that it is representative of the H. longi clade, which is sister to H. sapiens and likely contained the Denisovans. —Sacha Vignieri Diverse forms of Homo coexisted during the Middle Pleistocene. Whether these fossil humans represent different species or clades is debated. The ~1-million-year-old Yunxian 2 fossil from China is important for understanding the cladogenesis of Homo and the origin of Homo sapiens . In this study, we restored and reconstructed the distorted Yunxian 2 cranium using recently introduced technology. The results show that this cranium displays mosaic primitive and derived features. Morphometric and phylogenetic analyses suggest that it is an early member of the Asian H. longi clade, which includes the Denisovans and is the main part of the sister group to the H. sapiens clade. Both the H. sapiens and H. longi clades have deep roots extending beyond the Middle Pleistocene and probably experienced rapid early diversification. Yunxian 2 may preserve transitional features close to the origins of the two clades.},

  abstract     = {Many species are declining, with lack of adequate habitat being a primary driver. Providing habitats in human-dominated landscapes is essential for maintaining populations and supporting ecosystem functions such as pollination, but habitat protection targets in such landscapes are poorly defined. Bishop et al . developed a framework to assess habitat needs based on the threshold at which populations respond more to increased habitat quality than quantity. They used a meta-analysis to define habitat quantity thresholds, using floral resources as a proxy for habitat quality, for insect pollinators (bumble bees, solitary bees, butterflies, and hoverflies) in agricultural landscapes. Hoverflies had a much lower threshold because of low habitat quality, and this framework could be adapted to guide targets for other taxa. —Bianca Lopez Biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes is declining, but evidence-based conservation targets to guide international policies for such landscapes are lacking. We present a framework for informing habitat conservation policies based on the enhancement of habitat quantity and quality and define thresholds of habitat quantity at which it becomes effective to also prioritize habitat quality. We applied this framework to insect pollinators, an important part of agroecosystem biodiversity, by synthesizing 59 studies from 19 countries. Given low habitat quality, hoverflies had the lowest threshold at 6% semi-natural habitat cover, followed by solitary bees (16%), bumble bees (18%), and butterflies (37%). These figures represent minimum habitat thresholds in agricultural landscapes, but when habitat quantity is restricted, marked increases in quality are required to reach similar outcomes.},
