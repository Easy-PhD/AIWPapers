Lee et al . examined genome motion across length scales from the size of small genes (five kilobases) to whole chromosomes (75,000 kilobases) with high spatial and temporal resolution using Transposon Assisted Chromatin Kinetic Imaging Technology (TRACK-IT), an improved live-cell imaging method. The authors found that the genomic sequences within the same “kinetic domain” came together rapidly (less than 1 minute on average), whereas sequences in distinct kinetic domains took much longer (minutes to hours). The rapid search with kinetic domains is dependent upon the motor protein cohesin, which can pull together distal points faster than diffusion. —Di Jiang Genome function requires regulated genome motion. However, tools to directly observe this motion in vivo have been limited in coverage and resolution. Here we introduce an approach to tile mammalian chromosomes with self-mapping fluorescent labels and track them at ultraresolution. We find that sequences separated by submegabase distances transition to proximity in tens of seconds. This rapid search is dependent on cohesin and is exhibited only within domains. Domain borders act as kinetic impediments to this search process, rather than structural boundaries. The genomic separation–dependent scaling of the search time for cis interactions violated predictions of diffusion, suggesting motor-driven folding. We also uncover cohesin-dependent processive motion at 2.7 kilobases per second. Together, these multiscale dynamics reveal the organization of the genome into kinetically associated domains.},

O’Dwyer et al . used data collected from the Wind River Forest Dynamics Plot to test whether genetic information could improve population fluctuation predictions beyond ecological data alone. Indeed, using genetic data collected only once to calculate effective population size helped to improve their models over multiple species. Although genetic data can be expensive to collect, the fact that doing so only once improved predictions across several years demonstrates a potential benefit for such efforts in the future. —Corinne Simonti Species population sizes fluctuate over time, and these temporal dynamics play a key role in governing the maintenance of biodiversity. Although modeling approaches have been developed to characterize fluctuations in species abundances, the data required to parameterize these models from scratch are substantial. Here we introduce a new approach to modeling population fluctuations on decadal timescales by relating community-level dynamics to population-level patterns encoded in plant genomes. Using genomic samples taken at a single time point to generate contemporary effective population size estimates in a temperate montane forest, we accurately predict fluctuations across three censuses. Our approach facilitates the use of genomic demography to parameterize multispecies community models in ecology and shows that population genomic data can provide accurate predictions for ecological dynamics.},

Despite high genetic diversity, the species shows stable but considerable continental population structure. Although one population showed little differentiation over a century and 4000 kilometers, nearby, we found two genetically distinct ecotypes. Vector control has resulted in strong signals of selection, with some resistance alleles shared across populations through gene flow and others arising independently. Fortunately, we found that a promising gene drive target in Anopheles gambiae is highly conserved in An. funestus .

  abstract     = {Genes are often controlled by enhancers located far away in the genome, but how their positioning affects gene activation is unclear. Eder et al . investigated how the position of the Sox2 gene influences activation by its enhancer. By systematically relocating reporter genes around the Sox2 locus, the authors found that Sox2 sits in an optimal “sweet spot” for activation and also restricts its enhancer’s reach. Removing Sox2 broadened and boosted enhancer-driven activation. This means that genes can act as gatekeepers, limiting their enhancers’ influence. Understanding these rules helps to explain gene regulation and may inform future genetic engineering or gene therapy strategies. —Di Jiang Genes are often activated by enhancers located at large genomic distances, and the importance of this positioning is poorly understood. By relocating promoter-reporter constructs into thousands of alternative positions within a single locus, we dissected the positional relationship between the mouse Sox2 gene and its distal enhancer. This revealed an intricate, sharply confined activation landscape in which the native Sox2 gene occupies an optimal position for its activation. Deletion of the gene relaxes this confinement and broadly increases reporter activity. The confining effect of the Sox2 gene is partially conferred by its ~1-kilobase coding region. Our local relocation approach provides high-resolution functional maps of a genomic locus and reveals that a gene can strongly constrain the realm of influence of its enhancer.},

Lavine Monovalent (lithium, sodium, potassium) and multivalent (magnesium, calcium, aluminum) metal anodes are promising alternatives to graphite anodes for overcoming the performance limitations of lithium-ion batteries. In this Review, we compare and contrast their electrochemical behaviors in nonaqueous electrolytes by discussing their common challenges of irregular metal deposition and unstable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs), as well as their differences, which are due to dissimilar surface energies and cation charge densities. General design strategies for electrode, electrolyte, and interphase are proposed to enable horizontally deposited metals with preferred crystallographic orientations and stable SEIs with distinct chemical compositions yet similar structural homogeneity. Finally, we assess the specific advantages and unresolved challenges of each system, providing cross-disciplinary insights to advance high-energy and low-cost metal-anode batteries for next-generation energy storage.},

Seismic monitoring of these changes has been limited to shallow depths, leaving an incomplete picture of the response-recovery cycles of fault zones. To look deeper into this, Bryan et al . applied optimal transport to receiver functions at broadband seismic stations for several years before and after the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes in California (see the Perspective by Rodriguez Padilla). After the events, seismic waves slowed throughout the crustal column, a sign of both shallow and deep damage. Recovery at shallow depths occurred within months, whereas deep damage persisted for at least several years after rupture. —Angela Hessler Earthquakes abruptly release tectonic stress that builds slowly over time through the coupled evolution of faults and the surrounding crust. Seismic wavespeeds track crustal deformation and stress changes, but typical monitoring methods are most sensitive to shallow depths. Using receiver functions, we tracked rupture-zone wavespeed and anisotropy changes throughout the crust during the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence. Shallow coseismic wavespeed reductions recovered within months, whereas a deeper postseismic wavespeed drop persisted without measurable recovery over several years. The deep, persistent wavespeed drop likely reflects accumulating damage driven by postseismic deformation, suggesting two possible scenarios: (i) a slow interseismic recovery where wavespeed and anisotropy track long-term stress evolution; or (ii) permanent deformation of an immature fault zone. Both scenarios affect the dynamics and energy budget of the seismic cycle.},

One of these regions includes a putative regulatory element for STC1 —a kidney-expressed gene involved in metabolism and the response to dehydration. We show that STC1 is induced by antidiuretic hormone in human cells, is associated with urea levels in the Turkana themselves, and is under strong and recent selection in this population as well as a second East African population, the Daasanach. This work highlights how integrating anthropological and genomic approaches can lead to a new understanding of human physiology with biomedical relevance.},

  abstract     = {An enduring challenge in organic chemistry is the selective synthesis of Z olefins, carbon-carbon double bonds with the largest substituents on each carbon oriented on the same side of the bond axis. Verardi et al . report a method that electrochemically replaces carbon-hydrogen bonds on olefins with sulfonium groups. Surprisingly, one of the groups then underwent elimination in a Z-selective manner. The other group could then be replaced with a versatile range of substituents that preserve the Z geometry. —Jake S. Yeston The stereoselective functionalization of C–H bonds represents a central challenge in modern organic synthesis. Despite decades of innovation in C–H activation chemistry, methods for Z -selective functionalization of alkenes have eluded synthetic practitioners. Terminal alkenes present the biggest challenge for Z -selectivity as they require selective cleavage of the more hindered of two otherwise virtually identical C–H bonds. Herein, we describe the transformation of alkenes into transient 1,2- bis -sulfonium intermediates found to undergo Z -selective elimination, overturning a textbook E2 stereoselectivity rule through stabilizing interactions. We identify paired electrolysis as an enabling strategy to both selectively generate the requisite bis -sulfonium intermediate and drive its rapid elimination in situ. The resultant Z -alkenyl sulfonium linchpins provide access to a wide array of Z -alkene targets from inexpensive feedstocks through robust cross-coupling reactions.},

  abstract     = {The maturity of experimental studies of nuclear magnetic resonance and the sophistication with which nuclear spins can be manipulated provided the first demonstration of a quantum computer platform. However, progress stalled early on when it was realized that scaling up was problematic. Stemp et al . now demonstrate direct entanglement between two nuclear spins that are separated by a relatively long distance. Two phosphorus atoms implanted in silicon formed a system comprising two 31 P nuclei and two bound electrons. Control of the exchange interaction between the two electrons resulted in quantum entanglement of the two nuclear spins. The results and scalability of the method are promising for the development of nuclear spin–based quantum computers. —Ian S. Osborne The use of nuclear spins for quantum computation is limited by the difficulty in creating genuine quantum entanglement between distant nuclei. Current demonstrations of nuclear entanglement in semiconductors rely on coupling the nuclei to a common electron, which is not a scalable strategy. In this work, we demonstrated a two-qubit controlled-Z logic operation between the nuclei of two phosphorus atoms in a silicon device, separated by up to 20 nanometers. Each atom binds separate electrons, whose exchange interaction mediates the nuclear two-qubit gate. We prepared and measured a nuclear Bell state with a fidelity of 76 − 5 + 5 % and a concurrence of 0.67 − 0.05 + 0.05 . With this method, future progress in scaling up semiconductor spin qubits can be extended to the development of nuclear spin–based quantum computers.},

  abstract     = {Rangelands provide livelihoods for billions of people but are being increasingly degraded. Overgrazing is often cited as a cause of this degradation, but the relative effects of grazing and climate change are poorly understood. Purevjav et al . designed a quasiexperimental study to disentangle the effects of climate and herd size on rangeland primary productivity in Mongolia, where livelihoods depend on rangelands and more than half of these rangelands are considered degraded. Although herd size had a negative effect on productivity, weather effects were much larger, particularly at decadal scales over which herders can adapt to changing conditions. These results suggest that policies limiting herd sizes may affect people without preventing rangeland degradation and support the need to curb climate change to protect ecosystems and livelihoods. —Bianca Lopez Rangelands are Earth’s dominant land type, supporting the livelihoods of more than 2 billion people. Concerns about rangeland degradation typically focus on overgrazing. But climate change may be a greater culprit. Using spatially disaggregated, nationwide data from Mongolia, from 1984 to 2024, we exploited seasonal variation in grazing locations to quasi-experimentally estimate the causal effects of livestock herd size, weather, and climate change on rangeland primary productivity. At interannual frequency, herd size modestly but significantly negatively affects primary productivity, with notable variation across ecological zones. The effects of weather fluctuations are, however, an order of magnitude larger. At the decadal scale, over which herders can adapt to climate change, herd size effects disappear, and temperature effects dominate. In Mongolia, climate change seems to drive most long-term change in rangeland primary productivity.},

In this case, knowledge of position was relaxed, resulting in a sharpening of the velocity distribution function. These results should allow quantum mechanical effects to be explored further in macroscopic systems and may find applications in advanced quantum sensing technologies. —Ian S. Osborne Manipulating the motion of macroscopic objects near their quantum mechanical uncertainties has been desired in diverse fields, including fundamental physics, sensing, and transducers. Despite progress in ground-state cooling of a levitated solid particle, realizing its nonclassical states has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate quantum squeezing of the motion of a single nanoparticle by rapidly varying its oscillation frequency. We reveal appreciable narrowing of the velocity variance to –4.9 ± 0.1 decibels of that of the ground state using free-expansion measurements. Our work shows that a levitated nanoparticle offers an ideal platform for studying nonclassical states of its motion and provides a route to developing applications in quantum sensing and exploring quantum mechanics at a macroscopic scale.},

How much and when that rain falls has major implications for the environment, agriculture, water supply, and river flow. Hill et al . found that although the well-documented effect of El Niño events is to decrease summer rainfall, it also paradoxically intensifies extreme daily precipitation amounts, thereby resulting in hazardous conditions across the region. The processes that create this intensification may be important in other tropical locations as well. —Jesse Smith Extreme rainfall during the Indian summer monsoon can be destructive and deadly to the world’s third-largest economy and most populous country. Although El Niño events in the equatorial Pacific are known to suppress total summer rainfall throughout India, we show using observational data spanning 1901 to 2020 that, counterintuitively, they simultaneously intensify extreme daily rainfall. This is partly driven by increases in extreme daily values of convective buoyancy, provided that both the undilute instability of near-surface air and the dilution by mixing with drier air above are considered. El Niño could plausibly drive similar changes in other tropical regions, and our framework could be further applied to changes in hourly extremes, to other internal variability modes, and to forced trends under climate change.},

Overlapping these data with the distribution of marine habitats and their vulnerabilities to stressors provides estimates of total impacts on ecosystems. Cumulative impacts are expected to double by midcentury, including in countries and coastal areas where people depend heavily on marine resources. Ocean warming and fisheries are two of the largest impacts, suggesting that curbing climate change and sustainable fisheries management could relieve stress on marine ecosystems. —Bianca Lopez Pressures from human activities are expected to increase substantially, affecting marine ecosystems globally. To plan for a sustainable future, we need to forecast the distributions of cumulative effects from multiple pressures. Here, we mapped (at 10-kilometer resolution) the future cumulative impacts of 10 climate, land-based, fishing, and other pressures on 20 marine habitats under two climate scenarios at mid-century (around 2050). We found that cumulative impacts are projected to increase 2.2 to 2.6 times globally, with coastal habitats facing higher impacts but offshore regions facing faster increases, especially in equatorial regions. Furthermore, many countries dependent on marine resources will have large increases in impacts. Incorporating these results into strategic policy and management will support more sustainable use and protection of marine ecosystems and the services they provide.},

Thus, the birds both understand the categories of their calls and create mental representations of their meaning, similar to what humans do. —Sacha Vignieri Vocal communication in social animals involves the production and perception of various calls that ethologists categorize into call types based on their acoustical structure and behavioral context. Whether these categories indicate distinct meanings for the animals remains unknown. The zebra finch, a gregarious songbird, uses ~11 call types that are known to communicate hunger, danger, or social conflict and to establish social contact and bonding. Using auditory discrimination tasks, we show that the birds both discriminate and categorize all the call types in their vocal repertoire. In addition, systematic errors were more frequent between call types used in similar behavioral contexts than could be expected from their acoustic similarity.
