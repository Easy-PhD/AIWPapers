  abstract     = {Mutant RAS drives the growth of various cancers, and mutant-selective drugs are approved or under development for clinical use. Sealover et al. identified differential and complementary engagement of downstream MAPK and PI3K pathways among mutant and wild-type RAS members that demanded a combined approach to effectively stunt tumor development. In KRAS-mutant cells, for example, inhibition of PI3K, which was activated by wild-type HRAS and NRAS more than by mutant KRAS, was synergistically cytotoxic with a KRAS-mutant–specific inhibitor. The findings reveal the critical contribution of wild-type RAS family members in cancer cells with mutant RAS and the need for therapeutic approaches that simultaneously target both. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Mutated RAS proteins activate downstream effector pathways (RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT) to drive oncogenic transformation and progression. Because RAS family members differentially engage these pathways, combined inhibition of both pathways is required to effectively treat RAS -mutated cancers. Here, we found that this was due to signaling contributed by wild-type RAS family members that activated an effector pathway that was poorly engaged by the mutant RAS family member. Wild-type KRAS and NRAS promoted RAF-MEK-ERK signaling in cells expressing mutant HRAS, whereas wild-type HRAS and NRAS promoted PI3K-AKT signaling in cells expressing mutant KRAS. Combining inhibitors targeting the poorly engaged RAS effector pathways with inhibitors targeting the mutant RAS resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity in a manner that depended on wild-type RAS expression. The farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib blocked mutant HRAS-PI3K signaling and synergized with MEK inhibitors in HRAS -mutated cells, whereas KRAS G12C inhibitors blocked mutant KRAS-MEK signaling and synergized with PI3K inhibitors in KRAS G12C -mutated cells. Synergy was abolished in MEFs lacking all RAS proteins and in cancer cell lines in which nonmutated RAS family members were deleted. Our data highlight the critical role of wild-type RAS family members in supporting mutant RAS signaling and its importance as a therapeutic cotarget in RAS -mutated cancers.},

  abstract     = {Natural killer (NK) cells have antitumor activity that is primed by IL-15 and IL-18, components of a cytokine cocktail used in NK cell–based cancer immunotherapy. Fallone et al. found that IL-15 and IL-18 synergized to activate the complex mTORC1, which resulted in increased proliferation and function of both mouse and human NK cells. IL-15 and IL-18 stimulated mTORC1 activity through distinct pathways not previously implicated in its regulation. The combination of IL-15 and IL-18 improved the survival of mice engrafted with tumor cells, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of NK cell–based cancer immunotherapy. —Wei Wong The multiprotein complex mTORC1 is essential for the increase in protein synthesis and bioenergetic metabolism that supports the proliferation of many cell types, including natural killer (NK) cells, which are important innate effectors of the antitumoral response. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of mTORC1 activation in NK cells by interleukin-15 (IL-15) and IL-18, which promote NK cell function and are components of a cytokine cocktail used to preactivate NK cells for cancer immunotherapy. Through genetic and pharmacological approaches, we showed that IL-15 activated mTORC1 through the PI3K/Akt/ERK pathway, whereas IL-18 signaled through the p38 effectors MK2 and MK3 in both murine and human primary NK cells. Both pathways synergized to promote NK cell proliferation and effector functions in an mTORC1-dependent manner. Moreover, both pathways operated independently of the inhibitor TSC and the activator Rheb, revealing a noncanonical mode of mTORC1 activation by cytokines. Treating mice with IL-15 and IL-18 in combination led to increased NK cell numbers and improved antitumoral activity, suggesting that this cytokine combination could be exploited to enhance NK cell potential in therapeutic settings.},
