  abstract     = {Mutations in the protein KRAS drive the growth of various cancers; thus, the gene expression programs induced by KRAS signaling are of particular interest for biomarker and drug development. Although oncogenic KRAS activates multiple transcription factors through the kinase ERK, Hibshman et al. found that MYC drove much of the mutant KRAS-dependent gene expression in pancreatic cancer (PDAC). MYC was critical for the proliferation of multiple KRAS-mutant PDAC cell lines, regulated several kinases, and induced a cell survival response through the small GTPase RHO. Because MYC itself is not yet druggable, the findings may inform new therapeutic strategies for PDAC. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Of the thousands of genes and substrates identified in KRAS-mutant signaling networks in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), more than 200 are transcription factors, implying extensive and complex transcriptional regulation. However, we observed that genetic suppression of the transcription factor MYC alone was sufficient to phenocopy the effect of KRAS suppression in signaling, growth, and metabolic processes in PDAC cells. We determined the gene transcription changes caused by acute suppression of MYC function in KRAS -mutant PDAC cell lines and performed dependency map and pathway analyses on the affected gene sets. The expression of 1685 genes was increased upon suppression of MYC, and this gene set may comprise the bulk of the MYC-regulated genes essential for PDAC growth. In contrast, the 1325 genes whose expression was inhibited may comprise a compensatory response to oncogenic stress, mediated in part by the GTPase RHO. MYC-dependent transcriptional activity was largely ERK dependent, and almost one-third of ERK-regulated genes were also regulated by MYC in PDAC cells. Furthermore, chemical proteomic profiling revealed MYC-regulated protein kinases that can be targeted therapeutically. Together, these data provide a molecular portrait of MYC-dependent signaling that encompasses potentially exploitable mechanisms for treating PDAC.},

  abstract     = {The activity of the voltage-gated K + channel Kv1.3 in neurons and immune cells must be restrained to avoid pathological effects. Estadella et al. found shared molecular mechanisms between two stimuli that induce endocytosis and therefore decrease the activity of Kv1.3. In response to either a signal critical for neuronal differentiation or an immunosuppressive stimulus, two clusters of lysine residues in Kv1.3 became ubiquitinated, triggering internalization and degradation. In human T cells, blocking the ubiquitination or endocytosis of Kv1.3 increased its abundance at the immune synapse and consequently Kv1.3 currents. These results suggest a degradation mechanism common to distinct endocytosis-inducing stimuli that keeps Kv1.3 activity in check. —Wei Wong The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 contributes to action potential conduction in sensory neurons and to sustained increases in cytoplasmic Ca 2+ that activate immune cells. Here, we found that two distinct endocytosis-inducing stimuli acted through the same residues in Kv1.3 to control surface abundance and activity of the channel. Upon stimulation of the growth factor receptor EGFR, which stimulates Tyr-directed kinases and is important in neuronal differentiation, or of the Ser/Thr kinase PKC, which participates in the down-regulation of inflammatory responses, Kv1.3 underwent ubiquitination-dependent endocytosis that routed channel proteins to lysosomes for degradation. We mapped two lysine clusters in the N and C termini of Kv1.3, both of which became ubiquitinated upon activation of either Tyr or Ser/Thr kinases and whose combined mutation had an additive effect in reducing ubiquitination and endocytosis. Manipulations that prevented the ubiquitination or decreased the endocytosis of Kv1.3 resulted in increased Kv1.3 abundance at the immunological synapse and activity in primary human T cells. Prolonged channel accumulation at this location would be expected to increase Kv1.3-dependent leukocyte activation and lead to chronic inflammatory pathologies. Thus, ubiquitination fine-tunes cell biology by inducing the endocytosis and turnover of Kv1.3 in response to biological stimuli and insults.},
