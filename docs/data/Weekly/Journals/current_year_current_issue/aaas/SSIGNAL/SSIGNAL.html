  abstract     = {Although T helper 17 (T H 17) cells protect against infection, they can adopt a pathogenic state that drives autoimmunity. Papadopoulou et al . found that oxidative phosphorylation promoted the nonpathogenic T H 17 cell state in mice and depended on the activation of the kinase AMPK by the adenosine receptor A 2A R. AMPK reduced the abundance of the histone acetyltransferase PCAF, leading to reduced expression of genes involved in aerobic glycolysis and an increase in the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Disrupting this pathway enabled T H 17 cells to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice. —Annalisa M. VanHook Metabolic reprogramming controls protective and pathogenic T helper 17 (T H 17) cell responses. When naïve T cells are differentiated into T H 17 cells in vitro, the presence of the cytokine activin A promotes their maturation into a nonpathogenic state. Here, we found that nonpathogenic T H 17 cells induced by activin A displayed reduced aerobic glycolysis and increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In response to activin A, signaling through the adenosine A 2A receptor (A 2A R) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) enhanced OXPHOS and reprogrammed pathogenic T H 17 cells toward nonpathogenic states that did not induce central nervous system autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. In pathogenic T H 17 cells, the transcriptional coactivator p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) increased acetylation at histone 3 Lys 9 (H3K9ac) of genes involved in aerobic glycolysis and T H 17 pathogenic programs. In contrast, in nonpathogenic activin A–treated T H 17 cells, AMPK signaling suppressed PCAF-mediated H3K9ac modification of genes involved in aerobic metabolism and enhanced H3K9ac modification of genes involved in OXPHOS and nonpathogenic T H 17 programs. Together, our findings uncover A 2A R-AMPK signaling as a central metabolic checkpoint that suppresses T H 17 cell pathogenicity.},

  abstract     = {So-called inhibitory coreceptors on T cells are targeted by checkpoint inhibitors to enhance antitumor immunity. Alamir et al. used a tumor cell–derived spheroid system to investigate the role of the coregulatory receptor TIM3 on murine and human cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). Imaging and functional studies showed that in the relatively immunosuppressive three-dimensional environment of spheroids, TIM3 inhibited CTL responses, whereas in two-dimensional systems, it played a costimulatory role. These findings suggest that TIM3 amplifies either inhibitory or stimulatory signals in T cells in a context-dependent manner, which could help inform the development of therapies that target it. —John F. Foley TIM3 is a coregulatory receptor that is highly abundant on multiple immune cell types, including T cells in response to prolonged exposure to antigen, and it marks functionally suppressed cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the tumor microenvironment. TIM3 exhibits inhibitory function in vivo but paradoxically has costimulatory T cell signaling capability in vitro. Here, we found that TIM3 directly inhibited the function of murine and human CTLs in direct interaction with target tumor cell spheroids. TIM3 regulated the ability of suppressed CTLs to polarize their actin cytoskeleton as a required step in cytolysis. Whereas the expression of the proposed TIM3 ligands CEACAM1 and galectin 9 in trans on target tumor cells enhanced TIM3 function, expression of CEACAM1 in cis on CTLs had the opposite effect. TIM3 functioned as an inhibitory receptor on spheroid-suppressed CTLs but not on active CTLs in a two-dimensional tissue culture model. Together, these data suggest that TIM3 enhances T cell function, serving as either a coinhibitory or costimulatory receptor depending on the functional context of the T cell on which it is expressed.},
