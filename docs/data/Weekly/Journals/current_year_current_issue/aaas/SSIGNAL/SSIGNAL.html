  abstract     = {The Ca 2+ release channel RYR1 mediates basal intracellular Ca 2+ leak in skeletal muscle, which is increased by mutations that confer life-threatening sensitivity to volatile anesthetics or heat. Yee et al. sought to determine whether these sensitivities were caused by RYR1-mediated Ca 2+ leak. Mice with a disease-inducing RYR1 mutation survived exposure to volatile anesthetics, and their skeletal muscle temperature did not appreciably increase during heat challenge if RYR1 also had a phosphorylation-mimicking mutation that reduced Ca 2+ leak in skeletal muscle. Thus, reducing the leakiness of mutant RYR1 prevents pathological thermogenesis in skeletal muscle. —Wei Wong Ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) is the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2+ release channel required for both skeletal muscle contraction and Ca 2+ leak. Mutations in RYR1 cause malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) and enhanced sensitivity to heat stroke (ESHS), which can result in death due to excessive skeletal muscle thermogenesis upon exposure to volatile anesthetics or heat. Here, we investigated the molecular and physiological functions of phosphorylation of RYR1 at Ser 2902 by the kinase striated muscle preferentially expressed protein (SPEG). Muscle from SPEG-deficient mice expressing RYR1 with a Ser 2902 →Asp 2902 (S2902D) point mutation to mimic phosphorylation by SPEG showed decreased SR Ca 2+ sparks. Muscle from mice homozygous for the S2902D point mutation had reduced SR Ca 2+ transients and small changes in force generation but overall mild phenotypic changes. YS mice, which are heterozygous for a Tyr 524 →Ser 524 point mutation in RYR1, show increased Ca 2+ leak and are a model of MHS and ESHS. Crossing YS mice with S2902D mice led to decreased SR Ca 2+ leak and desensitized the mice to both volatile anesthetics and heat. Thus, SPEG inhibits SR Ca 2+ leak in skeletal muscle by phosphorylating Ser 2902 on RYR1, and mutation of Ser 2902 to Asp 2902 to mimic this phosphorylation event rescues YS mice from heat-induced death.},

  abstract     = {Longitudinal bone growth occurs at growth plates. Hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO) causes benign, bony tumors to form at growth plates in children. The tumors cease growing after puberty but do not regress, leading to skeletal abnormalities. In a mouse model of HMO, Catheline et al. found that the osteochondromas acquired a growth plate–like architecture as they emerged from the connective tissue surrounding the growth plate. Tumor outgrowth was driven by the establishment of an ectopic growth axis orthogonal to that of the bone from which the tumor emerged and, like a normal growth plate, depended on Hedgehog signaling. The findings shed light on the origin and development of osteochrondromas and suggest potential targets for slowing their growth in patients. —Annalisa M. VanHook Osteochondromas characterize the rare pediatric disorder hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO). The tumors originate from the growth plate perichondrium along skeletal elements, appear first as ectopic cartilage, and then grow unidirectionally, colliding with and damaging surrounding structures. HMO is caused by mutations that affect the heparan sulfate (HS) synthases EXT1 or EXT2, leading to HS deficiency and aberrant activity of HS-binding growth factors. We investigated the signaling pathways and mechanisms underlying tumor growth in HMO using mice with conditional Ext1 deficiency in the growth plate and perichondrium. Developing tumors displayed active Hedgehog (Hh) signaling within their cartilaginous moiety and the presence of parathyroid hormone–related protein (PTHrP) at their distal edge, generating an ectopic Hh-PTHrP axis orthogonal to the one directing normal bone lengthening at the adjacent growth plate. In Ext1 mutants, loss of the Hh signaling effector Smoothened (Smo) reduced tumor growth, whereas heterozygous loss of the Smo inhibitor Patched1 (Ptch1) increased tumor growth. Two HS-binding growth factors that promote normal cartilage growth in the growth plate, BMP2 and activin A, did not exert their normal prochondrogenic activity when Hh signaling was blocked, demonstrating that Hh signaling is essential for chondrogenesis. Together, our findings show that osteochondromas usurp a physiological signaling mechanism to guide and propel their directional outgrowth, enabling them to damage surrounding tissues, and suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention.},
