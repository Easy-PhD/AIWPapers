  abstract     = {The advent of location information platforms based on global positioning systems has led to a proliferation of spatiotemporal trajectory data, which has, in turn, made the analysis of such data available to a broad range of applications, including traffic prediction, route planning, and trajectory similarity computation. Traditional methods for calculating trajectory similarity often suffer from high computational costs due to quadratic time complexity, particularly when dealing with large datasets. To this end, deep learning-based approaches to trajectory similarity learning have been proposed, with a view to offering enhanced efficiency and adaptability in comparison with traditional methods. However, these methods primarily focus on spatial trajectory similarity and fail to capture important temporal periodicity. Moreover, most of them directly use recurrent neural networks to obtain trajectory representations, while ignoring the spatial proximity information between neighboring regions. To address these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced spatiotemporal trajectory network, named GST, which integrates both spatial and temporal information to effectively learn trajectory similarity. Specifically, our model incorporates a graph neural network to capture the spatial proximity relationships and a time-embedding module to model the temporal periodicity information, thereby providing a more comprehensive spatiotemporal trajectory representation learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on 2 real-life datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy. In addition, ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed spatiotemporal learning mechanism.},

  abstract     = {From smart cities to healthcare, the internet of things (IoT) has transformed numerous industries. However, this expansion has raised security concerns, particularly cyberattacks. Traditional IoT intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have high false-positive rates and low detection accuracy due to IoT devices and traffic patterns. To overcome these challenges, this research proposes an intelligent-computing-based time series IDS that utilizes sophisticated data augmentation, signal transformation, and deep learning methods. The system begins by augmenting minority-class samples using conditional generative adversarial networks to handle class imbalance. The augmented dataset is then transformed into signal representations based on mel frequency cepstral coefficients, allowing the model to capture both the frequency and temporal characteristics of network traffic. Finally, a hybrid convolutional-neural-network–long-short-term-memory (CNN–LSTM) architecture is trained to identify anomalous behaviors with enhanced accuracy and lower false-positive rates. The proposed model utilizes the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity CICIoT2023 dataset, which is widely used for network security experiments. The results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional deep learning models in terms of accuracy, precision, and false-positive rate. Specifically, the proposed system improves accuracy by 5% to 10% across different attack types while reducing false-positive rates considerably. The research presents a detailed exploration of the advantages of signal transformation and explains how the CNN and LSTM models complement each other in detecting anomalies. This framework addresses the pressing need for intelligent time series analysis in cybersecurity through the introduction of a scalable and interpretable IDS solution specifically designed for IoT environments.},

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising adsorbents, yet atomic-level insights into Xe and Kr adsorption remain limited. Here, we report the first application of high-field solid-state 83 Kr nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), alongside extensive 129 Xe NMR, to investigate gas adsorption in eight MOFs representing three design strategies: ultramicroporous one-dimensional–channel MOFs with pore sizes matching noble gas diameters, functionalized MOFs, and MOFs with open metal sites. Single-gas and coadsorption studies reveal distinct adsorption sites, guest-host interactions, and gas dynamics in each MOF. Most MOFs retain crystallinity after exposure to 60-kilogray γ radiation. Several radiation-sensitive MOFs exhibit enhanced stability in the presence of Xe, suggesting that Xe adsorption enhances framework stability and may broaden the range of MOFs usable under γ radiation in nuclear off-gas separation. These findings offer valuable molecular-level design insights.},

However, once prototyped, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)–based silicone elastomer is limited in mechanical strength and programmable spatial construction due to the flexible polymer matrix and mismatched interface with other materials. We propose a mechanically strengthened PDMS-based origami structure (MSOS) via polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)/acetone solution swelling. The planar elastomer precursor can be swollen-folded into programmable spatial construction based on mechanically strengthened creases during solvent diffusion and de-gelatinization. This strengthened crease is induced by a hierarchical shrink-fitting based on solute molecular chain insertion and a seamless coupling interface between elastomer microstructures and solidified PMMA. We present a programmable MSOS to support a load more than 58,100 times of its own weight and a pillbug-inspired ringbot to resist heavy impact. Our work provides a strategy toward customized mechanically strengthened soft material for developing functional structural architectures and soft origami robots.},

Under acidic conditions, a previously unidentified class of β-carbolines (βCs), termed secofumitremorgins (SFs), with potent antiangiogenic activity in zebrafish models was found and identified via nuclear magnetic resonance, Marfey’s analysis, and quantum calculations. Using gene knockout, heterologous expression, precursor feeding, isotope tracing, molecular docking, and site-directed mutagenesis, a unique biosynthetic pathway for SFs was characterized, beyond the Pictet-Spenglerase–mediated biosynthetic process. Furthermore, an unreported pH-regulated mechanism was unveiled, where P450 (FtmG) facilitated new fumitremorgin intermediate formation, enabling spontaneous, nonenzymatic generation of βCs and spirotryprostatins under distinct pH conditions. Notably, this work provides detailed experimental evidence and reaction mechanisms for synergistic enzymatic and nonenzymatic catalysis driving metabolite diversification under pH stress. The findings expand biosynthetic paradigms for indole alkaloids and highlight the therapeutic potential of pH-elicited βCs, advancing strategies for natural product discovery.},

However, their functional potential is often limited by the intrinsic constraints of conventional host materials, which typically lack sufficient flexibility in defect engineering, magnetic modulation, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) enhancement. To address this challenge, we introduce high-entropy metal oxides (HEMOs) into carbon-based chiral frameworks, constructing HEMO and carbon nanocoil (HEMO@CNC) composites. By combining advanced microscopy, electromagnetic measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is revealed that increasing entropy and helical strain jointly induce nonlinear changes in SOC strength and defect-related localized states. Benefiting from these effects, the HEMO@CNC system achieves an ultrawide bandwidth, outperforming linear structures and low-entropy systems. This work provides a potential paradigm for integrating topological defect engineering and high-entropy quantum modulation, offering deeper insights into advancing electromagnetic functional materials from macroscopic design toward geometry-defect-spin synergistic regulation.},

We demonstrate a strategy to introduce and tune Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) to unprecedented magnitudes in inversion-symmetric solids by incorporating ultrasmall silver nanoparticles in bulk gold. The near-identical lattice constants of Ag and Au allow dense packing of the Ag/Au hetero-interfaces without compromising the global BIS. By varying the density of embedded nanoparticles, we generate Rashba SOI in a bulk metal with coupling strength ~15 meV∙Å, higher than any known system preserving BIS globally, and show up to ~20 times increase in the spin-orbit scattering rate. We argue that the combined effect of charge transfer at the interfaces and polaronic localization enhances the SOI.},

In contrast, a third pathway, which leverages the two-electron nucleophilic potential of alkyl–Co III , has remained unexplored because of the inherently low polarization of the C–Co bond. Here, we report an axial-coordination activation strategy to unlock this reactivity space in Co-MHAT catalysis. Through stoichiometric organometallic studies using well-defined alkyl–Co III complexes, we demonstrate that an alkoxide ligand can render alkyl–Co III sufficiently nucleophilic to displace a suitable leaving group, via a stereospecific backside-backside approach. This pathway is further applied in catalysis, enabling a diastereoselective redox neutral Co-MHAT cyclopropanation reaction.},

Here, we present a hydrogel platform that enables spatiotemporal modulation of toughness through a latent ionic cross-linking mechanism. By embedding calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) microparticles in alginate/polyacrylamide double-network hydrogels, we create a system where localized calcium release and thus ionic cross-linking can be programmed in both space and time. Spatial control is achieved by direct ink writing of CaCO 3 , while temporal activation is triggered by glucono-δ-lactone, a biocompatible acidifier that releases calcium on demand. This strategy allows user-defined tuning of stiffness and toughness, enabling fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) hydrogels with tailored mechanical profiles.

  abstract     = {Oral bacteriotherapy is increasingly exploited but faces challenges in simultaneously monitoring treatment process and achieving desirable efficacy. Here, we develop theranostic bacteria by depositing a protective visual therapeutic nanocoating via in situ sequential mineralization. Using two-step metal ion adsorption and nucleation, bacterial surface is successively mineralized with an inner manganese dioxide/ferric oxide nanoparticle layer and an outer calcium carbonate layer. Upon ingestion, the outer layer neutralizes gastric acid through double-decomposition reaction, protecting bacterial viability and the inner layer. During intestinal passage, the inner layer enables T1/T2 dual-mode magnetic resonance imaging for real-time tracking, whereas the lesion-triggered release of manganese ions allows T1 single-mode pathological detection. The inner layer also exhibits superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, synergizing therapeutic effects with bacteria. Further supported by satisfactory performances in two murine models of Salmonella -induced colitis and apolipoprotein E–deficient atherosclerosis, this work provides a platform to generate innovative theranostic agents for advanced bacteriotherapy.},

Here, we report a multibit programming spine structure strategy to create a magnetorheological metamaterial with high-density, reprogrammable, and visually readable information encoding capacities. Inspired by spine features, the magnetorheological spine beams, exhibiting substantial stiffness variation by bistable transition, meticulously conceived the stiffness reprogrammable magnetorheological metamaterial (SRMM). The SRMM exhibits a large stiffness conversion capability (40-fold) and high-density information encoding performance (10-bit). Coupling with the mechanoluminescent materials, the mechanical information achieves visualization conveniently, which is attributed to the conversion of the stiffness data into optical signals through optical energy level transitions. Such stiffness-based magnetorheological metamaterial offers expansive information encoding spaces, stable operation capabilities, and convenient readout approaches, advancing mechanical information processing system design for extreme environments.},

In the peptidoglycan biogenesis pathway in Escherichia coli , MurJ, the lipid II flippase, is an essential membrane protein. The 37-residue protein M from the Levivirus phage, known as Lys M or Sgl M , targets MurJ and induces cell lysis; however, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the MurJ/Lys M (JM) complex at 3.09-angstrom resolution, revealing that Lys M interacts with the crevasse between TM2 and TM7 of MurJ, locking MurJ in an outward-facing conformation, with Lys M acting like a wedge. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis and pull-down assays revealed key residues responsible for Lys M function, and molecular dynamics simulations showed that Lys M stabilizes MurJ’s outward-facing state. These findings demonstrate an unprecedented phage-derived mechanism for blocking lipid II transport, providing a structural framework for designing MurJ-targeted antimicrobial agents.},

We define accommodation quantitatively as mean thickness of potential deposition per unit of time, calculated per unit area based on a maximum deposition rate and slope-controlled probabilities of erosion and deposition. Testing this definition in a simple numerical stratigraphic forward model reproduces key stratal geometries and behaviors, suggesting basic predictive power. However, the model output is missing much stratigraphic detail, and it is difficult to see how this can be added through extension of the accommodation definition. This suggests that accommodation has less predictive power than typically assumed; many important elements of stratal prediction must come instead from independent calculation of sediment erosion, routing, and depositional processes.},

Here, we present a hybrid platform that enables comprehensive dc and ac analog signal processing within a 2D-ACT device. By synergistically integrating 2D-FET and SAW components, our system achieves real-time subwavelength carrier monitoring and ac signal manipulation. ac measurements further elucidate mechanisms of dc acoustoelectric current generation. Notably, by controlling the phase and intensity of counter-propagating SAWs, we demonstrate analog signal addition and subtraction capabilities not previously realized in 2D-ACT devices.

Our results show that revealing electro-chemo-mechanical interactions is essential to develop strategies to suppress the degradation of SSBs. Particularly, we revisit a LiNbO 3 (LNO) coating layer to mitigate electrochemical degradation. The LNO@NMC811 cathode retains 116 milliampere-hours per gram after 200 cycles, showing excellent stability, while the uncoated NMC811 cathode keeps degrading over time, with suppressed chemical heterogeneity and mechanical failure.

We report a plasmon-induced route to plasmonic-polymer hybrid nanomaterials using in operando single-particle spectroelectrochemistry. An energy transfer efficiency of 40% is achievable when the spectral overlap between gold nanorod scattering and polymer absorption is maximized. We also show that PIRET-initiated polymerization proceeds through a different mechanism than bulk polymerization, supported by spectroscopic evidence and density functional theory calculations, highlighting efficient energy cascading from photon to plasmon to exciton and, lastly, to unconventional light-initiated chemistry.},

We develop a three-component (ThrCo) LNP by replacing cholesterol and PEGylated lipids in Pfizer-BioNTech LNPs with zwitterionic pyridine carboxybetaine (PyCB) ionizable lipids (ILs), achieving ~70% lower liver accumulation and a 4.5-fold increase in spleen-specific mRNA translation. PyCB ILs enhance LNP hydrophilicity, stabilizing the outer membrane to compensate for cholesterol removal. PyCB groups also exhibit strong protonation at endosomal pH, facilitating mRNA translation. The zwitterionic surface of ThrCo LNP reduces protein adsorption, thereby preventing the accelerated blood clearance effect caused by PEGylated lipids following repeated administrations. Thus, ThrCo LNP–based vaccines efficiently deliver mRNA to splenic antigen-presenting cells, boosting immune responses and improving therapeutic outcomes.},

Through coculturing for 30 to 120 days, we observed the presence of tubular blood vessels at the center of vROs. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the vascularization in ROs was associated with angiogenesis and immune response. Furthermore, we observed that MGs in VOs migrated and integrated into the vROs as VOs and ROs fused, with the vROs exhibiting responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. The vROs expressed tight junction protein claudin-5 and displayed similar characteristics to the inner blood-retinal barrier (iBRB).

This study presents a general catalyst design strategy to control MW-induced heating of single metal ions by tuning the zeolite framework and electrostatic interactions. Key structural and electronic factors governing atomic-scale energy localization are identified. Applying this approach to the reverse water-gas shift reaction results in energy efficiency improvements via targeted heating of single-ion sites.

  abstract     = {Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic RNA-protein assemblies that form in response to cellular stress and must be efficiently disassembled to restore normal cell function. Valosin-containing protein (VCP), an enzyme implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, is essential for SG disassembly, but whether and how this process is coordinated with SG assembly remains unclear. Here, we identify the VCP cofactor, Alveolar soft part sarcoma locus (ASPL) as a key regulator linking SG assembly and disassembly. ASPL promotes SG assembly by facilitating biomolecular condensation of Ras guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein-binding protein (G3BP) and stabilizing its interactions with other SG proteins. ASPL also facilitates phosphorylation and activation of VCP by UNC-51-like kinases 1 and 2 (ULK1/2), enabling G3BP extraction and efficient SG disassembly. Pathogenic VCP mutations that disrupt ASPL binding impair SG disassembly, a defect rescued by phosphomimetic mutations or ASPL depletion. Our findings suggest that disruptions in the ASPL-VCP interaction uncouple SG assembly and disassembly, representing a potential mechanism underlying VCP-associated neurodegenerative diseases.},

One module is the A-C linker, an enigmatic protein assembly connecting the A-microtubule of one microtubule triplet to the C-microtubule of the neighboring triplet. Here, we integrated biochemistry, multiscale cryo–electron microscopy, and AlphaFold modeling to investigate the architecture of the centriole. Using an improved centriole isolation method, we determined the structure of the A-C linker bound to microtubule triplets, which revealed how the A-C linker cross-links microtubules and integrates with the B-C junction. We found marked changes in the structure and composition of the A-C linker that correlate with the presence of other centriolar modules, including the pinhead, cartwheel, and inner scaffold. Our findings show that the A-C linker is a highly integrated component of the centriole whose polymorphism may orchestrate the assembly of spatially distinct centriolar modules, and provide a framework for dissecting the biology of centrioles.},

To address the molecular basis of inorganic phosphate (Pi) specific transport within the sulfate transporter (SULTR) family, we determined the cryo–electron microscopy structures of Oryza sativa SULTR-like phosphorus distribution transporter (OsSPDT), a key Pi transporter for grain allocation, in apo- and Pi-binding states. OsSPDT forms a domain-swapped homodimer with each protomer containing an N-terminal domain (NTD), a transmembrane domain (TMD) divided into core and gate subdomains, and a C-terminal sulfate transporter and antisigma factor (STAS) domain. The structure adopts a cytoplasm-facing conformation with Pi coordinated at the core-gate interface. Key residues, including SPDT-unique Ser 170 , mediate Pi specificity within the binding pocket, distinguishing it evolutionarily from sulfate transporters within the SULTR family. Domain-swapping and mutational studies demonstrate functional interdependence of the NTD, TMD, and STAS domains. This work elucidates Pi selectivity in plant SULTR transporters and provides a molecular basis for developing low-phytate rice via OsSPDT gene editing.},

Ubiquitin-specific protease 21 (USP21), one of four major H2AK119-specific deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes. However, the mechanisms by which USP21 specifically deubiquitinates H2AK119ub and is regulated are unknown. We determined the cryo-EM structure of the USP21 catalytic domain bound to an H2AK119ub nucleosome, which revealed a recognition mode that differs from that of other H2AK119-specific DUBs. We unexpectedly found that the N-terminal IDR of USP21 inhibits the enzyme’s activity. Using AlphaFold-Multimer to perform a virtual screen of USP21 interactors, we identified kinases that phosphorylate the USP21 IDR and thereby relieve autoinhibition. AlphaFold3 modeling of USP21 suggests a structural model for autoinhibition. AlphaFold analysis suggests that phosphorylation-regulated autoinhibition may be a feature of various USP enzymes. These findings shed light on the mechanisms of H2AK119 deubiquitination and reveal a previously unexplored mode of phosphorylation-dependent DUB autoregulation.},

Nevertheless, little is known about the precise neural mechanisms governing the regulation of contagious pain in response to diverse environmental stressors. Here, we report that early life maternal separation (MS) precipitates impairments in the pain contagion between familiar partners. Specifically, we identify the indispensable role of glutamatergic projections from the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) to the prelimbic cortex (PrL) for the development of vicarious pain hypersensitivity. MS dampens activation of the PVT → PrL pathway during social interactions between observer and painful demonstrator. Augmenting the excitability or activity of the PVT → PrL circuit through chemogenetic interventions or tactile stimulation resembling social touch significantly ameliorates the MS-evoked contagious pain deficits. Collectively, our findings delineate a neural circuitry substrate underlying the loss of contagious pain stemming from MS and propose a potential therapeutic avenue for mitigating empathic impairments associated with early life adversity.},

The causative NLRs [resistance to Melanaphis sorghi 1A (RMES1A) and RMES1B] lack signaling domains and have adenosine triphosphatase mutations expected to abrogate function, suggesting that RMES1 NLRs regulate immunity via a noncanonical mechanism. The RMES1 NLR family is ancient, orthologous to phloem-feeding resistance genes in rice and syntenic across the grass superpangenome. Thus, gene birth-and-death processes at an ancient gene cluster created rare standing variation and provided the adaptive allele for evolutionary rescue.},

Gene duplication resulting from polyploidization offers insights into plant adaptation to environmental stress. Here, we reveal that extensive duplication of GhRALF30L , which encodes an intrinsically disordered small peptide, contributes to thermotolerance in cotton male reproductive organs. Polyploidization has driven the formation of 23 GhRALF30L genes in allotetraploid cotton, whereas only four or five homologs are identified in its two diploid ancestors. Expression and functional analyses confirm that GhRALF30L regulates thermotolerance in a dosage-dependent manner, with reduced dosage decreasing heat resistance. Under heat stress, GhRALF30L interacts with GhFERA1/GhCAPA1 and enhances their condensation at the plasma membrane, which activates heat stress responses by up-regulating the expression of heat shock factors ( HSFs ), heat shock proteins ( HSPs ), and reactive oxygen species scavenging genes. Our findings demonstrate that the GhRALF30L gene cluster, resulting from polyploidization, confers thermotolerance through facilitating the condensation of GhFERA1/GhCAPA1.},

We found that loss of clh-1 extends life span, improves stress resistance, reduces neuronal damage, and extends health span. These effects are linked to protective pathways, including those for oxidative stress and autophagy, and depend on the DAF-16/FoxO transcription factor. Notably, by knocking down and overexpressing the carbonic anhydrase cah-4 , we show that it is the glial alkalinization caused by loss of clh-1 that mediates these protective effects.

Analyzing two decades of seismicity (2005–2024) across three crustal sectors, we distinguished magma recharge from the mantle, its transfer and storage at intermediate depths, and final ascent to the surface. Moreover, we found that b value time variations can precede geochemical anomalies from magma ascent and its eruption by a few months.

To directly address these issues, this study introduces a noncontact approach by exploiting the unique properties of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light. The distinctive longitudinal electric field generated by OAM light substantially enhances the density of trap states in materials such as molybdenum disulfide, as the primary material for investigation, and others as supplementary examples. This enhancement enables precise modulation of key device characteristics, including readout current, hysteresis window, and charge storage capacity, with quantitative behavior accurately modeled by the Poole-Frenkel effect. Our results reveal the transformative potential of OAM light in enabling multilevel memory states with exceptional tunability and versatility across different material systems.

  abstract     = {Human schistosomiasis remains one of the most devastating parasitic diseases worldwide, and the development of genetically modified vector snails has long been a goal in the field. Here, we report the successful creation of genetically modified Biomphalaria glabrata , an important intermediate host, using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. We targeted the fibrinogen-related protein 3.1 ( FREP3.1 ) gene, confirmed stable germline transmission of the mutated gene, and established two different homozygous FREP3.1 -edited lines. Disruption of the FREP 3.1 gene did not alter snail susceptibility to Schistosoma mansoni infection, possibly due to a limited role of FREP3.1 in resistance or to functional redundancy and/or compensatory expression within the highly diverse FREP gene family. Our study demonstrates successful germline editing, effective ex ovo culture of decapsulated embryos, and the generation of viable, genetically modified B. glabrata snails, thereby establishing a foundation for future genetic strategies to control schistosomiasis.},

  abstract     = {The photochemical conversion of CO 2 into valuable fuels faces challenges of low efficiency and poor selectivity. Hydrated electrons (e aq − ), with their extremely negative reduction potential, are promising CO 2 -reducing agents, yet their short lifetime limits selectivity and high-energy-density product formation. Herein, we show that microdroplet interfaces with strong electric fields (10 9 volts per meter) substantially extend the lifespan of e aq − generated from industrial sulfite pollutants (SO 3 2− ), lowering energy barriers in the CO 2 reduction reaction and enabling targeted product formation. The machine learning strategy identified microdroplet size as the key parameter controlling electric field strength, product yield, and selectivity. In our lab-based scaled-up system, microdroplets <10 micrometers improved performance by four to seven orders of magnitude over bulk-phase systems, achieving ~99% methanol selectivity. Strong interfacial electric fields stabilize intermediates and modulate carbon-oxygen bond lengths, directing pathways to high-value products. This approach enables sustainable CO 2 utilization via microdroplets, potentially producing fuels from waste.},

Chronic nicotine exposure leads to nAChR desensitization, while nicotine withdrawal leads to nAChR recovery. However, detailed molecular mechanisms underlying nicotine-induced nAChR desensitization and its recovery remain elusive. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the α7 nAChR in complex with nicotine in both an open state and multiple desensitized states. Comparative analyses reveal progressive conformational changes during recovery from nicotine-induced desensitization and show that asymmetric nicotine binding disrupts the symmetry of the channel pore at the 16′ and 17′ sites. Integrating these findings with patch-clamp recordings and computational simulations, we identify an agonist-free structure that represents an atypical desensitized state closely resembling the resting conformation of α7 nAChR. These detailed mechanistic studies enhance our understanding of nicotine’s effects on α7 nAChRs.},

Here, we report the high-quality germline genome assembly of a marine ciliate Euplotes vannus , where ~80% are transposons and other germline-specific DNA that has to be precisely eliminated during soma development. We demonstrate that a class of soma-derived 30-nucleotide small RNAs precisely targets nontransposon DNA against elimination during this process. Small RNA–mediated targeting remains functional across varying small RNA lengths and is compatible with heterozygous sites. These small RNAs are cleaved by Dicer-like ribonuclease from long noncoding RNAs, which are bidirectionally transcribed of somatic chromosomes, initiated at subtelomeric chromosome breakage sequences (5′-TTGAA-3′). On the basis of these findings and time-course transcriptomic profiling, we propose a model elucidating the molecular mechanism of DNA elimination in Euplotes .

Aggregation-prone substrates such as vitellogenins and human alpha-1 antitrypsin (ATZ) were efficiently cleared. Integrated proteomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal systemic adaptations featuring increased protein turnover and oxidative stress resistance independent of superoxide dismutases (SODs). Notably, α3ΔN extended life span and stress resistance independently of canonical unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling via xbp-1 . These findings substantiate a “20 S pathway” of proteostasis that directly alleviates protein aggregation and oxidative stress, offering a promising therapeutic angle for neurodegenerative diseases.},

We here derive an exact formula for the efficiency of any cyclically driven quantum engine by using generalized laws of quantum thermodynamics that account for all possible correlations between all involved parties, including initial correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of two basic modes of engine operation: the usual thermal case, where heat is converted into work, and an athermal regime, where work is extracted from entropic resources, such as system-bath correlations. In the latter regime, the efficiency is not bounded by the usual Carnot formula. Our results provide a unified formalism to determine the efficiency of correlated microscopic quantum machines.},

K. rhaeticus produces the bacterial cellulose (BC) matrix that integrates Bacillus spores within, whereas the confined spores keep dormant and are resistant to harsh conditions in the environment. Bacillus spores can germinate and confer desired functions to the materials. Modulating the binding affinity of spores to the BC matrix with genetic engineering can improve cell loading and therefore enhance the material functionality.

Here, we uncover a critical role for the ATM-TRMT10A-BRCA1 signaling axis in regulating homologous recombination (HR) repair and PARPi sensitivity. We demonstrate that ATM phosphorylates TRMT10A at serine-28 after DNA damage, promoting BRCA1 recruitment and efficient HR repair. TRMT10A deletion disrupts HR repair, sensitizing cells to PARPis. Moreover, TRMT10A is up-regulated in mCRPC through stabilization by USP10. Targeting USP10 with spautin-1 induces TRMT10A degradation and enhances tumor sensitivity to PARPis in cell-derived xenografts and patient-derived xenograft models. These findings identify TRMT10A as a therapeutic vulnerability in mCRPC and demonstrate that combined inhibition of PARP and USP10 offers a promising synthetic lethal strategy for a broader group of patients lacking classical BRCA mutations.},

NLPs disrupt plant membranes through interactions with glycosylinositol phosphorylceramides (GIPCs), but the specificity of these interactions remains unclear. We studied binding and pore formation of NLPs in model membranes with GIPCs derived from dicotyledonous or monocotyledonous plants. Using the cytotoxic NLP 2 from fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa (MpNEP2), we show that membrane binding and damage extend beyond previously studied oomycetal NLPs. Furthermore, NLP Pya from the oomycete Pythium aphanidermatum exhibits promiscuous binding with a marked preference for branched GIPC series B lipids. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the structural plasticity of NLP Pya provides a rational basis for its interaction with a variety of GIPC headgroups. These results clarify the molecular basis of NLP cytotoxicity and emphasize their role in broad-spectrum pathogenicity.},

Here, we further dissect the molecular characteristics of this system and reveal the involvement of a phase-separated compartment in pairing. Focusing on the PC protein HIM-8, we explored its functional domains in vivo and its self-multimerizing properties in vitro. We find that the amino-terminal domain facilitates PC chromatin binding of the carboxyl-terminal domain, whereas the middle unstructured region is essential for PC association with the nuclear envelop (NE). Integrated analyses suggest that PC-NE association is mediated by a DNA-containing phase-separated compartment that is spatially distinct from, but connected to, the chromosome axis—likely through flexible linkages. We propose that homology evaluation occurs within this compartment, where direct DNA-DNA interactions could play a role.},

Traditionally, optimizing acquisition parameters, such as source wavelength, intensity, and exposure time, relies on empirical adjustments to enhance image contrast. Here, we introduce a digital twin methodology to overcome these limitations. Focusing on x-ray Raman imaging, a powerful yet underutilized speciation probe constrained by low quantum efficiency, we demonstrate its application to sensitive organic samples. Our approach enabled a 10-fold reduction in acquisition time while maintaining operation below the damage threshold, paving the way for high-fidelity spectral imaging with minimal sample degradation.},

  abstract     = {Dust devil migration is a direct expression of the dynamics of the lowermost martian atmosphere. These dynamics are responsible for dust lifting and atmospheric injection, a vital part of the dust cycle that governs modern Mars’ weather and climate. Here, we use deep learning and two decades’ worth of orbital images to track the global, diurnal, and seasonal migration patterns of dust devils across Mars, providing a distributed characterization of the dynamics of near-surface winds. Across Mars, derived wind stresses systematically exceed those predicted by global circulation models and frequently surpass the threshold required to initiate particle saltation and the lifting of dust. We identify instances of fast-moving dust devils, indicating strong near-surface winds, that are colocated with large-scale dust lifting events and storms. Our observations show that strong near-surface winds are abundant on Mars and play an important role in atmospheric dust sourcing, directly informing more accurate models of Mars’ atmosphere, weather, and climate.},

During normal replication, p21 promotes nascent DNA synthesis alongside the DNA polymerase iota (Pol ι)/p53 complex. When p21 is down-regulated but detectable, nascent DNA tracks are longer and discontinuous and rely on primase and DNA polymerase (PrimPol). With the complete elimination of p21, nascent DNA tracks become shorter and continuous and depend on Pol kappa (κ). Endogenous p21 levels are critical for genomic stability, as both PrimPol- and Pol κ–mediated syntheses can induce chromosomal instability. The residual expression of p21 in p53-null cells influences the involvement of PrimPol or Pol κ in nascent DNA synthesis and subsequent chromosomal instability. Our results demonstrate that endogenous levels of p21 in cycling cells, insufficient for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition, prevent genomic instability through proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding (PCNA), limiting PrimPol and Pol κ’s role in nascent DNA synthesis.},

Although higher-order Markov models can capture these effects, they grow rapidly in size and require large amounts of data, making them prone to overfitting some parts and underfitting others in systems with uneven coverage. To address this challenge, we construct concise networks from path data by interpolating between first-order and second-order Markov models. We prioritize simplicity and interpretability by creating state nodes that capture prominent second-order effects and by proposing a transparent measure that balances model size and quality. Our concise networks reveal large-scale memory patterns in both synthetic and real-world systems while remaining far simpler than full second-order models.},

Mechanistically, photocatalytically generated hydrogen induces robust immunogenic cell death by triggering severe endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Concurrently, photosynthetic oxygen production and photocatalytic lactic acid depletion collaboratively alleviate immunosuppression within the TME, thereby enhancing cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity by reducing the infiltration of immunosuppressive cells and promoting the repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages from the M2 to the M1 phenotype. In vivo studies demonstrate that PCC@AuNP not only eradicates primary tumors but also elicits potent systemic antitumor immunity against distant lesions, without observable toxicity to healthy tissues. Collectively, this innovative PCC@AuNP platform offers a safe and effective therapeutic strategy, heralding a pioneering era of cascade-augmented gas-driven cancer immunotherapy with superior precision and biosafety.},

Whereas TRAF6 was dispensable for pancreatic β cell function at baseline, TRAF6 was pivotal for insulin secretion, mitochondrial respiration, and mitophagy following metabolic stress in mouse and human islets. TRAF6 was critical for the recruitment and function of the ubiquitin-mediated (Parkin-dependent) mitophagy machinery. Glucose intolerance induced by TRAF6 deficiency following metabolic stress was reversed by concomitant Parkin deficiency by relieving obstructions in receptor-mediated (Parkin-independent) mitophagy. Our results establish that TRAF6 is vital for traffic through Parkin-mediated mitophagy and implicates TRAF6 in the cross-regulation of ubiquitin- and receptor-mediated mitophagy. Together, we illustrate that β cells engage innate immune signaling to adaptively respond to a diabetogenic environment.},

We demonstrate that LIGHT monotherapy activates T cells, but also induces T cell exhaustion and the recruitment of immunosuppressive elements. As colorectal liver metastases exhibit high levels of CTLA-4 expression, we combined LIGHT overexpression with anti-CTLA-4, leading to complete tumor control. The combination functions by homing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, inducing tumor antigen-specific T cells, and reversing T cell exhaustion. Whereas both LIGHT overexpression and anti-CTLA-4 increase tumor-promoting macrophages, the combination eliminates this population. The ability of LIGHT overexpression combined with CTLA-4 inhibition to reverse T cell exhaustion and myeloid cell suppression is supported by analysis of complementary patient cohorts and has strong clinical relevance, especially given that liver metastases contribute to immunotherapy resistance across various cancer types.},

They are typically derived from secondary formation, which is generated through atmospheric chemical reactions involving precursor compounds, such as phenolic compounds. However, information on NAC formation mechanisms remains limited. Here, we found that particulate-phase NAC concentrations were notably affected by relative humidity (RH) in field observations. Smog chamber experiments indicated that RH could influence NAC formation via changes in gaseous water concentration, rather than solely through aerosol liquid water content. Theoretical calculations further clarified that water clusters (WCs), formed from gaseous water, can notably lower reaction energy barriers along the NAC formation pathway, rendering this pathway competitive under atmospheric conditions. Hence, we propose a potential mechanism in which WCs catalyze NAC formation, offering a previously unidentified perspective on atmospheric secondary aerosol formation.},

Our analyses reveal that diversity is consistently linked to stability through dual pathways: positively associated with resistance and resilience via indirect structural mediation, yet negatively correlated with local stability unless interaction strength is accounted for. Critically, omitting structural mediation yields a net negative diversity-stability correlation, whereas integrating food web structure uncovers context-dependent positive relationships, underscoring structural metrics as pivotal explanatory variables. Our findings reconcile the diversity-stability debate by showing that the food web structure mediates context-dependent stability outcomes—integrating direct and indirect pathways resolves contradictions and advances actionable metrics for conservation strategies resilient to environmental changes.},

Combined with our parameter-efficient miniset self-attention block, this enables QuAN to access high-order moments of bit-string distributions and preferentially attend to less noisy snapshots. We test QuAN across three quantum simulation settings: driven hard-core Bose-Hubbard model, random quantum circuits, and toric code under coherent and incoherent noise. QuAN directly learns entanglement and state complexity growth from experimental computational basis measurements, including complexity growth in random circuits from noisy data.

This study examines the role of B cells and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) in melanoma responses to ICB. Retrospective meta-analyses reveal increased B cell enrichment in ICB responders’ pretreatment. Functional assays show that B cell depletion impairs T cell–mediated tumor cytotoxicity. EVs from melanoma tumors were analyzed, identifying miR-99a-5p in CD19 + EVs as up-regulated in responders. Silencing miR-99a-5p in B cells reduces T cell antitumor activity, suggesting its role in immune modulation. Mechanistically, miR-99a-5p promotes B cell maturation via class-switch recombination.

  abstract     = {Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), the most common severe cyanotic congenital heart disease, has unclear genetic causes. Through next-generation sequencing in 131 patients with nonsyndromic TOF, we identified an increased burden of rare deleterious variants in ciliary genes and cilium pathway and observed a multigenic inheritance pattern, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.672 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.120 to 2.547; P = 0.0104] for more than two deleterious variants and a cumulative OR of 3.158 (95% CI, 1.381 to 6.371; P = 0.0038) for six variants. Functional validation in single- and double-heterozygous mouse models carrying these variants recapitulated TOF-like phenotypes and impaired normal cilia structure and function, particularly disrupting Hedgehog signaling in cardiomyocytes, and down-regulating key transcription factors Gata4 and Nkx2-5 . Together, our study provides compelling evidence linking ciliary gene variants to a heightened risk of TOF in Han Chinese, offering valuable genetic insights into the etiology and pathogenesis of nonsyndromic TOF and supporting a multigenic inheritance model for the disease.},

  abstract     = {The equatorial jets dominating the dynamics of the Jovian planets exhibit two distinct types of zonal flows: strongly eastward in the gas giants (superrotation) and strongly westward in the ice giants (subrotation). Existing theories propose different mechanisms for these patterns, but no single mechanism has successfully explained both. However, the planetary parameters of the four Solar System giant planets suggest that a fundamentally different mechanism is unlikely. In this study, we show that convection-driven columnar structures can account for both eastward and westward equatorial jets, framing the phenomenon as a bifurcation. Consequently, both superrotation and subrotation emerge as stable branches of the same mechanistic solution. Our analysis of these solutions uncovers similarities in the properties of equatorial waves and the leading-order momentum balance. This study suggests that the fundamental dynamics governing equatorial jet formation may be more broadly applicable across the Jovian planets than previously believed, offering a unified explanation for their two distinct zonal wind patterns.},

We examined whether T2D β cell dysfunction can be rescued, charted the underlying molecular mechanisms by RNA sequencing, and mined transcriptomes for drug targets. Glucose responsiveness of T2D β cells improved in 60% of preparations after 3-day culture in euglycemic conditions. This was accompanied by changes in expression of >400 genes involved in functional or inflammatory pathways. Drug repurposing and target identification analyses predicted chemical and genetic hits, including JAK inhibitors, which were validated in a β cell line, human islets, and db/db mice. Therefore, defective β cell glucose responsiveness in T2D can recover, demonstrating β cell functional plasticity. The recovery associates with transcriptomic traits, pointing to targetable defects to induce T2D remission.},

Modulated sniffing and refined calcium signaling in the olfactory bulb inhibitory network during olfactory anemo-discriminations confirmed the orthonasal airflow information processing. Genetic perturbation of AMPAR function and optogenetic control bidirectionally shifted the anemo-discrimination learning pace, with contrasting phenotypes observed for odor learning, engagement of inhibitory circuits, and setting the optimal inhibition level for stimulus refinement. Enhanced learning caused by multimodal odor-airflow stimuli at subthreshold levels confirmed the heightened olfactory perception by mechanical stimuli.

Bacteroides species are prominent, long-term constituents of the gut microbiome that also play host to diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs). DGRs produce extraordinary numbers of DNA sequence variants and variable protein sequences. Macadangdang et al . investigated the DGRs that specifically target bacterial adhesion proteins (pilins) without disrupting the scaffold of the adhesin (see the Perspective by Paul and Mekalanos). This arrangement maximizes the capacity and rate of bacterial diversification with minimal cost. Data from mother-baby pairs showed that the first of a lifelong experience of bacterial and DGR transfer occurs at birth, resulting in the transfer of Bacteroides variants that are specific to and stick with their new hosts. —Caroline Ash Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) accelerate evolution by rapidly diversifying variable proteins. The human gastrointestinal microbiota harbors the greatest density of DGRs known in nature, suggesting that they play adaptive roles in this environment. We identified >1100 distinct DGRs among human-associated Bacteroides species and discovered a subset that diversify adhesive components of type V pili and related proteins. We show that Bacteroides DGRs are horizontally transferred across species, display activity levels ranging from high to low, and preferentially alter the functional characteristics of ligand-binding residues on adhesive organelles. Specific variable protein sequences are enriched when Bacteroides strains compete with other commensal bacteria in gnotobiotic mice. Analysis of >2700 DGRs from diverse phyla in mother-infant pairs shows that Bacteroides DGRs are disproportionately transferred to vaginally delivered infants where they actively diversify. Our observations provide a foundation for understanding the potential roles of targeted genome plasticity in shaping host-associated microbial communities.},

ORF2p binds double-stranded DNA without sequence specificity, and the single-stranded DNA path suggests dynamic EN positioning during cleavage. EN activity was strongly stimulated by forked or flap DNAs, indicating that ORF2p acts as a structure-selective endonuclease and explaining why LINE-1 mobilization predominantly occurs during DNA replication. —Di Jiang Long interspersed nuclear element–1 (LINE-1 or L1), the only autonomously active retrotransposon in humans today, constitutes a large proportion of the genome and continues to evolve the genome and impact fundamental biological processes. L1 retrotransposition critically depends on its endonuclease and reverse transcriptase subunit open reading frame 2 protein (ORF2p), which targets genomic loci and nicks DNA using an evolutionarily distinct yet not fully understood mechanism. Our structural and biochemical analyses revealed that ORF2p is a structure-dependent endonuclease. It binds a double-stranded DNA region upstream of the nicking site and recognizes a downstream forked or flap structure for efficient DNA nicking. This discovery suggests that L1 mobilization piggybacks on chromosomal processes with noncanonical DNA structure intermediates.},

Although these strains only differ by about 12,000 genetic variants, the authors identified nearly 6500 associations between genetic variants and protein levels. Nearly all (98%) of these variants acted in trans (>1 kilobase away from coding sequence) and many affected transcription factors, leading to downstream effects on many proteins.

Despite the modest genetic distance between the parents, we observed notable proteomic diversity and mapped more than 6400 genotype-protein associations, with more than 1600 linked to individual genetic variants. Proteomic adaptation emerged from a conserved network of cis- and trans-regulatory variants, often originating from proteins not traditionally linked to gene regulation.

Gao et al . found that deleting Aster-A specifically in T cells inhibited the uptake of dietary fats and prevented diet-induced obesity in mice (see the Perspective by Burkhardt and Ecker). By regulating the abundance of cholesterol in the plasma membrane, Aster-A modulated T cell receptor signaling and differentiation. In the absence of Aster-A, CD4 T cells in the gut produced a cytokine, interleukin-22, which decreased the ability of intestinal epithelial cells to take up fatty acids from the diet. —Sarah H. Ross The intrinsic pathways that control membrane organization in immune cells and their impact on cellular functions are poorly defined. We found that the nonvesicular cholesterol transporter Aster-A linked plasma membrane (PM) cholesterol availability in CD4 T cells to systemic metabolism. Aster-A was recruited to the PM during T cell receptor (TCR) activation, where it facilitated the removal of accessible cholesterol. Loss of Aster-A increased cholesterol accumulation in the PM, which enhanced TCR nanoclustering and signaling. Aster-A associated with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and negatively regulated calcium (Ca 2+ ) flux. Aster-A deficiency promoted CD4 T cells to acquire a T helper 17 (T H 17) phenotype and stimulated interleukin-22 production, which reduced intestinal fat absorption and conferred resistance to diet-induced obesity.

Acidosis, a metabolic state known to occur in tumors, appeared to be a main factor affecting cell metabolism by decreasing activity of the protein kinase ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase). ERK suppression blunted the effects of oncogene activation on mitochondrial morphology and favored tumor growth by allowing the cells to adapt to metabolic stress. —L. Bryan Ray Malignant tumors are characterized by diverse metabolic stresses, including nutrient shortages, hypoxia, and buildup of metabolic by-products. To understand how cancer cells adapt to such challenges, we conducted sequential CRISPR screens to identify genes that affect cellular fitness under specific metabolic stress conditions in cell culture and to then probe their relevance in pancreatic tumors. Comparative analyses of hundreds of fitness genes revealed that cancer metabolism in vivo was shaped by bioenergetic adaptations to tumor acidosis. Mechanistically, acidosis suppressed cytoplasmic activity of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), thereby preventing oncogene-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and promoting fused mitochondria. The resulting boost in mitochondrial respiration supported cancer cell adaptations to various metabolic stresses. Thus, acidosis is an environmental factor that alters energy metabolism to promote stress resilience in cancer.},

Chen et al . revealed a molecular mechanism that contributes to successful aging in these rodents: a change in the enzyme cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS), which is known to sense cytosolic DNA and initiate immune defense responses (see the Perspective by Martinez et al .). Unlike human cGAS, which inhibits DNA repair by homologous recombination in the nucleus, the naked mole rat enzyme has four amino acid changes that allow it to enhance DNA repair, thus delaying aging and enhancing life span. —L. Bryan Ray Efficient DNA repair might make possible the longevity of naked mole-rats. However, whether they have distinctive mechanisms to optimize functions of DNA repair suppressors is unclear. We find that naked mole-rat cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS) lacks the suppressive function of human or mouse homologs in homologous recombination repair through the alteration of four amino acids during evolution. The changes enable cGAS to retain chromatin longer upon DNA damage by weakening TRIM41-mediated ubiquitination and interaction with the segregase P97. Prolonged chromatin binding of cGAS enhanced the interaction between repair factors FANCI and RAD50 to facilitate RAD50 recruitment to damage sites, thereby potentiating homologous recombination repair. Moreover, the four amino acids mediate the function of cGAS in antagonizing cellular and tissue aging and extending life span. Manipulating cGAS might therefore constitute a mechanism for life-span extension.},

  abstract     = {The sites where RNA transcription begins and ends determine the full sequence of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and, consequently, the function of their encoded proteins. By analyzing both short- and long-read RNA-sequencing data across human tissues and other mammals, Calvo-Roitberg et al . revealed a coordinated relationship between transcription start and end sites that is dictated by the genomic order of alternative sites. This positional coupling, called the positional initiation-termination axis, is most prominent in long genes and is governed by the rate of RNA polymerase II elongation. These findings uncover a molecular mechanism that shapes mRNA diversity across tissues. —Di Jiang Transcriptional initiation and termination decisions drive messenger RNA (mRNA) isoform diversity but the relationship between them remains poorly understood. By systematically profiling joint usage of transcription start and end sites, we observed that mRNA using upstream starts preferentially use upstream end sites and that the usage of downstream sites is similarly coupled. Our results suggest a positional initiation termination axis (PITA), in which usage of alternative terminal sites are coupled based on their genomic order. PITA is enriched in longer genes with distinct chromatin features. We find that mRNA 5′ start choice directly influences 3′ ends depending on RNA polymerase II trafficking speed. Our results indicate that spatial organization and transcriptional dynamics couple transcription initiation and mRNA 3′ end decisions to define mRNA isoform expression.},

  abstract     = {Many cancers are resistant to immunotherapy because of poor immune cell infiltration. Activating the STING (stimulator of interferon genes) pathway is one way to encourage tumor immune cell infiltrates and positive therapeutic response. However, targeting the STING pathway has not yet succeeded in human trials despite encouraging results from experimental preclinical models. Hsu et al . report one possible reason: Many human cancers lose expression of a gene called methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), which causes a block of the STING pathway, but MTAP deficiency is rare in animal models. The researchers found that targeting a related process, polyamine metabolism, with the existing drug DL-α-difluoromethylornithine could restore immune activity in MTAP-deleted cancers and reduce tumor growth. This approach may offer a new way to improve cancer treatment and patient selection for STING-based therapies. —Priscilla N. Kelly Cytosolic nucleic acid–sensing pathways are potential targets for cancer immunotherapy. Although stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists have shown substantial antitumor effects in animal models, their clinical efficacy in human tumors remains unclear. Deletion of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a common genomic alteration in human tumors but is rare in preclinical syngeneic mouse models. We found that homozygous MTAP deletion in human tumors creates a tumor microenvironment that obstructs cytosolic nucleic acid–sensing pathways by down-regulating interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to resistance to STING agonists. Targeting polyamine biosynthesis reverses IRF3 down-regulation, restoring sensitivity to STING agonists in MTAP-deficient tumors. Our findings suggest that MTAP genetic status may inform patient responses to STING agonist therapy and offer an alternative strategy for boosting antitumor immune responses using STING agonists in MTAP -deleted tumors.},

Zhao et al . report on the synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical testing of a solid-state lithium tantalum oxychloride electrolyte with the formula Li 3 Ta 3 O 4 Cl 10 . The material has high ionic conductivity and low activation energy, even at lower temperatures. These properties are due to the mixed-anion chemistry, which enables facile lithium-ion migration pathways. The broad applicability of the mixed-anion strategy was validated using niobium and other cost-effective or earth-abundant elements to replace the tantalum, although with some decrease in conductivity. —Marc S. Lavine Solid-state batteries are attractive energy storage systems as a result of their inherent safety, but their development hinges on advanced solid-state electrolytes (SSEs). Most SSEs remain largely confined to single-anion systems (e.g., sulfides, oxides, halides, and polymers). Through mixed-anion design strategy, we develop crystalline Li 3 Ta 3 O 4 Cl 10 (LTOC) and its derivatives with excellent ionic conductivities (up to 13.7 millisiemens per centimeter at 25°C) and electrochemical stability. The LTOC structure features mixed-anion spiral chains, consisting of corner-shared oxygen and terminal chlorine atoms, which induces continuous “tetrahedron-tetrahedron” Li-ion migration pathways with low energy barriers. Additionally, LTOC demonstrates holistic cathode compatibility, enabling solid-state batteries operation at 4.9 volts versus Li/Li + and low temperature, down to −50°C. These findings describe a promising class of superionic conductors for high-performance solid-state batteries.},

Ferromagnetics and ferroelectrics have stray fields that can interfere with nearby memories, resulting in depolarization and ultimately limiting storage density. By contrast, in ferroaxial materials, the electric dipoles line up head to tail, forming vortices and thereby removing the stray fields. However, these vortex states have so far been difficult to control and switch. Zeng et al . demonstrated how single optical pulses can repeatedly switch a ferroaxial phase between two stable states (see the Perspective by He and Khalsa). The controlled switching between left and right helicity could be useful in developing a new platform for ultrafast information storage. —Ian S. Osborne Ultrafast switching of ferroic phases is an active research area with technological potential. Yet, some key challenges remain, ranging from limited speeds in ferromagnets to intrinsic volatility of switched domains owing to depolarizing fields in ferroelectrics. Unlike these ferroic systems, ferroaxial materials host bistable states that preserve spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetry and are therefore immune to depolarizing fields but also difficult to manipulate with conventional methods. We demonstrate photo-induced switching of ferroaxial order by engineering an effective axial field composed of circularly driven terahertz phonon modes. A switched ferroaxial domain remains stable for many hours and can be reversed back with a second terahertz pulse of opposite helicity. The effects demonstrated in this work may lead to the development of a robust platform for ultrafast information storage.},

Tang et al . have developed a FRET sensor for the plant hormone salicylic acid, which is primarily involved in activating immune responses. Using this sensor, the authors were able to visualize hormone levels with high sensitivity and spatial resolution at the cellular level and observed varied dynamics and patterns of salicylic acid up-regulation in response to bacterial infections. —Madeleine Seale Salicylic acid (SA) is a key phytohormone that orchestrates immune responses against pathogens, including Pseudomonas syringae bacteria. The timing and extent of SA accumulation are tightly controlled by plants but can be suppressed by pathogens to overcome immunity. Understanding SA dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolution remains challenging owing to limitations in existing detection methods that are indirect, destructive, or lacking in cellular precision and temporal resolution. We developed SalicS1, a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor specific to SA. SalicS1 enables real-time, reversible monitoring of SA levels in vivo with minimal perturbation of endogenous signaling.

Recently, the effectiveness of carbon-offsetting programs such as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation Plus) has been called into question, causing a decline in carbon offset values. Tang et al . addressed this question with updated analyses incorporating many projects and carefully chosen controls. Across 52 REDD+ Avoided Unplanned Deforestation projects from 12 countries in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, the authors found greater climate benefits than previous studies but low efficacy overall: Less than 20% of projects met their emissions targets. Project success and overestimation both varied considerably between countries. —Bianca Lopez REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation Plus) projects generate carbon credits to offset emissions, but recent studies have questioned their effectiveness. We evaluated 52 voluntary REDD+ projects across 12 tropical countries using synthetic control methods. Only a minority of project units showed statistically significant reductions in deforestation, and just 19% met their reported emissions targets. Nonetheless, many underperforming projects still delivered partial climate benefits, with an estimated 13.2% of tradable credits supported by counterfactual analysis. Effectiveness varied by region, with stronger performance in Brazil and Africa. Although systematic over-crediting remains a concern, our results suggest greater climate benefits than previous assessments.

Efforts have been made to mitigate this nonlinear process, but these were mostly limited to single-mode or few-mode fiber amplifiers, which have good beam quality. Here, we explored a highly multimode fiber amplifier in which stimulated Brillouin scattering was greatly suppressed due to a reduction of light intensity in a large fiber core and a broadening of the Brillouin scattering spectrum by multimode excitation. By applying a spatial wavefront shaping technique to the input light of a nonlinear amplifier, the output beam was focused to a diffraction-limited spot. Our multimode fiber amplifier can operate at high power with high efficiency and narrow linewidth, which ensures high coherence.

In mouse models, restoring mitochondrial ubiquitination through ubiquitin-specific peptidase 30 (Usp30) loss increased purifying selection of mtDNA in early embryogenesis. In vitro, genetically or chemically inhibiting Usp30 reduced mutant burden by increasing ubiquitin-mediated mitochondrial autophagy. Usp30 thus provides a promising target to treat and prevent mtDNA disorders. —Stella M. Hurtley Mitochondrial synthesis of adenosine triphosphate is essential for eukaryotic life but is dependent on the cooperation of two genomes: nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). mtDNA mutates ~15 times as fast as the nuclear genome, challenging this symbiotic relationship. Mechanisms must have evolved to moderate the impact of mtDNA mutagenesis but are poorly understood. Here, we observed purifying selection of a mouse mtDNA mutation modulated by Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 30 ( Usp30 ) during the maternal-zygotic transition. In vitro, Usp30 inhibition recapitulated these findings by increasing ubiquitin-mediated mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). We also found that high mutant burden, or heteroplasmy, impairs the ubiquitin-proteasome system, explaining how mutations can evade quality control to cause disease. Inhibiting USP30 unleashes latent mitophagy, reducing mutant mtDNA in high-heteroplasmy cells. These findings suggest a potential strategy to prevent mitochondrial disorders.},

They combined these data with locally recorded vocalizations analyzed by the artificial neural network model BirdNET. Together, these analyses revealed that half of the species responded to the end of the eclipse by singing a dawn chorus despite the “night” lasting only a few minutes. Variation in species response also informs us about variation in sensitivity to light, with implications for the impacts of artificial light. —Sacha Vignieri On 8 April 2024, a total solar eclipse disrupted light-dark cycles for North American birds during the lead-up to spring reproduction. Compiling more than 10,000 community observations and artificial intelligence analyses of nearly 100,000 vocalizations, we found that bird behavior was substantially affected by these few minutes of unexpected afternoon darkness. More than half of wild bird species changed their biological rhythms, with many producing a dawn chorus in the aftermath of the eclipse.

  abstract     = {Neuronal control of skeletal muscle function is ubiquitous across species for locomotion and doing work. In particular, emergent behaviors of neurons in biohybrid neuromuscular systems can advance bioinspired locomotion research. Although recent studies have demonstrated that chemical or optogenetic stimulation of neurons can control muscular actuation through the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the correlation between neuronal activities and resulting modulation in the muscle responses is less understood, hindering the engineering of high-level functional biohybrid systems. Here, we developed NMJ-based biohybrid crawling robots with optogenetic mouse motor neurons, skeletal muscles, 3D-printed hydrogel scaffolds, and integrated onboard wireless micro–light-emitting diode (μLED)–based optoelectronics. We investigated the coupling of the light stimulation and neuromuscular actuation through power spectral density (PSD) analysis. We verified the modulation of the mechanical functionality of the robot depending on the frequency of the optical stimulation to the neural tissue. We demonstrated continued muscle contraction up to 20 minutes after a 1-minute-long pulsed 2-hertz optical stimulation of the neural tissue. Furthermore, the robots were shown to maintain their mechanical functionality for more than 2 weeks. This study provides insights into reliable neuronal control with optoelectronics, supporting advancements in neuronal modulation, biohybrid intelligence, and automation.},

  abstract     = {Reading fluency is a vital building block for developing literacy, yet the best way to practice fluency—reading aloud—can cause anxiety severe enough to inhibit literacy development in ways that can have an adverse effect on students through adulthood. One promising intervention to mitigate oral reading anxiety is to have children read aloud to a robot. Although observations in prior work have suggested that people likely feel more comfortable in the presence of a robot instead of a human, few studies have empirically demonstrated that people feel less anxious performing in front of a robot compared with a human or used objective physiological indicators to identify decreased anxiety. To investigate whether a robotic reading companion could reduce reading anxiety felt by children, we conducted a within-subjects study where children aged 8 to 11 years ( n = 52) read aloud to a human and a robot individually while being monitored for physiological responses associated with anxiety. We found that children exhibited fewer physiological indicators of anxiety, specifically vocal jitter and heart rate variability, when reading to the robot compared with reading to a person. This paper provides strong evidence that a robot’s presence has an effect on the anxiety a person experiences while doing a task, offering justification for the use of robots in a wide-reaching array of social interactions that may be anxiety inducing.},

  abstract     = {According to productive failure (PF) theory, experiencing failure during problem-solving can enhance students’ knowledge acquisition in subsequent instruction. However, challenging students with problems beyond their current capabilities may strain their skills, prior knowledge, and emotional well-being. To address this, we designed a social robot–assisted teaching activity in which students observed a robot’s unsuccessful problem-solving attempts, offering a PF-like preparatory effect without requiring direct failure. We conducted two classroom-based studies in a middle school setting to evaluate the method’s effectiveness. In study 1 ( N = 135), we compared three instructional methods—observing robot failure (RF), individual problem-solving failure, and direct instruction—in an eighth-grade mathematics lesson. Students in the RF condition showed the greatest gains in conceptual understanding and reported lower social pressure, although no significant differences were found in procedural knowledge or knowledge transfer. Follow-up study 2 ( N = 110) further validated the method’s effectiveness in supporting knowledge acquisition after a 2-week robot-involved adaptation phase, when the novelty effect had largely subsided. Students confirmed their perception of the robot as a peer, and they offered positive evaluations of its intelligence and neutral views of its anthropomorphism. Our findings suggest that observing the robot’s failure has a comparable, or even greater, effect on knowledge acquisition than experiencing failure firsthand. These results underscore the value of social robots as peers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education and highlight the potential of integrating robotics with evidence-based teaching strategies to enhance learning outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent miniature systems capable of wireless sensing and manipulation hold considerable promise for advancing biomedical applications. However, the development of these systems has been substantially hindered by sensing-actuation incompatibility at small scales. To overcome this challenge, we propose a robotic sensing approach that integrates embedded ultrasonic soft sensors (EUSSs) with magnetic actuators, resulting in a wireless sensor-integrated miniature machine with seamless integration and minimal interference between fields. The EUSS, with its compact dimensions (1.3 millimeters by 1.3 millimeters by 1.6 millimeters), softness (98 kilopascals), and lightweight design (4.6 milligrams), is compatible with both soft and rigid components in terms of deformability and size. By engineering onboard transducers and using passive ultrasound communication along with external magnetic fields, we could wirelessly detect and regulate environmental parameters such as force, vibration, viscosity, and temperature. Demonstrations in rabbit and porcine models show the potential for robotic feedback control, accurate drug dosing, and in situ physiological monitoring, paving the way for real-world applications of intelligent miniature machines.},

  abstract     = {Dynamics models that predict the effects of physical interactions are essential for planning and control in robotic manipulation. Although models based on physical principles often generalize well, they typically require full-state information, which can be difficult or impossible to extract from perception data in complex, real-world scenarios. Learning-based dynamics models provide an alternative by deriving state transition functions purely from perceived interaction data, enabling the capture of complex, hard-to-model factors and predictive uncertainty and accelerating simulations that are often too slow for real-time control. Recent successes in this field have demonstrated notable advancements in robot capabilities, including long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects, granular materials, and complex multiobject interactions such as stowing and packing. A crucial aspect of these investigations is the choice of state representation, which determines the inductive biases in the learning system for reduced-order modeling of scene dynamics. This article provides a timely and comprehensive review of current techniques and trade-offs in designing learned dynamics models, highlighting their role in advancing robot capabilities through integration with state estimation and control and identifying critical research gaps for future exploration.},

  abstract     = {Modern robotic manufacturing requires collision-free coordination of multiple robots to complete numerous tasks in shared, obstacle-rich workspaces. Although individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning under spatiotemporal constraints remain computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales. Existing multiarm systems deployed in industry rely on human intuition and experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on procedurally generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot configurations, and task distributions. It uses a graph representation of scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through RL to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the subproblems of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and scalability of our planner also open the door to capabilities such as fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based replanning, where rapid adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.},

  abstract     = {The Ca 2+ release channel RYR1 mediates basal intracellular Ca 2+ leak in skeletal muscle, which is increased by mutations that confer life-threatening sensitivity to volatile anesthetics or heat. Yee et al. sought to determine whether these sensitivities were caused by RYR1-mediated Ca 2+ leak. Mice with a disease-inducing RYR1 mutation survived exposure to volatile anesthetics, and their skeletal muscle temperature did not appreciably increase during heat challenge if RYR1 also had a phosphorylation-mimicking mutation that reduced Ca 2+ leak in skeletal muscle. Thus, reducing the leakiness of mutant RYR1 prevents pathological thermogenesis in skeletal muscle. —Wei Wong Ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) is the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2+ release channel required for both skeletal muscle contraction and Ca 2+ leak. Mutations in RYR1 cause malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) and enhanced sensitivity to heat stroke (ESHS), which can result in death due to excessive skeletal muscle thermogenesis upon exposure to volatile anesthetics or heat. Here, we investigated the molecular and physiological functions of phosphorylation of RYR1 at Ser 2902 by the kinase striated muscle preferentially expressed protein (SPEG). Muscle from SPEG-deficient mice expressing RYR1 with a Ser 2902 →Asp 2902 (S2902D) point mutation to mimic phosphorylation by SPEG showed decreased SR Ca 2+ sparks. Muscle from mice homozygous for the S2902D point mutation had reduced SR Ca 2+ transients and small changes in force generation but overall mild phenotypic changes. YS mice, which are heterozygous for a Tyr 524 →Ser 524 point mutation in RYR1, show increased Ca 2+ leak and are a model of MHS and ESHS. Crossing YS mice with S2902D mice led to decreased SR Ca 2+ leak and desensitized the mice to both volatile anesthetics and heat. Thus, SPEG inhibits SR Ca 2+ leak in skeletal muscle by phosphorylating Ser 2902 on RYR1, and mutation of Ser 2902 to Asp 2902 to mimic this phosphorylation event rescues YS mice from heat-induced death.},

  abstract     = {Longitudinal bone growth occurs at growth plates. Hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO) causes benign, bony tumors to form at growth plates in children. The tumors cease growing after puberty but do not regress, leading to skeletal abnormalities. In a mouse model of HMO, Catheline et al. found that the osteochondromas acquired a growth plate–like architecture as they emerged from the connective tissue surrounding the growth plate. Tumor outgrowth was driven by the establishment of an ectopic growth axis orthogonal to that of the bone from which the tumor emerged and, like a normal growth plate, depended on Hedgehog signaling. The findings shed light on the origin and development of osteochrondromas and suggest potential targets for slowing their growth in patients. —Annalisa M. VanHook Osteochondromas characterize the rare pediatric disorder hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO). The tumors originate from the growth plate perichondrium along skeletal elements, appear first as ectopic cartilage, and then grow unidirectionally, colliding with and damaging surrounding structures. HMO is caused by mutations that affect the heparan sulfate (HS) synthases EXT1 or EXT2, leading to HS deficiency and aberrant activity of HS-binding growth factors. We investigated the signaling pathways and mechanisms underlying tumor growth in HMO using mice with conditional Ext1 deficiency in the growth plate and perichondrium. Developing tumors displayed active Hedgehog (Hh) signaling within their cartilaginous moiety and the presence of parathyroid hormone–related protein (PTHrP) at their distal edge, generating an ectopic Hh-PTHrP axis orthogonal to the one directing normal bone lengthening at the adjacent growth plate. In Ext1 mutants, loss of the Hh signaling effector Smoothened (Smo) reduced tumor growth, whereas heterozygous loss of the Smo inhibitor Patched1 (Ptch1) increased tumor growth. Two HS-binding growth factors that promote normal cartilage growth in the growth plate, BMP2 and activin A, did not exert their normal prochondrogenic activity when Hh signaling was blocked, demonstrating that Hh signaling is essential for chondrogenesis. Together, our findings show that osteochondromas usurp a physiological signaling mechanism to guide and propel their directional outgrowth, enabling them to damage surrounding tissues, and suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention.},
