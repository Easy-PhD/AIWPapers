  abstract     = {The advent of location information platforms based on global positioning systems has led to a proliferation of spatiotemporal trajectory data, which has, in turn, made the analysis of such data available to a broad range of applications, including traffic prediction, route planning, and trajectory similarity computation. Traditional methods for calculating trajectory similarity often suffer from high computational costs due to quadratic time complexity, particularly when dealing with large datasets. To this end, deep learning-based approaches to trajectory similarity learning have been proposed, with a view to offering enhanced efficiency and adaptability in comparison with traditional methods. However, these methods primarily focus on spatial trajectory similarity and fail to capture important temporal periodicity. Moreover, most of them directly use recurrent neural networks to obtain trajectory representations, while ignoring the spatial proximity information between neighboring regions. To address these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced spatiotemporal trajectory network, named GST, which integrates both spatial and temporal information to effectively learn trajectory similarity. Specifically, our model incorporates a graph neural network to capture the spatial proximity relationships and a time-embedding module to model the temporal periodicity information, thereby providing a more comprehensive spatiotemporal trajectory representation learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on 2 real-life datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy. In addition, ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed spatiotemporal learning mechanism.},

  abstract     = {From smart cities to healthcare, the internet of things (IoT) has transformed numerous industries. However, this expansion has raised security concerns, particularly cyberattacks. Traditional IoT intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have high false-positive rates and low detection accuracy due to IoT devices and traffic patterns. To overcome these challenges, this research proposes an intelligent-computing-based time series IDS that utilizes sophisticated data augmentation, signal transformation, and deep learning methods. The system begins by augmenting minority-class samples using conditional generative adversarial networks to handle class imbalance. The augmented dataset is then transformed into signal representations based on mel frequency cepstral coefficients, allowing the model to capture both the frequency and temporal characteristics of network traffic. Finally, a hybrid convolutional-neural-network–long-short-term-memory (CNN–LSTM) architecture is trained to identify anomalous behaviors with enhanced accuracy and lower false-positive rates. The proposed model utilizes the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity CICIoT2023 dataset, which is widely used for network security experiments. The results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional deep learning models in terms of accuracy, precision, and false-positive rate. Specifically, the proposed system improves accuracy by 5% to 10% across different attack types while reducing false-positive rates considerably. The research presents a detailed exploration of the advantages of signal transformation and explains how the CNN and LSTM models complement each other in detecting anomalies. This framework addresses the pressing need for intelligent time series analysis in cybersecurity through the introduction of a scalable and interpretable IDS solution specifically designed for IoT environments.},

Here, we demonstrate exciton-polariton condensation in a two-dimensional Penrose tiling with C 10 rotational symmetry—the evidence of quasicrystalline order in a quantum fluid of light. We identify a regime, wherein near-perfect delocalization and synchronization of a quantum fluid of light occurs at mesoscopic length scales extending beyond 100× the healing length and the size of each individual condensate. Realizing long-range order in fully reconfigurable quasicrystals of nonlinear and open-dissipative quantum fluids in the presence of artificial defects provides insights into phase synchronization between the condensates in unconventional, aperiodic settings.},

It leverages the controlled spreading of liquid ink on liquid surface and combines with precise laser engraving supported by rapid heat transfer at the solid-liquid interface. Geometric shapes, including basic forms of straight lines, sharp turns and circles, and complex patterns, were fabricated with exceptional fidelity to design specifications. We propose two heat-driven hydrodynamic locomotion mechanisms, fin-like bending and leg-like buckling. By harnessing these principles, we engineered two walkable devices—HydroFlexor and HydroBuckler—and demonstrated robust on-water locomotion. This work eliminates fragile postfabrication transfers in soft device manufacturing, bridging the gap between soft films and structure fabrication, and establishes a streamlined pathway for designing and deploying functional soft devices directly in liquid environments.},

The origins of these episodic movements and their relation to final instability remain unclear. We propose a novel “endo-exo” theory capturing the interplay between exogenous stressors such as rainfall and endogenous damage-healing processes. We predict four types of episodic dynamics, defined by the disturbance source (endogenous or exogenous) and criticality level (subcritical or critical), each with distinct power law exponent but all governed by a single parameter ϑ . These predictions are tested on the Preonzo landslide, whose sporadic activities align with the classification with ϑ ≈ 0.45 ± 0.1 . We find that its final collapse is preceded by an increased frequency of medium-to-large velocities over 1 to 2 months, signaling the transition into a catastrophic regime. Our research suggests that landslides may not permanently operate at a critical state, with major implications for forecasting catastrophic failures.},

Yet, the spatial and temporal dynamics of slab tearing remain enigmatic due to a lack of modern examples. Here, we integrate new seismic images with regional seismicity to investigate an actively fragmenting subduction system at northern Cascadia’s ridge-trench-fault triple junction where subduction termination is imminent. Our analyses reveal a broad shear-zone initiated at ~4 Ma by exploiting ridge-parallel fabrics of nascent oceanic lithosphere and progressively localized into a mature trench-perpendicular transform boundary. This process severed an oceanic microplate and enabled its diminished subduction relative to adjacent subducting lithosphere. Downdip, we image trench-parallel slab tears offset by the transform, suggesting lateral tear propagation was intersected by the transform boundary, facilitating efficient decoupling of the microplate while allowing adjacent subduction to continue. We propose a 4D model where transform boundaries drive laterally diachronous slab fragmentation and subduction termination.},

This switch makes the simulations computationally feasible, overcoming long-standing limitations of previous models. Using this framework, we successfully reproduce the self-assembly of subunits into icosahedral shells with T numbers greater than one—most notably T = 3, the most common structure in nature—a feat rigid-body models have so far failed to achieve. We also examine how genome architecture influences assembly and observe trends consistent with experiments using cowpea chlorotic mottle virus proteins: RNAs with more complex structure yield more complete capsids than do linear ones.

Here, we report the site-specific adaptive milk-derived nanovesicles (MiNVs) capable of overcoming intestinal and hepatic barriers for oral insulin delivery. These MiNVs could bind natural IgG on their surface, enabling FcRn-mediated transcytosis by evading the lysosomal degradation pathway. Upon reaching the liver, MiNVs responded to the elevated levels of biothiols in the hepatic microenvironment, triggering site-specific insulin release. In type 1 diabetic rats, the oral bioavailability reached 20.4%, which is about 20-fold higher than that of free insulin. Notably, MiNVs showed effective glycemic control over long-term treatment in type 1 diabetic rat and minipig models. By integrating transepithelial transport and liver-specific responsiveness, the site-specific adaptability of MiNVs supports their promise in oral insulin administration.},

Is metabolic dysfunction a cause of depression, a downstream consequence, or do both stem from shared underlying processes? We argue that neurocognitive mechanisms, particularly those involved in reward and effort processing, interact with metabolic physiology to shape each of these causal pathways. Metabolic signals do not act on the brain in isolation; they are embedded within a broader interoceptive system through which the brain detects and interprets bodily states. This system supports allostasis, the brain’s predictive regulation of internal physiological demands. We propose a framework of interoceptive energy allostasis in which disruptions to these predictive processes contribute to the bidirectional relationship between depression and metabolic dysfunction. By integrating perspectives from metabolic and computational psychiatry, this framework offers a theoretical lens to explain the multidirectional comorbidity between mental and metabolic ill-health.},

To address this challenge, we developed an acoustically powered micro-clampbot capable of clamping objects using claws actuated by acoustically induced secondary Bjerknes forces and moving via flagella that oscillate under acoustic input. The robot’s actions are governed by distinct acoustic frequencies, enabling precise and independent control of clamping and locomotion.

Notably, stronger salience learning facilitates proactive, but not retroactive, memory enhancement, challenging prevailing theories about salience’s role in these processes.

  abstract     = {Pulmonary surfactants reduce the work of breathing, enhance compliance, and prevent alveolar collapse. Yet, their role extends beyond that of a simple surfactant; otherwise, exogenous surfactant therapy would fully restore compliance in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by increasing surface concentration alone. Here, we show that interfacial microstructure and mechanics, regulated by spontaneous or ventilator-induced sighs, play a critical role. Using interfacial rheometry and structural analysis, including in situ neutron reflectometry and Raman-based techniques, we find that sighs enrich the air-liquid interface with saturated lipids, triggering structural rearrangements. This periodic “reset” transforms the layer into a mechanically robust, DPPC-rich film, where compressional hardening counteracts tension. These findings highlight the nonequilibrium dynamics of surfactant layers and underscore the importance of interfacial compressive stresses, not just tension, in governing lung mechanics. This mechanism helps sustain low interfacial stress and high compliance, offering mechanistic insight to guide protective ventilation strategies upon lung trauma and possibilities to optimize surfactant-enabled pulmonary treatment.},

Progress in both the understanding and adoption of ISF tests is hindered by sampling challenges, including lengthy collection times, non-negligible failure rates, variable collection volumes, and inconsistent bioanalyte levels. The causes of many of these issues are not well understood. We demonstrate a microneedle device that is several times faster than state of the art, collecting an average of 15.5 mg of ISF in 5 minutes in humans with near-zero failure rate. This improvement was achieved by designing the spatial pressure gradient driving ISF flow. The influence of penetration depth, collection time, pressure, and age on ISF collection was elucidated, with Darcy’s law explaining multiple observations. A data-driven acceptance criterion of <1% blood contamination for ISF is proposed. The device and findings presented will empower researchers to better conduct robust studies in the development of ISF diagnostics.},

The excitatory currents they produce reflect stochastic transitions between multiple agonist-bound closed- and open-pore states. We leveraged the intrinsically high open probability ( P o ) of NMDARs composed of GluN1 and GluN2A subunits, together with judiciously chosen mutants and ligands, to achieve conditions in which receptors had a P o near unity. Using single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we captured three activated receptor states, each with distinct conformations of the gate-forming M3 helices. Separately, we carried out single-channel electrophysiology, together with statistical modeling, to relate the cryo-EM structures to the gating reaction. NMDAR channel opening involves bending of the pore-forming M3 helices to produce a transient open-channel conformation, subsequently stabilized by new interactions between the D2-M3 linkers with the pre-M1 helices and the pre-M4 loops, to yield the stable open channel.},

  abstract     = {Structural plasticity of dendritic spines is a fundamental mechanism of learning and memory. It depends on the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). However, to bind TrkB, BDNF requires proteolytic cleavage to its mature form. Here, we demonstrate that MMP-9, an extracellular protease essential for neuronal function, plays a key role in this process. We show that, like BDNF, MMP-9 is rapidly released in response to synaptic stimulation, and its proteolytic activity, restricted to the activated spine, can be detected as early as 2 min after stimulation. Using two-photon microscopy and single-spine stimulation by glutamate uncaging, we demonstrate that MMP-9 action is important for TrkB activation and is required for structural plasticity. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a direct cleavage of proBDNF into mature BDNF by MMP-9. Our findings reveal a critical interaction between MMP-9 and BDNF through their autocrine regulation of TrkB activation and dendritic spine structural changes.},

Quantum mechanics provides an avenue to enhance precision, but it comes with a restriction: Incompatible observables, such as position and momentum, cannot be simultaneously measured to arbitrary accuracy as decreed by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. This restriction can be bypassed by instead measuring commuting modular observables, which are counterparts to the naturally incompatible observables. Here, we measure modular observables to estimate small changes in position and momentum with a single-mode multiparameter sensor. We deterministically prepare grid states in the mechanical motion of a trapped ion and demonstrate uncertainties in position and momentum below the standard quantum limit (SQL). Further, we examine another pair of incompatible observables—number and phase. We prepare a different resource—number-phase states—and demonstrate a metrological gain over the SQL. These results introduce previously unidentified measurement capabilities unavailable to classical systems and mark a substantial step in quantum metrology.},

Nevertheless, lunar influence on human reproductive behavior remains controversial. Here, we analyzed long-term menstrual records of individual women from the past 24 years and compared them with records from the past century. We show that women’s menstrual cycles recorded before the introduction of light-emitting diodes in 2010 and the extensive use of smart phones significantly synchronized with the Moon, while those after 2010 coupled to the Moon mostly in January. We hypothesize that the high gravimetric forces between the Moon, Sun, and Earth every January are sufficient for this coupling, while the increasing exposure to artificial light at night impinges on synchrony at other times.},

In favorable conditions, insulin and noninsulin peptides released from midgut epithelia activate foregut and hindgut enteric neurons, respectively, to sustain normal feeding and defecation behavior. During food scarcity, altered insulin signaling from sensory neurons activates the transcription factor DAF-16/FoxO in midgut epithelia, which blocks both peptidergic signaling axes to the ENS by transcriptionally shutting down the intestinal neuropeptide secretion machinery. Our findings demonstrate that midgut epithelial cells act as integrators relaying internal state information to distinct parts of the ENS to control animal behavior.},

This result indicates diminishing returns where each additional part contributes less to overall toolkit diversity. This scaling holds across diverse ecological and cultural contexts, suggesting a general principle of optimization in tool design. Ethnographic toolkits achieve their adaptability by reusing a core set of versatile parts and selectively incorporating more specialized parts.

The molecular characteristics of infiltrating GBM cells and their interactions with brain cells remain poorly understood, partly due to limited spatial tools for distinguishing tumor cells from those in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we introduce Spatially-resolved Chimeric AnalyzeR (SCAR), a computational tool for dissecting tumor-TME gene expression in spatial transcriptomics of human-mouse chimeric cancer models. SCAR reveals spatially distinct characteristics of GBM and their interactions with TME, identifying that infiltrative GBM up-regulates creatine kinase brain type (CKB) at the astrocyte-enriched leading edge compared to the tumor core. Mechanistically, GBM-secreted CKB catalyzes the extracellular conversion of astrocyte-supplied adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine into phosphocreatine, providing metabolic support for infiltrative tumor growth, which can be blocked by cyclocreatine. These results provide proof-of-concept validation of SCAR and demonstrate spatial context–dependent metabolic rewiring of GBM cells, with implications for therapies targeting infiltrative GBM.},

Here, we introduce high–molecular-weight poly(thioglycolic acid) (PTGA) that exhibits not only closed-loop recyclability but also i PP-like thermal properties, even superior mechanical and barrier properties, and processability well suited for common processing techniques such as blow molding into bottles. To circumvent long-standing challenges of extensive transthioesterification side reactions in the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of thioglycolide, which typically yielded only oligomers, we developed the interfacial chain-growth ROP occurring at the interface between the semicrystalline polymer surface and the monomer–organocatalyst solution phase, enabling the synthesis of high–molecular-weight PTGA. Overall, we show that PTGA is a scalable circular polymer that provides i PP-like properties and that the interfacial ROP method solves the challenges in typical solution-phase polymerization.},

  abstract     = {The plant cysteine protease metacaspases are structural homologs of animal caspases and play pivotal roles under biotic and abiotic stresses. However, whether metacaspases and purine-rich element (R-motif)–mediated defense messenger RNA translation are involved in plant antiviral immunity remains elusive. Here, we report that barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) infection activates metacaspase 4 (MC4) to cleave the RNA binding protein lupus autoantigen 1 (La1) behind residue arginine-448. The cleaved La1 1-448 version relocates to the cytoplasm and promotes the R-motif–mediated cap-independent defense mRNA translation. Moreover, MC4 overexpression restricts BSMV infection in tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ), whereas knockout of MC4 and knockdown of La1 are more susceptible to diverse plant virus infection. To counteract plant defense, the BSMV γb protein directly interacts with and inhibits the self-processing of MC4 and subsequent La1 cleavage, thereby impairing La1-mediated immune responses. Collectively, our findings unveil a hitherto unknown defense mechanism whereby the MC4-La1 cleavage module inhibits virus infection by coordinating R-motif–mediated defense mRNA translation.},

Actinoporins, a class of pore-forming proteins from sea anemones, target membranes to kill cells. Here, we report cryogenic electron microscopy structures of two actinoporins, fragaceatoxin C and sticholysin II, reconstituted in lipid membranes. The structures reveal an ordered arrangement of dozens of lipid molecules that form an integral part of the pore architecture. We also captured distinct oligomeric intermediates, arc-shaped assemblies with monomers in transitional conformations, representing key snapshots along the pore formation pathway. These data provide direct structural evidence for a stepwise mechanism in which monomers sequentially bind the membrane and undergo conformational changes that drive pore assembly and membrane disruption. Our findings reveal how these proteins reshape membranes and offer mechanistic insights into their cytolytic activity.

Stem cells have shown potential for DED treatment, but the main challenge lies in improving cell delivery effectiveness. Here, we developed eye drops for autoimmune DED treatment using porous arginine–glycine–aspartic acid (RGD)–modified alginate microcarriers with mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) (RGD-Alg@MSCs). These microcarriers provided a favorable microenvironment for large-scale cell expansion while maintaining stemness with ideal mechanical properties for ocular application. In vitro, RGD-Alg@MSCs demonstrated significantly enhanced therapeutic effects compared to conventional MSCs, including improved cell viability, reduced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species, and enhanced release of immunomodulatory factors. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct molecular mechanisms underlying these enhanced therapeutic effects. In the mouse model, RGD-Alg@MSCs exhibited prolonged ocular retention and enhanced tear production, promoted corneal healing, and suppressed inflammation by inhibiting dendritic cell activation and T H 17 differentiation. Our microcarrier system substantially improves stem cell delivery efficiency for treating autoimmune DED.},

LD function depends on a highly dynamic LD surface proteome. Key proteins continuously exchange between the ER and LDs; however, the mechanisms governing the interorganelle movement and accumulation on the LD surface remain poorly understood. Here, we developed an ex cellulo tool introducing a classification of ER-derived proteins based on their different affinity for LDs. We find that proteins with higher LD affinity can effectively displace those with lower affinity from the LD surface, identifying steric hindrance as a key mechanism in regulating ER-to-LD protein transfer. Consistent with this model, we show that, during adipocyte differentiation Plin1—an adipocyte-specific high-affinity LD protein—reduces the recruitment of ER proteins with lower affinity by displacing them from the LD surface. These findings highlight lateral protein-protein exclusion as a fundamental mechanism in shaping the LD proteome.},

Previously, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), the source cells of myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system, have been linked to brain aging by their compromised differentiation and regeneration capability. Whether a myelination-independent function of OPCs is involved in brain aging remains unknown. In this study, we herein report a myelination-independent role of OPCs in exaggerating cognitive decline in the aging brain via suppressing neuronal plasticity. Our results demonstrate that macroautophagic flux declines in aged OPCs. Inactivation of autophagy promotes the senescence of OPCs, which activates C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3)/CCL5–C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 signaling. Through this, autophagy-defective OPCs impair glutamatergic transmission, neuronal excitability, and long-term potentiation, exaggerating the cognitive decline in the aging brain.

Sequencing these recombined barcodes enabled parallel fitness assessment of millions of double mutants. Applied to Streptococcus pneumoniae , this revealed functions for previously uncharacterized genes across diverse biological pathways.

The genetic interactions identified span a wide range of biochemical processes, revealing new factors in presumably well-studied pathways, exemplified by a cytidine triphosphate synthase PyrJ.

Shao et al . found that the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal domain was not required for recruiting splicing factors during co-transcriptional splicing. Instead, the Pol II subunit RPB9 directly interacted with the splicing factor U2AF1, whereas U2AF2 operated independently. There is thus a dynamic “U2AF cycle” that separates splicing into two phases: an early Pol II–dependent phase and a later Pol II–independent phase. These findings reshape our understanding of how splicing is regulated during transcription, with implications for gene expression and disease mechanisms. —Di Jiang Distinguishing functional splice sites from abundant cryptic sites in precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) represents a fundamental challenge in decoding mammalian genomes. We demonstrate that the specific RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit RPB9 directly interacts with the 3′ AG dinucleotide binding factor U2AF1 to initiate 3′ splice site recognition. Combined with recent structural insights into Pol II–mediated 5′ splice site selection, these findings support a cotranscriptional mechanism to recognize paired 3′ and 5′ splice sites across individual exons. These initial exon definition events facilitate the recruitment of U2AF2 to heterodimerize with U2AF1, which also triggers U2AF1 release from elongating Pol II. Collectively, these results reveal dynamic U2AF cycling that partitions Pol II subunit–facilitated splice site recognition and subsequent Pol II–independent spliceosome assembly steps during cotranscriptional splicing.},

The juxtaposition of these conditions might help to explain the origins of past “snowball” climates such as those seen in the Neoproterozoic. —Jesse Smith Negative feedback between climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), mediated by the weathering of silicate minerals on land, is thought to provide the primary regulation of Earth’s climate on geological timescales. By contrast, we found that faster feedbacks involving organic matter are not only critical to Earth system recovery but can also create unexpected instability. Our Earth system model experiments show how sedimentary organic carbon burial, amplified by redox-sensitive phosphorus regeneration, can outweigh silicate weathering and paradoxically drive climate overcooling in response to massive CO 2 release. This instability depends on the initial balance between silicate weathering and organic carbon burial in addition to the state of global phosphorus cycling. It is most strongly expressed at intermediate ocean redox states, which may help us understand the timing of past ice ages.},

An unknown feature of this relationship is how the termites prevent the nutritional “combs” they produce from being overtaken by other fungi such as filamentous Pseudoxylaria , which have been observed to overtake combs when termites are experimentally removed. Panchal et al . observed termites removing Pseudoxylaria and covering them with soil boluses, and fully encasing Pseudoxylaria successfully prevented its infection of combs (see the Perspective by Goes and Adams). Further experiments showed that soil boluses are effective because of the fungistatic properties of bacteria associated with the termites, which the termites selectively apply to the “weedy,” but not the crop, fungus. —Bianca Lopez The symbiotic agriculture of fungus-farming termites can collapse if they fail to prevent invading weeds. Previous studies suggest a role for symbiotic fungistatic microbes in bringing about weed control. However, how termites employ these microbes to suppress fungal weeds without affecting the fungal cultivar remains unknown. We show that the fungus-farming termite Odontotermes obesus uses specific behaviors to remove, isolate, and suppress the growth of the fungal weed Pseudoxylaria , primarily by encasing it with soil boluses containing fungistatic microbes. These behaviors efficiently suppress the weed without affecting the crop. This integration of specific behaviors with termite-derived microbes appears to be the proximate mechanism of how microbes are topically used by termites to confine the weed while keeping the crop unaffected.},

Beam-forming analysis of P-wave arrivals showed that 8 seconds after the earthquake, the rupture slowed when it encountered the Mendocino Triple Junction and then jumped to supershear velocity before moving onshore. —Angela Hessler Fault structure and rupture physics are deeply intertwined, and observations of this coupling are critical for understanding earthquake behavior. Rupture propagation is observable at fine scales using dense seismic networks. Fiber-optic sensing allows for long-term deployments of ultradense arrays that enable high-resolution measurements of infrequent, large earthquakes. We recorded the 2024 moment magnitude ( M w ) 7 Mendocino Fault earthquake with a nearby fiber-optic array and imaged its behavior with seismic beamforming. The rupture propagated to the east at subshear velocity; stagnated near the Mendocino Triple Junction, a zone of structural complexity; and subsequently transitioned to supershear velocity. The correlation between source physics and structure shows how lithospheric heterogeneity affects first-order characteristics of earthquake ruptures. Our results also demonstrate the potential for fiber-optic sensing to improve real-time estimation of key parameters for early warning.},

  abstract     = {In some model organisms, starvation is known to induce epigenetic changes that extend the life span of progeny of the hungry parent. Zhang et al . investigated the mechanism of these effects in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans (see the Perspective by Bohnert). Their studies implicated an enzyme, lysosomal lipase-like 4 (LIPL-4), in the process. From there, the authors pieced together parts of a pathway in which increased activity of LIPL-4 activated signaling in intestinal lysosomes led to increased transcription and production of a variant of histone H3.3. Protein-tagging experiments indicated that the histone could be transferred to the germline, where it was modified by a methyltransferase and transmitted to progeny, thus extending their life span. —L. Bryan Ray The epigenome is sensitive to metabolic inputs and is crucial for aging. Lysosomes act as a signaling hub to sense metabolic cues and regulate longevity. We found that lysosomal metabolic pathways signal through the epigenome to regulate transgenerational longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans . Activation of lysosomal lipid signaling and lysosomal adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) or reduction of lysosomal mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling increased the expression of a histone H3.3 variant and increased its methylation on K79, leading to life-span extension across multiple generations. This transgenerational prolongevity effect required intestine-to-germline transportation of histone H3.3 and a germline-specific H3K79 methyltransferase and was recapitulated by overexpressing H3.3 or the H3K79 methyltransferase. Thus, signals from a lysosome affect the epigenome and link the soma and germ line to mediate transgenerational inheritance of longevity.},

Queuine and other 7-deazapurine nucleobase analogs are commonly incorporated into tRNA and are nucleic acid modifications required for the regulation of cellular gene expression. Wassarman et al . discovered that bacterial antiphage defense enzymes can also attach 7-deazapurines to proteins, generating an N-terminal 7-amido-7-deazaguanine (NDG) modification through a conjugation reaction. Structures of the enzymes involved in this process reveal homology to canonical queuine biosynthetic enzymes and explain how NDG is attached to proteins to control immune activation. —Di Jiang 7-Deazapurines are nucleobase analogs essential for nucleic acid modifications in nearly all cellular life. In this study, we discovered a role for 7-deazapurines in protein modification within type IV cyclic oligonucleotide–based antiviral signaling system (CBASS) antiphage defense and defined functions for CBASS ancillary proteins Cap9 and Cap10 in nucleobase-protein conjugation. A structure of Cap10 revealed a transfer RNA transglycosylase family enzyme remodeled to bind a partner cGAS/DncV–like nucleotidyltransferase that is modified with an N-terminal 7-amido-7-deazaguanine (NDG) nucleobase. A structure of Cap9 explained how this QueC-like enzyme co-opts a 7-deazapurine biosynthetic reaction to install NDG. We show that Cap9, Cap10, and protein deazaguanylation are essential for host defense against phage infection. Our results define a 7-deazapurine protein modification and explain how nucleobase biosynthetic machinery has been repurposed for antiviral immunity.},

  abstract     = {Short-range order (SRO) refers to the tendency of atoms to arrange themselves in a crystal lattice over small distances (typically less than a few nanometers) without forming a fully ordered compound at long ranges. SRO in metals has been linked to properties of mechanical deformation, and in ceramics has been linked to properties related to diffusion. In semiconductors, the concept of SRO has only rarely been studied beyond theoretical predictions linking SRO to important changes in electronic band structure. Using energy-filtered electron microscopy and complementary simulations, Vogl et al . confirmed the presence of SRO in a germanium-silicon-tin semiconductor and identified the actual atomic structure of the SRO motifs. Their work explores an exciting area for understanding and controlling SRO in semiconductors. —Yury Suleymanov Chemical short-range ordering is expected to be a key factor for tuning the electronic structure of semiconductors. However, experimental evidence of short-range ordering is still lacking due to the challenge of characterizing atomic-scale ordering motifs. Here, we determined the presence of short-range order in a ternary GeSiSn semiconductor system using advanced energy-filtered four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy and large-scale atomistic models generated by a machine learning neuroevolution potential of first-principles accuracy. This approach revealed preferred ordering of different atomic species with the dominant occurrence of Si–Ge–Sn triplets. Our findings not only confirmed the presence of short-range order but also directly revealed the actual atomic structure, demonstrating the potential for informed atomic order–based band engineering as a third degree of freedom beyond composition and strain tuning.},

  abstract     = {Many animal species have evolved camouflage or aposematic (warning) coloration, color patterns that protect them from predation. Medina et al . designed a distributed experiment with artificial Lepidopteran prey to assess how characteristics of the ecosystem influenced the effectiveness of these strategies. They found that camouflage was more beneficial when it was rarely used by prey and in low-light environments, whereas warning coloration was less beneficial in high-predation environments, where competition between predators may motivate them to sample aposematic insects. This comparative analysis helps to explain the distribution and evolution of antipredator coloration. —Bianca Lopez Natural selection has repeatedly led to the evolution of two alternative antipredator color strategies—camouflage to avoid detection and aposematism to advertise unprofitability—but we lack understanding of how ecological context favors one strategy over the other. We conducted a globally replicated predation experiment at 21 sites on six continents to test how predator community, prey community, and visual environment influenced the predation risk of 15,018 artificial paper “moth” prey with cryptic or warning coloration. Results indicated that aposematic strategies fare better in environments with low predation intensity, whereas camouflage strategies are advantaged when other camouflaged prey species are rare and when light levels are low. This study demonstrates how multiple mechanisms shape antipredator strategies, helping to explain the evolution and global distribution of camouflaged and aposematic animals.},

Liu et al . demonstrated a quantum learning advantage in an optical system using entangled photons as probes to reduce the sampling complexity of the process by more than 11 orders of magnitude compared with classical probes. This result highlights a route to quantum enhanced learning protocols for machine learning and developing quantum technologies. — Ian S. Osborne Recent advances in quantum technologies have demonstrated that quantum systems can outperform classical ones in specific tasks, a concept known as quantum advantage. Although previous efforts have focused on computational speedups, a definitive and provable quantum advantage that is unattainable by any classical system has remained elusive. In this work, we demonstrate a provable photonic quantum advantage by implementing a quantum-enhanced protocol for learning a high-dimensional physical process. Using imperfect Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen entanglement, we achieve a sample complexity reduction of 11.8 orders of magnitude compared to classical methods without entanglement. These results show that large-scale, provable quantum advantage is achievable with current photonic technology and represent a key step toward practical quantum-enhanced learning protocols in quantum metrology and machine learning.},

  abstract     = {It is now well known that there were at one time many Homo lineages. Understanding of the differences among these lineages is largely dependent upon crania that are rare and often damaged and deformed by age. Feng et al . reconstructed the 1-million-year-old Yunxian 2 cranium using an approach that allowed for removal of much of the compression and distortion naturally present in the fossil. In doing so, they found that the cranium contained both primitive and derived traits and concluded that it is representative of the H. longi clade, which is sister to H. sapiens and likely contained the Denisovans. —Sacha Vignieri Diverse forms of Homo coexisted during the Middle Pleistocene. Whether these fossil humans represent different species or clades is debated. The ~1-million-year-old Yunxian 2 fossil from China is important for understanding the cladogenesis of Homo and the origin of Homo sapiens . In this study, we restored and reconstructed the distorted Yunxian 2 cranium using recently introduced technology. The results show that this cranium displays mosaic primitive and derived features. Morphometric and phylogenetic analyses suggest that it is an early member of the Asian H. longi clade, which includes the Denisovans and is the main part of the sister group to the H. sapiens clade. Both the H. sapiens and H. longi clades have deep roots extending beyond the Middle Pleistocene and probably experienced rapid early diversification. Yunxian 2 may preserve transitional features close to the origins of the two clades.},

Providing habitats in human-dominated landscapes is essential for maintaining populations and supporting ecosystem functions such as pollination, but habitat protection targets in such landscapes are poorly defined. Bishop et al . developed a framework to assess habitat needs based on the threshold at which populations respond more to increased habitat quality than quantity. They used a meta-analysis to define habitat quantity thresholds, using floral resources as a proxy for habitat quality, for insect pollinators (bumble bees, solitary bees, butterflies, and hoverflies) in agricultural landscapes. Hoverflies had a much lower threshold because of low habitat quality, and this framework could be adapted to guide targets for other taxa. —Bianca Lopez Biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes is declining, but evidence-based conservation targets to guide international policies for such landscapes are lacking. We present a framework for informing habitat conservation policies based on the enhancement of habitat quantity and quality and define thresholds of habitat quantity at which it becomes effective to also prioritize habitat quality. We applied this framework to insect pollinators, an important part of agroecosystem biodiversity, by synthesizing 59 studies from 19 countries. Given low habitat quality, hoverflies had the lowest threshold at 6% semi-natural habitat cover, followed by solitary bees (16%), bumble bees (18%), and butterflies (37%). These figures represent minimum habitat thresholds in agricultural landscapes, but when habitat quantity is restricted, marked increases in quality are required to reach similar outcomes.},

The forest’s integrity is imminently threatened by the development of Mantuli Luxury Estate, a resort set to convert an estimated 17% of the forest reserve into a sprawling complex of villas and swimming pools (2). Zanzibar should reconsider the location of the resort to protect its vulnerable forests.},

  abstract     = {Neuronal control of skeletal muscle function is ubiquitous across species for locomotion and doing work. In particular, emergent behaviors of neurons in biohybrid neuromuscular systems can advance bioinspired locomotion research. Although recent studies have demonstrated that chemical or optogenetic stimulation of neurons can control muscular actuation through the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the correlation between neuronal activities and resulting modulation in the muscle responses is less understood, hindering the engineering of high-level functional biohybrid systems. Here, we developed NMJ-based biohybrid crawling robots with optogenetic mouse motor neurons, skeletal muscles, 3D-printed hydrogel scaffolds, and integrated onboard wireless micro–light-emitting diode (μLED)–based optoelectronics. We investigated the coupling of the light stimulation and neuromuscular actuation through power spectral density (PSD) analysis. We verified the modulation of the mechanical functionality of the robot depending on the frequency of the optical stimulation to the neural tissue. We demonstrated continued muscle contraction up to 20 minutes after a 1-minute-long pulsed 2-hertz optical stimulation of the neural tissue. Furthermore, the robots were shown to maintain their mechanical functionality for more than 2 weeks. This study provides insights into reliable neuronal control with optoelectronics, supporting advancements in neuronal modulation, biohybrid intelligence, and automation.},

  abstract     = {Reading fluency is a vital building block for developing literacy, yet the best way to practice fluency—reading aloud—can cause anxiety severe enough to inhibit literacy development in ways that can have an adverse effect on students through adulthood. One promising intervention to mitigate oral reading anxiety is to have children read aloud to a robot. Although observations in prior work have suggested that people likely feel more comfortable in the presence of a robot instead of a human, few studies have empirically demonstrated that people feel less anxious performing in front of a robot compared with a human or used objective physiological indicators to identify decreased anxiety. To investigate whether a robotic reading companion could reduce reading anxiety felt by children, we conducted a within-subjects study where children aged 8 to 11 years ( n = 52) read aloud to a human and a robot individually while being monitored for physiological responses associated with anxiety. We found that children exhibited fewer physiological indicators of anxiety, specifically vocal jitter and heart rate variability, when reading to the robot compared with reading to a person. This paper provides strong evidence that a robot’s presence has an effect on the anxiety a person experiences while doing a task, offering justification for the use of robots in a wide-reaching array of social interactions that may be anxiety inducing.},

  abstract     = {According to productive failure (PF) theory, experiencing failure during problem-solving can enhance students’ knowledge acquisition in subsequent instruction. However, challenging students with problems beyond their current capabilities may strain their skills, prior knowledge, and emotional well-being. To address this, we designed a social robot–assisted teaching activity in which students observed a robot’s unsuccessful problem-solving attempts, offering a PF-like preparatory effect without requiring direct failure. We conducted two classroom-based studies in a middle school setting to evaluate the method’s effectiveness. In study 1 ( N = 135), we compared three instructional methods—observing robot failure (RF), individual problem-solving failure, and direct instruction—in an eighth-grade mathematics lesson. Students in the RF condition showed the greatest gains in conceptual understanding and reported lower social pressure, although no significant differences were found in procedural knowledge or knowledge transfer. Follow-up study 2 ( N = 110) further validated the method’s effectiveness in supporting knowledge acquisition after a 2-week robot-involved adaptation phase, when the novelty effect had largely subsided. Students confirmed their perception of the robot as a peer, and they offered positive evaluations of its intelligence and neutral views of its anthropomorphism. Our findings suggest that observing the robot’s failure has a comparable, or even greater, effect on knowledge acquisition than experiencing failure firsthand. These results underscore the value of social robots as peers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education and highlight the potential of integrating robotics with evidence-based teaching strategies to enhance learning outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent miniature systems capable of wireless sensing and manipulation hold considerable promise for advancing biomedical applications. However, the development of these systems has been substantially hindered by sensing-actuation incompatibility at small scales. To overcome this challenge, we propose a robotic sensing approach that integrates embedded ultrasonic soft sensors (EUSSs) with magnetic actuators, resulting in a wireless sensor-integrated miniature machine with seamless integration and minimal interference between fields. The EUSS, with its compact dimensions (1.3 millimeters by 1.3 millimeters by 1.6 millimeters), softness (98 kilopascals), and lightweight design (4.6 milligrams), is compatible with both soft and rigid components in terms of deformability and size. By engineering onboard transducers and using passive ultrasound communication along with external magnetic fields, we could wirelessly detect and regulate environmental parameters such as force, vibration, viscosity, and temperature. Demonstrations in rabbit and porcine models show the potential for robotic feedback control, accurate drug dosing, and in situ physiological monitoring, paving the way for real-world applications of intelligent miniature machines.},

  abstract     = {Dynamics models that predict the effects of physical interactions are essential for planning and control in robotic manipulation. Although models based on physical principles often generalize well, they typically require full-state information, which can be difficult or impossible to extract from perception data in complex, real-world scenarios. Learning-based dynamics models provide an alternative by deriving state transition functions purely from perceived interaction data, enabling the capture of complex, hard-to-model factors and predictive uncertainty and accelerating simulations that are often too slow for real-time control. Recent successes in this field have demonstrated notable advancements in robot capabilities, including long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects, granular materials, and complex multiobject interactions such as stowing and packing. A crucial aspect of these investigations is the choice of state representation, which determines the inductive biases in the learning system for reduced-order modeling of scene dynamics. This article provides a timely and comprehensive review of current techniques and trade-offs in designing learned dynamics models, highlighting their role in advancing robot capabilities through integration with state estimation and control and identifying critical research gaps for future exploration.},

  abstract     = {Modern robotic manufacturing requires collision-free coordination of multiple robots to complete numerous tasks in shared, obstacle-rich workspaces. Although individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning under spatiotemporal constraints remain computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales. Existing multiarm systems deployed in industry rely on human intuition and experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on procedurally generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot configurations, and task distributions. It uses a graph representation of scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through RL to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the subproblems of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and scalability of our planner also open the door to capabilities such as fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based replanning, where rapid adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.},

  abstract     = {Although T helper 17 (T H 17) cells protect against infection, they can adopt a pathogenic state that drives autoimmunity. Papadopoulou et al . found that oxidative phosphorylation promoted the nonpathogenic T H 17 cell state in mice and depended on the activation of the kinase AMPK by the adenosine receptor A 2A R. AMPK reduced the abundance of the histone acetyltransferase PCAF, leading to reduced expression of genes involved in aerobic glycolysis and an increase in the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Disrupting this pathway enabled T H 17 cells to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice. —Annalisa M. VanHook Metabolic reprogramming controls protective and pathogenic T helper 17 (T H 17) cell responses. When naïve T cells are differentiated into T H 17 cells in vitro, the presence of the cytokine activin A promotes their maturation into a nonpathogenic state. Here, we found that nonpathogenic T H 17 cells induced by activin A displayed reduced aerobic glycolysis and increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In response to activin A, signaling through the adenosine A 2A receptor (A 2A R) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) enhanced OXPHOS and reprogrammed pathogenic T H 17 cells toward nonpathogenic states that did not induce central nervous system autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. In pathogenic T H 17 cells, the transcriptional coactivator p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) increased acetylation at histone 3 Lys 9 (H3K9ac) of genes involved in aerobic glycolysis and T H 17 pathogenic programs. In contrast, in nonpathogenic activin A–treated T H 17 cells, AMPK signaling suppressed PCAF-mediated H3K9ac modification of genes involved in aerobic metabolism and enhanced H3K9ac modification of genes involved in OXPHOS and nonpathogenic T H 17 programs. Together, our findings uncover A 2A R-AMPK signaling as a central metabolic checkpoint that suppresses T H 17 cell pathogenicity.},

  abstract     = {So-called inhibitory coreceptors on T cells are targeted by checkpoint inhibitors to enhance antitumor immunity. Alamir et al. used a tumor cell–derived spheroid system to investigate the role of the coregulatory receptor TIM3 on murine and human cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). Imaging and functional studies showed that in the relatively immunosuppressive three-dimensional environment of spheroids, TIM3 inhibited CTL responses, whereas in two-dimensional systems, it played a costimulatory role. These findings suggest that TIM3 amplifies either inhibitory or stimulatory signals in T cells in a context-dependent manner, which could help inform the development of therapies that target it. —John F. Foley TIM3 is a coregulatory receptor that is highly abundant on multiple immune cell types, including T cells in response to prolonged exposure to antigen, and it marks functionally suppressed cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the tumor microenvironment. TIM3 exhibits inhibitory function in vivo but paradoxically has costimulatory T cell signaling capability in vitro. Here, we found that TIM3 directly inhibited the function of murine and human CTLs in direct interaction with target tumor cell spheroids. TIM3 regulated the ability of suppressed CTLs to polarize their actin cytoskeleton as a required step in cytolysis. Whereas the expression of the proposed TIM3 ligands CEACAM1 and galectin 9 in trans on target tumor cells enhanced TIM3 function, expression of CEACAM1 in cis on CTLs had the opposite effect. TIM3 functioned as an inhibitory receptor on spheroid-suppressed CTLs but not on active CTLs in a two-dimensional tissue culture model. Together, these data suggest that TIM3 enhances T cell function, serving as either a coinhibitory or costimulatory receptor depending on the functional context of the T cell on which it is expressed.},
