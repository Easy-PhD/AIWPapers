  abstract     = {The advent of location information platforms based on global positioning systems has led to a proliferation of spatiotemporal trajectory data, which has, in turn, made the analysis of such data available to a broad range of applications, including traffic prediction, route planning, and trajectory similarity computation. Traditional methods for calculating trajectory similarity often suffer from high computational costs due to quadratic time complexity, particularly when dealing with large datasets. To this end, deep learning-based approaches to trajectory similarity learning have been proposed, with a view to offering enhanced efficiency and adaptability in comparison with traditional methods. However, these methods primarily focus on spatial trajectory similarity and fail to capture important temporal periodicity. Moreover, most of them directly use recurrent neural networks to obtain trajectory representations, while ignoring the spatial proximity information between neighboring regions. To address these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced spatiotemporal trajectory network, named GST, which integrates both spatial and temporal information to effectively learn trajectory similarity. Specifically, our model incorporates a graph neural network to capture the spatial proximity relationships and a time-embedding module to model the temporal periodicity information, thereby providing a more comprehensive spatiotemporal trajectory representation learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on 2 real-life datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy. In addition, ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed spatiotemporal learning mechanism.},

  abstract     = {From smart cities to healthcare, the internet of things (IoT) has transformed numerous industries. However, this expansion has raised security concerns, particularly cyberattacks. Traditional IoT intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have high false-positive rates and low detection accuracy due to IoT devices and traffic patterns. To overcome these challenges, this research proposes an intelligent-computing-based time series IDS that utilizes sophisticated data augmentation, signal transformation, and deep learning methods. The system begins by augmenting minority-class samples using conditional generative adversarial networks to handle class imbalance. The augmented dataset is then transformed into signal representations based on mel frequency cepstral coefficients, allowing the model to capture both the frequency and temporal characteristics of network traffic. Finally, a hybrid convolutional-neural-network–long-short-term-memory (CNN–LSTM) architecture is trained to identify anomalous behaviors with enhanced accuracy and lower false-positive rates. The proposed model utilizes the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity CICIoT2023 dataset, which is widely used for network security experiments. The results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional deep learning models in terms of accuracy, precision, and false-positive rate. Specifically, the proposed system improves accuracy by 5% to 10% across different attack types while reducing false-positive rates considerably. The research presents a detailed exploration of the advantages of signal transformation and explains how the CNN and LSTM models complement each other in detecting anomalies. This framework addresses the pressing need for intelligent time series analysis in cybersecurity through the introduction of a scalable and interpretable IDS solution specifically designed for IoT environments.},

The microbiota community determines the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in cancer immunotherapy; however, mechanisms able to improve this function are not known. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released by the microbiota restricts the sIgA repertoire by limiting T follicular helper (T FH ) cell activity in the Peyer’s patches via stimulation of the ionotropic P2X7 receptor. We show that sIgA amplification by oral administration of the ATP hydrolyzing enzyme apyrase corrects enteropathic features of ICB and improves therapeutic efficacy. Consistent with sIgA function in reshaping the gut ecosystem and enhancing ICB, IgA −/− mice did not show any improvement of antitumor response by apyrase administration. Mechanistically, data in mice and patients with cancer suggest that invigorated enterotropic cytotoxic T cells expressing the chemokine receptor CCR9 replenish the tumor microenvironment in a CCL25-mediated manner and control tumor growth, resulting in improved ICB efficacy.},

Although charge carrier mobility in single-crystalline organic semiconductors (OSCs) reaches 10 square centimeters per volt per second (cm 2 V −1 s −1 ), it is predominantly limited by molecular vibrations excited at room temperature. The extent to which mobility in single-crystalline OSCs can be increased remains a central question. Here, we demonstrate charge transport in a clean two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG) in uniaxially strained, single-crystalline OSCs at cryogenic temperatures, with minimized lattice vibrations. Hall effect measurements reveal a mobility of 117 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at 2 kelvin under 2.8% compressional strain, with an extraordinarily large piezoresistive effect and low sheet resistivity of 550 ohms, one-fifth of the lowest resistivity in unstrained samples. These clean systems offer opportunities to explore intrinsic strain-induced charge transport physics, where condensed matter phenomena, characterized by weakly bonded molecular orbitals, combine electronic correlation and lattice degrees of freedom.},

Analysis of this structure, together with structure-guided mutagenesis and functional assays, reveals how GOLPH3 uses coincidence detection of COPI and lipids to engage Golgi residents preferentially at late cisternae. Our findings rationalize the logic of cisternal maturation and explain how COPI can engage different types of substrates in different Golgi cisternae to retrieve some proteins back to the ER while retaining others within the Golgi apparatus.},

The engineered SMP-frame adhesive structure captures targets with normalized kinetic energies exceeding 3800 joules per square meter, empowered by the intrinsic viscoelasticity of the material to provide both strong energy dissipation and rapid adhesive interface strengthening. The dynamic strengthening mechanism delays crack propagation and greatly enhances detachment toughness, enabling unprecedented rebound suppression within the short timescales of collision.

In this study, we use cutting-edge experimental techniques to probe the pressure evolution of the relaxation spectrum in a Zr 46.8 Ti 8.2 Cu 7.5 Ni 10 Be 27.5 metallic glass across gigapascal pressure ranges. Our findings reveal two distinct relaxation mechanisms under high pressure: In the β-relaxation regime, compression drives the system with reduced atomic mobility and enhanced structural disorder, without appreciable density changes. Conversely, α-relaxation under pressure promotes density-driven structural ordering that improves thermal stability. Notably, the transition between these regimes occurs at a constant T / T g,P ratio, independent of applied pressure. These results provide crucial insights for decoupling the competing structural and relaxation contributions to glass stability, establishing a systematic framework for tailoring glass properties through controlled thermomechanical processing.},

Nef is a multifunctional, immunomodulatory protein that downmodulates cell surface proteins, including CD4 and MHC class I (MHC-I), which are important for T cell–mediated immunity. In addition, Nef also regulates cell-intrinsic immunity—Nef boosts the infectivity of virions produced and released from HIV-infected cells, at least in part, by counteracting the antiviral activity of transmembrane proteins SERINC3 and SERINC5. Here, we show that Nef proteins derived from many primary isolates of HIV-1 restore infectivity in interferon-treated cells and confer resistance to the antiviral protein interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) in a SERINC3/5-independent manner. Using Nef derived from primary HIV-1 clade C infection, we found that Nef interacts with IFITM3 in membranes, reduces IFITM3 incorporation into HIV-1 virions, and restores HIV-1 fusion with target cells. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized immunomodulatory role for Nef in the setting of the interferon-induced antiviral state during HIV-1 infection.},

  abstract     = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 epidemic is relatively under control due to the rapid development and deployment of vaccines and a few drugs. However, challenges persist, as new variants and issues with vaccine durability may compromise their effectiveness. Here, we report the discovery and evaluation of 1′-cyanocytidine (CNC), a nontoxic, next-generation nucleoside analog that displays submicromolar inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in various cell and 3D HAE-ALI primary culture systems. Intracellularly, CNC is metabolized to its active 5′-triphosphate form (CNC-TP), targeting the viral RNA–dependent RNA polymerase. Pre–steady-state kinetic analysis revealed CNC-TP is a reversible, competitive inhibitor. The 5′-isobutyryl ester prodrug of CNC (CN iBu C), which rapidly converts to CNC in mouse and hamster plasma, substantially reduced viral RNA levels and lung infectious virus titers in a Syrian hamster model after intraperitoneal and oral dosing. With favorable pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and safety profiles, CNC and CN iBu C represent promising candidates for SARS-CoV-2 therapy.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of internet of things, big data, and artificial intelligence is propelling sports science into a data-driven era, demanding real-time, multidimensional athletic performance monitoring. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have demonstrated exceptional potential in intelligent sports. However, the complexity and volume of TENG-generated data pose challenges for manual analysis. Machine learning (ML), with strengths in pattern recognition and adaptive processing, provides a powerful solution to enhance TENG-based sensing signal interpretation. This review systematically explores the integration of ML and TENG technology for intelligent sports. First, the fundamental theory and basic knowledge of TENGs are introduced, highlighting their versatility in sports sensing systems. Subsequently, a comprehensive overview of ML models for TENG signal analysis is discussed. Recent advancements of ML-assisted TENG-based intelligent sports applications, including sports training evaluation, sports health monitoring, and virtual/augmented reality sports, are then highlighted. Last, current challenges and future prospects of TENG-based intelligent sports systems are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Intracellular Ca 2+ controls various cellular functions, and local Ca 2+ dynamics are tightly regulated upon environmental cues. How cellular Ca 2+ balance is maintained during stress remains unresolved. Here, we identify an intracellular phosphoregulatory module comprising calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK)–ER-type Ca 2+ -ATPases 1 (ECA1) that integrates [Ca 2+ ] cyt flux with abscisic acid (ABA) homeostasis to modulate root growth under osmotic stress. Pharmacological and genetic disruption of ECA1-mediated Ca 2+ efflux triggered enhanced [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients and [ABA] cyt , exacerbating root growth hypersensitivity to osmotic stress. Biochemical assays reveal that CPK2/6/11 directly bind and phosphorylate ECA1, enhancing its Ca 2+ -pumping activity to restore cytosolic Ca 2+ equilibrium and subsequently prevent ABA cyt overaccumulation. Genetic analysis shows that eca1cpk11 phenocopied eca1 hypersensitivity, while triple and quadruple mutants amplified osmotic sensitivity, demonstrating that CPKs and ECA1 function as a cooperative phosphoregulatory hub regulating Ca 2+ signaling and root growth. Our work resolves a critical gap by elucidating how plants couple ionic and hormonal messengers to balance plant growth and stress resilience.},

During ischemia, mammalian CI transitions from a turnover-ready, structurally “closed” state toward a dormant “open” state that prevents it from functioning in reverse during reperfusion to produce reactive oxygen species. Unfortunately, simpler, genetically tractable CI models do not recapitulate the same regulatory behavior, compromising mechanistic studies. Here, we report the structure of isolated CI from the yeast Pichia pastoris ( Pp -CI) and identify distinct closed and open states that resemble those of mammalian CI. Notably, a hitherto-unknown protein (NUQM) completes an interdomain bridge in only the closed state, implying that NUQM stabilizes it by restricting the conformational changes of opening. The direct correlation of NUQM binding with closed/open status in Pp -CI provides opportunities for investigating regulatory mechanisms relevant to reversible catalysis and ischemia-reperfusion injury.},

Mitochondria are also a key source of intracellular ROS, yet their contribution to plant immunity is poorly characterized. Here, we studied mitochondrial ROS (mROS) function in plant-pathogen interactions, deploying genetically encoded sensors, assorted fluorescent markers, and genetic approaches to track mROS, specifically H 2 O 2 , dynamics and identify interorganelle contact sites. We unexpectedly found a mitochondria–endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ROS signal cascade functioning independently of apoplastic and chloroplastic ROS in plant immunity. mROS initiate immune responses induced by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora parasitica and promote mitochondria-ER association. These enhanced mitochondria-ER membrane associations are required for transfer of mROS signals and initiation of extensive unfolded protein responses. We conclude that mROS transfer via mitochondria-ER membranes to the ER lumen is an underappreciated yet essential component in plant defense.},

Like humans, 72% of mammals exhibited a female life expectancy advantage, while 68% of birds showed a male advantage, as expected from the harmful effects of sex chromosomes described by the heterogametic sex hypothesis. Yet, sex differences varied widely. In zoos, we found strong evidence that this variation generally correlated with both the mating system and sexual size dimorphism. Although with weaker evidence, the patterns remained consistent in populations from the wild, with an even larger effect of the mating system. Thus, even in zoos, where environmental pressures are largely reduced, precopulatory sexual selection seems to play a fundamental role in shaping sex differences in life expectancy in mammals and birds.},

In contrast, two-dimensional materials, with their all-surface nature, offer a platform for tuning quantum emitters via chemical functionalization. Because of its semiconducting properties that enable electrical addressability, monolayer WSe 2 is a promising candidate for quantum emission, although the complex interplay between point defects and the localized strain needed to activate quantum emission leads to poor spectral purity. Here, we demonstrate that functionalizing monolayer WSe 2 with conformal adlayers of 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) improves quantum emission spectral purity. Optical spectroscopy reveals that PTCDA functionalization lowers defect activation energies by 10 meV and induces a 30 nm redshift in quantum emission wavelength, while preserving the bright and dark exciton energies of monolayer WSe 2 . First-principles calculations corroborate these findings, thus providing molecular-level insight into the underlying mechanism of enhanced spectral purity.},

This approach provided the first quantitative and spatial analysis of the translational machinery within stress granules. Our findings suggest that stress granules have a limited impact on global translation regulation but serve to protect small ribosomal subunits and preinitiation complexes from degradation. Numerical simulations based on a phase-field model accurately reproduced the spatial distribution of ribosomal components inside and outside the stress granules, shedding light on the thermodynamic principles governing this process.},

Nonlinear spectroscopy cannot unambiguously distinguish coherent electronic dynamics from underdamped vibrational motion, and rigorous numerical simulations of realistic microscopic models have been intractable. Experimental studies supported by approximate numerical treatments that severely coarse-grain the vibrational environment have claimed the absence of long-lived quantum effects. Here, we report the nonperturbative, accurate microscopic model simulations of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex and demonstrate the presence of long-lived excitonic coherences at 77 kelvin and room temperature, which persist on picosecond timescales, similar to those of excitation energy transfer. Furthermore, we show that full microscopic simulations of nonlinear optical spectra are essential for identifying experimental evidence of quantum effects in photosynthesis, as approximate theoretical methods can misinterpret experimental data and potentially overlook quantum phenomena.},

A coplanar capacitive sensor was attached to the stent graft using a specially developed flexible thermal adhesive to monitor blood leakage, without compromising the stent graft’s function. It seamlessly folds and unfolds with the stent, allowing implantation through catheter-based procedures. Experimental validation confirmed that the sensor does not induce blood leakage and demonstrated long-term stability and functionality under vascular and dynamic conditions.

Comprehensive magnetostratigraphic sampling shows highly variable directions, consistent with a rapidly changing geomagnetic field along a longitudinally preferred band. High-precision geochronology constrains the geomagnetic variability to ~568 to 562 million years and suggests rates that are likely too rapid for true polar wander or plate tectonic interpretations. Comparison of igneous- and sedimentary-derived data, using a new statistical approach combining Bingham and Fisher distributions, indicates a high-inclination paleomagnetic direction that is compatible with independent evidence for regional glaciation.

  abstract     = {Depression presents challenges in understanding its biological basis and developing effective treatments. Posttranslational modifications provide critical insights into molecular mechanisms of disorders, yet their role in depression remains underexplored. Glycosylation has been particularly difficult to study due to its heterogeneous nature and analytical challenges, despite its potential to uncover previously unknown mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrate how chronic stress alters region-specific O-glycosylation across multiple brain regions, with a particular focus on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Our findings reveal significant changes in sialylated O-glycosylation patterns mediated by St3gal1 , a sialyltransferase essential for O-glycosylation. Notably, knockdown of St3gal1 in nonstressed mice induced depressive-like behaviors, whereas its overexpression in stressed mice alleviated depressive symptoms, underscoring its regulatory role in stress resilience. In addition, we identify potential glycoprotein targets and downstream regulators of St3gal1 , including neurexin 2 (NRXN2) in the medial PFC (mPFC), offering insights into molecular pathways linking O-glycosylation to depressive-like behaviors.},

  abstract     = {The uterine cervix is a critical mucosal interface that balances immune defense and reproductive function, yet how its distinct epithelial compartments coordinate responses to infection remains unclear. Here, we integrate patient-derived three-dimensional cervical organoids, single-cell transcriptomics, and native tissue analysis to construct a high-resolution atlas of epithelial cell diversity and immune dynamics during Chlamydia trachomatis infection. We demonstrate that cervical organoids closely resemble native tissue at transcriptional and cellular levels, identifying epithelial subtypes with region-specific immune specializations. Upon infection, ectocervical epithelia reinforce barrier integrity, whereas endocervical epithelia, particularly uninfected bystander cells, exhibit extensive transcriptional reprogramming characterized by robust interferon activation, antigen presentation, and antimicrobial defense. Infection profoundly reshapes epithelial intercellular communication, positioning bystander cells as major contributors to signaling networks coordinating immune responses and tissue regeneration. Our findings highlight a sophisticated epithelial-intrinsic immune network critical for cervical mucosal defense and establish a physiologically relevant platform for studying host-pathogen interactions and guiding targeted mucosal therapies against reproductive tract infections and pathologies.},

This ability gives pathogens a competitive edge over commensal microbiota, which can drive virulence in the inflamed gut. Despite such a critical function, the molecular mechanisms underlying the synthesis of Eut BMCs remain elusive. We report a systematic study for dissecting the molecular basis underlying Eut BMC assembly in Salmonella . We determined the functions of individual constituent proteins in the structure and function of Eut BMCs and demonstrated that EutQ is essential for cargo encapsulation and Eut BMC formation through specific association with the shell and cargo enzymes. We found that Eut proteins can self-assemble to form cargo and shell aggregates independently in vivo and that the biogenesis of Eut BMCs follows a “shell-initiated” pathway. Cargo enzymes exhibit dynamic liquid-like organization within the Eut BMC. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the structure and assembly of the Eut BMC that serves as a paradigm for membraneless organelles.},

Glaciers in the western United States are projected to disappear by 2100 CE, but whether they were previously absent in the current interglacial (past 11,700 years) remains debated. Here, we present evidence that two of the largest glaciers in California’s Sierra Nevada near Yosemite National Park persisted throughout the Holocene. Cosmogenic in situ carbon-14 and beryllium-10 exposure dating in newly exposed proglacial bedrock indicates continuous Holocene cover, likely by ice. At a nearby smaller glacier, bedrock exposure-burial ages suggest glacier expansion at ~7 thousand years ago, earlier than previously recognized. Moraine exposure ages at these sites and the Sierra Nevada’s largest glacier are distributed across the past several thousand years, suggesting that glaciers were near their preindustrial extent for much of the late Holocene. These findings imply that a glacier-free Sierra Nevada is unprecedented since before the Holocene. Future alpine glacial environments in California are thereby likely a no-analog scenario within the current interglacial.},

Herein we demonstrate the first example of a carbene-catalyzed atroposelective dynamic kinetic acylation reaction via transient seven-membered cyclic hemiacetals. The key for the success of this reaction relies on the formation and configurational instability of the transient seven-membered cyclic hemiacetal intermediate. The axially chiral biaryl aldehyde products obtained via this method can undergo a series of further transformations. Notably, one of the axially chiral biaryl aldehyde products can be used as the key and common intermediate for the asymmetric synthesis of natural product steganone.

In lymphoid organs, the adult T reg pool is continuously replenished with cells generated at different ages. In contrast, the skin retains a large fraction of T regs that colonize the tissue during the neonatal period, with minimal turnover in adulthood. The liver, lungs, and colon exhibit intermediate T reg renewal dynamics. Notably, neonatal T regs that persist into adulthood display a more activated phenotype and express markers associated with tissue-resident T regs and type 2 immunity.

Here, we designed and developed pseudo-rhodamine electrochromic molecules through a “tandem all-in-one” synthetic strategy that covalently integrates three distinct functional units within a single molecule. This molecular architecture simultaneously achieves exceptionally high heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant and ultrahigh molar absorption coefficient. We verified the underlying electrochromic mechanism involving a two-electron redox process of pyridinecarboxylic acid derivative units coupled with reversible pseudo-rhodamine spirocyclization. By implementing this tandem all-in-one molecular engineering strategy, different functional subunits within the electrochromic molecule are mutually bonded to interact through alternating reaction sequences, enabling near-synchronous operation of individual units. The resulting electrochromic display demonstrates ultrafast response speeds (35 milliseconds for bleaching and 65 milliseconds for coloration), capable of smooth video playback and rapid switching between digital states. The design principle showcases a prospective design pathway for the development of ultrafast electrochromic video displays.},

We found that reminders reduced warrants issued for missed court dates by ~20%, with 12.1% of clients in control issued a warrant compared to 9.7% of clients in treatment. Further, we found that incarceration from missed court dates dropped by a similar amount, from 6.6% in control to 5.2% in treatment.

Overall, most warmwater species (65% of populations) exhibited increases in productivity from warming, while slightly more than half of the cool-/cold-water species (53% of populations) experienced reduced productivity. Populations closer to their carrying capacity showed greater resilience to warming. For the majority of populations (92%), fishing had a more pronounced effect on population dynamics than warming during the time period examined. Therefore, while warming is likely to increasingly threaten many fish populations, effective local fishery management remains a key lever to mitigate these impacts.},

On the basis of accurate chronological frames and faunal quantitative data, we demonstrate that extinct megafauna were the principal prey item of early foragers from ~13,000 to 11,600 calibrated years before the present, and this fact had likely been obscured by lumping together pre- and postextinction archaeological faunal assemblages within a single chronological window. We also show that the most exploited extinct taxa were at the apex of the ranking of the prey choice model. After the diversity and abundance of megafauna had already declined severely (~12,500 B.P.), and especially after they had virtually disappeared (~11,600 B.P.), the human diet was broadened. This strongly reinforces the idea that humans must be central to the debate on Quaternary extinctions in South America.},

  abstract     = {While archaeal viruses show a stunning diversity of morphologies, many bear a notable resemblance to tailed bacterial phages. This raises fundamental questions: Do all tailed viruses share a common origin and do they infect their hosts in similar ways? Answering these questions requires high-resolution structural insights, yet no complete atomic models of archaeal viruses have been available. Here, we present the near-atomic resolution structure of Haloferax tailed virus 1 (HFTV1), an archaeal virus thriving in extreme salinity. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we resolve the architecture and assembly of all structural proteins and capture conformational transitions associated with DNA ejection. Our data reveal genome spooling within the capsid and identify putative receptor-binding and catalytic sites for host recognition and infection. These findings uncover key mechanisms of archaeal virus assembly, principles of virus-host interactions, and evolutionary links connecting archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic viruses.},

  abstract     = {Clinical translation of therapeutic messenger RNA (mRNA) technologies, particularly in solid tumors, has been limited due to unavailability of effective delivery systems. Here, we describe an mRNA delivery system that overcomes current challenges by co-encapsulating gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and mRNA within non-ionic surfactant vehicles (NSVs) to create “Aurniosoves” (AuNSVs). Through in vitro and in vivo studies, we demonstrate that AuNSVs improve vector accumulation and uptake within the tumor, resulting in enhanced protein expression and therapeutic efficacy. Mechanistically, these effects are the result of an iterative delivery process in which AuNSVs enter cells initially through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and release AuNPs into the cytoplasm. AuNPs subsequently adsorb and inactivate cellular trafficking regulators PP2A and Rab7, producing two effects: (i) rapid entry of additional AuNSVs through activation of caveolin-mediated endocytosis (CvME) and (ii) endosomal escape through inhibited endolysosomal fusion. We propose that AuNSVs be exploited as next-generation mRNA delivery systems.},

This ensures both selective pressure against deleterious mutations and the high expression of the GOI. By leveraging a machine learning framework, we predict optimal GOI-EG pairs on the basis of bioinformatic and biophysical features, identify linkers likely to minimize protein misfolding, and optimize DNA sequences for stability and expression. Experimental validation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated substantial improvements in stability and productivity for fluorescent proteins and human proinsulin.

  abstract     = {Phosphate (Pi) is an essential nutrient that frequently limits plant growth because of its low availability in soils, especially during early seedling development in Arabidopsis . Under Pi-deficient conditions, etiolated seedlings exhibit elongated hypocotyls, shortened roots, and small, pale cotyledons—a morphological adaptation that enhances light-foraging capacity. However, how Pi is strategically distributed among these organs to optimize seedling establishment remains unclear. We here identify a PHR1-EIN3/EIL1 regulatory module that directs minimal Pi resources to suppress root elongation and cotyledon expansion or to accelerate greening, promoting Pi conservation. This mechanism prioritizes hypocotyl elongation to improve light acquisition. In contrast, under sufficient Pi supply, hypocotyl and root growth is promoted along with cotyledon enlargement, while greening is delayed. Thus, the PHR1-EIN3/EIL1 module enables efficient allocation of limited Pi to maximize hypocotyl elongation for light foraging during early seedling establishment while strategically restricting Pi usage in other organs to enhance overall survival.},

Although mitophagy is one of the main pathways involved in the clearance of damaged or old mitochondria, its coordination with mitochondrial biogenesis is poorly characterized. Here, by unbiased approaches including last-generation liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and transcriptomics, we identify the protein phosphatase PP2A-B55α/PPP2R2A as a Parkin-dependent regulator of mitochondrial number. Upon mitochondrial damage, PP2A-B55α determines the amplitude of mitophagy induction and execution by regulating both early and late mitophagy events. A few minutes after the insult, ULK1 is released from the inhibitory regulation of PP2A-B55α, whereas 2 to 4 hours later, PP2A-B55α promotes the nuclear translocation of TFEB, the master regulator of autophagy and lysosome genes, to support mitophagy execution. Moreover, PP2A-B55α controls a transcriptional program of mitochondrial biogenesis by stabilizing the Parkin substrate and PGC-1α inhibitor PARIS. PP2A-B55α targeting rescues neurodegenerative phenotypes in a fly model of Parkinson’s disease, thus suggesting potential therapeutic application.},

How FAK becomes activated in response to cell-ECM adhesive forces at single FAs to facilitate directional motion is poorly understood. Using micropillar-based force microscopy and FA-targeted FRET biosensors, we monitored real-time traction forces and FAK activity at individual FAs during assembly and disassembly. Our results demonstrate oscillatory temporal coupling of traction force and FAK activity in high-tension FAs before FA disassembly. Cross-correlation analyses revealed that force precedes FAK activation, guiding FA turnover. Atomistic molecular simulations unveiled a force-induced mechanism where traction forces disrupt autoinhibitory FERM-kinase interactions in FAK, enabling catalytic activity without structural unfolding. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the spatiotemporal integration of mechanical forces and biochemical signaling in cell migration.},

Here, we demonstrate unprecedented control to engineer Feshbach resonances at tunable positions via Floquet driving in a lithium-6 (^{6}Li) atom gas, achieved through strong magnetic field modulation at megacycles per second frequencies. This periodic modulation creates scattering resonances whenever dressed molecular levels cross the atomic threshold. By adding a second modulation at twice the base frequency, we tune the asymmetry of resonance loss profiles and suppress two-body losses from Floquet heating. This technique enhances control over atomic interactions, expanding possibilities for quantum simulations of complex systems and studies of exotic quantum phases.},

Loss of AMOC stability has been inferred from slowing recovery of temperature and salinity fluctuations over time. However, observational datasets, constructed from records with sparse spatial and temporal coverage, may introduce substantial biases in stability indicators. Alternative records are therefore needed for reliable stability assessments. Here, using bivalve-derived environmental reconstructions, we show that the subpolar North Atlantic has experienced two destabilization episodes over the past ~150 years. The first preceded the rapid circulation changes associated with the 1920s North Atlantic regime shift, suggesting that a tipping point may have been crossed in the early 20th century. The second and stronger destabilization began around 1950 and continues to the present, supporting evidence of recent stability loss and suggesting that the region is moving toward a tipping point.},

Here, we combine atomic-resolution imaging under in situ electrical biasing conditions with first-principles calculations to unravel the atomic-scale switching mechanisms in SnSe, a vdW group IV monochalcogenide. Our results uncover the coexistence of a consecutive 90° switching pathway and a direct 180° switching pathway from antiferroelectric (AFE) to FE order in this vdW system. Atomic-scale investigations and strain analysis reveal that the switching processes simultaneously induce interlayer sliding and compressive strain, while the lattice remains coherent despite the presence of multidomain structures. These findings elucidate vdW ferroelectric switching dynamics at atomic scale and lay the foundation for the rational design of 2D ferroelectric nanodevices.},

Compared to NC IMPBs, CC IMPBs have smaller, sulfur (S)–poor, highly siderophile element (HSE)–enriched cores and younger core formation ages. However, the origins of these differences remain debated. Using equilibrium partitioning models between the S-poor solid and the S-rich liquid metal, we argue that HSE enrichment in IID, IIF, IIIF, and IVB cores resulted from a multistage evolutionary sequence: (i) segregation of S-rich, HSE-depleted protocores during initial planetesimal heating; (ii) collisional disruption before S-poor metal segregation; (iii) reaccretion of mantle fragments into daughter planetesimals; and (iv) further 26 Al-driven heating producing HSE-enriched, S-poor cores. We suggest that iron meteorites from these CC IMPBs originate from such second-generation cores. Accounting for “missing” S-rich protocores helps reconcile several NC-CC IMPB differences and highlights the role of early collisional processing in shaping planetesimal chemical evolution.},

However, research to date has focused primarily on phase and retardance aberrations, whereas another major source of aberration—diattenuation—remains largely unexplored. Unlike the others, diattenuation affects intensity in addition to phase and polarization, limiting the intrinsic correction capability of adaptive systems. In this work, we propose the use of optical skyrmions to probe diattenuation-aberrated systems and provide metrics that characterize the performance of vectorial adaptive optics (V-AO), with theoretical and experimental validations. Based on the probed results, we demonstrate V-AO correction under real-world aberrations for complex media imaging and analyze correction strategies to optimize measurements in aberrated polarimetric systems. This work paves the way for high-dimensional aberration correction, introduces a previously unidentified use of optical skyrmions, and provides insights that will aid the development of vectorial measurement systems.},

This violation becomes pronounced toward the underdoped regime, implying an intriguing evolution of pairing glue. The unexpected observation of positive Seebeck coefficients in this regime indicates the presence of nontrivial electron correlations. Furthermore, our comprehensive investigation across the superconducting dome reveals that the evolution of (thermo)electric normal-state properties—specifically, the sign changes of the Hall and Seebeck coefficients—coincides with the evolution of superconducting anisotropy and pairing strength.

  abstract     = {Cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of schizophrenia (SCZ), yet its mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated the functional role of NKAPL (nuclear factor κB activating protein-like)—an SCZ risk-associated gene—and the single nucleotide polymorphism rs1635 in cognitive deficits related to SCZ. We used Nkapl transgenic mouse models to explore the impact of NKAPL on SCZ-related cognitive deficits. NKAPL acts as a transcriptional repressor of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolizing enzyme succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH). Nkapl deletion in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interneurons led to increased SSADH levels, reduced GABA concentration in the synaptic cleft, impaired inhibitory synaptic transmission, and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, the rs1635 mutation (T153N) caused similar effects as the Nkapl knockout. Reexpression of wild-type NKAPL or genetic knockdown of SSADH in mPFC interneurons restored the synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in Nkapl −/− mice. Our study indicates the potential role of NKAPL and SSADH in mPFC interneurons in neuronal mechanisms of learning and memory in mice.},

It is defined as the weight of universal 1 / k 4 momentum tails, but, so far, its direct measurement has been hindered in Bose gases due to interactions strongly altering time-of-flight imaging. Here, we report the first direct measurement of the Tan contact in a strongly correlated Lieb-Liniger gas. Leveraging the one-dimensional geometry of our system, we implement a two-stage expansion scheme, yielding interaction-immune imaging. Our results show good agreement with theoretical predictions and are consistent with a predicted universal scaling law. Our work paves the way for further characterization of the Lieb-Liniger gas across broad interaction regimes and holds promise for extension to other correlated quantum gases in confined geometries.},

To overcome these obstacles, we developed a carboplatin lock-designed MOF (Pt-MOFs@Glu) targeting intestinal macrophages for brain-directed drug transport. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses revealed that intestinal macrophages migrate to the brain in response to chemokines. Building on this insight, Pt-MOFs@Glu was designed to engage these cells for precise delivery. Comprising carboplatin, pyrazine-quinoxaline, and β-glucan, the system induces an “avalanche effect” in the CNSL microenvironment, promoting tumor apoptosis and inhibiting metastasis. Combining pyrazine-quinoxaline to lock carboplatin and β-glucan to boost targeting, immunity, and oral absorption, the system enables ROS-triggered drug release, efficiently crosses the gastrointestinal tract and BBB, and synergizes chemo-immunotherapy to enhance therapeutic efficacy. This approach redefines CNSL treatment by harnessing the gut-brain axis, offering a transformative pathway to overcoming therapeutic barriers and improving patient outcomes.},

Here, we investigate the impact of RAD21L deletion, a meiosis-specific cohesin subunit, on the 3D genome architecture and gene expression in the male germ line. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that RAD21L deficiency impairs meiotic chromatin organization and inter/intrachromosomal interactions. This conspicuous 3D genome reorganization also disrupts bouquet formation, resulting in increased telomeric interactions between heterologous chromosomes in primary spermatocytes. Genome reorganization was accompanied by detectable transcriptional dysregulation in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, mainly affecting sex chromosomes. Collectively, our findings establish the cohesin RAD21L as a germline-specific critical regulator of genome-wide 3D genome reorganization during spermatogenesis and a modulator of the male germline transcriptional landscape.},

Moreover, the extent to which they can be used to reliably track movement kinematics remains unclear. Here, we describe a tracking method that uses near-infrared quantum dots as injectable markers. We demonstrate that our tags can be injected beneath the skin or into joints and imaged for months in freely moving mice noninvasively using standard cameras. Last, we create a large ground-truth dataset for training the next generation of markerless systems.

At this sub-epsilon precision level, the half-life of 234 U is refined to 245,670 ± 260 years. For U-Th geochronology, systematic uncertainties from decay constants largely cancel, effectively reducing the uncertainty in the 234 U half-life to ~±25 years. This improved measurement precision consequently reduces total 2σ age uncertainties to ±3 thousand years (kyr) at ~600 thousand years ago (ka) and ±6 kyr at ~700 ka, a substantial improvement over earlier methods with uncertainties of tens of thousands of years.},

We propose an innovative causal criterion, knockoff conditional mutual information (KOCMI), to accurately infer interventional direct causality without prior knowledge of the network structure using either time-independent or time-series data. KOCMI performs knockoff operation on a variable as its virtual intervention, which preserves the original network structure, and then identifies the causality between two variables by estimating the distributional invariance before and after such a virtual intervention. We show that, algorithmically, KOCMI enables quantification of causal relationship, even for networks with loops, and, theoretically, is also consistent with the do-calculus causal analyses but without their prerequisite of the network structure. KOCMI shows superior performance on benchmark and real datasets, comparing with existing methods. Overall, KOCMI provides a powerful tool in inferring interventional causality, which is theoretically ensured and experimentally validated by real intervention data.},

However, most UDP-glycosyltransferases encounter three major limitations: low activity, poor regioselectivity, and restricted substrate availability, hindering their pharmaceutical applications. To address these challenges, we conducted protein engineering on a previously unidentified glycosyltransferase, UGT75AJ2, which had 3′,7- O -glycosylation capabilities. Our approach involved three strategies: (i) development of a tailored focused rational iterative site-specific mutagenesis strategy, augmented by virtual screening and iterative mutagenesis, to design mutant Mut4-1 (S367A/V274A/F82V/I132T) with a 128-fold enhancement in relative catalytic activity; (ii) enhancement of the enzyme’s compatibility with a broader spectrum of sugar donors achieved through structural-based engineering, yielding mutant S14G/F366H/S367G and demonstrating effective utilization of diverse donors; (iii) construction of a targeted mutant library to enhance regioselectivity by active site analysis, leading to mutants with high selectivity for targeted glycosylation sites. This comprehensive study tackles predominant challenges in UDP-glycosyltransferases protein engineering, providing innovative approaches and insights that enhance the development of flavonoid glycosides.},

This finding is verified by the absence of a signal in a conventional type-II superconductor using the same setup and by ruling out the trapped-vortex effects through micro-Hall array measurements. Both the temperature dependence and the magnitude of the observed anomalous thermal Hall conductivity are quite different from those expected for the quantized thermal edge current of an intrinsic ATHE but consistent with extrinsic impurity-induced ATHEs in chiral superconductivity.

For mosquito-transmitted viruses like CHIKV, the potential for severe outbreaks is often assessed using climate-based estimates of the basic reproduction number, R 0 . We derived a large set of R 0 estimates for CHIKV by fitting a mechanistic model to data from 86 chikungunya outbreaks. These R 0 estimates were weakly predicted by climatic and other factors. Among deterministic drivers of outbreak severity, the contribution of R 0 was comparable to that of generation interval length, transmission distance, and population network structure. While aspects of chikungunya outbreak severity are predictable, innovative approaches are needed that look beyond the impacts of climate on R 0 .},

Performance can be separated into two “states”—an engaged (attentive) state with high performance, where fish consistently turn in the direction of coherent motion, and a second, disengaged (inattentive) state, where performance drops to chance. A hidden Markov model is sufficient to model these transitions and can be incorporated into a drift-diffusion model framework that has previously been used to model perceptual decision-making in larval zebrafish. Furthermore, we fit a mixture model of performance distributions and extract two latent variables termed “focus” and “competence” that are largely influenced by parents and environmental context, respectively.

  abstract     = {Assessing the impacts of future relative sea level rise requires projections consistent with historical observations. However, existing projections often do not align with past data, complicating adaptation planning, impact assessments, and communication. We present a spatial Bayesian model that generates local projections at tide gauge sites from historical records. The model integrates tide gauges, GPS, and satellite altimetry with past and future constraints on mountain glaciers, polar ice sheets, thermal expansion, ocean circulation, land water storage, and glacial history. By separating unforced ocean variability from long-term trends, we provide posterior estimates of sea level change and vertical land motion. The inclusion of local constraints reduces uncertainty in near-term local projections while producing global median projections and uncertainty ranges similar to those in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The model enables projections of local relative sea level rise for any given global temperature trajectory, illustrated with three IPCC AR6 Working Group III pathways.},

  abstract     = {Bacteria in the soil form complex communities, and some colonize the surfaces of roots. These bacteria are not uniformly distributed, however, and exhibit precise patterning around emerging lateral roots and early root differentiation zones. Tsai et al . established that the Casparian strip, an endodermal barrier around the root vasculature, is required for normal patterning of root bacteria (see the Perspective by Kozaeva and Brophy). At locations where the Casparian strip is absent, glutamine leaks from the vasculature and serves as an attractant for soil bacteria. Using precise spatial and temporal analysis, the authors provide insight into how bacteria around the root interact both with the plant and with each other. —Madeleine Seale Plant roots release exudates to encourage microbiome assembly, which influences the function and stress resilience of plants. How specific exudates drive spatial colonization patterns remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that endodermal Casparian strips—forming the root’s extracellular diffusion barrier—restrict nutrient leakage into the rhizosphere, coinciding with and controlling spatial colonization patterns of rhizobacteria. We find that vasculature-derived glutamine leakage is a major bacterial chemoattractant and enhancer of proliferation, defining a previously unknown pathway for root exudate formation. Bacteria defective in amino acid chemoperception display reduced attraction toward leakage sites, and roots with Casparian strip defects display bacterial overproliferation, dependent on bacterial capacity for amino acid metabolization. Associated chronic immune stimulation suggests that endodermal nutrient restriction is crucial for regulating microbial colonization and assembly, limiting excessive proliferation that could compromise plant health.},

  abstract     = {When cells experience a lack of amino acids, they initiate a stress response signaled by activations of the protein kinase GCN2. Zhou et al . used an in vitro translation system to refine our understanding of how this activation of GCN2 occurs. In their experiments, the critical factor appeared to be the collision of ribosomes that occurs when aminoacyl-transfer RNAs are not available and a peptide chain cannot be elongated. The trailing ribosomes then collide with the stalled ribosome, and GCN2 was found to be associated with this molecular traffic jam. There, the presence of uncharged transfer RNAs, another consequence of a shortage of amino acids, also promoted the phosphorylation and activation of GCN2. —L. Bryan Ray During nutrient deprivation, activation of the protein kinase GCN2 regulates cell survival and metabolic homeostasis. In addition to amino acid stress, GCN2 is activated by a variety of cellular stresses. GCN2 activation has been linked to its association with uncharged tRNAs, specific ribosomal proteins, and conditions of translational arrest, but their relative contribution to activation is unclear. Here, we used in vitro translation to reconstitute GCN2 activation by amino acid stress and compared collided ribosome populations induced by diverse translational stressors. Initiation of GCN2 signaling required the di-ribosome sensor GCN1, which recruits GCN2 to ribosomes in a collision-dependent manner, where GCN2 becomes activated by key ribosomal interactions and stably associated with collided ribosomes. Our findings define the molecular requirements and dynamics of GCN2 activation.},

This structure, formed by upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water from greater depths, has major impacts on both ocean biological productivity and climate. But how did this system behave during the Pliocene epoch, an interval that had a warmer climate than today and often is considered a climate analog for our warmer future? Rafter et al . analyzed the nitrogen isotopic compositions of marine sediments and organic phases in foraminifera to conclude that upwelling in the EEP has persisted over the past 4 million years, although the cold tongue was warmer during the Pliocene (see the Perspective by Rosenthal and Hess). These results have implications for both ocean circulation during the Pliocene and in the future. —Jesse Smith Upwelling generates a nutrient-rich “cold tongue” in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (EEP), with impacts on global climate, oceanic biological productivity, and the carbon cycle. The cold tongue was reduced during the Pliocene Epoch, a feature attributed to weaker upwelling and an associated deepening of the surface mixed layer in the EEP. Here, we report nitrogen-isotope evidence that modern-like upwelling occurred in the EEP during the Pliocene and has persisted over the past 5 million years. We explain the reduced Pliocene cold tongue as an expression of the reduced temperature difference between surface and subsurface waters in the tropical Pacific. The attendant reduction in the vertical density gradient may have maintained EEP upwelling despite the expected slackening of the trade winds under Pliocene warmth.},

However, recent data have demonstrated the existence of noncanonical routes of interneuronal communication mediating the transport of materials including calcium, mitochondria, and pathogenic proteins such as amyloid beta (Aβ). Using super-resolution and electron microscopy, Chang et al . identified and characterized structures called nanotubular bridges that connect dendrites in the brain (see the Perspective by Budinger and Heneka). These bridges mediate the transport of calcium ions, small molecules, and Aβ peptides, and may contribute to the spreading and accumulation of pathological Aβ in Alzheimer’s disease. —Mattia Maroso Intercellular nanotubular networks mediate material exchange, but their existence in neurons remains to be explored in detail. We identified long, thin dendritic filopodia forming direct dendrite–dendrite nanotubes (DNTs) in mammalian cortex. Super-resolution microscopy in dissociated neurons revealed DNTs’ actin-rich composition and dynamics, enabling long-range calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) propagation. Imaging and machine learning–based analysis validated in situ DNTs as anatomically distinct from synaptic spines. DNTs actively transported small molecules and human amyloid-β (Aβ); DNT density increased before plaque formation in the medial prefrontal cortex of APP/PS1 mice (APP, Aβ precursor protein; PS1, presenilin-1), suggesting that the dendrite-DNT network might play a role in Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Computational models of DNT-mediated Aβ propagation recapitulated early amyloidosis, predicting selective intracellular accumulation. These findings uncover a nanotubular connectivity layer in the brain, extending neuronal communication beyond classical synapses.},

  abstract     = {Eukaryotic DNA is packaged as chromatin, the basic unit of which is the nucleosome, around which about 150 base pairs of DNA are wrapped, limiting its accessibility. Chromatin remodelers mobilize nucleosomes to regulate replication and transcription. Moore et al . studied two major remodelers, ACF and RSC, in crowded chromatin by recreating phase-separated chromatin droplets in vitro. They found that both remodelers could enter and mobilize nucleosomes within droplets, but only RSC decompacted chromatin and increased droplet mobility. This decompaction likely enhances DNA accessibility in cells. Their findings suggest that remodelers differ in biological importance depending on their capacity to mobilize and decompact compacted chromatin. —Di Jiang Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes mobilize nucleosomes, but how such mobilization affects chromatin condensation is unclear. We investigate effects of two major remodelers, ACF and RSC, using chromatin condensates and single-molecule footprinting. We find that both remodelers inhibit the formation of condensed chromatin. However, the remodelers have distinct effects on preformed chromatin condensates. ACF spaces nucleosomes without decondensing the chromatin, explaining how ACF maintains nucleosome organization in transcriptionally repressed genomic regions. By contrast, RSC catalyzes ATP-dependent decondensation of chromatin. RSC also drives micron-scale movements of entire chromatin condensates. These additional activities of RSC may contribute to its central role in transcription. The biological importance of remodelers may thus reflect both their effects on nucleosome mobilization and the corresponding consequences on chromatin dynamics at the mesoscale.},

A key finding was the close agreement between the experiments and coupled ion–electron transfer theory rate expressions.

We provide experimental and theoretical evidence that lithium intercalation occurs by coupled ion-electron transfer, where ion transfer across the electrode-electrolyte interface is facilitated by electron transfer to a neighboring redox site.

This spin-photon interface enables demonstration of optical spin polarization and readout that distinguishes between spin states and magnetically inequivalent sites in a molecular crystal. Operation at frequencies compatible with mature photonic and microwave devices provides an opportunity for engineering scalable, integrated molecular spin-optical quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {The Otophysan suborder contains nearly 70% of all freshwater fish species, many of which are quite familiar, such as carp, catfish, and eels. It had been believed that this group originated in fresh water before the breakup of Pangea. However, after analyzing a recently discovered Late Cretaceous fossil, Liu et al . concluded that this group first evolved in a marine environment and later colonized fresh water multiple separate times. Furthermore, the fossil informs on the evolution of the group’s Weberian hearing apparatus, suggesting that it was associated with freshwater adaptations. —Sacha Vignieri Otophysans, known for their enhanced hearing enabled by the complex Weberian apparatus, comprise two-thirds of extant freshwater fish species. Previously, they were thought to have originated in fresh water before the breakup of Pangea, implying a nearly 80-million-year gap between the origin and oldest known fossil. However, the discovery of a Late Cretaceous freshwater otophysan challenges this view. Integrating fossil, morphological, and genomic data, we estimate a younger crown group origin of ~154 million years ago. Notably, ancestral range and habitat reconstructions indicate marine origins for the otophysan crown groups, with at least two transitions to fresh water. Functional simulations of the Weberian ossicles of this fossil suggest that the distinctive hearing capabilities of otophysans evolved in conjunction with fusion of hearing ossicle parts and freshwater adaptations.},

  abstract     = {Many cold-adapted plants will either need to expand their ranges or genetically adapt to the warming temperatures caused by climate change. Fior et al . assembled a draft genome of the alpine wood pink ( Dianthus sylvestris ) and looked for signatures of selection in high- and low-elevation populations. They identified the gene DsCEN/2 , the two main haplotypes of which determine flowering time and segregate at different frequencies between low- and high-elevation populations. The low-elevation haplotype seems to have arisen during range expansion to warmer valleys during the Last Glacial Maximum. Given its fitness benefits to larger plants in warm conditions, this haplotype will likely increase in frequency in high-elevation populations with future temperature increases. —Corinne Simonti Adaptive evolution is key for species to persist in a warming climate. However, how adaptive genetic variants arise and shape both past and future evolutionary trajectories remains largely unknown. In this work, we integrate genomics with functional and ecological assays to unravel the evolutionary history and adaptive potential of alleles governing adaptation to climate through flowering time in an Alpine carnation. We reveal that “warm” and “cold” alleles of the flowering inhibitor CENTRORADIALIS ( DsCEN/2 ) originated through recombination of highly divergent haplotypes during the carnation radiation, implicating ancestral variation in seeding climate-adaptive alleles. These alleles survived in glacial refugia before mediating the species’ range expansion in response to postglacial warming. We predict that, by recapitulating past evolution, warm alleles will continue to facilitate adaptation under future climate change.},

  abstract     = {As climate warms and humans build in more undeveloped environments, the threat of costly wildfire disasters is thought to be increasing. Cunningham et al . examined data about the global distribution, frequency, and associated climate conditions of the most lethal and costly wildfire disasters from 1980 to 2023, finding that disaster risk was highest in regions near relatively affluent, populated areas, and that the frequency of economically disastrous wildfires increased sharply after 2015. They also found that major disasters coincided with extreme climatic conditions. —Jesse Smith Climate change and land mismanagement are creating increasingly fire-prone built and natural environments. However, despite worsening fire seasons, evidence is lacking globally for trends in socially and economically disastrous wildfires, partly due to sparse systematic records. Using a 44-year dataset (1980 to 2023) we analyze the distribution, trends, and climatic conditions connected with the most lethal and costly wildfires. Disastrous wildfires occurred globally over this period but were concentrated in the Mediterranean and temperate conifer biomes. Disaster risk was highest where highly energetic daily fire events intersected affluent, populated areas. Economic disasters increased sharply from 2015 onward, with 43% of the 200 most damaging events occurring in the last decade. Disasters coincided with increasingly extreme climatic conditions, highlighting the urgent need to adapt to a more fire-prone world.},

  abstract     = {Neuronal control of skeletal muscle function is ubiquitous across species for locomotion and doing work. In particular, emergent behaviors of neurons in biohybrid neuromuscular systems can advance bioinspired locomotion research. Although recent studies have demonstrated that chemical or optogenetic stimulation of neurons can control muscular actuation through the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the correlation between neuronal activities and resulting modulation in the muscle responses is less understood, hindering the engineering of high-level functional biohybrid systems. Here, we developed NMJ-based biohybrid crawling robots with optogenetic mouse motor neurons, skeletal muscles, 3D-printed hydrogel scaffolds, and integrated onboard wireless micro–light-emitting diode (μLED)–based optoelectronics. We investigated the coupling of the light stimulation and neuromuscular actuation through power spectral density (PSD) analysis. We verified the modulation of the mechanical functionality of the robot depending on the frequency of the optical stimulation to the neural tissue. We demonstrated continued muscle contraction up to 20 minutes after a 1-minute-long pulsed 2-hertz optical stimulation of the neural tissue. Furthermore, the robots were shown to maintain their mechanical functionality for more than 2 weeks. This study provides insights into reliable neuronal control with optoelectronics, supporting advancements in neuronal modulation, biohybrid intelligence, and automation.},

  abstract     = {Reading fluency is a vital building block for developing literacy, yet the best way to practice fluency—reading aloud—can cause anxiety severe enough to inhibit literacy development in ways that can have an adverse effect on students through adulthood. One promising intervention to mitigate oral reading anxiety is to have children read aloud to a robot. Although observations in prior work have suggested that people likely feel more comfortable in the presence of a robot instead of a human, few studies have empirically demonstrated that people feel less anxious performing in front of a robot compared with a human or used objective physiological indicators to identify decreased anxiety. To investigate whether a robotic reading companion could reduce reading anxiety felt by children, we conducted a within-subjects study where children aged 8 to 11 years ( n = 52) read aloud to a human and a robot individually while being monitored for physiological responses associated with anxiety. We found that children exhibited fewer physiological indicators of anxiety, specifically vocal jitter and heart rate variability, when reading to the robot compared with reading to a person. This paper provides strong evidence that a robot’s presence has an effect on the anxiety a person experiences while doing a task, offering justification for the use of robots in a wide-reaching array of social interactions that may be anxiety inducing.},

  abstract     = {According to productive failure (PF) theory, experiencing failure during problem-solving can enhance students’ knowledge acquisition in subsequent instruction. However, challenging students with problems beyond their current capabilities may strain their skills, prior knowledge, and emotional well-being. To address this, we designed a social robot–assisted teaching activity in which students observed a robot’s unsuccessful problem-solving attempts, offering a PF-like preparatory effect without requiring direct failure. We conducted two classroom-based studies in a middle school setting to evaluate the method’s effectiveness. In study 1 ( N = 135), we compared three instructional methods—observing robot failure (RF), individual problem-solving failure, and direct instruction—in an eighth-grade mathematics lesson. Students in the RF condition showed the greatest gains in conceptual understanding and reported lower social pressure, although no significant differences were found in procedural knowledge or knowledge transfer. Follow-up study 2 ( N = 110) further validated the method’s effectiveness in supporting knowledge acquisition after a 2-week robot-involved adaptation phase, when the novelty effect had largely subsided. Students confirmed their perception of the robot as a peer, and they offered positive evaluations of its intelligence and neutral views of its anthropomorphism. Our findings suggest that observing the robot’s failure has a comparable, or even greater, effect on knowledge acquisition than experiencing failure firsthand. These results underscore the value of social robots as peers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education and highlight the potential of integrating robotics with evidence-based teaching strategies to enhance learning outcomes.},

To overcome this challenge, we propose a robotic sensing approach that integrates embedded ultrasonic soft sensors (EUSSs) with magnetic actuators, resulting in a wireless sensor-integrated miniature machine with seamless integration and minimal interference between fields. The EUSS, with its compact dimensions (1.3 millimeters by 1.3 millimeters by 1.6 millimeters), softness (98 kilopascals), and lightweight design (4.6 milligrams), is compatible with both soft and rigid components in terms of deformability and size. By engineering onboard transducers and using passive ultrasound communication along with external magnetic fields, we could wirelessly detect and regulate environmental parameters such as force, vibration, viscosity, and temperature.

  abstract     = {Dynamics models that predict the effects of physical interactions are essential for planning and control in robotic manipulation. Although models based on physical principles often generalize well, they typically require full-state information, which can be difficult or impossible to extract from perception data in complex, real-world scenarios. Learning-based dynamics models provide an alternative by deriving state transition functions purely from perceived interaction data, enabling the capture of complex, hard-to-model factors and predictive uncertainty and accelerating simulations that are often too slow for real-time control. Recent successes in this field have demonstrated notable advancements in robot capabilities, including long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects, granular materials, and complex multiobject interactions such as stowing and packing. A crucial aspect of these investigations is the choice of state representation, which determines the inductive biases in the learning system for reduced-order modeling of scene dynamics. This article provides a timely and comprehensive review of current techniques and trade-offs in designing learned dynamics models, highlighting their role in advancing robot capabilities through integration with state estimation and control and identifying critical research gaps for future exploration.},

  abstract     = {Modern robotic manufacturing requires collision-free coordination of multiple robots to complete numerous tasks in shared, obstacle-rich workspaces. Although individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning under spatiotemporal constraints remain computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales. Existing multiarm systems deployed in industry rely on human intuition and experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on procedurally generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot configurations, and task distributions. It uses a graph representation of scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through RL to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the subproblems of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and scalability of our planner also open the door to capabilities such as fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based replanning, where rapid adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.},

  abstract     = {Mutations in the protein KRAS drive the growth of various cancers; thus, the gene expression programs induced by KRAS signaling are of particular interest for biomarker and drug development. Although oncogenic KRAS activates multiple transcription factors through the kinase ERK, Hibshman et al. found that MYC drove much of the mutant KRAS-dependent gene expression in pancreatic cancer (PDAC). MYC was critical for the proliferation of multiple KRAS-mutant PDAC cell lines, regulated several kinases, and induced a cell survival response through the small GTPase RHO. Because MYC itself is not yet druggable, the findings may inform new therapeutic strategies for PDAC. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Of the thousands of genes and substrates identified in KRAS-mutant signaling networks in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), more than 200 are transcription factors, implying extensive and complex transcriptional regulation. However, we observed that genetic suppression of the transcription factor MYC alone was sufficient to phenocopy the effect of KRAS suppression in signaling, growth, and metabolic processes in PDAC cells. We determined the gene transcription changes caused by acute suppression of MYC function in KRAS -mutant PDAC cell lines and performed dependency map and pathway analyses on the affected gene sets. The expression of 1685 genes was increased upon suppression of MYC, and this gene set may comprise the bulk of the MYC-regulated genes essential for PDAC growth. In contrast, the 1325 genes whose expression was inhibited may comprise a compensatory response to oncogenic stress, mediated in part by the GTPase RHO. MYC-dependent transcriptional activity was largely ERK dependent, and almost one-third of ERK-regulated genes were also regulated by MYC in PDAC cells. Furthermore, chemical proteomic profiling revealed MYC-regulated protein kinases that can be targeted therapeutically. Together, these data provide a molecular portrait of MYC-dependent signaling that encompasses potentially exploitable mechanisms for treating PDAC.},

  abstract     = {The activity of the voltage-gated K + channel Kv1.3 in neurons and immune cells must be restrained to avoid pathological effects. Estadella et al. found shared molecular mechanisms between two stimuli that induce endocytosis and therefore decrease the activity of Kv1.3. In response to either a signal critical for neuronal differentiation or an immunosuppressive stimulus, two clusters of lysine residues in Kv1.3 became ubiquitinated, triggering internalization and degradation. In human T cells, blocking the ubiquitination or endocytosis of Kv1.3 increased its abundance at the immune synapse and consequently Kv1.3 currents. These results suggest a degradation mechanism common to distinct endocytosis-inducing stimuli that keeps Kv1.3 activity in check. —Wei Wong The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 contributes to action potential conduction in sensory neurons and to sustained increases in cytoplasmic Ca 2+ that activate immune cells. Here, we found that two distinct endocytosis-inducing stimuli acted through the same residues in Kv1.3 to control surface abundance and activity of the channel. Upon stimulation of the growth factor receptor EGFR, which stimulates Tyr-directed kinases and is important in neuronal differentiation, or of the Ser/Thr kinase PKC, which participates in the down-regulation of inflammatory responses, Kv1.3 underwent ubiquitination-dependent endocytosis that routed channel proteins to lysosomes for degradation. We mapped two lysine clusters in the N and C termini of Kv1.3, both of which became ubiquitinated upon activation of either Tyr or Ser/Thr kinases and whose combined mutation had an additive effect in reducing ubiquitination and endocytosis. Manipulations that prevented the ubiquitination or decreased the endocytosis of Kv1.3 resulted in increased Kv1.3 abundance at the immunological synapse and activity in primary human T cells. Prolonged channel accumulation at this location would be expected to increase Kv1.3-dependent leukocyte activation and lead to chronic inflammatory pathologies. Thus, ubiquitination fine-tunes cell biology by inducing the endocytosis and turnover of Kv1.3 in response to biological stimuli and insults.},
