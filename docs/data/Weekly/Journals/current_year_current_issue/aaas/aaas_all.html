  abstract     = {The advent of location information platforms based on global positioning systems has led to a proliferation of spatiotemporal trajectory data, which has, in turn, made the analysis of such data available to a broad range of applications, including traffic prediction, route planning, and trajectory similarity computation. Traditional methods for calculating trajectory similarity often suffer from high computational costs due to quadratic time complexity, particularly when dealing with large datasets. To this end, deep learning-based approaches to trajectory similarity learning have been proposed, with a view to offering enhanced efficiency and adaptability in comparison with traditional methods. However, these methods primarily focus on spatial trajectory similarity and fail to capture important temporal periodicity. Moreover, most of them directly use recurrent neural networks to obtain trajectory representations, while ignoring the spatial proximity information between neighboring regions. To address these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced spatiotemporal trajectory network, named GST, which integrates both spatial and temporal information to effectively learn trajectory similarity. Specifically, our model incorporates a graph neural network to capture the spatial proximity relationships and a time-embedding module to model the temporal periodicity information, thereby providing a more comprehensive spatiotemporal trajectory representation learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on 2 real-life datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy. In addition, ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed spatiotemporal learning mechanism.},

The rational design of enzyme-metal hybrid catalysts (EMHCs) is an attractive strategy for operating chemoenzymatic cascade reactions efficiently under mild conditions. In this study, we develop a method for the instantaneous and continuous synthesis of EMHCs in evaporating microdroplets. Compared to traditional wet impregnation methods, the reaction time of the microdroplet-assisted method is shortened from days to seconds, achieving a space-time yield increase by two to five orders of magnitude. The as-prepared Pd/lipase cross-linked enzyme aggregates with ultrasmall Pd nanoclusters and well-preserved structure of enzymes exhibit excellent activity in the dynamic kinetic resolution of chiral amines. The mechanism for the process enhancement in the synthesis of EMHCs in evaporating microdroplets is studied by theoretical calculations, indicating that the fast solvent evaporation and high-heat transfer are the major factors for the instantaneous synthesis of EMHCs.},

  abstract     = {Studies on the impact of metabolism on cell fate decisions are seeing a renaissance. However, a key challenge remains to distinguish signaling functions of metabolism from its canonical bioenergetic and biosynthetic roles, which underlie cellular homeostasis. Here, we tackled this challenge using mouse embryonic axis segmentation as an experimental model. First, we found that energetically subminimal amounts of glucose can support ongoing segmentation clock activity, providing evidence that glycolysis exerts a signaling function. Using a dynamical systems approach based on entrainment, we identified fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) as the potential signaling metabolite. Functionally, we demonstrated that glycolytic flux/FBP control the segmentation clock period and Wnt signaling in an anticorrelated manner. Critically, we showed that the slow segmentation clock phenotype caused by elevated glycolysis is mediated by Wnt signaling rather than cellular bioenergetic and biosynthetic state. Combined, our results demonstrate a modular organization of metabolic functions, revealing a signaling module of glycolysis that can be decoupled from its canonical metabolic functions.},

Enabled by high-precision frequency metrology, this approach reveals systematic discrepancies with state-of-the-art ab initio calculations, exposing subtle electron correlation effects in the dipole moment curve. Applied to line-intensity ratio thermometry (LRT), our technique determines gas temperatures with 0.5 millikelvin statistical uncertainty, exceeding previous LRT precision by two orders of magnitude. These results redefine the limits of optical gas metrology and enable International System of Units–traceable measurements for applications from combustion diagnostics to isotopic analysis.

Here, we used high-density surface EMG (HDsEMG) to sample multiple MUs per participant to investigate the features of inhibitory spinal microcircuits in both upper and lower limb control. We characterized the net inhibition as a function of individual MU firing rates, revealing participant-specific relationships. In silico modeling replicated these experimental characteristics and suggested that properties of the inhibitory currents rather than motoneuron size are responsible for net functional inhibition. Our results show that HDsEMG can highlight distinct control strategies across circuits and motor pools, revealing participant-specific properties of inhibitory spinal microcircuits.},

Using spectrally resolved ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, we demonstrate that FAD •– photoexcitation in the absence of substrate leads to the formation of the oxidized flavin FAD ox (the resting state in the catalytic cycle) within 100 femtoseconds. While this feature is similar to that occurring in flavoprotein oxidases, the ensuing photocycle is more complex. Upon excitation at the lowest-energy transition, the ejected electron is initially captured as a hydrated electron ( e – H ) before transferring to a secondary acceptor in 2.5 picoseconds and returning to the flavin in 37 picoseconds. This implies that e – H can be generated within a protein environment, an unprecedented finding. This assessment is supported by molecular dynamics simulations showing an expansion of the flavin-binding pocket without substrate, allowing water molecules to fill the void. Our results may pave the way to developing unconventional photocatalytic processes.},

A substantial challenge in neuroscience is identifying specific neural signals corresponding to each sound and analyzing them separately. Combining frequency tagging and machine learning, we achieved high-precision separation of neural responses to mixed melodies, classifying them by selective attention toward specific melodies. Across two magnetoencephalography datasets, individual musicality and task performance heavily influenced the attentional recruitment of cortical regions, correlating positively with top-down attention in the left parietal cortex but negatively with bottom-up attention in the right. In prefrontal areas, neural responses indicating higher sustained selective attention reflected better performance and musicality. These results suggest that musical training enhances neural mechanisms in the frontoparietal regions, boosting performance via improving top-down attention, reducing bottom-up distractions, and maintaining selective attention over time. This work establishes the effectiveness of combining frequency tagging with machine learning to capture cognitive and behavioral effects with stimulus precision, applicable to other studies involving simultaneous stimuli.},

We present a data-driven pathway to learn the XC functional by using the exact density, XC energy, and XC potential. While the exact densities are obtained from accurate configuration interaction (CI), the exact XC energies and XC potentials are obtained via inverse DFT calculations on the CI densities. We demonstrate how simple neural network (NN)–based local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA), trained on just five atoms and two molecules, provide remarkable improvement in total energies and densities. Particularly, the NN-based GGA functional attains similar accuracy as the higher rung SCAN meta-GGA on various thermochemistry datasets. These results underscore the promise of using the XC potential in modeling XC functionals and can pave the way for systematic learning of increasingly accurate XC functionals.},

To address which proglucagon peptides stimulate insulin secretion, we developed an assay to quantify levels of GLP-1(7–36)NH 2 . We also generated three transgenic mouse lines that allow α cell-specific, inducible deletion of the genes for the two prohormone convertase enzymes that process proglucagon . Our studies reveal that both mouse and human islets contain GLP-1(7–36)NH2, but glucagon mediates α cell–to–β cell communication in mice. However, in the absence of normal production of glucagon, α cells up-regulate prohormone convertase 1 (PC1/3) to generate GLP-1 and enhance glucose tolerance. Human islets have substantially higher levels of GLP-1 than mice, which positively correlate with rates of insulin secretion.

Using multiscale [40 to 2500 astronomical units (au)] observations of an MDC hosting an HMYSO, we identify a coherent dynamical structure analogous to barred spiral galaxies: three ~20,000 au spiral arms feed a ~7500 au central bar, which channels gas to a ~2000 au pseudodisk. Further accretion proceeds through the inner structures, including a Keplerian disk and an inner disk (~100 au), which are thought to be driving a collimated bipolar outflow. These multiscale structures (spiral arms, bar, streamers, envelope, disk, and outflow) have been simultaneously observed as a physically coherent structure within an MDC. Our discovery suggests that well-organized hierarchical structures play a crucial role during the gas accretion and angular momentum buildup of a massive disk.},

Both the variation amplitude and the angular range over which the frictional strength varies are governed by roughness alignment. Universal statistical patterns emerge in micromechanical quantities, including the microcontact area, orientation, deformation, and their evolutions under shear, following generalized extreme value distributions. To quantify asperity interactions, we introduce the contact fabric tensor, whose anisotropy provides a unified measure of roughness matching and a predictor for frictional strength and sliding onset.

Applying a periodically modulated laser light to optomechanical oscillators allows for stable and precise control of oscillator couplings. This enables us to not only explore the physics of quantized integer and fractional phase slips but also synthesize multioctave synchronizations of mechanical oscillators that exhibit tailorable multistability. Furthermore, the dynamically manipulated synchronizations lead to an exotic phase-space trajectory, which has a nontrivial winding number and giant nonreciprocity. This optomechanical Floquet engineering opens up the study of unexplored dynamics in complicated oscillator networks such as biological systems and innovative technology by mimicking their highly efficient information processing.},

  abstract     = {Auxin-mediated root gravitropism critically determines root angle, a key trait that underpins root system architecture (RSA). Auxin response factors (ARFs) regulate this process, but their downstream targets and functions remain unclear. We demonstrate that OsARF12 and OsARF25 induce cell wall thickness in epidermal cells of the lower side of the root, positioning auxin as a “break” of these cells during gravistimulation by directly regulating Increased Leaf Angle1 ( OsILA1 ) through a dual set of auxin response elements. Our study therefore establishes a direct link between auxin transcriptional signaling and cell wall fortification, driving the differential cell elongation required for root gravitropism and angle.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) materials often face limitations in molecular adsorption due to the absence of dangling bonds, affecting their performance as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates. We address this by engineering defects, specifically nanopores, in monolayer WS 2 through controlled plasma treatments. These nanopores create dangling bonds to improve molecular adsorption for molecule enrichment and dynamically modulate the WS 2 bandgap to optimize band alignment with rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules. This leads to a shift in photoluminescence peaks from red to blue with increasing defect density. Furthermore, the Raman signal is amplified by localized electromagnetic fields around the nanopores and carefully chosen resonance laser wavelengths. This combination allows blue-shifted WS 2 to achieve single-molecule SERS detection, with a sensitivity limit reaching 1 × 10 −20 M for R6G. Using SERS mapping, we visualize adsorption sites, confirming the nanopores’ role as active sites. Our study introduces a pioneering method for developing ultrasensitive 2D SERS substrates and advances the understanding of SERS mechanisms on 2D materials.},

Leveraging one single broadband femtosecond laser beam, cTHGM captures subtle absorption variations, including ~2-nanometer shifts in the Soret band, enabling precise distinction of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from hemoglobin with negligible phototoxicity. We demonstrate that cTHGM measures HbA1c fractions in single red blood cells (RBCs) in vivo and ex vivo, providing noninvasive HbA1c measurement and insights into HbA1c distribution at the cellular level. In addition, cTHGM reconstructs historical glycemic trajectories by decoding single-RBC HbA1c distributions, offering a retrospective view of glycemic variability over months. This innovative method combines label-free imaging, high spatial and spectral resolution, and noninvasive manners, making it a promising tool for diabetes management, glycemic variability monitoring, and broader applications in precision medicine.},

Thalamocortical input was initially balanced between CTs and ETs but shifted to CT-dominant 1 day post-NIHL and then normalized by day 7. This transient shift was accompanied by increased quantal size and suprathreshold excitability in CTs, with minimal changes in ETs. In vivo, CTs exhibited persistent elevation in sound intensity thresholds, while ETs showed a transient shift in frequency tuning and reduced high-frequency responsiveness that recovered within a week.

OROV RNA was detected in plasma and nasal swabs and infection-induced high levels of innate inflammation, type I interferon gene signatures, immunoglobulin M–positive B cell expansion, high titers of neutralizing antibodies, and detectable frequencies of OROV-specific T cells. Prior infection was protective against reinfection up to 524 days post–initial infection, demonstrating possible protective immunity induction against OROV infection.

A quantitative correlation between capacitance changes and x-ray dose rate is established, enabling stable, high-resolution imaging. Using this method, we achieve three-dimensional internal structure reconstruction with a simple single-pixel detector.

However, the chemical processes inducing even-MIF remain largely unknown. Here, we develop a three-dimensional atmospheric Hg isotope model linking Hg redox processes with even-MIF. The results show that the previous hypothesis of even-MIF occurring exclusively at the tropopause may not fully explain the global Δ 200 Hg patterns. We speculate OH-initiated reactions and photoreduction of Hg II (p) as likely dominant drivers. Simulations show that even-MIF primarily originates in the free troposphere and propagates downward to surface air. Our results reveal distinct spatial Δ 200 Hg variations that were previously unaccounted for in tracing Hg sources. This study provides critical insights into even-MIF drivers and serves as a reference for using Δ 200 Hg to trace atmospheric Hg sources.},

This study demonstrates that components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery regulate the proteasome-dependent degradation of functional PILS proteins under nonstressed conditions. We further reveal that both internal and external signals use the ERAD complex to differentially modulate the turnover rates of PILS proteins. Our findings uncover an additional physiological role of the ERAD complex in regulating PILS protein turnover.

  abstract     = {Whether the adaptive strategies of marine mixotrophs, organisms that combine heterotrophic and autotrophic nutrition, in response to global change are rooted in their symbiotic relationships is debated, especially for larger benthic foraminifera. Despite their importance in the ecosystem, there are controversial findings regarding the specificity of their algal endobionts, preventing a deeper understanding of their adaptive strategies. Using single-cell metabarcoding on 243 diatom-bearing foraminifera specimens from Indonesia, we found one highly dominant diatom strain in each foraminiferal host species bearing at least 90% of the reads in a majority of host species, whereas the bacterial community was very flexible, with only 25% of the variation explained by water depth, substrate type, location, and host species. Our results suggest that the adaptive strategy of the foraminiferal holobiont rather lies within its bacterial endobiome. Its dynamism likely facilitates the adaptive potential of foraminifera, supporting their proliferation across different environmental settings.},

Looking forward, we analyze the critical challenges that hinder the transition of ISE from laboratory to industry, including material stability, long-term durability, technoeconomic viability, and potential environmental risks.

Here, we present the demonstration of a cryptography protocol incorporating an intermediate quantum memory layer. Specifically, we implement Wiesner’s unforgeable quantum money primitive with a storage step, rather than as an on-the-fly procedure. This protocol imposes stringent requirements on storage efficiency and noise level to reach a secure regime. We demonstrate the implementation with polarization encoding of weak coherent states of light and a high-efficiency cold atom–based quantum memory and validate the full scheme.

Here, we show that, in male and female mice, a KD protects against weight gain and induces weight loss but over time leads to the development of hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and severe glucose intolerance. Unlike mice on conventional high-fat diet, KD-fed mice remain insulin sensitive and display low-insulin levels. Hyperglycemic clamp and ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assays revealed systemic and cell-intrinsic impairments in insulin secretion. Transcriptomic profiling of islets from KD-fed mice indicated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi stress and disrupted ER-Golgi protein trafficking, which were confirmed by electron microscopy showing a dilated Golgi network consistent with defective insulin granule trafficking and secretion. Together, these results suggest that long-term KD leads to multiple aberrations of metabolic parameters that caution their systematic use as a health-promoting dietary intervention.},

Here, we demonstrate how these two challenges can be solved using nanowaveguides fabricated from a low-loss magnetic insulator. We show that using local parametric pumping with a power of only a few milliwatts, one can achieve coherent amplification of spin-wave pulses by more than two orders of magnitude at zero bias magnetic field.

Inspired by the chloride voltage-gated channel 5 (ClC-5), we engineered a biomimetic Janus NP-MXene membrane featuring subnanochannels (~6.0 angstrom) and exceptional structural integrity, enabling controlled, simultaneous Na + /Cl − transport with unprecedented permselectivity. Under a 50-fold salinity gradient, the NP-MXene membrane achieved a record power density of 85.1 watts per square meter and an osmotic potential of 181.5 millivolts, the highest reported for a single device. Harnessing ion-specific signals from multi-ion transport, we further demonstrated an iontronic transistor capable of modulating ion flow by salinity gradients, eliminating the need for external gate voltage. This advance enables encoded signals and robotic control for advanced human-machine interfaces.

Although the mechanisms of DDR activation have been extensively studied, how DDR is kept inactive is far less well understood, especially in plants. Here, we show that the plant-specific transcription factor SOG1, a master regulator of the plant DDR, interacts with PRL1, which functions as a substrate adaptor of the Cullin4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4 PRL1 to polyubiquitinate SOG1, promoting SOG1 degradation through 26 S proteasome. When DNA damage occurs, PRL1 is degraded and SOG1 is phosphorylated, both of which impair the polyubiquitination and degradation of SOG1. This study demonstrated that plants dynamically control DDR by regulating the phosphorylation and polyubiquitination of SOG1.},

We also identify SETD2, a histone methyltransferase, as a chromatin modifying enzyme that controls intracellular iron availability through ferritin breakdown.

As a proof-of-concept application demonstration, the nanofluidic device exhibits an ionic memory property as a nanofluidic memristor.

In contrast to a solid, on PaLS, a droplet can be in 10 different wetting states. This richness arises from the adaptation of the liquid lubricants and can be harnessed to control the apparent contact angle of the droplet over the full range of wettability while removing contact-line pinning effects induced by the solid surface. In the limit of thin liquid films, we derive surface-averaged laws for the apparent contact angle for each wetting state, which capture both experimental and simulation data.

To address these challenges, this study develops a nanofiber membrane system with synergistic structural and interfacial enhancement. Through nanofiber architecture and surface engineering, the membrane balances proton conductivity, mechanical strength and electrochemical performance. The sandwich-structure nanofiber membrane (SSNFM) achieves a peak power density of 942 mW cm −2 after 100-hour accelerated stress testing, substantially outperforming conventional commercial membranes (520 mW cm −2 ). Electrochemical characterization confirms enhanced proton conductivity for SSNFM (40.4 mS cm −1 ) compared to commercial membranes (17.5 mS cm −1 ). Multiscale analyses, including x-ray computed tomography and multiphase simulations, reveal improved membrane properties, catalyst layer stability, and triple-phase boundary formation, facilitating efficient charge and mass transport.

We recorded VPC neuronal activity in two monkeys performing a tactile or acoustic bimodal detection task (BDT). Single-cell analyses revealed purely tactile, purely acoustic, bimodal, and decision-mnemonic responses. Population analyses of the VPC network and a recurrent neural network trained on the BDT uncovered notably similar latent dynamics. In both networks, neural trajectories diverged sharply from rest along modality-specific directions during stimulus presentation, while remained at rest during stimulus-absent trials. Subsequently, trajectories rotated toward a mnemonic subspace, where perceptual decisions (acoustic, tactile, and absent) were maintained in three distinctly different stable attractors. Using low-dimensional modeling, we propose a universal mechanism for the transition from sensory processing to memory retention explaining both biological and artificial latent neural dynamics in a simple dynamical motif. These results show that VPC neurons encode bimodal information, can integrate competing sensory inputs, and maintain multimodal perceptual decisions.},

  abstract     = {Spontaneous symmetry breaking, driven by nonadiabatic electron-nuclear coupling, can lead to geometric complexity in molecules and solids. While structural distortion from symmetry breaking occurs in femtoseconds, the timescale to lift electronic state degeneracy has remained elusive. We use the vibrationally resolved attosecond chronoscope to capture the electronic symmetry breaking induced by the Renner-Teller effect in bent CO 2 molecules after photoionization by an extreme ultraviolet photon by measuring attosecond ionization delays. Relative photoionization delays between the four cation states are observed, with vibrational state–dependent delays, we analyze the evolution of the degenerate A 2 Π u state to the nondegenerate A ′ and A ″ states due to molecular bending. With the help of theoretical analysis, we show that the relative photoionization delays of up to 72 as between the vibrational levels originate from the symmetry breaking–induced shape resonance. This study offers fundamental insights by resolving the coupled electron and structural dynamics simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here, we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency η reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field B ‖ is applied. The sign and the magnitude of η are tunable not only by B ‖ but also by the back-gate voltage. This diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano–superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and B ‖ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect marks the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI nanowire–based Josephson junction.},

Nipah virus (NiV), a deadly zoonotic paramyxovirus, uses its matrix protein (M) to drive virus assembly and budding through dimerization and PM interaction. We show that NiV-M–mediated virus-like particle (VLP) production depends on its interaction with host F-actin via its carboxyl-terminal domain. We demonstrate that F-actin retains NiV-M assembly sites at the PM by analyzing NiV-M assembly kinetics. Disrupting actin dynamics or NiV-M–actin interaction alters M nanoscale organization and reduces membrane retention, without affecting initial recruitment. We also show that the Arp2/3 complex, an actin-branching factor, promotes VLP production. Inhibiting Arp2/3 reduces NiV-M retention at the PM and impairs protrusion formation while leaving the assembly rate unchanged. These findings suggest that the host F-actin retains NiV assembly sites on the PM and promotes virus budding via Arp2/3-driven actin branching.},

We demonstrate that HTT organizes F-actin into bundles. Cryo–electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA) structural analyses reveal that HTT’s N-terminal HEAT and Bridge domains wrap around F-actin, while the C-terminal HEAT domain is displaced; furthermore, HTT dimerizes via the N-HEAT domain to bridge parallel actin filaments separated by ~20 nanometers. Our study provides the structural basis for understanding how HTT interacts with and organizes the actin cytoskeleton.},

Currently, little is known about the internal signals regulating haustorium development. Here, we identify root meristem growth factor (RGF) peptides in Phtheirospermum japonicum as endogenous inducers of prehaustorium formation. Treatment with specific RGF peptides in the absence of hosts triggered prehaustoria and induced expression of PjYUC3 , a gene required for auxin biosynthesis and prehaustorium formation. CRISPR-mediated knockouts showed that PjRGFR1 and PjRGFR3, receptors activated by the haustorium-specific RGF peptides PjRGF2 and PjRGF5, are essential for prehaustorium formation, revealing functional redundancy. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that PjRGF2 is broadly conserved among Orobanchaceae, whereas PjRGF5 appears to have recently evolved through segmental tandem multiplication. Our findings establish RGF peptides and their corresponding receptors as critical components of haustorium developmental signaling and provide insights into the evolutionary trajectories that shape plant parasitism.},

  abstract     = {Adipocyte hypertrophy during obesity triggers chronic inflammation, leading to metabolic disorders. However, the role of adipocyte-specific inflammatory signaling in metabolic syndrome remains unclear. The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, LUBAC, is an E3-ligase that generates nondegradative linear ubiquitination (Lin-Ub). LUBAC regulates NF-κB/MAPK-driven inflammation and prevents cell death triggered by immune receptors like TNF receptor-1. Here, we show that mice lacking HOIP, the Lin-E3 ligase catalytic subunit of LUBAC, in adipocytes ( Hoip A-KO ) display lipodystrophy and heightened susceptibility to obesity-induced metabolic syndrome, particularly metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Mechanistically, loss of HOIP attenuates TNF-induced NF-κB activation and promotes cell death in human adipocytes. Inhibiting caspase-8–mediated cell death is sufficient to prevent lipodystrophy and MASLD in Hoip A-KO obese mice. HOIP expression in adipose tissue positively correlates with metabolic fitness in obese individuals. Overall, our findings reveal a fundamental developmental role for Lin-Ub in adipocytes by mitigating cell death–driven adipose tissue inflammation and protecting against obesity-related metabolic syndrome.},

Fermentative yeasts are widespread in the terrestrial biosphere, and simple carbohydrates underpinning ethanol production are commonplace within fruits. We determined ethanol concentrations within fruits representing a substantial portion of the diet of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees. Ripe fruit pulp from 20 angiosperm species in Côte d’Ivoire and Uganda contained an average value of 0.31 (± 0.21 SD) and 0.32% (± 0.20) ethanol (weight/weight), respectively, as scaled by annual chimpanzee feeding time per species at each site. Chimpanzees typically eat ~4.5 kilograms of fruit per day, corresponding to an estimated ethanol ingestion of 14 grams (±9), or the equivalent of 1.4 (±0.9) standard drinks by international standards. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ethanol is widespread within tropical fruits and that modern predisposition to alcohol consumption derives from ancestral exposure to this psychoactive substance among frugivorous primates.},

Using exogenous molecular chaperone systems has the potential to stabilize native conformations and inhibit the aberrant aggregation of α-syn, yet inefficient blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and insufficient accumulation at PD sites limit their application. Herein, we developed chemotactic chaperone nanomotors (CNMs) that exploit the unique pathological microenvironment of PD lesions, characterized by elevated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels. The CNMs consist of a chemotactic-targeting module capable of sensing an iNOS concentration gradient, an α-syn–specific recognition module with conformation-sensitive binding domains, and a protein regulatory module with a hydrophobic microdomain that can stabilize α-syn and prevent misfolding. Results demonstrate that CNMs can achieve active chemotactic navigation across BBB and dual modulation of α-syn proteostasis through aggregate dissolution and prevention of misfolding. CNMs not only supplement exogenous chaperone activity but also restore endogenous protein stabilization mechanisms, concurrently reducing neuroinflammatory markers, promoting the application of nanochaperones for PD treatment.},

Integrated analyses across species identified diverse subtypes of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons that are highly conserved across primates. Compositional analyses revealed that subdivisions of the primate basolateral complex contain distinct classes of glutamatergic neurons and divergent gene expression profiles for parvalbumin and somatostatin GABAergic neurons. Referencing primate neuron types to transcriptomic atlases of the murine amygdala highlighted primate-specific specializations for glutamatergic neurons and identified which neuron types are conserved across mammals and amygdalar subdivisions.

This approach revealed a molecular hierarchy in which cell class–distinguishing features emerge first, followed by subclass- and type-related characteristics. Acquisition of cellular identity and diversity remained stable across in vivo models. In contrast, in vitro glutamatergic neurons showed decreased expression of identity-defining genes, reduced diversity, and alterations in connectivity. Cellular identity and diversity were closest to in vivo values in organotypic cultures.

By modulating the voltage bias waveform, the device allows precise control over confinement dynamics, enabling molecular capture, release, and exposure to periodic or stochastic confinement regimes. This flexibility facilitates the study of biomolecular behavior under dynamically adjustable conditions, including controlled confinement fluctuations. The device can manipulate diverse analytes such as double-stranded DNA, liposomes, and DNA nanotubes and facilitates introducing molecules into confined environments intact from bulk while providing enhanced tunability.

Under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5 scenario, the eastward mode’s expansion propagation speed shows a twofold increase from 5.1 ± 1.9 to 10.3 ± 2.0 meters per second by the late 21st century, with a remarkable eastward extension by ~30° longitude compared to the present climate. The accelerated eastward mode frequency is expected to rise by 15%, intensifying subseasonal precipitation whiplash worldwide and shortening disaster preparedness time. This acceleration results from an asymmetric pattern of boundary layer moisture convergence anomalies, driven by weakened Rossby wave westerlies and enhanced Kelvin wave response linked to warming-induced atmospheric stabilization and El Niño–like ocean surface warming pattern. Conversely, a projected weakening of easterly vertical shear over the northern Indian Ocean attenuates the Rossby wave response and favors more eastward expansion events.},

  abstract     = {Wide-bandgap (WBG; >1.65 electron volts) perovskites based on iodine-bromine (I-Br) mixed halides are critical components of perovskite-based tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, the uncontrolled crystallization dynamics of Br-rich species lead to reduced grain sizes and high defect densities in WBG perovskite films. Herein, a multifunctional additive 3,4,5-trifluorobenzamide (TFBZ) was introduced to enhance the crystallinity and passivate defects of the methylammonium (MA)–free WBG perovskite films. The TFBZ demonstrates superior passivation capability compared to benzamide, effectively mitigating both iodine vacancies and undercoordinated Pb 2+ defects via fluorine-enhanced interactions. In addition, the fluorine substituents in TFBZ could form N–H···F hydrogen bonds with formamidinium iodide to retard the crystallization rate of the perovskite. This proposed method is effective in defect passivation and crystal growth modulation for both 1.67– and 1.79–electron volt MA-free WBG perovskites, enabling the fabrication of MA-free all-perovskite TSCs with an encouraging power conversion efficiency of 29.01% (certified at 28.52%).},

Here, we studied the interaction between plasmons and VHS-related excitations in kagome metal CsV 3 Sb 5 films via far-field absorption spectroscopy. Notably, an anticrossing phenomenon was observed in the charge density wave states, with coupling strength approaching the strong coupling regime, indicating the formation of dispersive hybrid VHS interband plasmons. These modes are closely correlated to charge ordering states, with both the fitted coupling strength and the universal screening length of interband transitions exhibiting pronounced anomalies at the transition temperature. Our findings offer critical insights into the role of correlated electronic states in modulating plasmon behavior in kagome metals and unveil promising possibilities for tuning light-matter interactions in correlated materials.},

Using deep learning–based image analyses, including particle tracking, spatial distribution, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology analysis, we found that ER junctions facilitate stop-and-go motion switching and serve as platforms for endolysosome interactions. Within the ER network, endolysosomes exhibit three dynamic states: fast movement, local slow movement, and pausing. Pauses occur mainly at ER junctions, where transient endosome-lysosome interactions often coincide with organelle fission and are followed by departure. Disruption of ER junctions impairs lysosomal motility and maturation. We further show that actin condensation around endolysosomes mediates motion switching, involving VAP-STARD3 interaction and the actin regulator YWHAH. Other organelles, such as lipid droplets and peroxisomes, also pause near ER junctions. These findings highlight ER junctions as regulatory hubs that orchestrate organelle dynamics, contributing to the spatial coordination of organelle distribution and interactions within the cytoplasm.},

Currently available data assessing diatom responses focus on empirical comparisons between present-day and future conditions, rather than exploring the mechanisms driving these responses. Here, we conducted high-resolution growth experiments to map the fitness of diatoms across broad carbonate chemistry landscapes. Our results reveal species-specific carbonate chemistry niches, which can be used to predict ecological shifts between species under changing conditions driven by ocean acidification or ocean alkalinity enhancement. The results demonstrate that changes in diatom fitness are almost exclusively driven by carbon dioxide and proton concentrations, with bicarbonate exerting no discernible effect. Thus, current assumptions regarding the role of bicarbonate as a primary carbon source supporting diatom growth may be overestimated. This study presents a methodological and conceptual framework as a foundation for future studies to collate data capable of predicting species-specific responses and shifts in ecological niches driven by changes in marine carbonate chemistry.},

Here, we developed a noninvasive nanozyme eye drop capable of penetrating the fundus to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby inhibit neovascularization. The nanozyme eye drops consist of liposomes formed by fluorinated and arginine–glycine–aspartic acid–modified phospholipids, which enhance the penetration of ocular barriers. The encapsulated superoxide dismutase–catalase cascade nanozyme within these liposomes allows for efficient ROS scavenging. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that these nanozyme eye drops achieve deep retinal tissue penetration, alleviate oxidative stress, restore mitochondrial function, and suppress aberrant insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 signaling, thereby inhibiting pathological neovascularization. Enhanced ocular bioavailability and minimal toxicity further underscore its promise as a safe and effective noninvasive treatment for retinal neovascularization diseases.},

The observations are characterized by subkilometer-scale layering, ±20% variations in color of the individual layers, and high radiance ( I / F > 1). Strong spatial (latitudinal) variability is also evident, suggesting highly inhomogeneous absorption and atmospheric heating. Models of the radiance, while likely to be degenerate, indicate good agreement with lower-resolution results inferred from other techniques. Mesospheric aerosol layers (strongly blue in CaSSIS color ratios) are also evident. The observed decrease in the CaSSIS RED/BLU color ratio with altitude is indicative of a decrease in particle radius.},

Applying Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, we reduce the dataset’s dimensionality by 75%, identifying nine distinct precipitation groups and associated particle evolution pathways. UMAP effectively captures the global structure of precipitation phases such as rain, snow, and mixed-phase types, revealing clear patterns that linear methods struggle to resolve. The resulting UMAP manifold offers a unique perspective on precipitation phase and intensity, advancing our understanding of particle evolutionary processes and offering valuable insights for improving weather and climate models and remote sensing precipitation estimates.},

Postfire snow cover loss is more extreme in relatively low-elevation, warm environments compared to that in high-elevation, cold regions. Under +2°C of warming, 73% of the snow zone would experience more extreme earlier postfire snowmelt compared to historically average conditions. Regions with the largest shift earlier in postfire snowmelt timing under average climate conditions also have the largest shift earlier in postfire snowmelt under +2°C warming.

Warming weakened the GHG sink of alpine permafrost, thereby increasing (13%) its global warming potential, but strengthened the GHG sink of Arctic permafrost and decreased (−10%) its global warming potential. When warming caused drying of alpine permafrost soils, the CO 2 sink weakened but the CH 4 sink increased. In contrast, warming of relatively wet Arctic permafrost increased the CO 2 sink and CH 4 source. Warming led to much stronger increases of the N 2 O source in alpine than Arctic permafrost.

In the heterotaxy syndrome, abnormal left-right patterning leads to a spectrum of severe congenital heart defects, including ventricle malposition. A postulate anchored in the clinical nomenclature assumes that the looping direction of the embryonic heart tube determines ventricle position at birth. However, this has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here, we performed a unique longitudinal analysis of heterotaxy with right isomerism, using multimodality imaging of Nodal mouse mutants. Using direct correlations and advanced statistics, we dissected the contribution of heart looping variations to specific structural heart malformations, and uncovered unexpected plasticity of ventricle position after looping in 30% of revertant samples. Genetic tracing and topological associations show that plasticity involves a further step of heart remodeling at E13.5, rather than molecular reprogramming. Human patient scans are consistent with ventricle plasticity and suggest association with poorer prognosis. Our work reveals distinct asymmetric events shaping organs.},

The authors found that the genomic sequences within the same “kinetic domain” came together rapidly (less than 1 minute on average), whereas sequences in distinct kinetic domains took much longer (minutes to hours). The rapid search with kinetic domains is dependent upon the motor protein cohesin, which can pull together distal points faster than diffusion. —Di Jiang Genome function requires regulated genome motion. However, tools to directly observe this motion in vivo have been limited in coverage and resolution. Here we introduce an approach to tile mammalian chromosomes with self-mapping fluorescent labels and track them at ultraresolution. We find that sequences separated by submegabase distances transition to proximity in tens of seconds. This rapid search is dependent on cohesin and is exhibited only within domains. Domain borders act as kinetic impediments to this search process, rather than structural boundaries. The genomic separation–dependent scaling of the search time for cis interactions violated predictions of diffusion, suggesting motor-driven folding. We also uncover cohesin-dependent processive motion at 2.7 kilobases per second. Together, these multiscale dynamics reveal the organization of the genome into kinetically associated domains.},

Indeed, using genetic data collected only once to calculate effective population size helped to improve their models over multiple species. Although genetic data can be expensive to collect, the fact that doing so only once improved predictions across several years demonstrates a potential benefit for such efforts in the future. —Corinne Simonti Species population sizes fluctuate over time, and these temporal dynamics play a key role in governing the maintenance of biodiversity. Although modeling approaches have been developed to characterize fluctuations in species abundances, the data required to parameterize these models from scratch are substantial. Here we introduce a new approach to modeling population fluctuations on decadal timescales by relating community-level dynamics to population-level patterns encoded in plant genomes. Using genomic samples taken at a single time point to generate contemporary effective population size estimates in a temperate montane forest, we accurately predict fluctuations across three censuses. Our approach facilitates the use of genomic demography to parameterize multispecies community models in ecology and shows that population genomic data can provide accurate predictions for ecological dynamics.},

Despite high genetic diversity, the species shows stable but considerable continental population structure. Although one population showed little differentiation over a century and 4000 kilometers, nearby, we found two genetically distinct ecotypes.

  abstract     = {Genes are often controlled by enhancers located far away in the genome, but how their positioning affects gene activation is unclear. Eder et al . investigated how the position of the Sox2 gene influences activation by its enhancer. By systematically relocating reporter genes around the Sox2 locus, the authors found that Sox2 sits in an optimal “sweet spot” for activation and also restricts its enhancer’s reach. Removing Sox2 broadened and boosted enhancer-driven activation. This means that genes can act as gatekeepers, limiting their enhancers’ influence. Understanding these rules helps to explain gene regulation and may inform future genetic engineering or gene therapy strategies. —Di Jiang Genes are often activated by enhancers located at large genomic distances, and the importance of this positioning is poorly understood. By relocating promoter-reporter constructs into thousands of alternative positions within a single locus, we dissected the positional relationship between the mouse Sox2 gene and its distal enhancer. This revealed an intricate, sharply confined activation landscape in which the native Sox2 gene occupies an optimal position for its activation. Deletion of the gene relaxes this confinement and broadly increases reporter activity. The confining effect of the Sox2 gene is partially conferred by its ~1-kilobase coding region. Our local relocation approach provides high-resolution functional maps of a genomic locus and reveals that a gene can strongly constrain the realm of influence of its enhancer.},

General design strategies for electrode, electrolyte, and interphase are proposed to enable horizontally deposited metals with preferred crystallographic orientations and stable SEIs with distinct chemical compositions yet similar structural homogeneity.

Seismic monitoring of these changes has been limited to shallow depths, leaving an incomplete picture of the response-recovery cycles of fault zones. To look deeper into this, Bryan et al . applied optimal transport to receiver functions at broadband seismic stations for several years before and after the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes in California (see the Perspective by Rodriguez Padilla). After the events, seismic waves slowed throughout the crustal column, a sign of both shallow and deep damage. Recovery at shallow depths occurred within months, whereas deep damage persisted for at least several years after rupture. —Angela Hessler Earthquakes abruptly release tectonic stress that builds slowly over time through the coupled evolution of faults and the surrounding crust. Seismic wavespeeds track crustal deformation and stress changes, but typical monitoring methods are most sensitive to shallow depths. Using receiver functions, we tracked rupture-zone wavespeed and anisotropy changes throughout the crust during the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence. Shallow coseismic wavespeed reductions recovered within months, whereas a deeper postseismic wavespeed drop persisted without measurable recovery over several years. The deep, persistent wavespeed drop likely reflects accumulating damage driven by postseismic deformation, suggesting two possible scenarios: (i) a slow interseismic recovery where wavespeed and anisotropy track long-term stress evolution; or (ii) permanent deformation of an immature fault zone. Both scenarios affect the dynamics and energy budget of the seismic cycle.},

The authors identified several regions of the genome that appear to be under recent selection, including one near the gene STC1 , which is involved in the kidneys’ response to dehydration.

Working with Turkana communities, we sequenced 367 whole genomes and identified eight regions with evidence for recent positive selection. One of these regions includes a putative regulatory element for STC1 —a kidney-expressed gene involved in metabolism and the response to dehydration. We show that STC1 is induced by antidiuretic hormone in human cells, is associated with urea levels in the Turkana themselves, and is under strong and recent selection in this population as well as a second East African population, the Daasanach.

  abstract     = {An enduring challenge in organic chemistry is the selective synthesis of Z olefins, carbon-carbon double bonds with the largest substituents on each carbon oriented on the same side of the bond axis. Verardi et al . report a method that electrochemically replaces carbon-hydrogen bonds on olefins with sulfonium groups. Surprisingly, one of the groups then underwent elimination in a Z-selective manner. The other group could then be replaced with a versatile range of substituents that preserve the Z geometry. —Jake S. Yeston The stereoselective functionalization of C–H bonds represents a central challenge in modern organic synthesis. Despite decades of innovation in C–H activation chemistry, methods for Z -selective functionalization of alkenes have eluded synthetic practitioners. Terminal alkenes present the biggest challenge for Z -selectivity as they require selective cleavage of the more hindered of two otherwise virtually identical C–H bonds. Herein, we describe the transformation of alkenes into transient 1,2- bis -sulfonium intermediates found to undergo Z -selective elimination, overturning a textbook E2 stereoselectivity rule through stabilizing interactions. We identify paired electrolysis as an enabling strategy to both selectively generate the requisite bis -sulfonium intermediate and drive its rapid elimination in situ. The resultant Z -alkenyl sulfonium linchpins provide access to a wide array of Z -alkene targets from inexpensive feedstocks through robust cross-coupling reactions.},

  abstract     = {The maturity of experimental studies of nuclear magnetic resonance and the sophistication with which nuclear spins can be manipulated provided the first demonstration of a quantum computer platform. However, progress stalled early on when it was realized that scaling up was problematic. Stemp et al . now demonstrate direct entanglement between two nuclear spins that are separated by a relatively long distance. Two phosphorus atoms implanted in silicon formed a system comprising two 31 P nuclei and two bound electrons. Control of the exchange interaction between the two electrons resulted in quantum entanglement of the two nuclear spins. The results and scalability of the method are promising for the development of nuclear spin–based quantum computers. —Ian S. Osborne The use of nuclear spins for quantum computation is limited by the difficulty in creating genuine quantum entanglement between distant nuclei. Current demonstrations of nuclear entanglement in semiconductors rely on coupling the nuclei to a common electron, which is not a scalable strategy. In this work, we demonstrated a two-qubit controlled-Z logic operation between the nuclei of two phosphorus atoms in a silicon device, separated by up to 20 nanometers. Each atom binds separate electrons, whose exchange interaction mediates the nuclear two-qubit gate. We prepared and measured a nuclear Bell state with a fidelity of 76 − 5 + 5 % and a concurrence of 0.67 − 0.05 + 0.05 . With this method, future progress in scaling up semiconductor spin qubits can be extended to the development of nuclear spin–based quantum computers.},

  abstract     = {Rangelands provide livelihoods for billions of people but are being increasingly degraded. Overgrazing is often cited as a cause of this degradation, but the relative effects of grazing and climate change are poorly understood. Purevjav et al . designed a quasiexperimental study to disentangle the effects of climate and herd size on rangeland primary productivity in Mongolia, where livelihoods depend on rangelands and more than half of these rangelands are considered degraded. Although herd size had a negative effect on productivity, weather effects were much larger, particularly at decadal scales over which herders can adapt to changing conditions. These results suggest that policies limiting herd sizes may affect people without preventing rangeland degradation and support the need to curb climate change to protect ecosystems and livelihoods. —Bianca Lopez Rangelands are Earth’s dominant land type, supporting the livelihoods of more than 2 billion people. Concerns about rangeland degradation typically focus on overgrazing. But climate change may be a greater culprit. Using spatially disaggregated, nationwide data from Mongolia, from 1984 to 2024, we exploited seasonal variation in grazing locations to quasi-experimentally estimate the causal effects of livestock herd size, weather, and climate change on rangeland primary productivity. At interannual frequency, herd size modestly but significantly negatively affects primary productivity, with notable variation across ecological zones. The effects of weather fluctuations are, however, an order of magnitude larger. At the decadal scale, over which herders can adapt to climate change, herd size effects disappear, and temperature effects dominate. In Mongolia, climate change seems to drive most long-term change in rangeland primary productivity.},

Kamba et al . now take this a step further to demonstrate the quantum mechanical effect of squeezing in the motional state of a levitated silica microsphere, squeezing results from the knowledge of one parameter to be sacrificed to gain better precision of its conjugate parameter. In this case, knowledge of position was relaxed, resulting in a sharpening of the velocity distribution function. These results should allow quantum mechanical effects to be explored further in macroscopic systems and may find applications in advanced quantum sensing technologies. —Ian S. Osborne Manipulating the motion of macroscopic objects near their quantum mechanical uncertainties has been desired in diverse fields, including fundamental physics, sensing, and transducers. Despite progress in ground-state cooling of a levitated solid particle, realizing its nonclassical states has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate quantum squeezing of the motion of a single nanoparticle by rapidly varying its oscillation frequency. We reveal appreciable narrowing of the velocity variance to –4.9 ± 0.1 decibels of that of the ground state using free-expansion measurements. Our work shows that a levitated nanoparticle offers an ideal platform for studying nonclassical states of its motion and provides a route to developing applications in quantum sensing and exploring quantum mechanics at a macroscopic scale.},

How much and when that rain falls has major implications for the environment, agriculture, water supply, and river flow. Hill et al . found that although the well-documented effect of El Niño events is to decrease summer rainfall, it also paradoxically intensifies extreme daily precipitation amounts, thereby resulting in hazardous conditions across the region. The processes that create this intensification may be important in other tropical locations as well. —Jesse Smith Extreme rainfall during the Indian summer monsoon can be destructive and deadly to the world’s third-largest economy and most populous country. Although El Niño events in the equatorial Pacific are known to suppress total summer rainfall throughout India, we show using observational data spanning 1901 to 2020 that, counterintuitively, they simultaneously intensify extreme daily rainfall. This is partly driven by increases in extreme daily values of convective buoyancy, provided that both the undilute instability of near-surface air and the dilution by mixing with drier air above are considered. El Niño could plausibly drive similar changes in other tropical regions, and our framework could be further applied to changes in hourly extremes, to other internal variability modes, and to forced trends under climate change.},

Halpern et al . mapped the intensity of 10 different types of human-caused pressure, including the effects of climate change, fishing, and pollution, across the global oceans. Overlapping these data with the distribution of marine habitats and their vulnerabilities to stressors provides estimates of total impacts on ecosystems. Cumulative impacts are expected to double by midcentury, including in countries and coastal areas where people depend heavily on marine resources. Ocean warming and fisheries are two of the largest impacts, suggesting that curbing climate change and sustainable fisheries management could relieve stress on marine ecosystems. —Bianca Lopez Pressures from human activities are expected to increase substantially, affecting marine ecosystems globally. To plan for a sustainable future, we need to forecast the distributions of cumulative effects from multiple pressures. Here, we mapped (at 10-kilometer resolution) the future cumulative impacts of 10 climate, land-based, fishing, and other pressures on 20 marine habitats under two climate scenarios at mid-century (around 2050). We found that cumulative impacts are projected to increase 2.2 to 2.6 times globally, with coastal habitats facing higher impacts but offshore regions facing faster increases, especially in equatorial regions. Furthermore, many countries dependent on marine resources will have large increases in impacts. Incorporating these results into strategic policy and management will support more sustainable use and protection of marine ecosystems and the services they provide.},

Thus, the birds both understand the categories of their calls and create mental representations of their meaning, similar to what humans do. —Sacha Vignieri Vocal communication in social animals involves the production and perception of various calls that ethologists categorize into call types based on their acoustical structure and behavioral context. Whether these categories indicate distinct meanings for the animals remains unknown. The zebra finch, a gregarious songbird, uses ~11 call types that are known to communicate hunger, danger, or social conflict and to establish social contact and bonding. Using auditory discrimination tasks, we show that the birds both discriminate and categorize all the call types in their vocal repertoire. In addition, systematic errors were more frequent between call types used in similar behavioral contexts than could be expected from their acoustic similarity. Thus, zebra finches organize their calls into categories and create a mental representation of the meaning of these sounds.},

In particular, emergent behaviors of neurons in biohybrid neuromuscular systems can advance bioinspired locomotion research. Although recent studies have demonstrated that chemical or optogenetic stimulation of neurons can control muscular actuation through the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the correlation between neuronal activities and resulting modulation in the muscle responses is less understood, hindering the engineering of high-level functional biohybrid systems. Here, we developed NMJ-based biohybrid crawling robots with optogenetic mouse motor neurons, skeletal muscles, 3D-printed hydrogel scaffolds, and integrated onboard wireless micro–light-emitting diode (μLED)–based optoelectronics. We investigated the coupling of the light stimulation and neuromuscular actuation through power spectral density (PSD) analysis. We verified the modulation of the mechanical functionality of the robot depending on the frequency of the optical stimulation to the neural tissue. We demonstrated continued muscle contraction up to 20 minutes after a 1-minute-long pulsed 2-hertz optical stimulation of the neural tissue. Furthermore, the robots were shown to maintain their mechanical functionality for more than 2 weeks. This study provides insights into reliable neuronal control with optoelectronics, supporting advancements in neuronal modulation, biohybrid intelligence, and automation.},

  abstract     = {Reading fluency is a vital building block for developing literacy, yet the best way to practice fluency—reading aloud—can cause anxiety severe enough to inhibit literacy development in ways that can have an adverse effect on students through adulthood. One promising intervention to mitigate oral reading anxiety is to have children read aloud to a robot. Although observations in prior work have suggested that people likely feel more comfortable in the presence of a robot instead of a human, few studies have empirically demonstrated that people feel less anxious performing in front of a robot compared with a human or used objective physiological indicators to identify decreased anxiety. To investigate whether a robotic reading companion could reduce reading anxiety felt by children, we conducted a within-subjects study where children aged 8 to 11 years ( n = 52) read aloud to a human and a robot individually while being monitored for physiological responses associated with anxiety. We found that children exhibited fewer physiological indicators of anxiety, specifically vocal jitter and heart rate variability, when reading to the robot compared with reading to a person. This paper provides strong evidence that a robot’s presence has an effect on the anxiety a person experiences while doing a task, offering justification for the use of robots in a wide-reaching array of social interactions that may be anxiety inducing.},

  abstract     = {According to productive failure (PF) theory, experiencing failure during problem-solving can enhance students’ knowledge acquisition in subsequent instruction. However, challenging students with problems beyond their current capabilities may strain their skills, prior knowledge, and emotional well-being. To address this, we designed a social robot–assisted teaching activity in which students observed a robot’s unsuccessful problem-solving attempts, offering a PF-like preparatory effect without requiring direct failure. We conducted two classroom-based studies in a middle school setting to evaluate the method’s effectiveness. In study 1 ( N = 135), we compared three instructional methods—observing robot failure (RF), individual problem-solving failure, and direct instruction—in an eighth-grade mathematics lesson. Students in the RF condition showed the greatest gains in conceptual understanding and reported lower social pressure, although no significant differences were found in procedural knowledge or knowledge transfer. Follow-up study 2 ( N = 110) further validated the method’s effectiveness in supporting knowledge acquisition after a 2-week robot-involved adaptation phase, when the novelty effect had largely subsided. Students confirmed their perception of the robot as a peer, and they offered positive evaluations of its intelligence and neutral views of its anthropomorphism. Our findings suggest that observing the robot’s failure has a comparable, or even greater, effect on knowledge acquisition than experiencing failure firsthand. These results underscore the value of social robots as peers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education and highlight the potential of integrating robotics with evidence-based teaching strategies to enhance learning outcomes.},

To overcome this challenge, we propose a robotic sensing approach that integrates embedded ultrasonic soft sensors (EUSSs) with magnetic actuators, resulting in a wireless sensor-integrated miniature machine with seamless integration and minimal interference between fields. The EUSS, with its compact dimensions (1.3 millimeters by 1.3 millimeters by 1.6 millimeters), softness (98 kilopascals), and lightweight design (4.6 milligrams), is compatible with both soft and rigid components in terms of deformability and size. By engineering onboard transducers and using passive ultrasound communication along with external magnetic fields, we could wirelessly detect and regulate environmental parameters such as force, vibration, viscosity, and temperature. Demonstrations in rabbit and porcine models show the potential for robotic feedback control, accurate drug dosing, and in situ physiological monitoring, paving the way for real-world applications of intelligent miniature machines.},

Although models based on physical principles often generalize well, they typically require full-state information, which can be difficult or impossible to extract from perception data in complex, real-world scenarios. Learning-based dynamics models provide an alternative by deriving state transition functions purely from perceived interaction data, enabling the capture of complex, hard-to-model factors and predictive uncertainty and accelerating simulations that are often too slow for real-time control. Recent successes in this field have demonstrated notable advancements in robot capabilities, including long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects, granular materials, and complex multiobject interactions such as stowing and packing. A crucial aspect of these investigations is the choice of state representation, which determines the inductive biases in the learning system for reduced-order modeling of scene dynamics. This article provides a timely and comprehensive review of current techniques and trade-offs in designing learned dynamics models, highlighting their role in advancing robot capabilities through integration with state estimation and control and identifying critical research gaps for future exploration.},

  abstract     = {Modern robotic manufacturing requires collision-free coordination of multiple robots to complete numerous tasks in shared, obstacle-rich workspaces. Although individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning under spatiotemporal constraints remain computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales. Existing multiarm systems deployed in industry rely on human intuition and experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on procedurally generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot configurations, and task distributions. It uses a graph representation of scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through RL to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the subproblems of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and scalability of our planner also open the door to capabilities such as fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based replanning, where rapid adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.},

  abstract     = {Mutant RAS drives the growth of various cancers, and mutant-selective drugs are approved or under development for clinical use. Sealover et al. identified differential and complementary engagement of downstream MAPK and PI3K pathways among mutant and wild-type RAS members that demanded a combined approach to effectively stunt tumor development. In KRAS-mutant cells, for example, inhibition of PI3K, which was activated by wild-type HRAS and NRAS more than by mutant KRAS, was synergistically cytotoxic with a KRAS-mutant–specific inhibitor. The findings reveal the critical contribution of wild-type RAS family members in cancer cells with mutant RAS and the need for therapeutic approaches that simultaneously target both. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Mutated RAS proteins activate downstream effector pathways (RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT) to drive oncogenic transformation and progression. Because RAS family members differentially engage these pathways, combined inhibition of both pathways is required to effectively treat RAS -mutated cancers. Here, we found that this was due to signaling contributed by wild-type RAS family members that activated an effector pathway that was poorly engaged by the mutant RAS family member. Wild-type KRAS and NRAS promoted RAF-MEK-ERK signaling in cells expressing mutant HRAS, whereas wild-type HRAS and NRAS promoted PI3K-AKT signaling in cells expressing mutant KRAS. Combining inhibitors targeting the poorly engaged RAS effector pathways with inhibitors targeting the mutant RAS resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity in a manner that depended on wild-type RAS expression. The farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib blocked mutant HRAS-PI3K signaling and synergized with MEK inhibitors in HRAS -mutated cells, whereas KRAS G12C inhibitors blocked mutant KRAS-MEK signaling and synergized with PI3K inhibitors in KRAS G12C -mutated cells. Synergy was abolished in MEFs lacking all RAS proteins and in cancer cell lines in which nonmutated RAS family members were deleted. Our data highlight the critical role of wild-type RAS family members in supporting mutant RAS signaling and its importance as a therapeutic cotarget in RAS -mutated cancers.},

Fallone et al. found that IL-15 and IL-18 synergized to activate the complex mTORC1, which resulted in increased proliferation and function of both mouse and human NK cells. IL-15 and IL-18 stimulated mTORC1 activity through distinct pathways not previously implicated in its regulation. The combination of IL-15 and IL-18 improved the survival of mice engrafted with tumor cells, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of NK cell–based cancer immunotherapy. —Wei Wong The multiprotein complex mTORC1 is essential for the increase in protein synthesis and bioenergetic metabolism that supports the proliferation of many cell types, including natural killer (NK) cells, which are important innate effectors of the antitumoral response. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of mTORC1 activation in NK cells by interleukin-15 (IL-15) and IL-18, which promote NK cell function and are components of a cytokine cocktail used to preactivate NK cells for cancer immunotherapy. Through genetic and pharmacological approaches, we showed that IL-15 activated mTORC1 through the PI3K/Akt/ERK pathway, whereas IL-18 signaled through the p38 effectors MK2 and MK3 in both murine and human primary NK cells. Both pathways synergized to promote NK cell proliferation and effector functions in an mTORC1-dependent manner. Moreover, both pathways operated independently of the inhibitor TSC and the activator Rheb, revealing a noncanonical mode of mTORC1 activation by cytokines. Treating mice with IL-15 and IL-18 in combination led to increased NK cell numbers and improved antitumoral activity, suggesting that this cytokine combination could be exploited to enhance NK cell potential in therapeutic settings.},
