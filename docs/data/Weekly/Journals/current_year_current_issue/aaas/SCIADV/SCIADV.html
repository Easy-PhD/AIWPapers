Here, this work introduces a scalable yet versatile approach to design and fabricate 3D electronic systems by printing liquid metal patterns onto heat-shrinkable polymer substrates. Upon controlled thermal actuation, the 2D circuits transform into target 3D geometries with enhanced electrical performance. The resulting 3D shrinking electronics enable conformal antenna integration for IoT devices and gesture-interactive wearable interfaces. This low-cost, versatile platform offers a paradigm for customizable, shape-adaptive electronics in intelligent real and virtual environments.},

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising adsorbents, yet atomic-level insights into Xe and Kr adsorption remain limited. Here, we report the first application of high-field solid-state 83 Kr nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), alongside extensive 129 Xe NMR, to investigate gas adsorption in eight MOFs representing three design strategies: ultramicroporous one-dimensional–channel MOFs with pore sizes matching noble gas diameters, functionalized MOFs, and MOFs with open metal sites. Single-gas and coadsorption studies reveal distinct adsorption sites, guest-host interactions, and gas dynamics in each MOF. Most MOFs retain crystallinity after exposure to 60-kilogray γ radiation. Several radiation-sensitive MOFs exhibit enhanced stability in the presence of Xe, suggesting that Xe adsorption enhances framework stability and may broaden the range of MOFs usable under γ radiation in nuclear off-gas separation. These findings offer valuable molecular-level design insights.},

However, once prototyped, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)–based silicone elastomer is limited in mechanical strength and programmable spatial construction due to the flexible polymer matrix and mismatched interface with other materials. We propose a mechanically strengthened PDMS-based origami structure (MSOS) via polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)/acetone solution swelling. The planar elastomer precursor can be swollen-folded into programmable spatial construction based on mechanically strengthened creases during solvent diffusion and de-gelatinization. This strengthened crease is induced by a hierarchical shrink-fitting based on solute molecular chain insertion and a seamless coupling interface between elastomer microstructures and solidified PMMA. We present a programmable MSOS to support a load more than 58,100 times of its own weight and a pillbug-inspired ringbot to resist heavy impact. Our work provides a strategy toward customized mechanically strengthened soft material for developing functional structural architectures and soft origami robots.},

It achieves dual-modal imaging at a 10-hertz frame rate and completes a whole-breast scan in 12 seconds, providing penetration up to 5 centimeters in vivo. In a clinical study involving 170 patients with 186 breast tumors, we developed a diagnostic model leveraging combined photoacoustic and ultrasound features. In a triple-blinded comparison using pathological diagnosis as the ground truth, HDMI significantly improved diagnostic specificity from 22.5 to 75.0% compared to clinical ultrasonography.

Upon ingestion, the outer layer neutralizes gastric acid through double-decomposition reaction, protecting bacterial viability and the inner layer. During intestinal passage, the inner layer enables T1/T2 dual-mode magnetic resonance imaging for real-time tracking, whereas the lesion-triggered release of manganese ions allows T1 single-mode pathological detection. The inner layer also exhibits superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, synergizing therapeutic effects with bacteria. Further supported by satisfactory performances in two murine models of Salmonella -induced colitis and apolipoprotein E–deficient atherosclerosis, this work provides a platform to generate innovative theranostic agents for advanced bacteriotherapy.},

Here, we report a multibit programming spine structure strategy to create a magnetorheological metamaterial with high-density, reprogrammable, and visually readable information encoding capacities. Inspired by spine features, the magnetorheological spine beams, exhibiting substantial stiffness variation by bistable transition, meticulously conceived the stiffness reprogrammable magnetorheological metamaterial (SRMM). The SRMM exhibits a large stiffness conversion capability (40-fold) and high-density information encoding performance (10-bit). Coupling with the mechanoluminescent materials, the mechanical information achieves visualization conveniently, which is attributed to the conversion of the stiffness data into optical signals through optical energy level transitions. Such stiffness-based magnetorheological metamaterial offers expansive information encoding spaces, stable operation capabilities, and convenient readout approaches, advancing mechanical information processing system design for extreme environments.},

In the peptidoglycan biogenesis pathway in Escherichia coli , MurJ, the lipid II flippase, is an essential membrane protein. The 37-residue protein M from the Levivirus phage, known as Lys M or Sgl M , targets MurJ and induces cell lysis; however, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the MurJ/Lys M (JM) complex at 3.09-angstrom resolution, revealing that Lys M interacts with the crevasse between TM2 and TM7 of MurJ, locking MurJ in an outward-facing conformation, with Lys M acting like a wedge. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis and pull-down assays revealed key residues responsible for Lys M function, and molecular dynamics simulations showed that Lys M stabilizes MurJ’s outward-facing state. These findings demonstrate an unprecedented phage-derived mechanism for blocking lipid II transport, providing a structural framework for designing MurJ-targeted antimicrobial agents.},

Here, we present a hybrid platform that enables comprehensive dc and ac analog signal processing within a 2D-ACT device. By synergistically integrating 2D-FET and SAW components, our system achieves real-time subwavelength carrier monitoring and ac signal manipulation. ac measurements further elucidate mechanisms of dc acoustoelectric current generation. Notably, by controlling the phase and intensity of counter-propagating SAWs, we demonstrate analog signal addition and subtraction capabilities not previously realized in 2D-ACT devices. This platform establishes a benchmark for compact, low-loss ACT devices in ac signal processing, representing a notable advance for acoustoelectric technologies and 2D material systems.},

Our results show that revealing electro-chemo-mechanical interactions is essential to develop strategies to suppress the degradation of SSBs. Particularly, we revisit a LiNbO 3 (LNO) coating layer to mitigate electrochemical degradation. The LNO@NMC811 cathode retains 116 milliampere-hours per gram after 200 cycles, showing excellent stability, while the uncoated NMC811 cathode keeps degrading over time, with suppressed chemical heterogeneity and mechanical failure.

The cholesterol in current LNP formulations promotes their uptake by hepatocytes, while the polyethylene glycol-modified (PEGylated) lipids induce PEG immunogenicity, further reducing the efficacy in the setting of repeated administrations. We develop a three-component (ThrCo) LNP by replacing cholesterol and PEGylated lipids in Pfizer-BioNTech LNPs with zwitterionic pyridine carboxybetaine (PyCB) ionizable lipids (ILs), achieving ~70% lower liver accumulation and a 4.5-fold increase in spleen-specific mRNA translation. PyCB ILs enhance LNP hydrophilicity, stabilizing the outer membrane to compensate for cholesterol removal. PyCB groups also exhibit strong protonation at endosomal pH, facilitating mRNA translation. The zwitterionic surface of ThrCo LNP reduces protein adsorption, thereby preventing the accelerated blood clearance effect caused by PEGylated lipids following repeated administrations. Thus, ThrCo LNP–based vaccines efficiently deliver mRNA to splenic antigen-presenting cells, boosting immune responses and improving therapeutic outcomes.},

Comparing to the lamellar structures formed at noncatalyzed electrodes, Li 2 S deposited at Pt catalytic electrode exhibited a spherical morphology. The zero-order reaction kinetics was captured on catalytic surfaces, differing from noncatalyzed electrodes. The electrodeposition of Li 2 S follows the overpotential-driven progressive and instantaneous nucleation processes, showing a promoted deposition and reversible dissolution at the overpotential of 80 mV. The Li 2 S transformation under high polysulfides concentrations indicated that an increase of catalytic sites and uniform distribution of Li 2 S would be critical for practical Li-S batteries.

The synthesis combines initiated chemical vapor deposition and diffusion-limited vapor derivatization to form a zwitterionic top layer with high ionic conductivity and an inner covalently cross-linked layer blocking solvent access while remaining stable at reducing potentials. Cu substrates with G-ZWP interphases show >2000-hour cycling at 1 milliampere per square centimeter [6 milliampere hours per square centimeter (mA·hour/cm 2 )].

  abstract     = {Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic RNA-protein assemblies that form in response to cellular stress and must be efficiently disassembled to restore normal cell function. Valosin-containing protein (VCP), an enzyme implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, is essential for SG disassembly, but whether and how this process is coordinated with SG assembly remains unclear. Here, we identify the VCP cofactor, Alveolar soft part sarcoma locus (ASPL) as a key regulator linking SG assembly and disassembly. ASPL promotes SG assembly by facilitating biomolecular condensation of Ras guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein-binding protein (G3BP) and stabilizing its interactions with other SG proteins. ASPL also facilitates phosphorylation and activation of VCP by UNC-51-like kinases 1 and 2 (ULK1/2), enabling G3BP extraction and efficient SG disassembly. Pathogenic VCP mutations that disrupt ASPL binding impair SG disassembly, a defect rescued by phosphomimetic mutations or ASPL depletion. Our findings suggest that disruptions in the ASPL-VCP interaction uncouple SG assembly and disassembly, representing a potential mechanism underlying VCP-associated neurodegenerative diseases.},

  abstract     = {Centriole assembly involves the coordination of centriolar modules. One module is the A-C linker, an enigmatic protein assembly connecting the A-microtubule of one microtubule triplet to the C-microtubule of the neighboring triplet. Here, we integrated biochemistry, multiscale cryo–electron microscopy, and AlphaFold modeling to investigate the architecture of the centriole. Using an improved centriole isolation method, we determined the structure of the A-C linker bound to microtubule triplets, which revealed how the A-C linker cross-links microtubules and integrates with the B-C junction. We found marked changes in the structure and composition of the A-C linker that correlate with the presence of other centriolar modules, including the pinhead, cartwheel, and inner scaffold. Our findings show that the A-C linker is a highly integrated component of the centriole whose polymorphism may orchestrate the assembly of spatially distinct centriolar modules, and provide a framework for dissecting the biology of centrioles.},

Nevertheless, little is known about the precise neural mechanisms governing the regulation of contagious pain in response to diverse environmental stressors. Here, we report that early life maternal separation (MS) precipitates impairments in the pain contagion between familiar partners. Specifically, we identify the indispensable role of glutamatergic projections from the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) to the prelimbic cortex (PrL) for the development of vicarious pain hypersensitivity. MS dampens activation of the PVT → PrL pathway during social interactions between observer and painful demonstrator. Augmenting the excitability or activity of the PVT → PrL circuit through chemogenetic interventions or tactile stimulation resembling social touch significantly ameliorates the MS-evoked contagious pain deficits. Collectively, our findings delineate a neural circuitry substrate underlying the loss of contagious pain stemming from MS and propose a potential therapeutic avenue for mitigating empathic impairments associated with early life adversity.},

  abstract     = {High-temperature stress in plant stamens frequently causes male sterility, limiting crop yields. Gene duplication resulting from polyploidization offers insights into plant adaptation to environmental stress. Here, we reveal that extensive duplication of GhRALF30L , which encodes an intrinsically disordered small peptide, contributes to thermotolerance in cotton male reproductive organs. Polyploidization has driven the formation of 23 GhRALF30L genes in allotetraploid cotton, whereas only four or five homologs are identified in its two diploid ancestors. Expression and functional analyses confirm that GhRALF30L regulates thermotolerance in a dosage-dependent manner, with reduced dosage decreasing heat resistance. Under heat stress, GhRALF30L interacts with GhFERA1/GhCAPA1 and enhances their condensation at the plasma membrane, which activates heat stress responses by up-regulating the expression of heat shock factors ( HSFs ), heat shock proteins ( HSPs ), and reactive oxygen species scavenging genes. Our findings demonstrate that the GhRALF30L gene cluster, resulting from polyploidization, confers thermotolerance through facilitating the condensation of GhFERA1/GhCAPA1.},

We found that loss of clh-1 extends life span, improves stress resistance, reduces neuronal damage, and extends health span. These effects are linked to protective pathways, including those for oxidative stress and autophagy, and depend on the DAF-16/FoxO transcription factor. Notably, by knocking down and overexpressing the carbonic anhydrase cah-4 , we show that it is the glial alkalinization caused by loss of clh-1 that mediates these protective effects.

We developed an automated radio frequency identification (RFID) tracking system to continuously collect behavioral data from entire colonies, monitoring 102 individuals from five colonies for 30 days. Based on behavioral parameters, we statistically identified distinct behavioral phenotypes, comprising one cluster for breeders and six clusters for nonbreeders. Breeders formed strong social bonds, consistently remaining close in activity rhythm synchrony, spatial proximity, and directional following. In contrast, nonbreeders exhibited behavioral heterogeneity according to their cluster: One cluster avoided other active nonbreeders, whereas another cluster attracted frequent following.

Through the IL-27–IL-27 receptor interaction, these IL-27/CXCL10-producing B cells targeted CD40-activated B cells in vitro and, upon induction by immunization and viral infection, optimized antibody responses and antiviral immunity in vivo. Also present in breast cancer tumors and retained there through CXCL10-CXCR3 interaction–mediated self-targeting, these cells promoted B cell PD-L1 expression and immune evasion. Mechanistically, Il27 and Cxcl10 transcription was induced by synergizing Toll-like receptor (TLR) and CD40 signals and driven by coinduced transcription factor BATF3, which directly targeted these genes. By applying a discovery framework focusing on regulatory cells, our findings expand the recognized scope of B cell regulatory functions.},

Here, we show that temporal variations in the slope of earthquake frequency-magnitude distribution ( b value) at Mount Etna, a proxy for crustal stress changes, can track magma movements from deep to shallow crustal levels. Analyzing two decades of seismicity (2005–2024) across three crustal sectors, we distinguished magma recharge from the mantle, its transfer and storage at intermediate depths, and final ascent to the surface. Moreover, we found that b value time variations can precede geochemical anomalies from magma ascent and its eruption by a few months.

Across Mars, derived wind stresses systematically exceed those predicted by global circulation models and frequently surpass the threshold required to initiate particle saltation and the lifting of dust. We identify instances of fast-moving dust devils, indicating strong near-surface winds, that are colocated with large-scale dust lifting events and storms.

  abstract     = {The rate of DNA synthesis is crucial for full DNA duplication. We report a key role of p21 in controlling this rate. During normal replication, p21 promotes nascent DNA synthesis alongside the DNA polymerase iota (Pol ι)/p53 complex. When p21 is down-regulated but detectable, nascent DNA tracks are longer and discontinuous and rely on primase and DNA polymerase (PrimPol). With the complete elimination of p21, nascent DNA tracks become shorter and continuous and depend on Pol kappa (κ). Endogenous p21 levels are critical for genomic stability, as both PrimPol- and Pol κ–mediated syntheses can induce chromosomal instability. The residual expression of p21 in p53-null cells influences the involvement of PrimPol or Pol κ in nascent DNA synthesis and subsequent chromosomal instability. Our results demonstrate that endogenous levels of p21 in cycling cells, insufficient for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition, prevent genomic instability through proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding (PCNA), limiting PrimPol and Pol κ’s role in nascent DNA synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Limited tumor immunogenicity and the profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) pose major challenges to effective cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we present a photoactivatable immunostimulator based on nanoengineered microalgae (PCC@AuNP) to simultaneously enhance tumor immunogenicity and remodel the TME. Mechanistically, photocatalytically generated hydrogen induces robust immunogenic cell death by triggering severe endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Concurrently, photosynthetic oxygen production and photocatalytic lactic acid depletion collaboratively alleviate immunosuppression within the TME, thereby enhancing cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity by reducing the infiltration of immunosuppressive cells and promoting the repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages from the M2 to the M1 phenotype. In vivo studies demonstrate that PCC@AuNP not only eradicates primary tumors but also elicits potent systemic antitumor immunity against distant lesions, without observable toxicity to healthy tissues. Collectively, this innovative PCC@AuNP platform offers a safe and effective therapeutic strategy, heralding a pioneering era of cascade-augmented gas-driven cancer immunotherapy with superior precision and biosafety.},

  abstract     = {Innate immune signaling is activated in immunometabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, yet its impact on glucose homeostasis is controversial. Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 integrates innate immune signals following diet-induced obesity to promote glucose homeostasis through the induction of mitophagy. Whereas TRAF6 was dispensable for pancreatic β cell function at baseline, TRAF6 was pivotal for insulin secretion, mitochondrial respiration, and mitophagy following metabolic stress in mouse and human islets. TRAF6 was critical for the recruitment and function of the ubiquitin-mediated (Parkin-dependent) mitophagy machinery. Glucose intolerance induced by TRAF6 deficiency following metabolic stress was reversed by concomitant Parkin deficiency by relieving obstructions in receptor-mediated (Parkin-independent) mitophagy. Our results establish that TRAF6 is vital for traffic through Parkin-mediated mitophagy and implicates TRAF6 in the cross-regulation of ubiquitin- and receptor-mediated mitophagy. Together, we illustrate that β cells engage innate immune signaling to adaptively respond to a diabetogenic environment.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer and liver metastases are a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Overexpression of the immunostimulatory cytokine TNFSF14/LIGHT associates with improved survival and correlates with increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients and a clinically relevant model of colorectal liver metastases. We demonstrate that LIGHT monotherapy activates T cells, but also induces T cell exhaustion and the recruitment of immunosuppressive elements. As colorectal liver metastases exhibit high levels of CTLA-4 expression, we combined LIGHT overexpression with anti-CTLA-4, leading to complete tumor control. The combination functions by homing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, inducing tumor antigen-specific T cells, and reversing T cell exhaustion. Whereas both LIGHT overexpression and anti-CTLA-4 increase tumor-promoting macrophages, the combination eliminates this population. The ability of LIGHT overexpression combined with CTLA-4 inhibition to reverse T cell exhaustion and myeloid cell suppression is supported by analysis of complementary patient cohorts and has strong clinical relevance, especially given that liver metastases contribute to immunotherapy resistance across various cancer types.},

  abstract     = {Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) are an abundant class of compounds in atmospheric particulate matter, exerting considerable impacts on air quality, climate, and public health. They are typically derived from secondary formation, which is generated through atmospheric chemical reactions involving precursor compounds, such as phenolic compounds. However, information on NAC formation mechanisms remains limited. Here, we found that particulate-phase NAC concentrations were notably affected by relative humidity (RH) in field observations. Smog chamber experiments indicated that RH could influence NAC formation via changes in gaseous water concentration, rather than solely through aerosol liquid water content. Theoretical calculations further clarified that water clusters (WCs), formed from gaseous water, can notably lower reaction energy barriers along the NAC formation pathway, rendering this pathway competitive under atmospheric conditions. Hence, we propose a potential mechanism in which WCs catalyze NAC formation, offering a previously unidentified perspective on atmospheric secondary aerosol formation.},

  abstract     = {The immune tumor microenvironment is a dynamic ecosystem where B cells play critical roles in modulating immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy responses. While traditionally seen as passive players in tumor immunity, recent evidence suggests that B cells actively influence antitumor responses. This study examines the role of B cells and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) in melanoma responses to ICB. Retrospective meta-analyses reveal increased B cell enrichment in ICB responders’ pretreatment. Functional assays show that B cell depletion impairs T cell–mediated tumor cytotoxicity. EVs from melanoma tumors were analyzed, identifying miR-99a-5p in CD19 + EVs as up-regulated in responders. Silencing miR-99a-5p in B cells reduces T cell antitumor activity, suggesting its role in immune modulation. Mechanistically, miR-99a-5p promotes B cell maturation via class-switch recombination. These findings underscore B cells’ impact on melanoma immunotherapy, offering insights into novel therapeutic strategies targeting B cell–related pathways.},

We report here that mice can accurately discriminate airflow in the absence of whiskers. Modulated sniffing and refined calcium signaling in the olfactory bulb inhibitory network during olfactory anemo-discriminations confirmed the orthonasal airflow information processing. Genetic perturbation of AMPAR function and optogenetic control bidirectionally shifted the anemo-discrimination learning pace, with contrasting phenotypes observed for odor learning, engagement of inhibitory circuits, and setting the optimal inhibition level for stimulus refinement. Enhanced learning caused by multimodal odor-airflow stimuli at subthreshold levels confirmed the heightened olfactory perception by mechanical stimuli. Our results thus explain the multimodality of olfaction and reveal the unexplored dimensionality of odor perception.},
