The lack of translational symmetry combined with intrinsic long-range order endows aperiodic crystals with unique physical characteristics, while, at the same time, markedly enriching the spectrum and localization properties. Here, we demonstrate exciton-polariton condensation in a two-dimensional Penrose tiling with C 10 rotational symmetry—the evidence of quasicrystalline order in a quantum fluid of light. We identify a regime, wherein near-perfect delocalization and synchronization of a quantum fluid of light occurs at mesoscopic length scales extending beyond 100× the healing length and the size of each individual condensate. Realizing long-range order in fully reconfigurable quasicrystals of nonlinear and open-dissipative quantum fluids in the presence of artificial defects provides insights into phase synchronization between the condensates in unconventional, aperiodic settings.},

  abstract     = {Walking on liquid surface is a unique locomotion ability of insects, but engineering on-liquid walkable devices currently requires disjointed, multistage fabrication and delicate deployment. Here, we introduce HydroSpread—a direct processing technology that enables seamless fabrication and patterning of soft films on liquid surface. It leverages the controlled spreading of liquid ink on liquid surface and combines with precise laser engraving supported by rapid heat transfer at the solid-liquid interface. Geometric shapes, including basic forms of straight lines, sharp turns and circles, and complex patterns, were fabricated with exceptional fidelity to design specifications. We propose two heat-driven hydrodynamic locomotion mechanisms, fin-like bending and leg-like buckling. By harnessing these principles, we engineered two walkable devices—HydroFlexor and HydroBuckler—and demonstrated robust on-water locomotion. This work eliminates fragile postfabrication transfers in soft device manufacturing, bridging the gap between soft films and structure fabrication, and establishes a streamlined pathway for designing and deploying functional soft devices directly in liquid environments.},

  abstract     = {Landslides exhibit intermittent downslope movements over days to years before a possible collapse, commonly boosted by external events like precipitation. The origins of these episodic movements and their relation to final instability remain unclear. We propose a novel “endo-exo” theory capturing the interplay between exogenous stressors such as rainfall and endogenous damage-healing processes. We predict four types of episodic dynamics, defined by the disturbance source (endogenous or exogenous) and criticality level (subcritical or critical), each with distinct power law exponent but all governed by a single parameter ϑ . These predictions are tested on the Preonzo landslide, whose sporadic activities align with the classification with ϑ ≈ 0.45 ± 0.1 . We find that its final collapse is preceded by an increased frequency of medium-to-large velocities over 1 to 2 months, signaling the transition into a catastrophic regime. Our research suggests that landslides may not permanently operate at a critical state, with major implications for forecasting catastrophic failures.},

Yet, the spatial and temporal dynamics of slab tearing remain enigmatic due to a lack of modern examples. Here, we integrate new seismic images with regional seismicity to investigate an actively fragmenting subduction system at northern Cascadia’s ridge-trench-fault triple junction where subduction termination is imminent. Our analyses reveal a broad shear-zone initiated at ~4 Ma by exploiting ridge-parallel fabrics of nascent oceanic lithosphere and progressively localized into a mature trench-perpendicular transform boundary. This process severed an oceanic microplate and enabled its diminished subduction relative to adjacent subducting lithosphere. Downdip, we image trench-parallel slab tears offset by the transform, suggesting lateral tear propagation was intersected by the transform boundary, facilitating efficient decoupling of the microplate while allowing adjacent subduction to continue. We propose a 4D model where transform boundaries drive laterally diachronous slab fragmentation and subduction termination.},

We present a molecular dynamics model that incorporates essential physical and biological features, including protein diffusion, genome flexibility, and a conformational switch that mimics allostery and activates the elastic properties of proteins upon binding. This switch makes the simulations computationally feasible, overcoming long-standing limitations of previous models. Using this framework, we successfully reproduce the self-assembly of subunits into icosahedral shells with T numbers greater than one—most notably T = 3, the most common structure in nature—a feat rigid-body models have so far failed to achieve. We also examine how genome architecture influences assembly and observe trends consistent with experiments using cowpea chlorotic mottle virus proteins: RNAs with more complex structure yield more complete capsids than do linear ones. These results establish a predictive framework for genome-guided assembly and offer insight into designing synthetic capsids for biomedical applications.},

However, the harsh gastrointestinal environment, the low permeability of the intestinal epithelium, and hepatic clearance of foreign particles remain key challenges in this area. Here, we report the site-specific adaptive milk-derived nanovesicles (MiNVs) capable of overcoming intestinal and hepatic barriers for oral insulin delivery. These MiNVs could bind natural IgG on their surface, enabling FcRn-mediated transcytosis by evading the lysosomal degradation pathway. Upon reaching the liver, MiNVs responded to the elevated levels of biothiols in the hepatic microenvironment, triggering site-specific insulin release. In type 1 diabetic rats, the oral bioavailability reached 20.4%, which is about 20-fold higher than that of free insulin. Notably, MiNVs showed effective glycemic control over long-term treatment in type 1 diabetic rat and minipig models. By integrating transepithelial transport and liver-specific responsiveness, the site-specific adaptability of MiNVs supports their promise in oral insulin administration.},

Is metabolic dysfunction a cause of depression, a downstream consequence, or do both stem from shared underlying processes? We argue that neurocognitive mechanisms, particularly those involved in reward and effort processing, interact with metabolic physiology to shape each of these causal pathways. Metabolic signals do not act on the brain in isolation; they are embedded within a broader interoceptive system through which the brain detects and interprets bodily states. This system supports allostasis, the brain’s predictive regulation of internal physiological demands. We propose a framework of interoceptive energy allostasis in which disruptions to these predictive processes contribute to the bidirectional relationship between depression and metabolic dysfunction. By integrating perspectives from metabolic and computational psychiatry, this framework offers a theoretical lens to explain the multidirectional comorbidity between mental and metabolic ill-health.},

These systems often require additional actuation mechanisms, such as magnetic control, for assistance. To address this challenge, we developed an acoustically powered micro-clampbot capable of clamping objects using claws actuated by acoustically induced secondary Bjerknes forces and moving via flagella that oscillate under acoustic input. The robot’s actions are governed by distinct acoustic frequencies, enabling precise and independent control of clamping and locomotion. The micro-clampbot can pick a single particle from a cluster and navigate delicately through narrow channels, with narrow necks (~2.1 times the width of the micro-clampbot). This system facilitates the targeted transportation of microscale objects, including live cells, without causing damage.

We present results from 10 independent studies with a total of 648 participants and provide clear evidence of both retroactive and proactive enhancements in weak memories, directly addressing ongoing debates about the existence of these effects. Notably, stronger salience learning facilitates proactive, but not retroactive, memory enhancement, challenging prevailing theories about salience’s role in these processes. Instead, retroactive enhancement depends on the proximity between incidentally encoded and conditioned stimuli in a high-level feature embedding extracted from a convolutional neural network, revealing a graded prioritization mechanism.

Yet, their role extends beyond that of a simple surfactant; otherwise, exogenous surfactant therapy would fully restore compliance in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by increasing surface concentration alone. Here, we show that interfacial microstructure and mechanics, regulated by spontaneous or ventilator-induced sighs, play a critical role. Using interfacial rheometry and structural analysis, including in situ neutron reflectometry and Raman-based techniques, we find that sighs enrich the air-liquid interface with saturated lipids, triggering structural rearrangements. This periodic “reset” transforms the layer into a mechanically robust, DPPC-rich film, where compressional hardening counteracts tension. These findings highlight the nonequilibrium dynamics of surfactant layers and underscore the importance of interfacial compressive stresses, not just tension, in governing lung mechanics. This mechanism helps sustain low interfacial stress and high compliance, offering mechanistic insight to guide protective ventilation strategies upon lung trauma and possibilities to optimize surfactant-enabled pulmonary treatment.},

We demonstrate a microneedle device that is several times faster than state of the art, collecting an average of 15.5 mg of ISF in 5 minutes in humans with near-zero failure rate. This improvement was achieved by designing the spatial pressure gradient driving ISF flow. The influence of penetration depth, collection time, pressure, and age on ISF collection was elucidated, with Darcy’s law explaining multiple observations. A data-driven acceptance criterion of <1% blood contamination for ISF is proposed.

  abstract     = {Canonical N -methyl- d -aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels with critical roles in the development and function of the nervous system. The excitatory currents they produce reflect stochastic transitions between multiple agonist-bound closed- and open-pore states. We leveraged the intrinsically high open probability ( P o ) of NMDARs composed of GluN1 and GluN2A subunits, together with judiciously chosen mutants and ligands, to achieve conditions in which receptors had a P o near unity. Using single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we captured three activated receptor states, each with distinct conformations of the gate-forming M3 helices. Separately, we carried out single-channel electrophysiology, together with statistical modeling, to relate the cryo-EM structures to the gating reaction. NMDAR channel opening involves bending of the pore-forming M3 helices to produce a transient open-channel conformation, subsequently stabilized by new interactions between the D2-M3 linkers with the pre-M1 helices and the pre-M4 loops, to yield the stable open channel.},

  abstract     = {Structural plasticity of dendritic spines is a fundamental mechanism of learning and memory. It depends on the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). However, to bind TrkB, BDNF requires proteolytic cleavage to its mature form. Here, we demonstrate that MMP-9, an extracellular protease essential for neuronal function, plays a key role in this process. We show that, like BDNF, MMP-9 is rapidly released in response to synaptic stimulation, and its proteolytic activity, restricted to the activated spine, can be detected as early as 2 min after stimulation. Using two-photon microscopy and single-spine stimulation by glutamate uncaging, we demonstrate that MMP-9 action is important for TrkB activation and is required for structural plasticity. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a direct cleavage of proBDNF into mature BDNF by MMP-9. Our findings reveal a critical interaction between MMP-9 and BDNF through their autocrine regulation of TrkB activation and dendritic spine structural changes.},

Quantum mechanics provides an avenue to enhance precision, but it comes with a restriction: Incompatible observables, such as position and momentum, cannot be simultaneously measured to arbitrary accuracy as decreed by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. This restriction can be bypassed by instead measuring commuting modular observables, which are counterparts to the naturally incompatible observables. Here, we measure modular observables to estimate small changes in position and momentum with a single-mode multiparameter sensor. We deterministically prepare grid states in the mechanical motion of a trapped ion and demonstrate uncertainties in position and momentum below the standard quantum limit (SQL). Further, we examine another pair of incompatible observables—number and phase. We prepare a different resource—number-phase states—and demonstrate a metrological gain over the SQL. These results introduce previously unidentified measurement capabilities unavailable to classical systems and mark a substantial step in quantum metrology.},

Nevertheless, lunar influence on human reproductive behavior remains controversial. Here, we analyzed long-term menstrual records of individual women from the past 24 years and compared them with records from the past century. We show that women’s menstrual cycles recorded before the introduction of light-emitting diodes in 2010 and the extensive use of smart phones significantly synchronized with the Moon, while those after 2010 coupled to the Moon mostly in January. We hypothesize that the high gravimetric forces between the Moon, Sun, and Earth every January are sufficient for this coupling, while the increasing exposure to artificial light at night impinges on synchrony at other times.},

In favorable conditions, insulin and noninsulin peptides released from midgut epithelia activate foregut and hindgut enteric neurons, respectively, to sustain normal feeding and defecation behavior. During food scarcity, altered insulin signaling from sensory neurons activates the transcription factor DAF-16/FoxO in midgut epithelia, which blocks both peptidergic signaling axes to the ENS by transcriptionally shutting down the intestinal neuropeptide secretion machinery. Our findings demonstrate that midgut epithelial cells act as integrators relaying internal state information to distinct parts of the ENS to control animal behavior.},

We observed a substantial increase in self-reported sleep problems among individuals aged 15 to 45, from 34 to 49% between 2010 and 2021, and a 10-fold increase in melatonin use. We also found relevant clusters of sleep-related prescriptions, diagnoses, and procedures with age-specific incidence patterns.

The artificial olfactory neuron module is developed by connecting a GeSe-based ovonic threshold switch and a micro–light-emitting diode (μLED) platform–based semiconductor metal oxide gas sensor in series. The use of μLED gas sensors enables ultralow-power operation, resulting in substantially decreased power consumption. The artificial olfactory neuron module generates spike signals with low operation voltage, demonstrating energy efficiency and advanced performance.

This result indicates diminishing returns where each additional part contributes less to overall toolkit diversity. This scaling holds across diverse ecological and cultural contexts, suggesting a general principle of optimization in tool design. Ethnographic toolkits achieve their adaptability by reusing a core set of versatile parts and selectively incorporating more specialized parts. However, increasing richness also increases complexity, and complexity is costly. We formalize these dynamics within a combinatorial optimization framework and discuss the implications.},

The molecular characteristics of infiltrating GBM cells and their interactions with brain cells remain poorly understood, partly due to limited spatial tools for distinguishing tumor cells from those in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we introduce Spatially-resolved Chimeric AnalyzeR (SCAR), a computational tool for dissecting tumor-TME gene expression in spatial transcriptomics of human-mouse chimeric cancer models. SCAR reveals spatially distinct characteristics of GBM and their interactions with TME, identifying that infiltrative GBM up-regulates creatine kinase brain type (CKB) at the astrocyte-enriched leading edge compared to the tumor core. Mechanistically, GBM-secreted CKB catalyzes the extracellular conversion of astrocyte-supplied adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine into phosphocreatine, providing metabolic support for infiltrative tumor growth, which can be blocked by cyclocreatine. These results provide proof-of-concept validation of SCAR and demonstrate spatial context–dependent metabolic rewiring of GBM cells, with implications for therapies targeting infiltrative GBM.},

To circumvent long-standing challenges of extensive transthioesterification side reactions in the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of thioglycolide, which typically yielded only oligomers, we developed the interfacial chain-growth ROP occurring at the interface between the semicrystalline polymer surface and the monomer–organocatalyst solution phase, enabling the synthesis of high–molecular-weight PTGA.

Here, we report that barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) infection activates metacaspase 4 (MC4) to cleave the RNA binding protein lupus autoantigen 1 (La1) behind residue arginine-448. The cleaved La1 1-448 version relocates to the cytoplasm and promotes the R-motif–mediated cap-independent defense mRNA translation. Moreover, MC4 overexpression restricts BSMV infection in tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ), whereas knockout of MC4 and knockdown of La1 are more susceptible to diverse plant virus infection. To counteract plant defense, the BSMV γb protein directly interacts with and inhibits the self-processing of MC4 and subsequent La1 cleavage, thereby impairing La1-mediated immune responses. Collectively, our findings unveil a hitherto unknown defense mechanism whereby the MC4-La1 cleavage module inhibits virus infection by coordinating R-motif–mediated defense mRNA translation.},

We also captured distinct oligomeric intermediates, arc-shaped assemblies with monomers in transitional conformations, representing key snapshots along the pore formation pathway. These data provide direct structural evidence for a stepwise mechanism in which monomers sequentially bind the membrane and undergo conformational changes that drive pore assembly and membrane disruption.

  abstract     = {Dry eye disease (DED) is characterized by chronic inflammation and an unstable tear film. Stem cells have shown potential for DED treatment, but the main challenge lies in improving cell delivery effectiveness. Here, we developed eye drops for autoimmune DED treatment using porous arginine–glycine–aspartic acid (RGD)–modified alginate microcarriers with mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) (RGD-Alg@MSCs). These microcarriers provided a favorable microenvironment for large-scale cell expansion while maintaining stemness with ideal mechanical properties for ocular application. In vitro, RGD-Alg@MSCs demonstrated significantly enhanced therapeutic effects compared to conventional MSCs, including improved cell viability, reduced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species, and enhanced release of immunomodulatory factors. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct molecular mechanisms underlying these enhanced therapeutic effects. In the mouse model, RGD-Alg@MSCs exhibited prolonged ocular retention and enhanced tear production, promoted corneal healing, and suppressed inflammation by inhibiting dendritic cell activation and T H 17 differentiation. Our microcarrier system substantially improves stem cell delivery efficiency for treating autoimmune DED.},

  abstract     = {Lipid droplets (LDs) are organelles with a neutral lipid core surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer, which is continuous with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). LD function depends on a highly dynamic LD surface proteome. Key proteins continuously exchange between the ER and LDs; however, the mechanisms governing the interorganelle movement and accumulation on the LD surface remain poorly understood. Here, we developed an ex cellulo tool introducing a classification of ER-derived proteins based on their different affinity for LDs. We find that proteins with higher LD affinity can effectively displace those with lower affinity from the LD surface, identifying steric hindrance as a key mechanism in regulating ER-to-LD protein transfer. Consistent with this model, we show that, during adipocyte differentiation Plin1—an adipocyte-specific high-affinity LD protein—reduces the recruitment of ER proteins with lower affinity by displacing them from the LD surface. These findings highlight lateral protein-protein exclusion as a fundamental mechanism in shaping the LD proteome.},

  abstract     = {DNA digital storage features high storage density, low power consumption, and extended digital recovery time. However, conventional DNA preservation methods suffer from limitations like low DNA loading and complex recovery processes. In this study, we develop a liquid crystal–guided DNA information preservation platform (LDIPP) assembled from diverse lengths of DNA molecules ranging from 688 base pairs to 4.8 mega–base pairs and cationic surfactants. The thermotropic LDIPP provides encoded DNA information with high density loading, thermoplasticity, antimicrobial, and anti-enzymatic properties. Notably, DNA information was nondestructively recovered by manipulating the assembly structure using specific salt solutions and bioamplified through microbial fermentation. By mineralizing inorganic crystals on LDIPP, the preservation lifetime is expected to be increased by nearly an order of magnitude at −20°C. The LDIPP platform offers enhanced DNA data loading, nondestructive recovery, and customizable macroscopic features, making it a promising option for long-term information preservation in the rapidly advancing field of DNA storage.},

  abstract     = {Aging drives cognitive decline in the adult brain with unclear mechanisms. Previously, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), the source cells of myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system, have been linked to brain aging by their compromised differentiation and regeneration capability. Whether a myelination-independent function of OPCs is involved in brain aging remains unknown. In this study, we herein report a myelination-independent role of OPCs in exaggerating cognitive decline in the aging brain via suppressing neuronal plasticity. Our results demonstrate that macroautophagic flux declines in aged OPCs. Inactivation of autophagy promotes the senescence of OPCs, which activates C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3)/CCL5–C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 signaling. Through this, autophagy-defective OPCs impair glutamatergic transmission, neuronal excitability, and long-term potentiation, exaggerating the cognitive decline in the aging brain. Our study demonstrates a myelination-independent role of OPCs in brain aging and identifies that a declined autophagy in OPCs is a pivotal factor in driving aging-associated cognitive decline.},
