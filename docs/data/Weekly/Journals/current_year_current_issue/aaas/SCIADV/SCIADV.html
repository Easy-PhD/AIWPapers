Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising adsorbents, yet atomic-level insights into Xe and Kr adsorption remain limited. Here, we report the first application of high-field solid-state 83 Kr nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), alongside extensive 129 Xe NMR, to investigate gas adsorption in eight MOFs representing three design strategies: ultramicroporous one-dimensional–channel MOFs with pore sizes matching noble gas diameters, functionalized MOFs, and MOFs with open metal sites. Single-gas and coadsorption studies reveal distinct adsorption sites, guest-host interactions, and gas dynamics in each MOF. Most MOFs retain crystallinity after exposure to 60-kilogray γ radiation. Several radiation-sensitive MOFs exhibit enhanced stability in the presence of Xe, suggesting that Xe adsorption enhances framework stability and may broaden the range of MOFs usable under γ radiation in nuclear off-gas separation. These findings offer valuable molecular-level design insights.},

However, once prototyped, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)–based silicone elastomer is limited in mechanical strength and programmable spatial construction due to the flexible polymer matrix and mismatched interface with other materials. We propose a mechanically strengthened PDMS-based origami structure (MSOS) via polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)/acetone solution swelling. The planar elastomer precursor can be swollen-folded into programmable spatial construction based on mechanically strengthened creases during solvent diffusion and de-gelatinization. This strengthened crease is induced by a hierarchical shrink-fitting based on solute molecular chain insertion and a seamless coupling interface between elastomer microstructures and solidified PMMA. We present a programmable MSOS to support a load more than 58,100 times of its own weight and a pillbug-inspired ringbot to resist heavy impact. Our work provides a strategy toward customized mechanically strengthened soft material for developing functional structural architectures and soft origami robots.},

Under acidic conditions, a previously unidentified class of β-carbolines (βCs), termed secofumitremorgins (SFs), with potent antiangiogenic activity in zebrafish models was found and identified via nuclear magnetic resonance, Marfey’s analysis, and quantum calculations. Using gene knockout, heterologous expression, precursor feeding, isotope tracing, molecular docking, and site-directed mutagenesis, a unique biosynthetic pathway for SFs was characterized, beyond the Pictet-Spenglerase–mediated biosynthetic process. Furthermore, an unreported pH-regulated mechanism was unveiled, where P450 (FtmG) facilitated new fumitremorgin intermediate formation, enabling spontaneous, nonenzymatic generation of βCs and spirotryprostatins under distinct pH conditions. Notably, this work provides detailed experimental evidence and reaction mechanisms for synergistic enzymatic and nonenzymatic catalysis driving metabolite diversification under pH stress. The findings expand biosynthetic paradigms for indole alkaloids and highlight the therapeutic potential of pH-elicited βCs, advancing strategies for natural product discovery.},

  abstract     = {Chiral electromagnetic materials, with their unique spatial configurations, can regulate the propagation and polarization of electromagnetic waves, serving as powerful tools for tailoring electromagnetic behavior. However, their functional potential is often limited by the intrinsic constraints of conventional host materials, which typically lack sufficient flexibility in defect engineering, magnetic modulation, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) enhancement. To address this challenge, we introduce high-entropy metal oxides (HEMOs) into carbon-based chiral frameworks, constructing HEMO and carbon nanocoil (HEMO@CNC) composites. By combining advanced microscopy, electromagnetic measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is revealed that increasing entropy and helical strain jointly induce nonlinear changes in SOC strength and defect-related localized states. Benefiting from these effects, the HEMO@CNC system achieves an ultrawide bandwidth, outperforming linear structures and low-entropy systems. This work provides a potential paradigm for integrating topological defect engineering and high-entropy quantum modulation, offering deeper insights into advancing electromagnetic functional materials from macroscopic design toward geometry-defect-spin synergistic regulation.},

We demonstrate a strategy to introduce and tune Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) to unprecedented magnitudes in inversion-symmetric solids by incorporating ultrasmall silver nanoparticles in bulk gold. The near-identical lattice constants of Ag and Au allow dense packing of the Ag/Au hetero-interfaces without compromising the global BIS. By varying the density of embedded nanoparticles, we generate Rashba SOI in a bulk metal with coupling strength ~15 meV∙Å, higher than any known system preserving BIS globally, and show up to ~20 times increase in the spin-orbit scattering rate. We argue that the combined effect of charge transfer at the interfaces and polaronic localization enhances the SOI.},

In contrast, a third pathway, which leverages the two-electron nucleophilic potential of alkyl–Co III , has remained unexplored because of the inherently low polarization of the C–Co bond. Here, we report an axial-coordination activation strategy to unlock this reactivity space in Co-MHAT catalysis. Through stoichiometric organometallic studies using well-defined alkyl–Co III complexes, we demonstrate that an alkoxide ligand can render alkyl–Co III sufficiently nucleophilic to displace a suitable leaving group, via a stereospecific backside-backside approach. This pathway is further applied in catalysis, enabling a diastereoselective redox neutral Co-MHAT cyclopropanation reaction.},

Here, we present a hydrogel platform that enables spatiotemporal modulation of toughness through a latent ionic cross-linking mechanism. By embedding calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) microparticles in alginate/polyacrylamide double-network hydrogels, we create a system where localized calcium release and thus ionic cross-linking can be programmed in both space and time. Spatial control is achieved by direct ink writing of CaCO 3 , while temporal activation is triggered by glucono-δ-lactone, a biocompatible acidifier that releases calcium on demand. This strategy allows user-defined tuning of stiffness and toughness, enabling fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) hydrogels with tailored mechanical profiles. The resulting materials offer a versatile platform for anisotropic impact shielding, directional strain sensing, and 3D-printed tissue adhesives, representing a paradigm shift for adaptive, reconfigurable, and multifunctional soft materials.},

The SRMM exhibits a large stiffness conversion capability (40-fold) and high-density information encoding performance (10-bit). Coupling with the mechanoluminescent materials, the mechanical information achieves visualization conveniently, which is attributed to the conversion of the stiffness data into optical signals through optical energy level transitions.

  abstract     = {Many antibiotics target essential cellular processes. To combat multidrug-resistant bacteria, new antibacterial strategies are needed. In the peptidoglycan biogenesis pathway in Escherichia coli , MurJ, the lipid II flippase, is an essential membrane protein. The 37-residue protein M from the Levivirus phage, known as Lys M or Sgl M , targets MurJ and induces cell lysis; however, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the MurJ/Lys M (JM) complex at 3.09-angstrom resolution, revealing that Lys M interacts with the crevasse between TM2 and TM7 of MurJ, locking MurJ in an outward-facing conformation, with Lys M acting like a wedge. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis and pull-down assays revealed key residues responsible for Lys M function, and molecular dynamics simulations showed that Lys M stabilizes MurJ’s outward-facing state. These findings demonstrate an unprecedented phage-derived mechanism for blocking lipid II transport, providing a structural framework for designing MurJ-targeted antimicrobial agents.},

  abstract     = {Accommodation, the space available for potential sediment deposition, is a central concept for stratigraphic heterogeneity prediction and deciphering Earth history. We define accommodation quantitatively as mean thickness of potential deposition per unit of time, calculated per unit area based on a maximum deposition rate and slope-controlled probabilities of erosion and deposition. Testing this definition in a simple numerical stratigraphic forward model reproduces key stratal geometries and behaviors, suggesting basic predictive power. However, the model output is missing much stratigraphic detail, and it is difficult to see how this can be added through extension of the accommodation definition. This suggests that accommodation has less predictive power than typically assumed; many important elements of stratal prediction must come instead from independent calculation of sediment erosion, routing, and depositional processes.},

Here, we present a hybrid platform that enables comprehensive dc and ac analog signal processing within a 2D-ACT device. By synergistically integrating 2D-FET and SAW components, our system achieves real-time subwavelength carrier monitoring and ac signal manipulation. ac measurements further elucidate mechanisms of dc acoustoelectric current generation. Notably, by controlling the phase and intensity of counter-propagating SAWs, we demonstrate analog signal addition and subtraction capabilities not previously realized in 2D-ACT devices. This platform establishes a benchmark for compact, low-loss ACT devices in ac signal processing, representing a notable advance for acoustoelectric technologies and 2D material systems.},

However, their commercial viability is limited by the poor cycle stability and complex degradation mechanism. This study underscores the pivotal role of electro-chemo-mechanical interactions in driving the failure of SSBs. Leveraging advanced x-ray imaging and spectroscopy techniques, we analyzed LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 (NMC811) cathodes from cycled Li x In||Li 6 PS 5 Cl (LPSC)||NMC811 SSBs, uncovering the interplay between microstructure, chemical heterogeneity, mechanical characteristics, and electrochemical performance. Our results show that revealing electro-chemo-mechanical interactions is essential to develop strategies to suppress the degradation of SSBs. Particularly, we revisit a LiNbO 3 (LNO) coating layer to mitigate electrochemical degradation. The LNO@NMC811 cathode retains 116 milliampere-hours per gram after 200 cycles, showing excellent stability, while the uncoated NMC811 cathode keeps degrading over time, with suppressed chemical heterogeneity and mechanical failure. This work highlights the importance of synergizing advanced material design with coating techniques, ensuring uniform lithium flux and improving mechanical properties to achieve stable, high-performance SSBs.},

We report a plasmon-induced route to plasmonic-polymer hybrid nanomaterials using in operando single-particle spectroelectrochemistry. An energy transfer efficiency of 40% is achievable when the spectral overlap between gold nanorod scattering and polymer absorption is maximized. We also show that PIRET-initiated polymerization proceeds through a different mechanism than bulk polymerization, supported by spectroscopic evidence and density functional theory calculations, highlighting efficient energy cascading from photon to plasmon to exciton and, lastly, to unconventional light-initiated chemistry.},

We develop a three-component (ThrCo) LNP by replacing cholesterol and PEGylated lipids in Pfizer-BioNTech LNPs with zwitterionic pyridine carboxybetaine (PyCB) ionizable lipids (ILs), achieving ~70% lower liver accumulation and a 4.5-fold increase in spleen-specific mRNA translation. PyCB ILs enhance LNP hydrophilicity, stabilizing the outer membrane to compensate for cholesterol removal. PyCB groups also exhibit strong protonation at endosomal pH, facilitating mRNA translation. The zwitterionic surface of ThrCo LNP reduces protein adsorption, thereby preventing the accelerated blood clearance effect caused by PEGylated lipids following repeated administrations. Thus, ThrCo LNP–based vaccines efficiently deliver mRNA to splenic antigen-presenting cells, boosting immune responses and improving therapeutic outcomes.},

Through coculturing for 30 to 120 days, we observed the presence of tubular blood vessels at the center of vROs. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the vascularization in ROs was associated with angiogenesis and immune response. Furthermore, we observed that MGs in VOs migrated and integrated into the vROs as VOs and ROs fused, with the vROs exhibiting responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. The vROs expressed tight junction protein claudin-5 and displayed similar characteristics to the inner blood-retinal barrier (iBRB). These vRO models, which incorporate vascular structures and MGs, provide an alternate avenue for retinal vascular disease research and hold promise for future clinical applications.},

Comparing to the lamellar structures formed at noncatalyzed electrodes, Li 2 S deposited at Pt catalytic electrode exhibited a spherical morphology. The zero-order reaction kinetics was captured on catalytic surfaces, differing from noncatalyzed electrodes. The electrodeposition of Li 2 S follows the overpotential-driven progressive and instantaneous nucleation processes, showing a promoted deposition and reversible dissolution at the overpotential of 80 mV. The Li 2 S transformation under high polysulfides concentrations indicated that an increase of catalytic sites and uniform distribution of Li 2 S would be critical for practical Li-S batteries.

We demonstrate the existence of a quantum limit cycle in phase space in the absence of a drive and the occurrence of quantum synchronization when the nonlinear oscillator is externally driven. We additionally show that synchronization can be enhanced with the help of squeezing perpendicular to the direction of the drive and, counterintuitively, linear dissipation. We also observe the bifurcation to a bistable phase-space distribution for large squeezing.

Valosin-containing protein (VCP), an enzyme implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, is essential for SG disassembly, but whether and how this process is coordinated with SG assembly remains unclear. Here, we identify the VCP cofactor, Alveolar soft part sarcoma locus (ASPL) as a key regulator linking SG assembly and disassembly. ASPL promotes SG assembly by facilitating biomolecular condensation of Ras guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein-binding protein (G3BP) and stabilizing its interactions with other SG proteins. ASPL also facilitates phosphorylation and activation of VCP by UNC-51-like kinases 1 and 2 (ULK1/2), enabling G3BP extraction and efficient SG disassembly. Pathogenic VCP mutations that disrupt ASPL binding impair SG disassembly, a defect rescued by phosphomimetic mutations or ASPL depletion. Our findings suggest that disruptions in the ASPL-VCP interaction uncouple SG assembly and disassembly, representing a potential mechanism underlying VCP-associated neurodegenerative diseases.},

Here, we integrated biochemistry, multiscale cryo–electron microscopy, and AlphaFold modeling to investigate the architecture of the centriole. Using an improved centriole isolation method, we determined the structure of the A-C linker bound to microtubule triplets, which revealed how the A-C linker cross-links microtubules and integrates with the B-C junction. We found marked changes in the structure and composition of the A-C linker that correlate with the presence of other centriolar modules, including the pinhead, cartwheel, and inner scaffold.

  abstract     = {Phosphorus (P) limitation severely affects crop yields. To address the molecular basis of inorganic phosphate (Pi) specific transport within the sulfate transporter (SULTR) family, we determined the cryo–electron microscopy structures of Oryza sativa SULTR-like phosphorus distribution transporter (OsSPDT), a key Pi transporter for grain allocation, in apo- and Pi-binding states. OsSPDT forms a domain-swapped homodimer with each protomer containing an N-terminal domain (NTD), a transmembrane domain (TMD) divided into core and gate subdomains, and a C-terminal sulfate transporter and antisigma factor (STAS) domain. The structure adopts a cytoplasm-facing conformation with Pi coordinated at the core-gate interface. Key residues, including SPDT-unique Ser 170 , mediate Pi specificity within the binding pocket, distinguishing it evolutionarily from sulfate transporters within the SULTR family. Domain-swapping and mutational studies demonstrate functional interdependence of the NTD, TMD, and STAS domains. This work elucidates Pi selectivity in plant SULTR transporters and provides a molecular basis for developing low-phytate rice via OsSPDT gene editing.},

Ubiquitin-specific protease 21 (USP21), one of four major H2AK119-specific deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes. However, the mechanisms by which USP21 specifically deubiquitinates H2AK119ub and is regulated are unknown. We determined the cryo-EM structure of the USP21 catalytic domain bound to an H2AK119ub nucleosome, which revealed a recognition mode that differs from that of other H2AK119-specific DUBs. We unexpectedly found that the N-terminal IDR of USP21 inhibits the enzyme’s activity. Using AlphaFold-Multimer to perform a virtual screen of USP21 interactors, we identified kinases that phosphorylate the USP21 IDR and thereby relieve autoinhibition. AlphaFold3 modeling of USP21 suggests a structural model for autoinhibition. AlphaFold analysis suggests that phosphorylation-regulated autoinhibition may be a feature of various USP enzymes. These findings shed light on the mechanisms of H2AK119 deubiquitination and reveal a previously unexplored mode of phosphorylation-dependent DUB autoregulation.},

Nevertheless, little is known about the precise neural mechanisms governing the regulation of contagious pain in response to diverse environmental stressors. Here, we report that early life maternal separation (MS) precipitates impairments in the pain contagion between familiar partners. Specifically, we identify the indispensable role of glutamatergic projections from the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) to the prelimbic cortex (PrL) for the development of vicarious pain hypersensitivity. MS dampens activation of the PVT → PrL pathway during social interactions between observer and painful demonstrator. Augmenting the excitability or activity of the PVT → PrL circuit through chemogenetic interventions or tactile stimulation resembling social touch significantly ameliorates the MS-evoked contagious pain deficits. Collectively, our findings delineate a neural circuitry substrate underlying the loss of contagious pain stemming from MS and propose a potential therapeutic avenue for mitigating empathic impairments associated with early life adversity.},

The causative NLRs [resistance to Melanaphis sorghi 1A (RMES1A) and RMES1B] lack signaling domains and have adenosine triphosphatase mutations expected to abrogate function, suggesting that RMES1 NLRs regulate immunity via a noncanonical mechanism. The RMES1 NLR family is ancient, orthologous to phloem-feeding resistance genes in rice and syntenic across the grass superpangenome. Thus, gene birth-and-death processes at an ancient gene cluster created rare standing variation and provided the adaptive allele for evolutionary rescue.},

Gene duplication resulting from polyploidization offers insights into plant adaptation to environmental stress. Here, we reveal that extensive duplication of GhRALF30L , which encodes an intrinsically disordered small peptide, contributes to thermotolerance in cotton male reproductive organs. Polyploidization has driven the formation of 23 GhRALF30L genes in allotetraploid cotton, whereas only four or five homologs are identified in its two diploid ancestors. Expression and functional analyses confirm that GhRALF30L regulates thermotolerance in a dosage-dependent manner, with reduced dosage decreasing heat resistance. Under heat stress, GhRALF30L interacts with GhFERA1/GhCAPA1 and enhances their condensation at the plasma membrane, which activates heat stress responses by up-regulating the expression of heat shock factors ( HSFs ), heat shock proteins ( HSPs ), and reactive oxygen species scavenging genes. Our findings demonstrate that the GhRALF30L gene cluster, resulting from polyploidization, confers thermotolerance through facilitating the condensation of GhFERA1/GhCAPA1.},

We found that loss of clh-1 extends life span, improves stress resistance, reduces neuronal damage, and extends health span. These effects are linked to protective pathways, including those for oxidative stress and autophagy, and depend on the DAF-16/FoxO transcription factor. Notably, by knocking down and overexpressing the carbonic anhydrase cah-4 , we show that it is the glial alkalinization caused by loss of clh-1 that mediates these protective effects.

We developed an automated radio frequency identification (RFID) tracking system to continuously collect behavioral data from entire colonies, monitoring 102 individuals from five colonies for 30 days. Based on behavioral parameters, we statistically identified distinct behavioral phenotypes, comprising one cluster for breeders and six clusters for nonbreeders. Breeders formed strong social bonds, consistently remaining close in activity rhythm synchrony, spatial proximity, and directional following. In contrast, nonbreeders exhibited behavioral heterogeneity according to their cluster: One cluster avoided other active nonbreeders, whereas another cluster attracted frequent following.

Through the IL-27–IL-27 receptor interaction, these IL-27/CXCL10-producing B cells targeted CD40-activated B cells in vitro and, upon induction by immunization and viral infection, optimized antibody responses and antiviral immunity in vivo. Also present in breast cancer tumors and retained there through CXCL10-CXCR3 interaction–mediated self-targeting, these cells promoted B cell PD-L1 expression and immune evasion. Mechanistically, Il27 and Cxcl10 transcription was induced by synergizing Toll-like receptor (TLR) and CD40 signals and driven by coinduced transcription factor BATF3, which directly targeted these genes.

Analyzing two decades of seismicity (2005–2024) across three crustal sectors, we distinguished magma recharge from the mantle, its transfer and storage at intermediate depths, and final ascent to the surface. Moreover, we found that b value time variations can precede geochemical anomalies from magma ascent and its eruption by a few months.

This enhancement enables precise modulation of key device characteristics, including readout current, hysteresis window, and charge storage capacity, with quantitative behavior accurately modeled by the Poole-Frenkel effect.

The machine learning strategy identified microdroplet size as the key parameter controlling electric field strength, product yield, and selectivity. In our lab-based scaled-up system, microdroplets <10 micrometers improved performance by four to seven orders of magnitude over bulk-phase systems, achieving ~99% methanol selectivity. Strong interfacial electric fields stabilize intermediates and modulate carbon-oxygen bond lengths, directing pathways to high-value products.

  abstract     = {Nicotine is the predominant alkaloid in tobacco leaves and affects the human nervous system by interacting with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Chronic nicotine exposure leads to nAChR desensitization, while nicotine withdrawal leads to nAChR recovery. However, detailed molecular mechanisms underlying nicotine-induced nAChR desensitization and its recovery remain elusive. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the α7 nAChR in complex with nicotine in both an open state and multiple desensitized states. Comparative analyses reveal progressive conformational changes during recovery from nicotine-induced desensitization and show that asymmetric nicotine binding disrupts the symmetry of the channel pore at the 16′ and 17′ sites. Integrating these findings with patch-clamp recordings and computational simulations, we identify an agonist-free structure that represents an atypical desensitized state closely resembling the resting conformation of α7 nAChR. These detailed mechanistic studies enhance our understanding of nicotine’s effects on α7 nAChRs.},

  abstract     = {Metazoans suppress transposons via small RNA–mediated silencing, but ciliates physically eliminate transposons from somatic genomes. Here, we report the high-quality germline genome assembly of a marine ciliate Euplotes vannus , where ~80% are transposons and other germline-specific DNA that has to be precisely eliminated during soma development. We demonstrate that a class of soma-derived 30-nucleotide small RNAs precisely targets nontransposon DNA against elimination during this process. Small RNA–mediated targeting remains functional across varying small RNA lengths and is compatible with heterozygous sites. These small RNAs are cleaved by Dicer-like ribonuclease from long noncoding RNAs, which are bidirectionally transcribed of somatic chromosomes, initiated at subtelomeric chromosome breakage sequences (5′-TTGAA-3′). On the basis of these findings and time-course transcriptomic profiling, we propose a model elucidating the molecular mechanism of DNA elimination in Euplotes . These findings provide insights into the role of small RNAs in transmitting genetic information across generations and maintaining genome stability.},

We engineered a Caenorhabditis elegans model with a hyperactive 20 S proteasome (α3ΔN) for selective 20 S activation. α3ΔN markedly enhanced IDP and misfolded protein degradation, reduced oxidative damage, and improved endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation (ERAD). Aggregation-prone substrates such as vitellogenins and human alpha-1 antitrypsin (ATZ) were efficiently cleared. Integrated proteomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal systemic adaptations featuring increased protein turnover and oxidative stress resistance independent of superoxide dismutases (SODs). Notably, α3ΔN extended life span and stress resistance independently of canonical unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling via xbp-1 . These findings substantiate a “20 S pathway” of proteostasis that directly alleviates protein aggregation and oxidative stress, offering a promising therapeutic angle for neurodegenerative diseases.},

We here derive an exact formula for the efficiency of any cyclically driven quantum engine by using generalized laws of quantum thermodynamics that account for all possible correlations between all involved parties, including initial correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of two basic modes of engine operation: the usual thermal case, where heat is converted into work, and an athermal regime, where work is extracted from entropic resources, such as system-bath correlations. In the latter regime, the efficiency is not bounded by the usual Carnot formula. Our results provide a unified formalism to determine the efficiency of correlated microscopic quantum machines.},

K. rhaeticus produces the bacterial cellulose (BC) matrix that integrates Bacillus spores within, whereas the confined spores keep dormant and are resistant to harsh conditions in the environment. Bacillus spores can germinate and confer desired functions to the materials. Modulating the binding affinity of spores to the BC matrix with genetic engineering can improve cell loading and therefore enhance the material functionality.

Here, we uncover a critical role for the ATM-TRMT10A-BRCA1 signaling axis in regulating homologous recombination (HR) repair and PARPi sensitivity. We demonstrate that ATM phosphorylates TRMT10A at serine-28 after DNA damage, promoting BRCA1 recruitment and efficient HR repair. TRMT10A deletion disrupts HR repair, sensitizing cells to PARPis. Moreover, TRMT10A is up-regulated in mCRPC through stabilization by USP10. Targeting USP10 with spautin-1 induces TRMT10A degradation and enhances tumor sensitivity to PARPis in cell-derived xenografts and patient-derived xenograft models. These findings identify TRMT10A as a therapeutic vulnerability in mCRPC and demonstrate that combined inhibition of PARP and USP10 offers a promising synthetic lethal strategy for a broader group of patients lacking classical BRCA mutations.},

NLPs disrupt plant membranes through interactions with glycosylinositol phosphorylceramides (GIPCs), but the specificity of these interactions remains unclear. We studied binding and pore formation of NLPs in model membranes with GIPCs derived from dicotyledonous or monocotyledonous plants. Using the cytotoxic NLP 2 from fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa (MpNEP2), we show that membrane binding and damage extend beyond previously studied oomycetal NLPs. Furthermore, NLP Pya from the oomycete Pythium aphanidermatum exhibits promiscuous binding with a marked preference for branched GIPC series B lipids. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the structural plasticity of NLP Pya provides a rational basis for its interaction with a variety of GIPC headgroups. These results clarify the molecular basis of NLP cytotoxicity and emphasize their role in broad-spectrum pathogenicity.},

Here, we further dissect the molecular characteristics of this system and reveal the involvement of a phase-separated compartment in pairing. Focusing on the PC protein HIM-8, we explored its functional domains in vivo and its self-multimerizing properties in vitro. We find that the amino-terminal domain facilitates PC chromatin binding of the carboxyl-terminal domain, whereas the middle unstructured region is essential for PC association with the nuclear envelop (NE). Integrated analyses suggest that PC-NE association is mediated by a DNA-containing phase-separated compartment that is spatially distinct from, but connected to, the chromosome axis—likely through flexible linkages. We propose that homology evaluation occurs within this compartment, where direct DNA-DNA interactions could play a role.},

Here, we use deep learning and two decades’ worth of orbital images to track the global, diurnal, and seasonal migration patterns of dust devils across Mars, providing a distributed characterization of the dynamics of near-surface winds. Across Mars, derived wind stresses systematically exceed those predicted by global circulation models and frequently surpass the threshold required to initiate particle saltation and the lifting of dust. We identify instances of fast-moving dust devils, indicating strong near-surface winds, that are colocated with large-scale dust lifting events and storms. Our observations show that strong near-surface winds are abundant on Mars and play an important role in atmospheric dust sourcing, directly informing more accurate models of Mars’ atmosphere, weather, and climate.},

During normal replication, p21 promotes nascent DNA synthesis alongside the DNA polymerase iota (Pol ι)/p53 complex. When p21 is down-regulated but detectable, nascent DNA tracks are longer and discontinuous and rely on primase and DNA polymerase (PrimPol). With the complete elimination of p21, nascent DNA tracks become shorter and continuous and depend on Pol kappa (κ). Endogenous p21 levels are critical for genomic stability, as both PrimPol- and Pol κ–mediated syntheses can induce chromosomal instability. The residual expression of p21 in p53-null cells influences the involvement of PrimPol or Pol κ in nascent DNA synthesis and subsequent chromosomal instability. Our results demonstrate that endogenous levels of p21 in cycling cells, insufficient for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition, prevent genomic instability through proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding (PCNA), limiting PrimPol and Pol κ’s role in nascent DNA synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Network methods capture the interplay between structure and dynamics of complex systems across scales by modeling indirect interactions as random walks. However, path data from real-world systems frequently exhibit memory effects that this first-order Markov model fails to capture. Although higher-order Markov models can capture these effects, they grow rapidly in size and require large amounts of data, making them prone to overfitting some parts and underfitting others in systems with uneven coverage. To address this challenge, we construct concise networks from path data by interpolating between first-order and second-order Markov models. We prioritize simplicity and interpretability by creating state nodes that capture prominent second-order effects and by proposing a transparent measure that balances model size and quality. Our concise networks reveal large-scale memory patterns in both synthetic and real-world systems while remaining far simpler than full second-order models.},

Herein, we present a photoactivatable immunostimulator based on nanoengineered microalgae (PCC@AuNP) to simultaneously enhance tumor immunogenicity and remodel the TME. Mechanistically, photocatalytically generated hydrogen induces robust immunogenic cell death by triggering severe endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Concurrently, photosynthetic oxygen production and photocatalytic lactic acid depletion collaboratively alleviate immunosuppression within the TME, thereby enhancing cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity by reducing the infiltration of immunosuppressive cells and promoting the repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages from the M2 to the M1 phenotype. In vivo studies demonstrate that PCC@AuNP not only eradicates primary tumors but also elicits potent systemic antitumor immunity against distant lesions, without observable toxicity to healthy tissues. Collectively, this innovative PCC@AuNP platform offers a safe and effective therapeutic strategy, heralding a pioneering era of cascade-augmented gas-driven cancer immunotherapy with superior precision and biosafety.},

Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 integrates innate immune signals following diet-induced obesity to promote glucose homeostasis through the induction of mitophagy. Whereas TRAF6 was dispensable for pancreatic β cell function at baseline, TRAF6 was pivotal for insulin secretion, mitochondrial respiration, and mitophagy following metabolic stress in mouse and human islets. TRAF6 was critical for the recruitment and function of the ubiquitin-mediated (Parkin-dependent) mitophagy machinery. Glucose intolerance induced by TRAF6 deficiency following metabolic stress was reversed by concomitant Parkin deficiency by relieving obstructions in receptor-mediated (Parkin-independent) mitophagy. Our results establish that TRAF6 is vital for traffic through Parkin-mediated mitophagy and implicates TRAF6 in the cross-regulation of ubiquitin- and receptor-mediated mitophagy. Together, we illustrate that β cells engage innate immune signaling to adaptively respond to a diabetogenic environment.},

Integrative analysis revealed highly cell type–specific regulatory elements and enabled the reconstruction of the gene regulatory network governing differentiation. We identified putative candidate regulons, such as ELK3, enriched in pro–B cells and potentially involved in cell cycle progression. Regulons from bulk data were projected onto single-cell data, validating their activity and refining the regulatory landscape.

Overexpression of the immunostimulatory cytokine TNFSF14/LIGHT associates with improved survival and correlates with increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients and a clinically relevant model of colorectal liver metastases. We demonstrate that LIGHT monotherapy activates T cells, but also induces T cell exhaustion and the recruitment of immunosuppressive elements. As colorectal liver metastases exhibit high levels of CTLA-4 expression, we combined LIGHT overexpression with anti-CTLA-4, leading to complete tumor control. The combination functions by homing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, inducing tumor antigen-specific T cells, and reversing T cell exhaustion. Whereas both LIGHT overexpression and anti-CTLA-4 increase tumor-promoting macrophages, the combination eliminates this population. The ability of LIGHT overexpression combined with CTLA-4 inhibition to reverse T cell exhaustion and myeloid cell suppression is supported by analysis of complementary patient cohorts and has strong clinical relevance, especially given that liver metastases contribute to immunotherapy resistance across various cancer types.},

They are typically derived from secondary formation, which is generated through atmospheric chemical reactions involving precursor compounds, such as phenolic compounds. However, information on NAC formation mechanisms remains limited. Here, we found that particulate-phase NAC concentrations were notably affected by relative humidity (RH) in field observations. Smog chamber experiments indicated that RH could influence NAC formation via changes in gaseous water concentration, rather than solely through aerosol liquid water content. Theoretical calculations further clarified that water clusters (WCs), formed from gaseous water, can notably lower reaction energy barriers along the NAC formation pathway, rendering this pathway competitive under atmospheric conditions. Hence, we propose a potential mechanism in which WCs catalyze NAC formation, offering a previously unidentified perspective on atmospheric secondary aerosol formation.},

Here, we analyzed 217 global marine food webs, quantifying structural properties and multidimensional stability to evaluate how diversity and structure jointly influence stability. Our analyses reveal that diversity is consistently linked to stability through dual pathways: positively associated with resistance and resilience via indirect structural mediation, yet negatively correlated with local stability unless interaction strength is accounted for. Critically, omitting structural mediation yields a net negative diversity-stability correlation, whereas integrating food web structure uncovers context-dependent positive relationships, underscoring structural metrics as pivotal explanatory variables. Our findings reconcile the diversity-stability debate by showing that the food web structure mediates context-dependent stability outcomes—integrating direct and indirect pathways resolves contradictions and advances actionable metrics for conservation strategies resilient to environmental changes.},

Combined with our parameter-efficient miniset self-attention block, this enables QuAN to access high-order moments of bit-string distributions and preferentially attend to less noisy snapshots. We test QuAN across three quantum simulation settings: driven hard-core Bose-Hubbard model, random quantum circuits, and toric code under coherent and incoherent noise. QuAN directly learns entanglement and state complexity growth from experimental computational basis measurements, including complexity growth in random circuits from noisy data. In regimes inaccessible to existing theory, QuAN unveils the complete phase diagram for noisy toric code data as a function of both noise types, highlighting AI’s transformative potential for assisting quantum hardware.},

Existing theories propose different mechanisms for these patterns, but no single mechanism has successfully explained both. However, the planetary parameters of the four Solar System giant planets suggest that a fundamentally different mechanism is unlikely. In this study, we show that convection-driven columnar structures can account for both eastward and westward equatorial jets, framing the phenomenon as a bifurcation. Consequently, both superrotation and subrotation emerge as stable branches of the same mechanistic solution. Our analysis of these solutions uncovers similarities in the properties of equatorial waves and the leading-order momentum balance. This study suggests that the fundamental dynamics governing equatorial jet formation may be more broadly applicable across the Jovian planets than previously believed, offering a unified explanation for their two distinct zonal wind patterns.},

  abstract     = {Remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D) can occur after hypocaloric diet, bariatric surgery, or pharmacological treatments and associates with improved β cell function. Here, we studied islets from nondiabetic ( n = 15) and T2D ( n = 21) donors. We examined whether T2D β cell dysfunction can be rescued, charted the underlying molecular mechanisms by RNA sequencing, and mined transcriptomes for drug targets. Glucose responsiveness of T2D β cells improved in 60% of preparations after 3-day culture in euglycemic conditions. This was accompanied by changes in expression of >400 genes involved in functional or inflammatory pathways. Drug repurposing and target identification analyses predicted chemical and genetic hits, including JAK inhibitors, which were validated in a β cell line, human islets, and db/db mice. Therefore, defective β cell glucose responsiveness in T2D can recover, demonstrating β cell functional plasticity. The recovery associates with transcriptomic traits, pointing to targetable defects to induce T2D remission.},

  abstract     = {Airflow detection while smelling is a fundamental requirement for olfaction, yet the mechanisms underlying such multimodal processing in the olfactory system remain unknown. We report here that mice can accurately discriminate airflow in the absence of whiskers. Modulated sniffing and refined calcium signaling in the olfactory bulb inhibitory network during olfactory anemo-discriminations confirmed the orthonasal airflow information processing. Genetic perturbation of AMPAR function and optogenetic control bidirectionally shifted the anemo-discrimination learning pace, with contrasting phenotypes observed for odor learning, engagement of inhibitory circuits, and setting the optimal inhibition level for stimulus refinement. Enhanced learning caused by multimodal odor-airflow stimuli at subthreshold levels confirmed the heightened olfactory perception by mechanical stimuli. Our results thus explain the multimodality of olfaction and reveal the unexplored dimensionality of odor perception.},
