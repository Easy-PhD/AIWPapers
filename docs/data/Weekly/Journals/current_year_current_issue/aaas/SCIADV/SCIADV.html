  abstract     = {One-pot chemoenzymatic cascade reactions integrate the advantages of enzymatic catalysis and chemical catalysis, offering routes to synthesize enantiopure compounds in an efficient and environmentally friendly manner. The rational design of enzyme-metal hybrid catalysts (EMHCs) is an attractive strategy for operating chemoenzymatic cascade reactions efficiently under mild conditions. In this study, we develop a method for the instantaneous and continuous synthesis of EMHCs in evaporating microdroplets. Compared to traditional wet impregnation methods, the reaction time of the microdroplet-assisted method is shortened from days to seconds, achieving a space-time yield increase by two to five orders of magnitude. The as-prepared Pd/lipase cross-linked enzyme aggregates with ultrasmall Pd nanoclusters and well-preserved structure of enzymes exhibit excellent activity in the dynamic kinetic resolution of chiral amines. The mechanism for the process enhancement in the synthesis of EMHCs in evaporating microdroplets is studied by theoretical calculations, indicating that the fast solvent evaporation and high-heat transfer are the major factors for the instantaneous synthesis of EMHCs.},

  abstract     = {Studies on the impact of metabolism on cell fate decisions are seeing a renaissance. However, a key challenge remains to distinguish signaling functions of metabolism from its canonical bioenergetic and biosynthetic roles, which underlie cellular homeostasis. Here, we tackled this challenge using mouse embryonic axis segmentation as an experimental model. First, we found that energetically subminimal amounts of glucose can support ongoing segmentation clock activity, providing evidence that glycolysis exerts a signaling function. Using a dynamical systems approach based on entrainment, we identified fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) as the potential signaling metabolite. Functionally, we demonstrated that glycolytic flux/FBP control the segmentation clock period and Wnt signaling in an anticorrelated manner. Critically, we showed that the slow segmentation clock phenotype caused by elevated glycolysis is mediated by Wnt signaling rather than cellular bioenergetic and biosynthetic state. Combined, our results demonstrate a modular organization of metabolic functions, revealing a signaling module of glycolysis that can be decoupled from its canonical metabolic functions.},

Enabled by high-precision frequency metrology, this approach reveals systematic discrepancies with state-of-the-art ab initio calculations, exposing subtle electron correlation effects in the dipole moment curve. Applied to line-intensity ratio thermometry (LRT), our technique determines gas temperatures with 0.5 millikelvin statistical uncertainty, exceeding previous LRT precision by two orders of magnitude. These results redefine the limits of optical gas metrology and enable International System of Units–traceable measurements for applications from combustion diagnostics to isotopic analysis.

Traditional surface and needle EMG methodologies have limited capacity to shed light on the diversity of motor unit (MU) control strategies that may be unique to each individual. Here, we used high-density surface EMG (HDsEMG) to sample multiple MUs per participant to investigate the features of inhibitory spinal microcircuits in both upper and lower limb control. We characterized the net inhibition as a function of individual MU firing rates, revealing participant-specific relationships. In silico modeling replicated these experimental characteristics and suggested that properties of the inhibitory currents rather than motoneuron size are responsible for net functional inhibition. Our results show that HDsEMG can highlight distinct control strategies across circuits and motor pools, revealing participant-specific properties of inhibitory spinal microcircuits.},

Using spectrally resolved ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, we demonstrate that FAD •– photoexcitation in the absence of substrate leads to the formation of the oxidized flavin FAD ox (the resting state in the catalytic cycle) within 100 femtoseconds. While this feature is similar to that occurring in flavoprotein oxidases, the ensuing photocycle is more complex. Upon excitation at the lowest-energy transition, the ejected electron is initially captured as a hydrated electron ( e – H ) before transferring to a secondary acceptor in 2.5 picoseconds and returning to the flavin in 37 picoseconds. This implies that e – H can be generated within a protein environment, an unprecedented finding. This assessment is supported by molecular dynamics simulations showing an expansion of the flavin-binding pocket without substrate, allowing water molecules to fill the void. Our results may pave the way to developing unconventional photocatalytic processes.},

A substantial challenge in neuroscience is identifying specific neural signals corresponding to each sound and analyzing them separately. Combining frequency tagging and machine learning, we achieved high-precision separation of neural responses to mixed melodies, classifying them by selective attention toward specific melodies. Across two magnetoencephalography datasets, individual musicality and task performance heavily influenced the attentional recruitment of cortical regions, correlating positively with top-down attention in the left parietal cortex but negatively with bottom-up attention in the right. In prefrontal areas, neural responses indicating higher sustained selective attention reflected better performance and musicality. These results suggest that musical training enhances neural mechanisms in the frontoparietal regions, boosting performance via improving top-down attention, reducing bottom-up distractions, and maintaining selective attention over time. This work establishes the effectiveness of combining frequency tagging with machine learning to capture cognitive and behavioral effects with stimulus precision, applicable to other studies involving simultaneous stimuli.},

We present a data-driven pathway to learn the XC functional by using the exact density, XC energy, and XC potential. While the exact densities are obtained from accurate configuration interaction (CI), the exact XC energies and XC potentials are obtained via inverse DFT calculations on the CI densities. We demonstrate how simple neural network (NN)–based local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA), trained on just five atoms and two molecules, provide remarkable improvement in total energies and densities. Particularly, the NN-based GGA functional attains similar accuracy as the higher rung SCAN meta-GGA on various thermochemistry datasets. These results underscore the promise of using the XC potential in modeling XC functionals and can pave the way for systematic learning of increasingly accurate XC functionals.},

Recent findings support an α cell–to–β cell axis that is mediated by paracrine signaling through the glucagon receptor and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor in β cells. To address which proglucagon peptides stimulate insulin secretion, we developed an assay to quantify levels of GLP-1(7–36)NH 2 . We also generated three transgenic mouse lines that allow α cell-specific, inducible deletion of the genes for the two prohormone convertase enzymes that process proglucagon . Our studies reveal that both mouse and human islets contain GLP-1(7–36)NH2, but glucagon mediates α cell–to–β cell communication in mice. However, in the absence of normal production of glucagon, α cells up-regulate prohormone convertase 1 (PC1/3) to generate GLP-1 and enhance glucose tolerance. Human islets have substantially higher levels of GLP-1 than mice, which positively correlate with rates of insulin secretion.

Using multiscale [40 to 2500 astronomical units (au)] observations of an MDC hosting an HMYSO, we identify a coherent dynamical structure analogous to barred spiral galaxies: three ~20,000 au spiral arms feed a ~7500 au central bar, which channels gas to a ~2000 au pseudodisk. Further accretion proceeds through the inner structures, including a Keplerian disk and an inner disk (~100 au), which are thought to be driving a collimated bipolar outflow. These multiscale structures (spiral arms, bar, streamers, envelope, disk, and outflow) have been simultaneously observed as a physically coherent structure within an MDC. Our discovery suggests that well-organized hierarchical structures play a crucial role during the gas accretion and angular momentum buildup of a massive disk.},

By rotating one surface with respect to the other, we precisely control roughness matching, enabling nearly an order-of-magnitude variation in the maximum static friction coefficient. Both the variation amplitude and the angular range over which the frictional strength varies are governed by roughness alignment. Universal statistical patterns emerge in micromechanical quantities, including the microcontact area, orientation, deformation, and their evolutions under shear, following generalized extreme value distributions. To quantify asperity interactions, we introduce the contact fabric tensor, whose anisotropy provides a unified measure of roughness matching and a predictor for frictional strength and sliding onset. These findings advance our understanding of friction at rough interfaces and inform the design of mechanical systems, adhesives, and fault models.},

Applying a periodically modulated laser light to optomechanical oscillators allows for stable and precise control of oscillator couplings. This enables us to not only explore the physics of quantized integer and fractional phase slips but also synthesize multioctave synchronizations of mechanical oscillators that exhibit tailorable multistability. Furthermore, the dynamically manipulated synchronizations lead to an exotic phase-space trajectory, which has a nontrivial winding number and giant nonreciprocity.

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) materials often face limitations in molecular adsorption due to the absence of dangling bonds, affecting their performance as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates. We address this by engineering defects, specifically nanopores, in monolayer WS 2 through controlled plasma treatments. These nanopores create dangling bonds to improve molecular adsorption for molecule enrichment and dynamically modulate the WS 2 bandgap to optimize band alignment with rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules. This leads to a shift in photoluminescence peaks from red to blue with increasing defect density. Furthermore, the Raman signal is amplified by localized electromagnetic fields around the nanopores and carefully chosen resonance laser wavelengths. This combination allows blue-shifted WS 2 to achieve single-molecule SERS detection, with a sensitivity limit reaching 1 × 10 −20 M for R6G. Using SERS mapping, we visualize adsorption sites, confirming the nanopores’ role as active sites. Our study introduces a pioneering method for developing ultrasensitive 2D SERS substrates and advances the understanding of SERS mechanisms on 2D materials.},

Here, we present color-resolved third harmonic generation microscopy (cTHGM), a noninvasive method for molecular imaging based on absorption-enhanced THG response. Leveraging one single broadband femtosecond laser beam, cTHGM captures subtle absorption variations, including ~2-nanometer shifts in the Soret band, enabling precise distinction of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from hemoglobin with negligible phototoxicity. We demonstrate that cTHGM measures HbA1c fractions in single red blood cells (RBCs) in vivo and ex vivo, providing noninvasive HbA1c measurement and insights into HbA1c distribution at the cellular level. In addition, cTHGM reconstructs historical glycemic trajectories by decoding single-RBC HbA1c distributions, offering a retrospective view of glycemic variability over months. This innovative method combines label-free imaging, high spatial and spectral resolution, and noninvasive manners, making it a promising tool for diabetes management, glycemic variability monitoring, and broader applications in precision medicine.},

This device can transduce proximity or airflow into spike trains with a frequency range of ~500 to 1500 hertz. A spiking NCTP system is developed, achieving high accuracy (>92%) in multidimensional recognition of noncontact targets, mediated by airflow. Furthermore, we show that a spider robot equipped with a FISH matrix outperforms one relying exclusively on machine vision in tasks of predation and evasion, demonstrating high adaptability to complex environments.

Thalamocortical input was initially balanced between CTs and ETs but shifted to CT-dominant 1 day post-NIHL and then normalized by day 7. This transient shift was accompanied by increased quantal size and suprathreshold excitability in CTs, with minimal changes in ETs. In vivo, CTs exhibited persistent elevation in sound intensity thresholds, while ETs showed a transient shift in frequency tuning and reduced high-frequency responsiveness that recovered within a week. These findings reveal distinct, cell type–specific plasticity mechanisms in deep-layer ACtx neurons following peripheral damage and highlight potential targets for treating hearing loss–related disorders such as tinnitus and hyperacusis.},

OROV RNA was detected in plasma and nasal swabs and infection-induced high levels of innate inflammation, type I interferon gene signatures, immunoglobulin M–positive B cell expansion, high titers of neutralizing antibodies, and detectable frequencies of OROV-specific T cells. Prior infection was protective against reinfection up to 524 days post–initial infection, demonstrating possible protective immunity induction against OROV infection.

A quantitative correlation between capacitance changes and x-ray dose rate is established, enabling stable, high-resolution imaging. Using this method, we achieve three-dimensional internal structure reconstruction with a simple single-pixel detector. This approach overcomes intrinsic material limitations and enhances signal reliability, providing a promising pathway toward the commercialization of low-cost, high-performance perovskite-based x-ray imaging and computed tomography systems.},

However, the chemical processes inducing even-MIF remain largely unknown. Here, we develop a three-dimensional atmospheric Hg isotope model linking Hg redox processes with even-MIF. The results show that the previous hypothesis of even-MIF occurring exclusively at the tropopause may not fully explain the global Δ 200 Hg patterns. We speculate OH-initiated reactions and photoreduction of Hg II (p) as likely dominant drivers. Simulations show that even-MIF primarily originates in the free troposphere and propagates downward to surface air. Our results reveal distinct spatial Δ 200 Hg variations that were previously unaccounted for in tracing Hg sources. This study provides critical insights into even-MIF drivers and serves as a reference for using Δ 200 Hg to trace atmospheric Hg sources.},

By combining operando x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) with fixed-energy x-ray absorption voltammetry (FEXRAV) at semiconductor/cocatalyst interfaces, we provide an element-selective probe of Co oxidation states under dark and illuminated conditions. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized interfacial Co state, highlighting interface structure’s role in tuning catalytic activity. We observe light-induced reduction in oxidation state and cathodic shift in Co redox potentials, offering insights into hole transfer and catalytic behavior. Identification of a specific photocatalytic cycle, distinct from dark-state electrocatalysis, advances understanding of how light modulates rate-determining steps in OER.

We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a space-time holographic metasurface antenna (HMA) capable of encoding and reconstructing the full amplitude, phase, and frequency contents of object waves.

This study demonstrates that components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery regulate the proteasome-dependent degradation of functional PILS proteins under nonstressed conditions. We further reveal that both internal and external signals use the ERAD complex to differentially modulate the turnover rates of PILS proteins. Our findings uncover an additional physiological role of the ERAD complex in regulating PILS protein turnover.

Using single-cell metabarcoding on 243 diatom-bearing foraminifera specimens from Indonesia, we found one highly dominant diatom strain in each foraminiferal host species bearing at least 90% of the reads in a majority of host species, whereas the bacterial community was very flexible, with only 25% of the variation explained by water depth, substrate type, location, and host species.

  abstract     = {Ferro-piezoelectricity occurs in robust and ordered crystalline materials, where polarization is reoriented under an external field. However, complex electric fields, disordered networks, and porous materials with poor crystallinity hinder the development of high-performance ferro-piezoelectric materials. Here, we describe two-dimensional (2D) crystalline Na-Mn-Sn-S chalcogels ([Sn 2 S 6 ] 4− :Mn 2+ at a molar ratio of 1:0.5; NMSC-1) with a unique arrangement within a disordered network, resulting in unprecedented intrinsic ferro-piezoelectric characteristics. The NMSC-1 can be used as an efficient filler in poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoro ethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)]/NMSC-1 nanocomposite, enhancing crystallization of P(VDF-TrFE) and its ferro-piezoelectricity. Even at a low filler content of 0.5 wt %, the P(VDF-TrFE)/NMSC-1 nanocomposite exhibits superior piezoelectric performance compared with pure P(VDF-TrFE), P(VDF-TrFE)/other Na-Mn-Sn-S chalcogels (NMSC-2 and NMSC-3 with [Sn 2 S 6 ] 4− :Mn 2+ molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:2, respectively) with poor crystallinity, and nanocomposites of P(VDF-TrFE) and other 2D nanomaterials (Na-Mn-Sn-S powders, MgAl-layered double hydroxides, and SnS 2 nanoflowers), implying potential uses in sensing applications and the harvesting of mechanical energy.},

We examine the latest advancements in the ISE technology, focusing on materials innovations and heat management designed for high-salinity brines, which are key to enabling rapid evaporation and selective mineral recovery. Looking forward, we analyze the critical challenges that hinder the transition of ISE from laboratory to industry, including material stability, long-term durability, technoeconomic viability, and potential environmental risks. Acknowledging that the practical implementation of ISE is not yet certain, this study outlines a potential road map to guide the efforts needed to overcome these barriers and realize the goal of efficient, sustainable mineral extraction.},

However, optical memories have broader applications, and their storage and buffering capabilities can benefit a wide range of future quantum technologies. Here, we present the demonstration of a cryptography protocol incorporating an intermediate quantum memory layer. Specifically, we implement Wiesner’s unforgeable quantum money primitive with a storage step, rather than as an on-the-fly procedure. This protocol imposes stringent requirements on storage efficiency and noise level to reach a secure regime. We demonstrate the implementation with polarization encoding of weak coherent states of light and a high-efficiency cold atom–based quantum memory and validate the full scheme.

Here, we show that, in male and female mice, a KD protects against weight gain and induces weight loss but over time leads to the development of hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and severe glucose intolerance. Unlike mice on conventional high-fat diet, KD-fed mice remain insulin sensitive and display low-insulin levels. Hyperglycemic clamp and ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assays revealed systemic and cell-intrinsic impairments in insulin secretion. Transcriptomic profiling of islets from KD-fed mice indicated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi stress and disrupted ER-Golgi protein trafficking, which were confirmed by electron microscopy showing a dilated Golgi network consistent with defective insulin granule trafficking and secretion. Together, these results suggest that long-term KD leads to multiple aberrations of metabolic parameters that caution their systematic use as a health-promoting dietary intervention.},

The main challenges that still need to be addressed to ensure high competitiveness of magnonic devices include finding ways to efficiently amplify spin waves in nanostructures and developing nanocircuits that can operate without the need for an external bias magnetic field. Here, we demonstrate how these two challenges can be solved using nanowaveguides fabricated from a low-loss magnetic insulator. We show that using local parametric pumping with a power of only a few milliwatts, one can achieve coherent amplification of spin-wave pulses by more than two orders of magnitude at zero bias magnetic field.

Conventional membranes are constrained to unidirectional transport of either cations or anions, severely limiting their versatility and performance. Inspired by the chloride voltage-gated channel 5 (ClC-5), we engineered a biomimetic Janus NP-MXene membrane featuring subnanochannels (~6.0 angstrom) and exceptional structural integrity, enabling controlled, simultaneous Na + /Cl − transport with unprecedented permselectivity. Under a 50-fold salinity gradient, the NP-MXene membrane achieved a record power density of 85.1 watts per square meter and an osmotic potential of 181.5 millivolts, the highest reported for a single device. Harnessing ion-specific signals from multi-ion transport, we further demonstrated an iontronic transistor capable of modulating ion flow by salinity gradients, eliminating the need for external gate voltage. This advance enables encoded signals and robotic control for advanced human-machine interfaces. The scalable fabrication of nanofluidic channels facilitates high-performance iontronics for efficient energy-information flow.},

Although the mechanisms of DDR activation have been extensively studied, how DDR is kept inactive is far less well understood, especially in plants. Here, we show that the plant-specific transcription factor SOG1, a master regulator of the plant DDR, interacts with PRL1, which functions as a substrate adaptor of the Cullin4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4 PRL1 to polyubiquitinate SOG1, promoting SOG1 degradation through 26 S proteasome. When DNA damage occurs, PRL1 is degraded and SOG1 is phosphorylated, both of which impair the polyubiquitination and degradation of SOG1. This study demonstrated that plants dynamically control DDR by regulating the phosphorylation and polyubiquitination of SOG1.},

We also identify SETD2, a histone methyltransferase, as a chromatin modifying enzyme that controls intracellular iron availability through ferritin breakdown.

Through experiments and theoretical simulations, we unveil the underlying mechanism for this unique nonlinear proton transport property, i.e., the gating effect from the built-in electric potential across the MOF phase junctions enabled by voltage bias above a threshold. As a proof-of-concept application demonstration, the nanofluidic device exhibits an ionic memory property as a nanofluidic memristor.

In contrast to a solid, on PaLS, a droplet can be in 10 different wetting states. This richness arises from the adaptation of the liquid lubricants and can be harnessed to control the apparent contact angle of the droplet over the full range of wettability while removing contact-line pinning effects induced by the solid surface. In the limit of thin liquid films, we derive surface-averaged laws for the apparent contact angle for each wetting state, which capture both experimental and simulation data.

To address these challenges, this study develops a nanofiber membrane system with synergistic structural and interfacial enhancement. Through nanofiber architecture and surface engineering, the membrane balances proton conductivity, mechanical strength and electrochemical performance. The sandwich-structure nanofiber membrane (SSNFM) achieves a peak power density of 942 mW cm −2 after 100-hour accelerated stress testing, substantially outperforming conventional commercial membranes (520 mW cm −2 ). Electrochemical characterization confirms enhanced proton conductivity for SSNFM (40.4 mS cm −1 ) compared to commercial membranes (17.5 mS cm −1 ). Multiscale analyses, including x-ray computed tomography and multiphase simulations, reveal improved membrane properties, catalyst layer stability, and triple-phase boundary formation, facilitating efficient charge and mass transport.

Single-cell analyses revealed purely tactile, purely acoustic, bimodal, and decision-mnemonic responses. Population analyses of the VPC network and a recurrent neural network trained on the BDT uncovered notably similar latent dynamics. In both networks, neural trajectories diverged sharply from rest along modality-specific directions during stimulus presentation, while remained at rest during stimulus-absent trials. Subsequently, trajectories rotated toward a mnemonic subspace, where perceptual decisions (acoustic, tactile, and absent) were maintained in three distinctly different stable attractors. Using low-dimensional modeling, we propose a universal mechanism for the transition from sensory processing to memory retention explaining both biological and artificial latent neural dynamics in a simple dynamical motif. These results show that VPC neurons encode bimodal information, can integrate competing sensory inputs, and maintain multimodal perceptual decisions.},

We use the vibrationally resolved attosecond chronoscope to capture the electronic symmetry breaking induced by the Renner-Teller effect in bent CO 2 molecules after photoionization by an extreme ultraviolet photon by measuring attosecond ionization delays. Relative photoionization delays between the four cation states are observed, with vibrational state–dependent delays, we analyze the evolution of the degenerate A 2 Π u state to the nondegenerate A ′ and A ″ states due to molecular bending. With the help of theoretical analysis, we show that the relative photoionization delays of up to 72 as between the vibrational levels originate from the symmetry breaking–induced shape resonance.

  abstract     = {A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here, we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency η reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field B ‖ is applied. The sign and the magnitude of η are tunable not only by B ‖ but also by the back-gate voltage. This diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano–superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and B ‖ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect marks the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI nanowire–based Josephson junction.},

  abstract     = {Several enveloped viruses, including paramyxoviruses, assemble and bud from the host plasma membrane (PM). Nipah virus (NiV), a deadly zoonotic paramyxovirus, uses its matrix protein (M) to drive virus assembly and budding through dimerization and PM interaction. We show that NiV-M–mediated virus-like particle (VLP) production depends on its interaction with host F-actin via its carboxyl-terminal domain. We demonstrate that F-actin retains NiV-M assembly sites at the PM by analyzing NiV-M assembly kinetics. Disrupting actin dynamics or NiV-M–actin interaction alters M nanoscale organization and reduces membrane retention, without affecting initial recruitment. We also show that the Arp2/3 complex, an actin-branching factor, promotes VLP production. Inhibiting Arp2/3 reduces NiV-M retention at the PM and impairs protrusion formation while leaving the assembly rate unchanged. These findings suggest that the host F-actin retains NiV assembly sites on the PM and promotes virus budding via Arp2/3-driven actin branching.},

Here, we show that HTT also interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, and its loss of function disturbs the morphology and function of the axonal growth cone. We demonstrate that HTT organizes F-actin into bundles. Cryo–electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA) structural analyses reveal that HTT’s N-terminal HEAT and Bridge domains wrap around F-actin, while the C-terminal HEAT domain is displaced; furthermore, HTT dimerizes via the N-HEAT domain to bridge parallel actin filaments separated by ~20 nanometers. Our study provides the structural basis for understanding how HTT interacts with and organizes the actin cytoskeleton.},

Currently, little is known about the internal signals regulating haustorium development. Here, we identify root meristem growth factor (RGF) peptides in Phtheirospermum japonicum as endogenous inducers of prehaustorium formation. Treatment with specific RGF peptides in the absence of hosts triggered prehaustoria and induced expression of PjYUC3 , a gene required for auxin biosynthesis and prehaustorium formation. CRISPR-mediated knockouts showed that PjRGFR1 and PjRGFR3, receptors activated by the haustorium-specific RGF peptides PjRGF2 and PjRGF5, are essential for prehaustorium formation, revealing functional redundancy. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that PjRGF2 is broadly conserved among Orobanchaceae, whereas PjRGF5 appears to have recently evolved through segmental tandem multiplication. Our findings establish RGF peptides and their corresponding receptors as critical components of haustorium developmental signaling and provide insights into the evolutionary trajectories that shape plant parasitism.},

  abstract     = {Adipocyte hypertrophy during obesity triggers chronic inflammation, leading to metabolic disorders. However, the role of adipocyte-specific inflammatory signaling in metabolic syndrome remains unclear. The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, LUBAC, is an E3-ligase that generates nondegradative linear ubiquitination (Lin-Ub). LUBAC regulates NF-κB/MAPK-driven inflammation and prevents cell death triggered by immune receptors like TNF receptor-1. Here, we show that mice lacking HOIP, the Lin-E3 ligase catalytic subunit of LUBAC, in adipocytes ( Hoip A-KO ) display lipodystrophy and heightened susceptibility to obesity-induced metabolic syndrome, particularly metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Mechanistically, loss of HOIP attenuates TNF-induced NF-κB activation and promotes cell death in human adipocytes. Inhibiting caspase-8–mediated cell death is sufficient to prevent lipodystrophy and MASLD in Hoip A-KO obese mice. HOIP expression in adipose tissue positively correlates with metabolic fitness in obese individuals. Overall, our findings reveal a fundamental developmental role for Lin-Ub in adipocytes by mitigating cell death–driven adipose tissue inflammation and protecting against obesity-related metabolic syndrome.},

Fermentative yeasts are widespread in the terrestrial biosphere, and simple carbohydrates underpinning ethanol production are commonplace within fruits. We determined ethanol concentrations within fruits representing a substantial portion of the diet of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees. Ripe fruit pulp from 20 angiosperm species in Côte d’Ivoire and Uganda contained an average value of 0.31 (± 0.21 SD) and 0.32% (± 0.20) ethanol (weight/weight), respectively, as scaled by annual chimpanzee feeding time per species at each site. Chimpanzees typically eat ~4.5 kilograms of fruit per day, corresponding to an estimated ethanol ingestion of 14 grams (±9), or the equivalent of 1.4 (±0.9) standard drinks by international standards. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ethanol is widespread within tropical fruits and that modern predisposition to alcohol consumption derives from ancestral exposure to this psychoactive substance among frugivorous primates.},

Using exogenous molecular chaperone systems has the potential to stabilize native conformations and inhibit the aberrant aggregation of α-syn, yet inefficient blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and insufficient accumulation at PD sites limit their application. Herein, we developed chemotactic chaperone nanomotors (CNMs) that exploit the unique pathological microenvironment of PD lesions, characterized by elevated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels. The CNMs consist of a chemotactic-targeting module capable of sensing an iNOS concentration gradient, an α-syn–specific recognition module with conformation-sensitive binding domains, and a protein regulatory module with a hydrophobic microdomain that can stabilize α-syn and prevent misfolding. Results demonstrate that CNMs can achieve active chemotactic navigation across BBB and dual modulation of α-syn proteostasis through aggregate dissolution and prevention of misfolding. CNMs not only supplement exogenous chaperone activity but also restore endogenous protein stabilization mechanisms, concurrently reducing neuroinflammatory markers, promoting the application of nanochaperones for PD treatment.},

Integrated analyses across species identified diverse subtypes of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons that are highly conserved across primates. Compositional analyses revealed that subdivisions of the primate basolateral complex contain distinct classes of glutamatergic neurons and divergent gene expression profiles for parvalbumin and somatostatin GABAergic neurons. Referencing primate neuron types to transcriptomic atlases of the murine amygdala highlighted primate-specific specializations for glutamatergic neurons and identified which neuron types are conserved across mammals and amygdalar subdivisions.

This approach revealed a molecular hierarchy in which cell class–distinguishing features emerge first, followed by subclass- and type-related characteristics. Acquisition of cellular identity and diversity remained stable across in vivo models. In contrast, in vitro glutamatergic neurons showed decreased expression of identity-defining genes, reduced diversity, and alterations in connectivity. Cellular identity and diversity were closest to in vivo values in organotypic cultures.

This flexibility facilitates the study of biomolecular behavior under dynamically adjustable conditions, including controlled confinement fluctuations.

The accelerated eastward mode frequency is expected to rise by 15%, intensifying subseasonal precipitation whiplash worldwide and shortening disaster preparedness time. This acceleration results from an asymmetric pattern of boundary layer moisture convergence anomalies, driven by weakened Rossby wave westerlies and enhanced Kelvin wave response linked to warming-induced atmospheric stabilization and El Niño–like ocean surface warming pattern. Conversely, a projected weakening of easterly vertical shear over the northern Indian Ocean attenuates the Rossby wave response and favors more eastward expansion events.},

However, the uncontrolled crystallization dynamics of Br-rich species lead to reduced grain sizes and high defect densities in WBG perovskite films. Herein, a multifunctional additive 3,4,5-trifluorobenzamide (TFBZ) was introduced to enhance the crystallinity and passivate defects of the methylammonium (MA)–free WBG perovskite films. The TFBZ demonstrates superior passivation capability compared to benzamide, effectively mitigating both iodine vacancies and undercoordinated Pb 2+ defects via fluorine-enhanced interactions. In addition, the fluorine substituents in TFBZ could form N–H···F hydrogen bonds with formamidinium iodide to retard the crystallization rate of the perovskite. This proposed method is effective in defect passivation and crystal growth modulation for both 1.67– and 1.79–electron volt MA-free WBG perovskites, enabling the fabrication of MA-free all-perovskite TSCs with an encouraging power conversion efficiency of 29.01% (certified at 28.52%).},

  abstract     = {Van Hove singularities (VHSs) play a critical role in determining the properties of topological and correlated electronic states. Their associated excitations offer unique opportunities for exploring light-matter interactions reshaped by these correlated states, although experimental observations remain limited. Here, we studied the interaction between plasmons and VHS-related excitations in kagome metal CsV 3 Sb 5 films via far-field absorption spectroscopy. Notably, an anticrossing phenomenon was observed in the charge density wave states, with coupling strength approaching the strong coupling regime, indicating the formation of dispersive hybrid VHS interband plasmons. These modes are closely correlated to charge ordering states, with both the fitted coupling strength and the universal screening length of interband transitions exhibiting pronounced anomalies at the transition temperature. Our findings offer critical insights into the role of correlated electronic states in modulating plasmon behavior in kagome metals and unveil promising possibilities for tuning light-matter interactions in correlated materials.},

  abstract     = {Endosomes and lysosomes (collectively termed “endolysosomes”) traverse the cytoplasm in a stop-and-go manner, but the mechanisms underlying this motion remain poorly understood. Using deep learning–based image analyses, including particle tracking, spatial distribution, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology analysis, we found that ER junctions facilitate stop-and-go motion switching and serve as platforms for endolysosome interactions. Within the ER network, endolysosomes exhibit three dynamic states: fast movement, local slow movement, and pausing. Pauses occur mainly at ER junctions, where transient endosome-lysosome interactions often coincide with organelle fission and are followed by departure. Disruption of ER junctions impairs lysosomal motility and maturation. We further show that actin condensation around endolysosomes mediates motion switching, involving VAP-STARD3 interaction and the actin regulator YWHAH. Other organelles, such as lipid droplets and peroxisomes, also pause near ER junctions. These findings highlight ER junctions as regulatory hubs that orchestrate organelle dynamics, contributing to the spatial coordination of organelle distribution and interactions within the cytoplasm.},

Currently available data assessing diatom responses focus on empirical comparisons between present-day and future conditions, rather than exploring the mechanisms driving these responses. Here, we conducted high-resolution growth experiments to map the fitness of diatoms across broad carbonate chemistry landscapes. Our results reveal species-specific carbonate chemistry niches, which can be used to predict ecological shifts between species under changing conditions driven by ocean acidification or ocean alkalinity enhancement. The results demonstrate that changes in diatom fitness are almost exclusively driven by carbon dioxide and proton concentrations, with bicarbonate exerting no discernible effect. Thus, current assumptions regarding the role of bicarbonate as a primary carbon source supporting diatom growth may be overestimated. This study presents a methodological and conceptual framework as a foundation for future studies to collate data capable of predicting species-specific responses and shifts in ecological niches driven by changes in marine carbonate chemistry.},

Current treatments, including repeated intraocular anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections, are invasive and often lead to discomfort and complicated hemorrhages. Here, we developed a noninvasive nanozyme eye drop capable of penetrating the fundus to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby inhibit neovascularization. The nanozyme eye drops consist of liposomes formed by fluorinated and arginine–glycine–aspartic acid–modified phospholipids, which enhance the penetration of ocular barriers. The encapsulated superoxide dismutase–catalase cascade nanozyme within these liposomes allows for efficient ROS scavenging. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that these nanozyme eye drops achieve deep retinal tissue penetration, alleviate oxidative stress, restore mitochondrial function, and suppress aberrant insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 signaling, thereby inhibiting pathological neovascularization. Enhanced ocular bioavailability and minimal toxicity further underscore its promise as a safe and effective noninvasive treatment for retinal neovascularization diseases.},

These unique observations provide high-resolution (18 meters per pixel) measurements of light scattered by aerosols in the atmosphere. The observations are characterized by subkilometer-scale layering, ±20% variations in color of the individual layers, and high radiance ( I / F > 1). Strong spatial (latitudinal) variability is also evident, suggesting highly inhomogeneous absorption and atmospheric heating. Models of the radiance, while likely to be degenerate, indicate good agreement with lower-resolution results inferred from other techniques. Mesospheric aerosol layers (strongly blue in CaSSIS color ratios) are also evident. The observed decrease in the CaSSIS RED/BLU color ratio with altitude is indicative of a decrease in particle radius.},

In this study, we examine more than 1.5 million minute-scale rain and snow particle attributes and collocated meteorological variables from seven global measurement sites over 9 years. Applying Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, we reduce the dataset’s dimensionality by 75%, identifying nine distinct precipitation groups and associated particle evolution pathways. UMAP effectively captures the global structure of precipitation phases such as rain, snow, and mixed-phase types, revealing clear patterns that linear methods struggle to resolve. The resulting UMAP manifold offers a unique perspective on precipitation phase and intensity, advancing our understanding of particle evolutionary processes and offering valuable insights for improving weather and climate models and remote sensing precipitation estimates.},

Postfire snow cover loss is more extreme in relatively low-elevation, warm environments compared to that in high-elevation, cold regions. Under +2°C of warming, 73% of the snow zone would experience more extreme earlier postfire snowmelt compared to historically average conditions. Regions with the largest shift earlier in postfire snowmelt timing under average climate conditions also have the largest shift earlier in postfire snowmelt under +2°C warming.

Here, we synthesized the response of growing season carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions to experimentally manipulated warming of ~2°C for permafrost in alpine and Arctic regions. Warming weakened the GHG sink of alpine permafrost, thereby increasing (13%) its global warming potential, but strengthened the GHG sink of Arctic permafrost and decreased (−10%) its global warming potential. When warming caused drying of alpine permafrost soils, the CO 2 sink weakened but the CH 4 sink increased. In contrast, warming of relatively wet Arctic permafrost increased the CO 2 sink and CH 4 source. Warming led to much stronger increases of the N 2 O source in alpine than Arctic permafrost. Although keeping additional warming below 2°C in permafrost regions can avoid the positive permafrost-climate feedback, measures are needed to maintain fragile carbon sink of alpine permafrost ecosystems.},

The ultrathin electrode is fabricated using gelatin hydrogels with temperature-controlled phase change properties reinforced by nanomesh while incorporating lithium chloride, and a binary solvent achieves antifreezing and antidehydration characteristics. The design minimizes flexural rigidity, resulting in high interfacial adhesion energy with human skin, and enhances gas (air, oxygen, and carbon dioxide) permeance and water vapor transmission rate.

In the heterotaxy syndrome, abnormal left-right patterning leads to a spectrum of severe congenital heart defects, including ventricle malposition. A postulate anchored in the clinical nomenclature assumes that the looping direction of the embryonic heart tube determines ventricle position at birth. However, this has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here, we performed a unique longitudinal analysis of heterotaxy with right isomerism, using multimodality imaging of Nodal mouse mutants. Using direct correlations and advanced statistics, we dissected the contribution of heart looping variations to specific structural heart malformations, and uncovered unexpected plasticity of ventricle position after looping in 30% of revertant samples. Genetic tracing and topological associations show that plasticity involves a further step of heart remodeling at E13.5, rather than molecular reprogramming. Human patient scans are consistent with ventricle plasticity and suggest association with poorer prognosis. Our work reveals distinct asymmetric events shaping organs.},
