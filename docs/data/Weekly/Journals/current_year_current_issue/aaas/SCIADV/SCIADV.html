  abstract     = {In March 2024, a highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (HPAI) clade 2.3.4.4b virus was identified in US dairy cows, with spillover to cats, poultry, and humans. Up to 30% of commercial pasteurized milk tested contained viral genome copies. The impact of residual viral remnants on host immunity is unknown. Orally ingested proteins can stimulate gut-associated lymphoid tissues, potentially inducing tolerance and altering responses to later infection. We found that milk pasteurization fully inactivated pandemic H1N1 and bovine H5N1 influenza viruses yet preserved hemagglutinin (HA) protein integrity. In mice, repeated oral exposure to inactivated virus did not alter mortality after H5N1 virus challenge. Preliminary data showed that naïve mice exposed to improperly pasteurized milk containing live H5N1 virus developed lethal infection, whereas prior H1N1 infection conferred protection. Mice with preexisting H1N1 immunity remained protected when challenged with bovine H5N1 virus after exposure to H5N1 pasteurized in milk. These findings suggest that pasteurized milk containing inactivated H5N1 virus poses minimal health risks.},

Here, we demonstrate exciton-polariton condensation in a two-dimensional Penrose tiling with C 10 rotational symmetry—the evidence of quasicrystalline order in a quantum fluid of light. We identify a regime, wherein near-perfect delocalization and synchronization of a quantum fluid of light occurs at mesoscopic length scales extending beyond 100× the healing length and the size of each individual condensate.

Efficient fiber-to-chip coupling is critical to minimize loss and maintain high optical bandwidth for photonic computing. We present a plug-and-play fiber-to-PIC solution using female multifiber termination push-on cables, with alignment counterparts additively fabricated on the chip via two-photon polymerization. We develop 3D out-of-plane couplers achieving −0.41-decibel peak transmission and broadband performance with losses below 0.55 decibels in the 1500-to 1600-nanometer range. Integration with the plug-and-play interface adds only 0.37 ± 0.12 decibels, yielding a record-low 0.78-decibel loss for passive out-of-plane packaging. Reproducibility is demonstrated by interfacing a 17-port photonic circuit for incoherent photonic computing, coupling the full 100-nanometer spectrum of a superluminescent LED to enable low-noise operation at 17.6 gigabaud. This passive, multiport, and reconfigurable approach delivers high performance, reliability, and versatility, advancing photonic packaging toward the scalability of electronic chip integration.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of fluidic vortex rings have long captivated researchers because of their complex behavior despite simple structure. Photonic toroidal vortices constitute a family of three-dimensional, spacetime nonseparable structured light fields carrying transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). However, as solutions to the dispersive Maxwells’ equations, these wave packets do not survive nondispersive propagation, and their dynamics remain elusive. In this article, the dynamics of photonic toroidal vortices under various dispersion regimes, mediated by transverse and longitudinal OAM, are investigated through simulations and experiments. The results reveal that the motion of a toroidal vortex is strongly affected by longitudinal OAM. The swirling flow destabilizes the toroidal structure under dispersion and induces topological transformations of vortex lines, characterized by annihilation and subsequent reformation in vacuum. The renascent toroidal vortex exhibits robust propagation in vacuum while maintaining its structure. These findings are supported by experimental validation and highlight the potential of photonic toroidal vortices as controllable channels for directional energy and information transfer.},

Geometric shapes, including basic forms of straight lines, sharp turns and circles, and complex patterns, were fabricated with exceptional fidelity to design specifications. We propose two heat-driven hydrodynamic locomotion mechanisms, fin-like bending and leg-like buckling. By harnessing these principles, we engineered two walkable devices—HydroFlexor and HydroBuckler—and demonstrated robust on-water locomotion. This work eliminates fragile postfabrication transfers in soft device manufacturing, bridging the gap between soft films and structure fabrication, and establishes a streamlined pathway for designing and deploying functional soft devices directly in liquid environments.},

The origins of these episodic movements and their relation to final instability remain unclear. We propose a novel “endo-exo” theory capturing the interplay between exogenous stressors such as rainfall and endogenous damage-healing processes. We predict four types of episodic dynamics, defined by the disturbance source (endogenous or exogenous) and criticality level (subcritical or critical), each with distinct power law exponent but all governed by a single parameter ϑ . These predictions are tested on the Preonzo landslide, whose sporadic activities align with the classification with ϑ ≈ 0.45 ± 0.1 . We find that its final collapse is preceded by an increased frequency of medium-to-large velocities over 1 to 2 months, signaling the transition into a catastrophic regime. Our research suggests that landslides may not permanently operate at a critical state, with major implications for forecasting catastrophic failures.},

Here, we integrate new seismic images with regional seismicity to investigate an actively fragmenting subduction system at northern Cascadia’s ridge-trench-fault triple junction where subduction termination is imminent. Our analyses reveal a broad shear-zone initiated at ~4 Ma by exploiting ridge-parallel fabrics of nascent oceanic lithosphere and progressively localized into a mature trench-perpendicular transform boundary. This process severed an oceanic microplate and enabled its diminished subduction relative to adjacent subducting lithosphere. Downdip, we image trench-parallel slab tears offset by the transform, suggesting lateral tear propagation was intersected by the transform boundary, facilitating efficient decoupling of the microplate while allowing adjacent subduction to continue. We propose a 4D model where transform boundaries drive laterally diachronous slab fragmentation and subduction termination.},

We demonstrate a cascaded amplification strategy that breaks this critical barrier. By implementing quadruple-pass focusing of 5.7-millijoule, 800-nanometer femtosecond pulses in nitrogen, we achieve a 40-fold enhancement in the energy of N 2 + lasing, yielding an output of approximately 4.4 microjoules. This multipass configuration also reduces the lasing threshold by nearly 70%, facilitates spectral broadening of pump pulses, and compresses the pulse duration of N 2 + lasing. Capitalizing on these combined effects, we developed a single-beam coherent Raman spectroscopy, which enables simultaneous detection of multiple species and exhibits high sensitivity at the parts-per-million level. This work successfully addresses the energy bottleneck of air lasing using only commercially available femtosecond lasers and provides a promising approach for standoff chemical analysis.},

Using this framework, we successfully reproduce the self-assembly of subunits into icosahedral shells with T numbers greater than one—most notably T = 3, the most common structure in nature—a feat rigid-body models have so far failed to achieve. We also examine how genome architecture influences assembly and observe trends consistent with experiments using cowpea chlorotic mottle virus proteins: RNAs with more complex structure yield more complete capsids than do linear ones.

These MiNVs could bind natural IgG on their surface, enabling FcRn-mediated transcytosis by evading the lysosomal degradation pathway. Upon reaching the liver, MiNVs responded to the elevated levels of biothiols in the hepatic microenvironment, triggering site-specific insulin release. In type 1 diabetic rats, the oral bioavailability reached 20.4%, which is about 20-fold higher than that of free insulin. Notably, MiNVs showed effective glycemic control over long-term treatment in type 1 diabetic rat and minipig models.

The evolutionarily conserved polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C) plays multiple roles in transcription. Here, we show that PAF1C regulates the growth-defense tradeoff by repressing defense genes expression in Arabidopsis . Loss of PAF1C leads to increased expression of defense genes, enhanced disease resistance, but compromised growth. Mechanistically, PAF1C binds to defense genes, where it interacts with histone deacetylases, such as HDA6, to promote histone deacetylation, thereby repressing defense genes expression. The plant immune hormone salicylic acid (SA) promotes the interaction between PAF1 and the SA receptor NPR1, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate the polyubiquitination and degradation of PAF1. Genetically, loss of PAF1 suppresses the immune defects of the npr1 mutant, supporting the notion that PAF1 functions downstream of NPR1. Collectively, this study identifies the NPR1-PAF1C-HDA6 module that regulates the growth-defense tradeoff.},

Is metabolic dysfunction a cause of depression, a downstream consequence, or do both stem from shared underlying processes? We argue that neurocognitive mechanisms, particularly those involved in reward and effort processing, interact with metabolic physiology to shape each of these causal pathways. Metabolic signals do not act on the brain in isolation; they are embedded within a broader interoceptive system through which the brain detects and interprets bodily states. This system supports allostasis, the brain’s predictive regulation of internal physiological demands. We propose a framework of interoceptive energy allostasis in which disruptions to these predictive processes contribute to the bidirectional relationship between depression and metabolic dysfunction. By integrating perspectives from metabolic and computational psychiatry, this framework offers a theoretical lens to explain the multidirectional comorbidity between mental and metabolic ill-health.},

These systems often require additional actuation mechanisms, such as magnetic control, for assistance. To address this challenge, we developed an acoustically powered micro-clampbot capable of clamping objects using claws actuated by acoustically induced secondary Bjerknes forces and moving via flagella that oscillate under acoustic input. The robot’s actions are governed by distinct acoustic frequencies, enabling precise and independent control of clamping and locomotion. The micro-clampbot can pick a single particle from a cluster and navigate delicately through narrow channels, with narrow necks (~2.1 times the width of the micro-clampbot). This system facilitates the targeted transportation of microscale objects, including live cells, without causing damage.

  abstract     = {Salient experiences open temporal windows that boost otherwise mundane memories encoded before and after pivotal events. A proposed feature of this phenomenon is its selectivity: Salient stimuli preferentially strengthen weak memories that share semantic connections. However, evidence in humans remains inconclusive, and a key question persists: Which factors determine the presence and magnitude of memory enhancement within current neurobiological and behavioral frameworks? We present results from 10 independent studies with a total of 648 participants and provide clear evidence of both retroactive and proactive enhancements in weak memories, directly addressing ongoing debates about the existence of these effects. Notably, stronger salience learning facilitates proactive, but not retroactive, memory enhancement, challenging prevailing theories about salience’s role in these processes. Instead, retroactive enhancement depends on the proximity between incidentally encoded and conditioned stimuli in a high-level feature embedding extracted from a convolutional neural network, revealing a graded prioritization mechanism. These findings offer insights into the mechanisms driving the consolidation of everyday experiences.},

Genomic and reverse genetics studies identified PB2 478I and NP 450N mutations as key determinants of enhanced polymerase activity, immune cell tropism, and pathogenicity. Mutant GA/W22-145E/22 virus carrying PB2 478V /NP 450S showed complete survival without systemic dissemination. Furthermore, GA/W22-145E/22 demonstrated robust replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bovine mammary gland organoids, raising concerns about zoonotic spillover.

While increasing channel thickness enhances its capacitance and thereby amplifies transconductance, it simultaneously impedes ion transport kinetics, leading to slower switching speeds. Here, we present a three-dimensional electrolyte-surrounded OECT architecture that redefines ion transport dynamics by enabling multidirectional ion doping to the channel for efficient and rapid switching. Our proposed approach achieves a remarkable enhancement in the operational bandwidth of OECTs, reaching 26 kHz while preserving their high transconductance, notably using a commercially available conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate). This is enabled by micro/nanostructured channel design that enhances ion accessibility and minimizes parasitic effects. This advancement allows for continuous, wide-frequency neural signal recording from peripheral nerves. This work offers a robust strategy for achieving both high transconductance and fast switching in OECTs, establishing a foundation for the development of next-generation, high-speed bioelectronic interfaces.},

Our findings indicate that a topological transition occurs in response to modulation frequency increases, producing anomalous edge states with chirality within Floquet harmonic bandgaps. The open nature of the metasurface facilitates harmonic generation via Floquet edge states. Experimentally, we confirm the existence of Floquet harmonic bands and the robust unidirectional propagation of these edge states. In addition, we propose a large-scale coding scheme to dynamically reconfigure propagation paths through programmable binary states of the meta-units. The system not only provides a unique platform to explore interesting physics, it can also offer opportunities for diverse applications.},

We establish that TOC1 phosphorylation (particularly at S175) is necessary for optimal interaction with FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3) and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 5 (PIF5) at the CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) promoter to down-regulate CCA1 expression. Expression of the closely related LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) also requires TOC1 but is independent of TOC1 phosphorylation, suggesting different TOC1-dependent gene repression mechanisms. We additionally show that TOC1 phosphorylation–dependent interactions at specific clock gene promoters selectively regulate these circadian system components more acutely than nonrhythmic genes. Our genome-wide analysis demonstrates that the TOC1 phosphostate is important for optimal chromatin presence and robust rhythmic gene expression.},

Subsequently, using rJN.1, rJN.1-D130A-dFCS, and rJN.1-mTRS-D130A-dFCS as the backbones, we generated three recombinant viruses expressing a nonfunctional, soluble, and stabilized prefusion F protein of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSVF).

However, rJN.1-mTRS-D130A-dFCS-RSVF was poorly immunogenic.

Yet, their role extends beyond that of a simple surfactant; otherwise, exogenous surfactant therapy would fully restore compliance in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by increasing surface concentration alone. Here, we show that interfacial microstructure and mechanics, regulated by spontaneous or ventilator-induced sighs, play a critical role. Using interfacial rheometry and structural analysis, including in situ neutron reflectometry and Raman-based techniques, we find that sighs enrich the air-liquid interface with saturated lipids, triggering structural rearrangements. This periodic “reset” transforms the layer into a mechanically robust, DPPC-rich film, where compressional hardening counteracts tension. These findings highlight the nonequilibrium dynamics of surfactant layers and underscore the importance of interfacial compressive stresses, not just tension, in governing lung mechanics. This mechanism helps sustain low interfacial stress and high compliance, offering mechanistic insight to guide protective ventilation strategies upon lung trauma and possibilities to optimize surfactant-enabled pulmonary treatment.},

Through integrative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we identified STK11 as a key transcriptional and metabolic regulator during M2 polarization. STK11 deficiency enhanced the expression of M2-associated markers and promoted glutamine metabolism in IL-4–stimulated macrophages. Mechanistically, STK11 deficiency led to increased FOXO1 activation, thereby promoting M2 polarization. Pharmacological inhibition of FOXO1 or glutamine metabolism effectively reversed the enhanced M2 polarization. In an orthotopic model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, myeloid-specific deletion of STK11 resulted in increased accumulation of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages, impaired antitumor immunity, and accelerated tumor progression. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for STK11 in modulating M2 macrophage polarization, offering mechanistic insights that may inform the development of immunometabolic therapies for pancreatic cancer.},

We demonstrate a microneedle device that is several times faster than state of the art, collecting an average of 15.5 mg of ISF in 5 minutes in humans with near-zero failure rate. This improvement was achieved by designing the spatial pressure gradient driving ISF flow. The influence of penetration depth, collection time, pressure, and age on ISF collection was elucidated, with Darcy’s law explaining multiple observations. A data-driven acceptance criterion of <1% blood contamination for ISF is proposed.

Using single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we captured three activated receptor states, each with distinct conformations of the gate-forming M3 helices. Separately, we carried out single-channel electrophysiology, together with statistical modeling, to relate the cryo-EM structures to the gating reaction. NMDAR channel opening involves bending of the pore-forming M3 helices to produce a transient open-channel conformation, subsequently stabilized by new interactions between the D2-M3 linkers with the pre-M1 helices and the pre-M4 loops, to yield the stable open channel.},

Multi-CBB aggregation generated rod-, triangle-, and diamond-shaped AggreBots, altering tissue geometry without sacrificing surface cilia density or inter-CBB boundary fidelity. The further introduction of CCDC39 -mutated CBBs as cilia-inactive modules enabled the generation of hybrid AggreBots with precision modulation of active cilia distribution, further empowering alterations to motility patterns. Our results demonstrate the potential of AggreBots as living tissue propellers with morphological “levers” by which modifications to tissue motility can be theoretically planned and experimentally verified.},

  abstract     = {NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain–containing protein 3 (NLRP3) has a fundamental role in host defense and is involved in diverse inflammatory diseases. NLRP3 protein expression is tightly controlled by the ubiquitin system. In particular, NLRP3 protein degradation has been extensively studied. In contrast, the mechanisms to stabilize NLRP3 protein are much less known. Here, we demonstrated the critical role of ubiquitin-specific protease 13 (USP13) in regulating NLRP3 protein stability and inflammasome activation independently of its deubiquitinating enzyme activity. USP13 competes with E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM31 to interact with NLRP3 and prevents TRIM31-mediated NLRP3 ubiquitination at K192 and K496 sites, thereby inhibiting proteasomal degradation of NLRP3. USP13 deficiency reduces NLRP3 protein expression in both human and mouse macrophages, which consequently inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. Accordingly, deficiency of USP13 attenuates monosodium urate crystal–induced mouse peritonitis. Overall, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism of NLRP3 stability by USP13 and provide a potential therapeutic target for NLRP3-driven diseases.},

However, the therapeutic potential of liver-targeted ceramide lowering remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that elevated ceramide levels in MASH patients and mouse models are closely associated with the activation of hepatic de novo ceramide synthesis. The analysis of human hepatic single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data revealed predominant up-regulation of SPTLC2 , which encodes a subunit of the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo ceramide synthesis pathway, in hepatocytes. By targeted inhibition of SPTLC2 with lipid nanoparticle–mediated siRNA delivery to hepatocytes, we reduced both hepatic and circulating ceramide levels. This intervention suppressed hepatic lipid uptake and lipogenesis, thereby alleviating MASH progression. Therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated in an 8-week methionine-choline–deficient diet-induced MASH model and validated in a 1-year choline-deficient high-fat diet–induced MASH model. Our findings highlight hepatocyte Sptlc2 as a promising therapeutic target for MASH.},

Two affected siblings presented with a range of clinical features including impaired motor coordination, muscle atrophy, foot deformities, and positive Babinski sign. Using different preparations including recombinant human and mouse NAMPT proteins, patient fibroblasts, and mouse model, we showed that the p.P158A mutation decreased NAMPT enzyme activity, leading to disrupted cellular bioenergetics, metabolic derangements, and increased oxidative stress. Moreover, the p.P158A mutation could cause synaptic dysfunction and motor neuron degeneration in the mouse model.

It depends on the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). However, to bind TrkB, BDNF requires proteolytic cleavage to its mature form. Here, we demonstrate that MMP-9, an extracellular protease essential for neuronal function, plays a key role in this process. We show that, like BDNF, MMP-9 is rapidly released in response to synaptic stimulation, and its proteolytic activity, restricted to the activated spine, can be detected as early as 2 min after stimulation. Using two-photon microscopy and single-spine stimulation by glutamate uncaging, we demonstrate that MMP-9 action is important for TrkB activation and is required for structural plasticity. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a direct cleavage of proBDNF into mature BDNF by MMP-9. Our findings reveal a critical interaction between MMP-9 and BDNF through their autocrine regulation of TrkB activation and dendritic spine structural changes.},

Mechanistic studies revealed the balance of β1 and β4 integrin signaling, hemidesmosome formation, and laminin production were influenced by eBM properties.

Quantum mechanics provides an avenue to enhance precision, but it comes with a restriction: Incompatible observables, such as position and momentum, cannot be simultaneously measured to arbitrary accuracy as decreed by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. This restriction can be bypassed by instead measuring commuting modular observables, which are counterparts to the naturally incompatible observables. Here, we measure modular observables to estimate small changes in position and momentum with a single-mode multiparameter sensor. We deterministically prepare grid states in the mechanical motion of a trapped ion and demonstrate uncertainties in position and momentum below the standard quantum limit (SQL). Further, we examine another pair of incompatible observables—number and phase. We prepare a different resource—number-phase states—and demonstrate a metrological gain over the SQL.

TPGS-RNP@LNPs achieved 59.7% Lsd1 editing efficiency in macrophages, surpassing the commercial CRISPRMAX (43.0%). Oral TPGS-RNP@LNPs promoted H3K4 methylation to modulate epigenetic states, achieving inflammation mitigation, epithelial barrier restoration, and retardation of colitis and its associated tumorigenesis.

Extending deep learning to handle higher-dimensional spectra and varying acceleration factors is desirable. However, scalability requires complex networks and more data, seriously hindering applications. To address this, we designed a network to learn data in one dimension (1D). First, time-domain signals were modeled as the outer product of 1D exponentials. Then, each 1D exponential was approximated with a rank-one Hankel matrix. Last, reconstruction error was corrected with a neural network. Here, we demonstrate robust 3D NMR reconstruction across acceleration factors (2 to 33) using one trained network. In addition, we find that reconstruction of 4D NMR is possible with artificial intelligence. This work opens an avenue for accelerating arbitrarily high-dimensional NMR.},

This reduction is tightly correlated with age-associated accumulation of effector T cells, which have little to no α2,6-linked sialic acid. To understand how α2,6-linked sialic acid affects T cell physiology, we generated a mouse model with T cell–specific deletion of sialyltransferase gene St6gal1 . The lack of α2,6-linked sialic acid leads to reduced responsiveness in naïve T cells, leading to impaired T cell responses against Listeria monocytogenes infection and tumor growth. PD-1 pathway blockade partially restores St6gal1 -deficient T cells’ ability to control tumor growth. These findings suggest that α2,6-linked sialic acid is critical for maintaining long-term T cell responsiveness, and its loss may contribute to decreased T cell function with age.},

In favorable conditions, insulin and noninsulin peptides released from midgut epithelia activate foregut and hindgut enteric neurons, respectively, to sustain normal feeding and defecation behavior. During food scarcity, altered insulin signaling from sensory neurons activates the transcription factor DAF-16/FoxO in midgut epithelia, which blocks both peptidergic signaling axes to the ENS by transcriptionally shutting down the intestinal neuropeptide secretion machinery. Our findings demonstrate that midgut epithelial cells act as integrators relaying internal state information to distinct parts of the ENS to control animal behavior.},

  abstract     = {Sleep problems among young adults pose a major public health challenge. Leveraging nationwide health surveys and registers from Denmark, we investigated patterns of sleep problems from late adolescence to adulthood and explored early life-course determinants. We generated life-course embeddings using unsupervised machine learning on data from 2.2 million individuals born from 1980 to 2015. We used this landscape to identify neighboring factors of sleep problems. We observed a substantial increase in self-reported sleep problems among individuals aged 15 to 45, from 34 to 49% between 2010 and 2021, and a 10-fold increase in melatonin use. We also found relevant clusters of sleep-related prescriptions, diagnoses, and procedures with age-specific incidence patterns. Specific childhood adversities, such as sibling psychiatric illness, foster care, and parental divorce, were shared factors across multiple sleep disorders such as insomnia and nightmares. These findings underscore the complex interplay between medical and psychosocial factors in sleep.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying nanoscale protein secondary structure in aqueous solutions is crucial for understanding protein interactions and dynamics. Deep learning models are adept at predicting protein secondary structures, but their ability to model them in aqueous solutions is hindered by data constraints. Here, we present a mid-infrared plasmonic sensor integrated with a synthesized complex-frequency wave (s-CFW)–informed convolutional neural network (CNN) to address these limitations. The sensor enables direct probing of the amide I band in sub-10-nanometer proteins. By using s-CFW to amplify target spectral features, the developed physics-informed CNN achieves a mean relative error of less than 0.1 in predicting secondary structure percentages, more than twice as accurate as a pristine CNN. This method enables in situ and real-time quantification of subtle conformational changes during protein assembly, thereby addressing the issue of data scarcity that now hinders the development of advanced deep learning models for predicting protein dynamics and interactions in physiological environments.},

However, conventional E-nose systems based on von Neumann computing have encountered challenges such as high hardware costs and power consumption because of the necessity of hardware-intensive circuits and processors. This work implements low-power artificial olfactory neuron modules within a spiking neural network (SNN) to address this issue. The artificial olfactory neuron module is developed by connecting a GeSe-based ovonic threshold switch and a micro–light-emitting diode (μLED) platform–based semiconductor metal oxide gas sensor in series. The use of μLED gas sensors enables ultralow-power operation, resulting in substantially decreased power consumption. The artificial olfactory neuron module generates spike signals with low operation voltage, demonstrating energy efficiency and advanced performance. A real-time gas classification based on the SNN is feasibly conducted with an accuracy of 99.6%. Moreover, it is possible to classify different ingredients under humidity disturbance conditions through a hardware SNN.},

Here, we found that 30 to 50% of circulating Tfr in human blood have a naïve-like phenotype (preTfr, CD45RA + CD45RO − Foxp3 + CXCR5 + ). PreTfr are expandable in vitro while retaining suppressive capacity. They are transcriptionally similar to naïve T regs (nT regs ) ex vivo, but after stimulation, they gain increased expression of Tfr-related suppressive molecules such as IL-1RA, suggesting that they are primed for full differentiation into mature Tfr. Further, we demonstrate that preTfr but not nT reg are significantly reduced in the blood of patients with COVID-19 and patients with sepsis and that this loss is correlated with increased anti–interferon-γ antibodies and activated atypical B cells. Together, these data suggest that Tfr are disrupted at the earliest stage of their formation during severe disease and may be an important therapeutic target in future vaccine developments.},

However, technological solutions come with associated costs, and in small-scale societies, technological complexity reflects this trade-off between efficiency and resource constraints. Here, we analyze this trade-off and show a sublinear scaling relationship between toolkit richness and tool part richness in ethnographic societies. This result indicates diminishing returns where each additional part contributes less to overall toolkit diversity. This scaling holds across diverse ecological and cultural contexts, suggesting a general principle of optimization in tool design. Ethnographic toolkits achieve their adaptability by reusing a core set of versatile parts and selectively incorporating more specialized parts. However, increasing richness also increases complexity, and complexity is costly. We formalize these dynamics within a combinatorial optimization framework and discuss the implications.},

The molecular characteristics of infiltrating GBM cells and their interactions with brain cells remain poorly understood, partly due to limited spatial tools for distinguishing tumor cells from those in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we introduce Spatially-resolved Chimeric AnalyzeR (SCAR), a computational tool for dissecting tumor-TME gene expression in spatial transcriptomics of human-mouse chimeric cancer models. SCAR reveals spatially distinct characteristics of GBM and their interactions with TME, identifying that infiltrative GBM up-regulates creatine kinase brain type (CKB) at the astrocyte-enriched leading edge compared to the tumor core. Mechanistically, GBM-secreted CKB catalyzes the extracellular conversion of astrocyte-supplied adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine into phosphocreatine, providing metabolic support for infiltrative tumor growth, which can be blocked by cyclocreatine. These results provide proof-of-concept validation of SCAR and demonstrate spatial context–dependent metabolic rewiring of GBM cells, with implications for therapies targeting infiltrative GBM.},

Here, we introduce high–molecular-weight poly(thioglycolic acid) (PTGA) that exhibits not only closed-loop recyclability but also i PP-like thermal properties, even superior mechanical and barrier properties, and processability well suited for common processing techniques such as blow molding into bottles. To circumvent long-standing challenges of extensive transthioesterification side reactions in the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of thioglycolide, which typically yielded only oligomers, we developed the interfacial chain-growth ROP occurring at the interface between the semicrystalline polymer surface and the monomer–organocatalyst solution phase, enabling the synthesis of high–molecular-weight PTGA. Overall, we show that PTGA is a scalable circular polymer that provides i PP-like properties and that the interfacial ROP method solves the challenges in typical solution-phase polymerization.},

However, whether metacaspases and purine-rich element (R-motif)–mediated defense messenger RNA translation are involved in plant antiviral immunity remains elusive. Here, we report that barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) infection activates metacaspase 4 (MC4) to cleave the RNA binding protein lupus autoantigen 1 (La1) behind residue arginine-448. The cleaved La1 1-448 version relocates to the cytoplasm and promotes the R-motif–mediated cap-independent defense mRNA translation. Moreover, MC4 overexpression restricts BSMV infection in tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ), whereas knockout of MC4 and knockdown of La1 are more susceptible to diverse plant virus infection. To counteract plant defense, the BSMV γb protein directly interacts with and inhibits the self-processing of MC4 and subsequent La1 cleavage, thereby impairing La1-mediated immune responses. Collectively, our findings unveil a hitherto unknown defense mechanism whereby the MC4-La1 cleavage module inhibits virus infection by coordinating R-motif–mediated defense mRNA translation.},

We also captured distinct oligomeric intermediates, arc-shaped assemblies with monomers in transitional conformations, representing key snapshots along the pore formation pathway. These data provide direct structural evidence for a stepwise mechanism in which monomers sequentially bind the membrane and undergo conformational changes that drive pore assembly and membrane disruption.

Here, we show that Atoh1-Cre –mediated knockout (ACKO) of Kmt2d encoding the lysine methyltransferase KMT2D (MLL4) in cerebellar GC lineage inhibits the transition of GC progenitors to GCs while cell non-autonomously affecting other cerebellar cells. Kmt2d ACKO impaired cerebellum-associated behaviors and caused facial peculiarity, microcephaly, and reduced body size in mice.

LD function depends on a highly dynamic LD surface proteome. Key proteins continuously exchange between the ER and LDs; however, the mechanisms governing the interorganelle movement and accumulation on the LD surface remain poorly understood. Here, we developed an ex cellulo tool introducing a classification of ER-derived proteins based on their different affinity for LDs. We find that proteins with higher LD affinity can effectively displace those with lower affinity from the LD surface, identifying steric hindrance as a key mechanism in regulating ER-to-LD protein transfer. Consistent with this model, we show that, during adipocyte differentiation Plin1—an adipocyte-specific high-affinity LD protein—reduces the recruitment of ER proteins with lower affinity by displacing them from the LD surface. These findings highlight lateral protein-protein exclusion as a fundamental mechanism in shaping the LD proteome.},

  abstract     = {DNA digital storage features high storage density, low power consumption, and extended digital recovery time. However, conventional DNA preservation methods suffer from limitations like low DNA loading and complex recovery processes. In this study, we develop a liquid crystal–guided DNA information preservation platform (LDIPP) assembled from diverse lengths of DNA molecules ranging from 688 base pairs to 4.8 mega–base pairs and cationic surfactants. The thermotropic LDIPP provides encoded DNA information with high density loading, thermoplasticity, antimicrobial, and anti-enzymatic properties. Notably, DNA information was nondestructively recovered by manipulating the assembly structure using specific salt solutions and bioamplified through microbial fermentation. By mineralizing inorganic crystals on LDIPP, the preservation lifetime is expected to be increased by nearly an order of magnitude at −20°C. The LDIPP platform offers enhanced DNA data loading, nondestructive recovery, and customizable macroscopic features, making it a promising option for long-term information preservation in the rapidly advancing field of DNA storage.},

Traditional probes using “add-on” strategies often suffer from mechanical rigidity, compromised electrical performance, and insufficient biocompatibility, limiting their clinical applicability. In this study, we present a method for the direct laser writing of electrode arrays onto the curved surface of optical fibers, integrating them within a biocompatible polymer coating to create monolithic neural probes. The monolithic probes demonstrate high mechanical bending endurance, stable impedance, and improved biocompatibility, resulting in a lower inflammatory response compared to conventional systems. Furthermore, our method facilitates the multilayer integration of multilayer electrodes onto optical fibers, enabling high-density electrical readout channels. This advancement represents substantial progress in neuroengineering, with promising implications for future neural monitoring and modulation applications.},

  abstract     = {The lysosome integrates anabolic signaling and nutrient sensing to regulate intracellular growth pathways. The leucine-rich repeat–containing 8 (LRRC8) channel complex forms a lysosomal anion channel and regulates PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, skeletal muscle differentiation, growth, and systemic glucose metabolism. Here, we define the endogenous LRRC8 subunits localized to a subset of lysosomes in differentiated myotubes. We show that LRRC8A affects leucine-stimulated mTOR; lysosome size; number; pH; expression of lysosomal proteins LAMP2, P62, and LC3B; and lysosomal function. Mutating an LRRC8A lysosomal targeting dileucine motif sequence (LRRC8A-L706A;L707A) in myotubes recapitulates the abnormal AKT signaling and altered lysosomal morphology and pH observed in LRRC8A knockout cells. In vivo, LRRC8A-L706A;L707A knock-in mice exhibit increased adiposity, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance associated with reduced skeletal muscle PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, glucose uptake, and impaired incorporation of glucose into glycogen. These data reveal a lysosomal LRRC8-mediated metabolic signaling function regulating lysosomal function, systemic glucose homeostasis, and insulin sensitivity.},

  abstract     = {Temperate phages and prophages are well-known carriers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) facilitating their transmission. In contrast, lytic phages rarely harbor functional ARGs. However, by a lenient threshold search strategy combined with a machine learning approach based on structural similarity, here we identified 9419 potential ARGs within lytic phages. We showed that potential trimethoprim-resistance dihydrofolate reductase ( dfrA ) genes enriched in lytic phages could confer trimethoprim resistance to Escherichia coli . Sequence analysis revealed that lytic phages rarely transfer these potential dfrA genes into their bacterial hosts. Functional studies showed that these dfrA genes not only enhance phage reproduction in the presence of trimethoprim but also promote bacterial growth during phage infection. These results highlight that abundant functional ARGs were selected in evolution to improve lytic phage reproduction by promoting bacterial growth during infection, suggesting that dfrA genes play important roles in evolutionary mutualism between lytic phages and their hosts.},

  abstract     = {Genetic variants can have sex-specific, sex-biased, or sexually antagonistic fitness effects, yet their roles in fitness-related traits remain unclear. Using pooled phenotype sorting and sequencing of male Drosophila melanogaster from natural populations, we identified starvation resistance–associated variants, many in regulatory regions or altering protein sequences. RNA interference experiments showed that 85.7% (66 of 77) of the candidate genes with nonlethal knockdown effects influenced starvation resistance. Of these, 49 had sex-dependent effects, including 12 with sexually antagonistic effects—all increasing resistance in females but decreasing it in males. These patterns were not explained by sex-biased expression or knockdown efficiency. Analysis of the Lnk gene revealed that both nonsynonymous mutations and expression changes had sex-dependent effects. Our findings indicate that polygenic architecture, sex-dependent effects, and pleiotropy jointly shape evolutionary outcomes and that some variants maintained by these forces may enable rapid responses to environmental change.},

Peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors (PPARs) are leading targets to modulate AT MΦ phenotype. Here, we developed a dextran-based nanomedicine that delivers PPARα/γ agonists to AT MΦs and improves obesity and diabetic phenotypes in vivo. Within 1 week of treatment, AT MΦs decreased and became lipid laden, while extracellular vesicles secreted from AT decreased and reduced in lipid content. Within 2 weeks, glucose tolerance returned to levels of lean controls, followed by weight loss and reduced food intake. After 4 weeks, AT browning and amelioration of hepatic steatosis were evident. The physiological shifts were reproducible in three rodent models of obesity, spanning sexes and gonadal status. Effects were enhanced for the targeted nanomedicine compared with free drugs at equivalent doses, supporting the hypothesis that targeted PPAR activation in AT MΦs benefits systemic metabolism.},

  abstract     = {Aging drives cognitive decline in the adult brain with unclear mechanisms. Previously, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), the source cells of myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system, have been linked to brain aging by their compromised differentiation and regeneration capability. Whether a myelination-independent function of OPCs is involved in brain aging remains unknown. In this study, we herein report a myelination-independent role of OPCs in exaggerating cognitive decline in the aging brain via suppressing neuronal plasticity. Our results demonstrate that macroautophagic flux declines in aged OPCs. Inactivation of autophagy promotes the senescence of OPCs, which activates C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3)/CCL5–C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 signaling. Through this, autophagy-defective OPCs impair glutamatergic transmission, neuronal excitability, and long-term potentiation, exaggerating the cognitive decline in the aging brain. Our study demonstrates a myelination-independent role of OPCs in brain aging and identifies that a declined autophagy in OPCs is a pivotal factor in driving aging-associated cognitive decline.},
