  abstract     = {Mosquitoes have a substantial impact on human and animal health, but their deeper evolutionary relationships have been difficult to resolve. We inferred a time-calibrated phylogenetic history of mosquitoes using conserved genome-wide markers from representatives of major lineages. Our analyses revealed that codon bias and positive selection in subfamily Anophelinae contributed to a substantial level of branch attraction bias between Anophelinae and outgroup taxa, which in our view has misled previous phylogenetic analyses of mosquitoes. Accounting for this systematic phylogenetic bias led to a revised view of mosquito evolution, including the nonmonophyly of subfamily Culicinae. Similarly, we dated the origin of mosquitoes to the mid-Cretaceous (~106 Mya) and most extant genera to after the KPg boundary <66 Mya, 100 My younger than previous estimates and coincident with the origin of Plasmodium parasites. Our study provides a foundation for future analyses of the evolution of mosquito-borne disease.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive differences in the thermal stabilities of enzyme structure and function play critical roles in establishing the thermal optima and limits of all organisms. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying these adaptations can yield insights into protein structure–function relationships, protein evolution, and the consequences of temperature shifts on species distributions. Past studies have suggested that only a small number of amino acid substitutions are needed for adaptive change, but whether similar sites in the sequence, which we term thermal adaptation–related sequence sites (TRSS), and similar changes in amino acid content at these TRSS occur across widely different taxa remains to be elucidated. For detecting TRSS among orthologs of species adapted to a wide range of temperatures, we investigated 277 lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) orthologs in marine fish from diverse habitats. We validated the importance of several TRSS variants using site-directed mutagenesis on zebrafish LDH-A, effectively recreating the variants in the zebrafish ortholog. Our results indicate that enzyme thermal adaptation arises primarily from a few substitutions that influence hydrophobicity in functionally important regions of secondary structures. These findings reveal striking convergence in the sites (the TRSS) of temperature-adaptive evolution of LDH-As and provide insights into the types of amino acid substitutions that foster adaptation to temperature. Furthermore, the patterns of convergent evolution identified in this study supported development of a deep learning model for predicting thermal limits. This model can provide an important tool for predicting thermal ranges of species and the potential effects of temperature change on distribution patterns.},

  abstract     = {Cutting onions often leads to tear-inducing aerosol release, yet the underlying mechanics remain poorly understood. In this work, via high-speed characterizations, we show that droplet formation occurs via a two-stage process: an initial high-speed outburst followed by slower ligament fragmentation. By systematically varying blade sharpness and speed, we find that faster or blunter blades significantly increase both the number and energy of ejected droplets. Strain mapping reveals that the onion’s tough epidermis acts as a barrier to fracture, enabling the underlying mesophyll to undergo significant compression before rupture. Developing a simplified bilayer model, we experimentally and theoretically capture the mechanism behind, with numerical calculations of the onion critical fracture forces matching independent Instron results. The work highlights the importance of blade sharpening routines to limiting ejected droplets infected with pathogens in the kitchen, which pack additional outburst energy due to vegetables’ outer strong casings.},

  abstract     = {Urbanization was one of the most significant transitions in human history, yet explanations for the rise and expansion of early cities remain contentious. Here, we propose that simple models from population ecology can integrate existing theories for the development of early cities. Using newly synthesized paleoclimatological, paleoecological, demographic, and historical data from across the Classic Period Maya Lowlands (250–1000 CE) integrated with piece-wise structural equation models, we show that climate downturns, intergroup conflict, and strong economies of scale interact to promote the coevolution of urbanism and patron–client relationships, fueling city expansion, urban institutions, and systemic inequality. In addition, we elucidate how these nonlinear pathways structure the persistence or dissolution of cities. This study underscores the importance of robust economies of scale in the development of early cities and provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the conditions that promote or hinder urbanization, offering insights applicable to both ancient and contemporary urban dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The Earth’s earliest magnetic field may have originated in a basal magma ocean, a layer of silicate melt surrounding the core that could have persisted for billions of years. Recent studies show that the electrical conductivity of liquid with a bulk silicate Earth composition exceeds 10 4 S/m at basal magma ocean conditions, potentially surpassing the threshold for dynamo activity. Over most of its history however, the basal magma ocean is more enriched in iron than the bulk silicate Earth, due to iron’s incompatibility in the mineral assemblages of the lower mantle. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations, we examine how iron content affects the silicate dynamo hypothesis. We investigate how the electrical conductivity of silicate liquid changes with iron enrichment, at pressures and temperatures relevant for Earth’s basal magma ocean. We also compute the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity, to evaluate convective instability of basal magma oceans. Finally, we apply our results to model the thermal and magnetic evolution of Earth’s basal magma ocean over time.},
