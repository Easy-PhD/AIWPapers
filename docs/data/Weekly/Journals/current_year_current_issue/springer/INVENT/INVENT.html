  abstract     = {Cutting a hyperbolic surface $X$ along a simple closed multi-geodesic results in a hyperbolic structure on the complementary subsurface. We study the distribution of the shapes of these subsurfaces in moduli space as boundary lengths go to infinity, showing that they equidistribute to the Kontsevich measure on a corresponding moduli space of metric ribbon graphs. In particular, random subsurfaces look like random ribbon graphs, a law which does not depend on the initial choice of $X$ . This result strengthens Mirzakhani’s famous simple closed multi-geodesic counting theorems for hyperbolic surfaces.},

The proof goes by constructing a nontrivial representation of the fundamental group of each of the acyclic 2-dimensional $G$ -complexes constructed by Oliver and Segev. In the first part we develop the necessary theory and cover the cases where $G=\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(2^{n})$ , $G=\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(q)$ with $q\equiv 3\pmod{8}$ or $G=\mathrm{Sz}(2^{n})$ . The cases $G=\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(q)$ with $q\equiv 5\pmod{8}$ are addressed in the second part.},

We prove analogously that the Cheeger constant of closed hyperbolic surfaces of large genus is bounded from above by $2/\pi \approx 0.63$ ... which is strictly less than the Cheeger constant of the hyperbolic plane. The proof uses a random construction based on a Poisson–Voronoi tessellation of the surface with a vanishing intensity.},

  abstract     = {Conformal dimension is a fundamental invariant of metric spaces, particularly suited to the study of self-similar spaces, such as spaces with expanding self-coverings (e.g., Julia sets of complex rational functions). The dynamics of these systems are encoded by the associated iterated monodromy groups, which are examples of contracting self-similar groups. Their amenability is a well-known open question. We show that if $G$ is an iterated monodromy group, and if the (Ahlfors-regular) conformal dimension of the underlying space is strictly less than 2, then every symmetric random walk with finite second moment on $G$ has the Liouville property. As a corollary, every such group is amenable. This criterion applies to all examples of contracting groups previously known to be amenable, and to many new ones. In particular, it implies that for every sub-hyperbolic complex rational function $f$ whose Julia set is not the whole sphere, the iterated monodromy group of $f$ is amenable.},

  abstract     = {We show that the infinite staircases which arise in the ellipsoid embedding functions of rigid del Pezzo surfaces (with their monotone symplectic forms) can be entirely explained in terms of rational sesquicuspidal symplectic curves. Moreover, we show that these curves can all be realized algebraically, giving various new families of algebraic curves with one cusp singularity. Our main techniques are (i) a generalized Orevkov twist, and (ii) the interplay between algebraic ℚ-Gorenstein smoothings and symplectic almost toric fibrations. Along the way we develop various methods for constructing singular algebraic (and hence symplectic) curves which may be of independent interest.},
