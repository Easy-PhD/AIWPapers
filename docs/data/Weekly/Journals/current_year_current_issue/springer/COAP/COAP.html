In light of this, a great number of smoothing techniques has been proposed in the literature. In this paper we present, in a unified manner, results and methods based on functions that smooth and approximate the exact penalty function. We show that these functions define a class of algorithms that converges to global and local minimizers. This unified approach allows us to derive sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of local minimizers for the subproblems and to establish a linear convergence rate for this class of methods, using an error bound-type condition. Finally, numerical experiments with problems of the CUTEst collection are presented to illustrate the computational performance of some methods from the literature which can be recovered as particular cases of our unified approach.},

Combining with the adaptive nonmonotone line search technique, we prove the global convergence of the proposed method. Furthermore, its sublinear convergence rate for convex problems and R-linear convergence rate for problems with quadratic functional growth property are analyzed.

  abstract     = {The sequence-form representation has shown remarkable efficacy in computing Nash equilibria for two-player extensive-form games with perfect recall. Nonetheless, devising an efficient algorithm for n-player games using the sequence form remains a substantial challenge. To bridge this gap, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition, characterized by a polynomial system, for Nash equilibrium within the sequence-form framework. Building upon this, we develop a sequence-form differentiable path-following method for computing a Nash equilibrium. This method involves constructing an artificial logarithmic-barrier game in sequence form, where two functions of an auxiliary variable are introduced to incorporate logarithmic-barrier terms into the payoff functions and construct the strategy space. Afterward, we prove the existence of a smooth path determined by the artificial game, originating from an arbitrary totally mixed behavioral-strategy profile and converging to a Nash equilibrium of the original game as the auxiliary variable approaches zero. In addition, a convex-quadratic-penalty method and a variant of linear tracing procedure in sequence form are presented as two alternative techniques for computing a Nash equilibrium. Numerical comparisons further illuminate the effectiveness and efficiency of these methods.},

In this paper, we shall provide a high-efficiency algorithm for precisely solving the integer programming (IP) formulations for the CNDP. Firstly, a preprocessing procedure is introduced, which can not only reduce the size of the exponential-size IP formulation of the problem but also strengthen the linear programming relaxation. Secondly, the polyhedral properties of the polytope associated with the exponential-size IP formulation are explored, providing a flexible way to derive facet-defining inequalities for the polytope from certain projected ones. Thirdly, a family of strong valid inequalities based on clique subgraphs is developed for the polytope, with both necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be facet-defining. The complexity and algorithm of the separation problem for these inequalities are also investigated. Finally, we extend our research findings from the exponential-size IP formulation to two polynomial-size IP reformulations for the CNDP. Computational results demonstrate the efficacy of incorporating our proposed preprocessing and valid inequalities into an IP solver for solving all three CNDP formulations.},

The introduction of cardinality penalty can make the model automatically generate sparse solutions, but solving the cardinality objective nonlinear program is highly challenging since the objective function is discontinuous. We first give a continuous approximation and discuss its relationship with the original problem. Second, we propose a proximal augmented Lagrangian method for finding a weak directional(d)-stationary point of the continuous approximation. The proposed algorithm is a novel combination of the classical augmented Lagrangian method and proximal gradient algorithm. We prove that the proposed method globally converges to a weak d-stationary point of the continuous approximation, which is stronger than Clarke stationary point. Third, we demonstrate that the cardinality objective nonlinear program is a better model for the facility capacity expansion problem, which can generate key capacity expansion locations to avoid the high operating costs caused by expanding a large number of facilities. Finally, a systematic computational study on two capacity expansion problems is presented. The numerical results demonstrate the benefit of the cardinality objective nonlinear program and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear conjugate gradient methods have recently garnered significant attention within the multiobjective optimization community. These methods maintain consistency in conjugate parameters with their single-objective optimization counterparts. However, the desirable conjugate property of search directions remains uncertain, even for quadratic cases, in multiobjective conjugate gradient methods. This loss of the conjugate property significantly limits the applicability of these methods. To elucidate the role of the last search direction, we develop a subspace minimization Barzilai-Borwein method for multiobjective optimization problems (SMBBMO). In SMBBMO, each search direction is derived by optimizing a preconditioned Barzilai-Borwein subproblem within a two-dimensional subspace generated by the last search direction and the current Barzilai-Borwein descent direction. Furthermore, to ensure the global convergence of SMBBMO, we employ a modified Cholesky factorization on a transformed scale matrix, capturing the local curvature information of the problem within the two-dimensional subspace. Under mild assumptions, we establish both global and Q-linear convergence of the proposed method. Finally, comparative numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of SMBBMO, even when tackling large-scale and ill-conditioned problems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we deal with batch Bayesian Optimization (Bayes-Opt) problems over a box. Bayes-Opt approaches find their main applications when the objective function is very expensive to evaluate. Sometimes, given the availability of multi-processor computing architectures, function evaluation might be performed in parallel in order to lower the clock-time of the overall computation. This paper fits this situation and is devoted to the development of a novel bi-objective optimization (BOO) acquisition strategy to sample batches of points where to evaluate the objective function. The BOO problem involves the Gaussian Process posterior mean and variance functions, which, in most of the acquisition strategies from the literature, are generally used in combination, frequently through scalarization. However, such scalarization could compromise the Bayes-Opt process performance, as getting the desired trade-off between exploration and exploitation is not trivial in most cases. We instead aim to reconstruct the Pareto front of the BOO problem exploiting first order information of the posterior mean and variance, thus generating multiple trade-offs of the two functions without any a priori knowledge. The algorithm used for the reconstruction is the Non-dominated Sorting Memetic Algorithm (NSMA), recently proposed in the literature and proved to be effective in solving hard MOO problems. Finally, we present two clustering approaches, each of them operating on a different space, to select potentially optimal points from the Pareto front. We compare our methodology with well-known acquisition strategies from the literature, showing its effectiveness on a wide set of experiments.},

Specifically, for a function with a $$\mu $$ -Hölder continuous Hessian, when equipped with a retraction featuring a $$\nu $$ -Hölder continuous differential and a $$\theta $$ -inexact subproblem solver, both RTR and RAR with $$2\!+\!\alpha $$ regularization (where $$\alpha =\min \{\mu ,\nu ,\theta \}$$ ) locate an $$(\epsilon ,\epsilon ^{\alpha /(1+\alpha )})$$ -approximate second-order stationary point within at most $$O(\epsilon ^{-(2+\alpha )/(1+\alpha )})$$ iterations and at most $${\widetilde{O}}(\epsilon ^{- (4+3\alpha ) /(2(1+\alpha ))})$$ Hessian-vector products with high probability.
