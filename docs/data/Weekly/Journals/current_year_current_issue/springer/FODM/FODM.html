  abstract     = {Given a buyback contract, the supplier is responsible for dealing with the remaining items at the end of the season. However, the salvage value of the remaining items will affect the order quantity and profit of the retailer, and the parameters of the buyback contract for coordinating the supply chain will also be influenced. In order to explore these effects, a model with uncertain demand and perfect quality replenishment for the centralized supply chain is presented, and taken as a benchmark. Then we examine the optimal order quantity for the retailer in both centralized and decentralized supply chains, where demand is uncertain, replenishment has imperfect quality, and the remaining perfect and imperfect items have different salvage values, respectively. We investigate these problems using uncertainty theory, formulate relevant models, solve them, and then present the main results. For the sake of coordinating the supply chain, we find that the buyback contract can achieve supply chain coordination under appropriate conditions. Moreover, the optimal order quantity for the retailer is determined by the inverse distribution of the uncertain demand. The salvage values of both perfect-quality items and imperfect-quality items have positive impacts on the optimal order quantity. Further, the optimal parameters of the buyback contract are determined based on the bargaining power of the supplier during the contract signing process. It is beneficial for the supplier with strong bargaining power to offer a buyback price close to the wholesale price.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty theory, established on the foundational axioms of normality, duality, subadditivity, and product, is a new branch of mathematics and it is particularly applicable in scenarios where the distribution function is not close enough to observed frequencies, a common occurrence in financial markets. Consequently, the field of uncertain finance has been actively explored and advanced by numerous scholars. This paper presents a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of recent advances in uncertain finance. Through a systematic literature review methodology, we conducted an extensive search in the Web of Science database, covering publications from January 2009 to April 2025. Our search strategy yielded a total of 162 relevant articles focusing on uncertain finance, which form the basis of this review. The study systematically summarizes the key theoretical models and findings in the field of uncertain finance. Furthermore, it provides an analysis of potential future research directions and emerging trends in this domain.},

  abstract     = {Convergence has been a topic of considerable interest. This study further develops U-S chance theory to investigate convergences for uncertain random sequences in complex systems where human uncertainty and randomness with sub-linear characteristics coexist. Building upon two existing chance measures, this paper defines two new chance measures, presents their properties and proves the relationship among the four chance measures. Six expectations of uncertain random variables under U-S chance spaces are suggested based on Choquet integrals and sub-linear expectations. Meanwhile, their relationship and Markov’s inequality are proven. Furthermore, this paper systematically presents multiple definitions of the continuities for chance measures under U-S chance spaces and investigate the relationships among them. Based on the continuity assumption of uncertain measure, a new version of Borel-Cantelli lemma under U-S chance spaces is proven. Finally, several definitions of convergences for uncertain random sequences under U-S chance spaces are presented. By rigorous mathematical proofs and systematic construction of counterexamples, the relationships among different types of convergences are illustrated.},

  abstract     = {This research introduces a novel contribution to the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) field by addressing fuzzy demands, soft time windows, and recharging at demand points. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model that incorporates uncertainties in demand levels and allows flexibility in time windows with a penalty for its violation. LINGO software is utilized to solve the proposed model. To assess the effect of fuzzy demand, a parametric analysis is conducted by varying the fuzzy demand parameters using lexicographic fuzzy method implemented by LINGO. The model’s validity and effectiveness are verified using Solomon’s benchmark dataset, and further applied to a case study from the Egyptian local market. The solutions obtained are evaluated based on total costs incurred and total CO2 emissions. By analyzing the resulting solutions, managerial implications are deduced, providing a framework for decision-makers in electric vehicle fleet management. Recommendations are made to decision makers on fuzzy demand modeling techniques, charging infrastructure, pricing and incentive strategies, and management systems. This study contributes to the advancement of EVRP research, offering practical solutions for real-world transportation planning and logistics management.},

  abstract     = {Portfolio selection problems, considering returns of the securities as uncertain variables, are an important area of contemporary research. In this line, linear and zigzag uncertainty distributions are popularly being used. These distributions contain two and three parameters, a, b and a, b, c, respectively. In this paper, two families of uncertainty distributions containing one arbitrary constant each have been introduced, and the properties are studied. Linear and zigzag uncertainty distributions then become a particular member of the respective family. This is achieved by introducing the arbitrary constants h and k, $$0 \le h< 1,~0<k<1$$ , representing the values of the cumulative uncertainty level at a (for linear) and b (for zigzag). Then, by varying the values of h and k, that is, by changing the slope(s) of the line segment(s), one can fit different distributions having one or two line segments. The newly introduced families have been successfully applied to model and solve portfolio selection problems in an uncertain environment. The solution that fulfills the investor’s requirements may then be chosen. The proposed method of solution has been illustrated by a numerical example. In constructing portfolio selection problems, we considered the adjustment of securities and the transaction costs involved. The solutions obtained for optimal returns and risks for different values of the arbitrary constants are compared.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses a portfolio optimization problem characterized by uncertain returns. In this context, the returns of risky assets are viewed as uncertain variables, estimated by experienced experts. Initially, a mean-Conditional Value at Risk-entropy model is proposed for the uncertain portfolio optimization problem, considering four criteria: return, risk, liquidity, and the diversification degree of the portfolio. In this model, investment return is determined by the uncertain expected value, investment risk is represented by uncertain Conditional Value at Risk, and entropy is used to measure the diversification degree of the portfolio. Furthermore, our model differs from previous bi-objective optimization models by integrating both maximum return and minimum risk into a single objective form through the introduction of a risk aversion factor and the removal of dimensional influences caused by different units via a normalization method. Subsequently, several auxiliary portfolio selection models are converted into different equivalent deterministic models. Utilizing a neural network strategy with reducing dimension and complexity, the resulting single-objective optimization problem is solved. Based on Lyapunov theory, the proposed model is proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov and globally convergent to an exact optimal solution of the achieved mathematical programming problem for different weight values. The efficient frontier (Pareto Optimal Solution) is also provided using different weight values. Additionally, these algorithms determine an approximation of the set of efficient elements and diversify the solutions along the Pareto front. Computer simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed model.},
