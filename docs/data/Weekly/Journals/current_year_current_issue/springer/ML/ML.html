  abstract     = {Causality has become a fundamental approach for explaining the relationships between events, phenomena, and outcomes in various fields of study. It has invaded various fields and applications, such as medicine, healthcare, economics, finance, fraud detection, cybersecurity, education, public policy, recommender systems, anomaly detection, robotics, control, sociology, marketing, and advertising. In this paper, we survey its development over the past five decades, shedding light on the differences between causality and other approaches, as well as the preconditions for using it. Furthermore, the paper illustrates how causality interacts with new approaches such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Generative AI (GAI), Machine and Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Fuzzy Logic. We study the impact of causality on various fields, its contribution, and its interaction with state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, the paper exemplifies the trustworthiness and explainability of causality models. We offer several ways to evaluate causality models and discuss future directions.},

  abstract     = {In supervised machine learning, models are typically trained using data with hard labels, i.e., definite assignments of class membership. This traditional approach, however, does not take the inherent uncertainty in these labels into account. We investigate whether incorporating label uncertainty, represented for each instance as a discrete probability distribution over the class labels, known as a soft label, improves the predictive performance of classification models, focusing on tabular data. We first demonstrate the potential value of soft label learning (SLL) for estimating model parameters in a simulation experiment, particularly for limited sample sizes and imbalanced data. Subsequently, we compare the performance of various wrapper methods for learning from both hard and soft labels using identical base classifiers. On real-world-inspired synthetic data with clean labels, the SLL methods consistently outperform the hard label methods. Since real-world data is often noisy and precise soft labels are challenging to obtain, we study the effect that noisy probability estimates have on model performance. Alongside conventional noise models, our study examines four types of miscalibration that are known to affect human annotators. The results show that SLL methods outperform the hard label methods in the majority of settings. Finally, we evaluate the methods on a real-world dataset with confidence scores, where the SLL methods are shown to match the traditional methods for predicting the (noisy) hard labels while providing more accurate confidence estimates.},

This article investigates using Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract a small number of interpretable text features. We propose two workflows: one fully automated by the LLM (feature proposal and value calculation), and another where users define features and the LLM calculates values. This LLM-based feature extraction enables interpretable rule learning, overcoming issues like spurious interpretability seen with bag-of-words. We evaluated the proposed methods on five diverse datasets (including scientometrics, banking, hate speech, and food hazard). LLM-generated features yielded predictive performance similar to the SciBERT embedding model but used far fewer, interpretable features. Most generated features were considered relevant for the corresponding prediction tasks by human users. We illustrate practical utility on a case study focused on mining recommendation action rules for the improvement of research article quality and citation impact.},

  abstract     = {The experimental validation of algorithms depends strongly on the characteristics of the test set used. Ideally, such a set should exhibit diverse characteristics that challenge an algorithm and are present in real-world problems. An approach to examine the diversity and representativeness of a test set is Instance Space Analysis, which uses a 2D projection to visualise the test set while identifying the strengths and weaknesses of competing algorithms. However, this has the limitation of discarding potentially useful information while crowding out the space as more features and algorithms are considered. This paper describes an extension of Instance Space Analysis into 3D, which retains a higher degree of information while maintaining the explainability of the visualisation by finding the rotations that maximise the linear trends. In addition to the expansion to 3D, a new algorithm for identifying portfolio footprints is introduced, offering a more robust and reliable method for identifying footprints in both 2D and 3D instance spaces. As a case study, we present a performance analysis of unsupervised anomaly detection methods, subject to changes in the normalisation technique. The results demonstrate the advantages by identifying regions of strength of algorithms previously thought to be underpowered.},

  abstract     = {Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) contain a vast number of facts with timestamps in the real world and have more abundant semantic information compared with Knowledge Graphs (KGs). However, TKGs are usually incomplete. Reasoning potential facts in the future is a challenging task and has emerged as a hotspot in the research of TKGs. One key of this task is to dive deep into the evolutional patterns contained in historical facts, which are helpful to predict future facts. However, most of the existing models focus on modeling evolutional patterns based on the entire graph, which ignores the important role of the query-related paths. Furthermore, the existing graph neural networks (GNNs) cannot efficiently extract the graph structural information that is vital to model the evolutional pattern. In order to address these two problems, we propose a two-stage reasoning model Evo-Path in this paper. At the temporal path searching stage, Evo-Path learns a temporal-semantic policy network and employs beam search policy to obtain the clue paths and candidate answers based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). At the evolutional reasoning stage, we propose a Multi-Relational Graph Attention Network (MRGAT) to encode the structural information of clue subgraphs so as to model the evolutional patterns over clue paths and deduce final answers. We evaluate our model on four public TKG datasets: ICEWS14, ICEWS18-7000, ICEWS05-15-7000, and GDELT. Extensive experimental results show that Evo-Path not only outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines in MRR and Hits@1 but also has interpretability for reasoning results. Three application case studies highlight the significant value of our model for predicting human behavior.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning, as a paradigm of distributed machine learning, allows participants to collaboratively model without sharing data, effectively addressing the data island problem. However, relying solely on model transmission still poses privacy leakage risks. Hao et al. proposed an efficient and lightweight federated learning scheme, HLX+19, based on differential privacy, which demonstrates significant advantages in privacy protection and performance. However, we found that HLX+19 has inherent security vulnerabilities and limited scalability. Therefore, this paper first designs a reconstruction attack experiment aimed at approximating the recovery of original data from the noise-added data of HLX+19 in a collusion scenario. Subsequently, we propose DP-FedSecure, a federated learning privacy protection scheme based on adaptive noise. By adopting adaptive noise, we enhance the randomness of the noise distribution, thereby improving the security of the scheme. We conducted a security analysis of DP-FedSecure and experimentally validated its effectiveness in resisting reconstruction attacks. Finally, we performed comparative experiments on encryption efficiency and accuracy. The results indicate that, DP-FedSecure achieves approximately 97.43% improvement in encryption efficiency compared to HLX+19, and the impact of security parameters on encryption efficiency has been reduced from exponential to linear. Therefore, DP-FedSecure demonstrates high efficiency and good scalability in terms of encryption. Experiments on real-world datasets further validate the high accuracy of DP-FedSecure, while we balanced the relationship between security and accuracy through adaptive noise.},

After identifying three main directions that impact the framework’s performance (the environment dynamics, the RL algorithm and the neural network used as a function approximator), we conduct an ablation study to evaluate the effectiveness of each component, analyzing several variations of them. The experiments compare three environment dynamics, implemented as Gym spaces (Linear, Local and Global), two algorithms [PPO and the Cross-Entropy method (Wagner in Constructions in combinatorics via neural networks, 2021, https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14516 )], different neural network structures (Multi-Layer Perceptron and Graph Neural Networks) and reward systems. This study was intended not only to test the framework’s capabilities, but also to identify a configuration of environment, algorithm, and neural network that can be effective when exploring graph spaces, even with a complex target. For this reason, all the experiments were executed on Brouwer’s Conjecture. We also present the data collected with the various trained models, as these interesting configurations can be used in the inference process on the problem. Our analysis shows that a proper calibration of the individual components of the framework can significantly improve its performance, suggesting effective settings for addressing complex problems and contributing to the study of Brouwer’s Conjecture.

  abstract     = {Social interactions are prevalent in our lives. These can be observed, e. g., online using social media, however, also offline specifically using sensors. In such contexts, typically time-stamped interactions are recorded, which can also be inferred from real-time location of humans. Such interaction data can then be modeled as so-called social interaction networks. For their analysis, a variety of different approaches can be applied. A prominent research direction is then the detection of patterns describing specific subgroups with exceptional behavioral characteristics, given some measure of interest. In the standard case of plain graphs modeling the interaction networks, methods for identifying such subgroups mainly focus on structural characteristics of the network and/or the induced subgraph. For attributed social networks, then additional attributive information can be exploited. This paper proposes to focus on the dyadic structure of the attributed social interaction networks, thus enabling a compositional perspective for identifying interesting subgroup patterns. Specifically, we can then analyze spatio-temporal data modeled as attributed social interaction networks for identifying exceptional social behavior. The presented approach adapts local pattern mining using subgroup discovery to the dyadic setting, exploiting attribute information of the spatio-temporal attributed interaction networks. With this, specific characteristics of social interactions are considered, i. e., duration and frequency, for identifying subgroups capturing social behavior that deviates from the norm. For subgroup discovery, we propose according interestingness measures in the form of seven novel quality functions and discuss their properties. In our experimentation, we perform an evaluation demonstrating the efficacy of the presented approach using four real-world datasets on face-to-face interactions in academic conferencing as well as school playground contexts. Our results indicate that the proposed method returns interesting, meaningful, and valid findings and results.},

  abstract     = {Multi-class classification tasks often encounter imbalanced data in real-world applications, misclassifying minority classes leads to severe losses. Although linear interpolation is an effective oversampling method for addressing class imbalance problem, it tends to generate noisy and overlapping examples. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adaptive collaborative minority oversampling (ACo-MO) method specifically designed for multi-class imbalanced classification. Different from existing oversampling methods that rely on k-nearest neighbors to select and generate examples, our method first leverages boosting to identify difficult-to-classify examples (e.g., those near decision boundaries and in small disjuncts). This strategy ensures that the minority class boundary is effectively expanded. Subsequently, we introduce the global distribution of the minority class and collaborate with the boosting iteration to synthesize examples, which adaptively adjusts the interpolation range to minimize noise generation. Furthermore, synthetic examples enable interpolation in the vicinity of the selected example, not just along a linear path, thereby reducing the probability of overlap among the synthesized examples. We validated the effectiveness of ACo-MO through extensive experiments on 23 datasets. The results demonstrate its superiority over ten state-of-the-art multi-class imbalanced classification methods in three performance measures.},
