  abstract     = {This article presents a novel pretopology-based algorithm designed to address the challenges of clustering mixed data without the need for dimensionality reduction. Leveraging Disjunctive Normal Form, our approach formulates customizable logical rules and adjustable hyperparameters that allow for user-defined hierarchical cluster construction and facilitate tailored solutions for heterogeneous datasets. Through hierarchical dendrogram analysis and comparative clustering metrics, our method demonstrates superior performance by accurately and interpretably delineating clusters directly from raw data, thus preserving data integrity. Empirical findings highlight the algorithm’s robustness in constructing meaningful clusters and reveal its potential in overcoming issues related to clustered data explainability. The novelty of this work lies in its departure from traditional dimensionality reduction techniques and its innovative use of logical rules that enhance both cluster formation and clarity, thereby contributing a significant advancement to the discourse on clustering mixed data.},

  abstract     = {The problem of credit risk data imbalance reduces the effectiveness of assessment models. Existing oversampling methods focus only on a partial sample of a few classes, resulting in a lack of diversity in the types of data generated. This paper proposes an innovative GAN variant called Magnify-GAN. The originality of Magnify-GAN lies in the fact that it is equipped with a primary discriminator and multiple secondary discriminators, each of which employs a different loss function. This multi-discriminator approach not only improves the learning results, but also enriches the feedback received during the training process. In addition, we integrate an innovative dynamic coefficient mechanism to enable the model to dynamically adapt to changes in data distribution. To further improve stability and address the common modal collapse problem in GAN, a gradient penalty method is embedded in the training protocol. This integrated strategy ensures that Magnify-GAN can effectively generate samples representing various minority classes within the real data. Compared to ten classical imbalanced sampling methods, Magnify-GAN demonstrates superior performance in precision, F1-score, and AUC values across six synthetic and four real-world imbalanced datasets. Ablation studies, visualized through heatmaps, reveal the complementary synergy between the core modules. Furthermore, a complexity analysis shows that Magnify-GAN offers significant performance gains with moderate increases in computational cost compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Time series classification (TSC) is a crucial task across various domains, and its performance heavily depends on the quality of input representations. Among various representations, the recurrence plot (RP) effectively captures topological recurrence, the unique property of time series data. However, conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) cannot fully exploit this property since they treat the RP as grid-like data. In this study, we propose RP-GCN, a novel approach that uses a graph convolutional network (GCN) to exploit topological recurrence inherent in the RP, thereby improving TSC performance. Our method transforms a multivariate time series into graphs where state matrices act as node feature matrices and RPs serve as adjacency matrices, enabling graph convolution to utilize recurrence relationships. We evaluated RP-GCN on 35 benchmark multivariate time series classification datasets and demonstrated superior accuracy and efficient inference time compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Shield operational parameters are inherently noisy and, relative to concurrent geological exploration data, contain considerable redundancy, they must be pre-processed before the datasets input to artificial intelligence models. This paper presents a denoising and compression method for preprocessing shield operational parameters, integrating it with the stratal slicing method for predicting disc cutter wear. The operational parameter signals affecting cutter wear are first denoised using wavelet transform, Fourier transform, rolling average, and autoencoder techniques. The proposed Ring-based Summation Averaging (RSA) and Piecewise Aggregate Averaging (PAA) methods are then used to compress the denoised signals, resulting in compressed sequences composed of key points equal to the number of tunnel rings, effectively matching the geological parameters expanded by the stratal slicing method. Furthermore, the prepared data were tested using the long short-term memory (LSTM) + attention mechanism (AM) model to evaluate its application effectiveness in the Guangzhou Metro Line 18 railway. The results show that data compressed using PAA not only better tracks signal variations but also allows for flexible control of the output length of the compressed sequence. The combination of wavelet transforms denoising (WTD) with PAA exhibited the best wear prediction results, achieving R2 / MSE = 0.95 / 2.21 mm. By integrating WTD, PAA, stratal slicing method, and sequence models, a comprehensive and universal methodology is established that can predict disc cutter wear based on initial geological data and shield operational parameters.},

  abstract     = {The fast and robust stochastic optimization algorithms for training deep neural networks (DNNs) are still a topic of heated discussion. As a simple but effective way, the momentum technique, which utilizes historical gradient information, shows significant promise in training DNNs both theoretically and empirically. Nonetheless, the accumulation of error gradients in stochastic settings leads to the failure of momentum techniques, e.g., Nesterov’s accelerated gradient (NAG), in accelerating stochastic optimization algorithms. To address this problem, a novel type of stochastic optimization algorithm based on negative momentum (NM) is developed and analyzed. In this work, we applied NM to vanilla stochastic gradient descent (SGD), leading to SGD-NM. Although a convex combination of previous and current historical information is adopted in SGD-NM, fewer hyperparameters are introduced than those of the existing NM techniques. Meanwhile, we establish a theoretical guarantee for the resulting SGD-NM and show that SGD-NM enjoys the same low computational cost as vanilla SGD. To further show the superiority of NM in stochastic optimization algorithms, we propose a variant of stochastically controlled stochastic gradient (SCSG) based on the negative momentum technique, termed SCSG-NM, which achieves faster convergence compared to SCSG. Finally, we conduct experiments on various DNN architectures and benchmark datasets. The comparison results with state-of-the-art stochastic optimization algorithms show the great potential of NM in accelerating stochastic optimization, including more robust to large learning rates and better generalization.},
