  abstract     = {Visual servoing using image registration is a method employed in robotics to control the movement of a system using visual information. In this context, we propose a new intensity-based image registration algorithm (IBIR) that uses information derived from images acquired at different times or from different views to determine the parameters of the geometric transformations needed to align these images. The Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) is used to optimize these parameters, minimizing the difference between the images to be aligned. The proposed algorithm, Intensity-Based Image Registration via Arithmetic Optimisation Algorithm (IBIRAOA), is robust to image data fluctuations and perturbations and can avoid local optima. Simulation results prove the importance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in terms of computation time and similarity of aligned images compared to other methods based on various metaheuristics. In addition, our results confirm a significant improvement in the trajectory of the wheeled mobile robot, thus reinforcing the overall effectiveness of our method in practical navigation and robotic control applications.},

  abstract     = {In the current landscape, there is a rapid increase in the creation of new algorithms designed for specialized problem scenarios. The performance of these algorithms in unfamiliar or practical settings often remains untested. This paper presents a new development, the multi-objective Runge–Kutta optimizer (MORKO), which is built upon the principles of elitist non-dominated sorting and crowding distance. The goal is to achieve superior efficiency, diversity, and robustness in solutions. MORKO effectiveness is further enhanced by incorporating various strategies that maintain a balance between diversity and execution efficiency. This approach not only directs the search toward optimal regions but also ensures that the process does not become stagnant. The efficiency of MORKO is compared against renowned algorithms like the multi-objective marine predicator algorithm (MOMPA), multi-objective gradient-based optimizer (MOGBO), multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) on several test benchmarks such as ZDT, DTLZ, constraint (CONSTR, TNK, SRN, BNH, OSY and KITA) and real-world engineering design (brushless DC wheel motor, safety isolating transformer, helical spring, two-bar truss, welded beam, disk brake, tool spindle and cantilever beam) problems. We used unique, non-overlapping performance metrics for this comparison and suggested a fresh correlation analysis technique for exploration. The MORKO algorithm outcomes were rigorously tested and confirmed using the non-parametric statistical evaluations. The MORKO algorithm proves to excel in deriving comprehensive and varied solutions for many tests and practical challenges, owing to its multifaceted features. Looking ahead, MORKO has potential applications in complex engineering and management tasks.},

  abstract     = {The multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is an optimization technique that mimics the foraging behavior of birds to solve difficult optimization problems. MOPSO is well known for its strong global search capability, which efficiently locates solutions that are close to the global optimum across a wide search domain. However, similar to many other optimization algorithms, the fast convergence property of MOPSO can occasionally lead to the population entering the local optimum too soon, obstructing researchers from investigating more efficient solutions. To address this challenge, the study proposes a novel framework that integrates the fireworks algorithm (FA) into MOPSO and establishes a size-double archiving mechanism to maintain population diversity. By preventing population homogenization, this mechanism promotes the retention of better solutions. Additionally, by fusing evolutionary data analysis with particle information, the study offers new individual optimal choices and adaptive parameter tuning to improve the algorithm’s robustness and adaptability and better manage the complexity of multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). The suggested algorithm is compared with several existing MOPSOs and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in simulation experiments. Standard test problems like ZDT, UF, and DTLZ are used in the experiments. The new algorithm performs exceptionally well in terms of improving convergence and population diversity, as well as demonstrating significant competitiveness for solving MOPs.},

  abstract     = {As demonstrated in the section above, the stock market place is a dynamic factor, which makes it possible for traders and investors to make good decisions based on the information acquired through accurate prediction. This research aims at improving the prediction of stock market by applying a new method to Multi-attribute Group Decision making (MAGDM). MAGDM goes through a cycle of evaluating and ranking several criteria hence enhancing the decision-making aspects further. To overcome the shortcomings of prior models, some EU and FU is incorporated by combining Zadeh’s $${\hat{Z}}$$ -numbers with Picture Fuzzy Sets (PFSs). This integration is to enhance the ability of the model to address completely unclear decisions utilizing the peculiarities of $${\hat{Z}}$$ -numbers. To compare decisions between decision-makers, we proposed picture fuzzy $${\hat{Z}}$$ -numbers (PF $${\hat{Z}}$$ N) and for their aggregation, introduced picture fuzzy weighted averaging, picture fuzzy ordered weighted averaging, picture fuzzy hybrid averaging, picture fuzzy weighted geometric, picture fuzzy ordered weighted geometric and picture fuzzy hybrid geometric operators based algebraic $${\mathfrak {T}}$$ -norm ( $${\mathfrak {T}}-N$$ ) and $${\mathfrak {T}}$$ -conorm ( $${\mathfrak {T}}-CNs$$ ) To verify the efficiency of our suggested technique, we compare these operators with the Combined Compromised Solution (CoCoSo) model focusing on the stock market analysis. Our results, therefore, show how these operators are important in improving decision making accuracy and precision in conditions of risk. This research laid down the basis for enhancing decision-making and dealing with uncertainty in different fields especially in the application of stock market prediction. The proposed methodology can be attributed to providing a systematic and a more efficient way of dealing with uncertainty which in one way or the other has an outcome of enhancing the credibility of the decision making process in the financial sector.},

In this study, we develop an innovative forecasting framework called the Dynamic Harris Hawks Optimized Gated Recurrent Unit (DHH-GRU) for the prediction of BC. It combines the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) methods. We gathered data and a training set that included the Wisconsin diagnostic BC (WDBC) dataset, which contains 569 patients with malignant and beginning cases. The collected data were pre-processed using min–max normalization, and important features were extracted by Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the process of reducing the dimensionality with principal component analysis (PCA). Decimal scaling is employed to equalize the various feature effects. The proposed DHH-GRU technique incorporated the GRU for capturing sequential connections on temporal medical information, and the optimization process, DHH optimization, is utilized. The proposed method's effectiveness is compared and estimated with various existing techniques in terms of log-loss (0.06%), accuracy (98.05%), precision (98.09%), F1-score (98.28%), and recall (98.15%). The proposed DHH-GRU method has a more predictive ability with the sequential dependency in capturing GRU and DHH optimization’s combined behaviour of hunting. This method significantly improved the accuracy of BC prediction.},

  abstract     = {Software dominates modern enterprises, affecting numerous functions. Software firms constantly experiment with new methodologies to define and assess software quality to stay competitive and ensure excellence. Software engineering uses fundamentals and cutting-edge technology to develop great software. In recent decades, Data-mining techniques and machine learning for classifying problematic software projects have emerged to improve software quality. ML approaches, especially ensemble learning models, are becoming fundamental to software engineers’ daily jobs. This work created a binary white shark optimizer (WSO) to optimize standard ensemble learning models. The objective is to identify the most suitable ensemble number for weak learners to maximize accuracy on benchmark datasets. The EM model uses 14 weak learners. Twenty-one experimental runs are performed on 15 software-defective module datasets. The optimized ensemble model outperforms the standard Ensemble learning model in AUC-ROC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Specificity. The enhanced model has an average accuracy of 86%, compared to 76% for the standard ensemble model across all datasets. The optimized model outperformed the conventional ensemble for the same datasets, with an average AUC of 72% compared to 61% for the standard ensemble. The optimized model was more stable than the standard model, with an STD of 5.53E−03 vs 7.24E−02 for the ensemble model. The WSO optimization process strengthens and generalizes optimizeels. The study suggests that evolutionary metaheuristic approaches can enhance EM models’ accuracy, trustworthiness, and adaptability.},

This study addresses this issue by proposing the idea of neutrosophic BrXII (NeS-BrXII) distribution. The primary objective is to study the statistical properties of the proposed model by providing explicit expressions of reliability properties, the expression of moments and generating function, expression of order statistics, mean residual life, mean inactivity time, stochastic ordering, income inequality measures, and entropy in neutrosophic realm. In addition, the neutrosophic model parameters are estimated using the principle of maximum-likelihood estimation. Further, the precision of these model estimates is verified via a simulation study of the proposed model. Applying the model on two real-world material sciences data sets reinforces its efficacy with the NeS-BrXII distribution proving to be more suitable for managing anomalies in neutrosophic surface analysis among other models.},

Binary resolution, among other inference rules, is crucial in automated reasoning of first-order logic, including the new conflict resolution method. Conflict resolution processes only two clauses in each deduction step and eliminates a complementary pairs of literals from input clauses. This paper proposes a contradiction separation conflict deduction (CSCD) method based on the contradiction separation rule to address these limitations. This novel resolution methodology, together with its automated reasoning theory and method, handles several clauses in each deduction step to seek for conflicts and generates learnt clauses through synergized deduction. Thus, the approach improves deduction by detecting conflicts more effectively, especially with lengthier input clauses. CSCD and conflict resolution are analyzed in detail, then how to create a practical CSCD algorithm and its implementation is summarized. We tested the CSCD algorithm to solve the CASC-26 problems and also applied it to the current leading ATP system (Eprover). Experimental results show that the CSCD deduction approach improves reasoning capability of conflict deduction method. Additionally, the Eprover with the proposed CSCD algorithm improves its performance and has solved various problems with a rating of 1 from the benchmark database TPTP.},

  abstract     = {Today, reliable power delivery and increasing demand are important issues in modern power systems. Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices are used to control transmission line parameters to increase power transfer and stability. Nevertheless, the problem of determining the optimal placement and sizing of these devices is still challenging, as the placement and sizing of the devices affects generation costs, power losses, voltage stability, and system reliability. This study proposes the Fata Morgana Algorithm (FATA), an optimization algorithm inspired by the natural process of mirage formation to optimize placement and sizing of FACTS devices in an IEEE 30 bus system with wind turbine integration. The FATA algorithm is evaluated against recently developed and improved optimization techniques, such as rime-ice formation phenomenon based Improved RIME (IRIME) Algorithm, Newton–Raphson-Based Optimization (NRBO), Resistance Capacitance Algorithm (RCA), Krill Optimization Algorithm (KOA), and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), across multiple optimization objectives: reduction in generation cost, reduction in power loss and combined generation cost plus power loss, termed as Gross cost function. Results obtained show that FATA consistently outperforms the other algorithms in terms of convergence and solution quality, offering a robust approach to solving single objective optimization problems. FATA theoretically provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation, and produces better global solutions. It practically increases power system efficiency by lowering operational costs and losses and improving stability. Results indicate that the FATA algorithm produced minimum generation cost of 807.0405 $/h, which is 0.088–0.426% less than the competing algorithms. It also reduced power losses to 5.5917 MW, which is 1.095–6.781% less than other methods. For gross cost minimization, the FATA algorithm achieved a minimum gross cost of 1366.3727 $/h, which is 0.4799% better than the next best algorithm and 3.2261% better than the worst. The results also show that FATA is robust in solving complex optimization problems in power systems, and it provides significant improvements in run time and convergence efficiency. The main advantage for readers is that FATA provides a reliable and efficient way to optimize power systems. Future work could also investigate the application of FATA in real time, as well as in larger power networks with more renewable energy sources.},

VR environments require users to wear head-mounted displays (HMDs), blocking off their upper faces. That makes traditional Facial Expression Recognition (FER) approaches very limited in their usefulness. Thus, a Deep Learning (DL) solution combined with image processing is utilized to classify universal emotions: sadness, happiness, disgust, anger, fear and surprise. Hence, this paper suggests the Deep Automatic Facial Expression Recognition Model (DAFERM) for interactive virtual reality (VR) applications such as intelligent education, social networks, and virtual training. Two main parts comprise the system: one that uses deep neural networks (DNNs) for facial emotion identification and another that automatically tracks and segments faces. The system begins by following a marker on the front of the head-mounted display (HMD). With the help of the spatial data that has been retrieved, the positions and rotations of the face are estimated to segment the mouth. Finally, the system interacts with DNN using the pixels processed by the lips. It obtains the facial expression results in real time using an adaptive method for histogram-based mouth segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) is adopted in a wide spectrum of applications in which a vast amount of data are produced and distributed to centralized cloud platforms to deliver various services. It involves smart devices that collect thousands of terabytes of heterogeneous data and deployed this to make instant decision that aids for the better performance and most comfort life. Traditional IoT architecture is heavily centralized, where it stores the most sensitive information that creates the multiple threats and security breaches as the attackers target towards these centralized cloud systems. To improve the security chain in IoT environment, edge computing (EC) was introduced to distribute the applications of IoT at the edge of the communication networks. However, these edge-based IoT are also vulnerable to many threats due to their decentralized and in secured management. Block chain (BC) technology offers a most trusted solution to resolve the security issues in the IoT-Edge computing environment. This research study presents the block chain driven medical image encryption technique using modified honey badger optimization with the ensemble chaotic systems. The proposed block chain framework uses the divergent methods that integrates differential scroll, Hénon chaotic maps and modified honey badger optimization to generate the optimum keys and high secured image data. These high secured data are stored in the block chain, ensuring the image security to be stored in edge nodes. The complete framework was experimented using Ethereum using Ganache API and Python3.19 are utilized as the major programs for designing the varied interfaces of the recommended model. The comprehensive experimentation is undertaken to assess the security strength of the recommended encryption scheme. The evaluation metrics like as NACI, UACI, Entropy and standard verification methods such as NIST standard tests are deployed and analyzed. To prove it security strength, proposed secured BC framework is compared with the wide-variety of secured frameworks. The experimental findings reveal that the suggested framework establishes a more robust and secure environment for image exchange, surpassing the performance of other blockchain-based systems in terms of integrity, robustness and security. Finally, the paper spreads the bright light of advantages in deploying the proposed framework to formulate the most secured environment in the IoT-Edge environment for medical image transmission.},

However, determining the optimal system size is complicated by two major challenges: the cost of energy (COE) and the intermittent nature of RESs. This study introduces a novel mathematical approach to optimize the sizing of photovoltaic (PV), wind, hydrogen, battery, and fuel cell systems with electrolyzers, specifically tailored for the remote area of Lavan Island. The proposed method aims to deliver electricity without reliance on the traditional electricity distribution grid, while offering a scalable solution applicable to other geographical regions. The primary objective is to achieve cost-effective electricity generation while ensuring a reliable energy supply through the evaluation of system reliability indices. A fuzzy logic system is employed to minimize the costs of a hybrid system incorporating hydroelectric, wind, solar, and battery technologies, while simultaneously calculating two key reliability metrics: the Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) and the Dump Energy Probability (DEP). To optimize the objective function, this study applies three advanced algorithms: the Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA), the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), and the Honey Badger Algorithm (HBA). These algorithms are used to determine the global optimum, with comparative analyses conducted to highlight the performance of the proposed approach. The results are evaluated based on statistical metrics, including consistency, execution time, convergence speed, and the minimization of the objective function. The findings demonstrate the superiority and the reliability of the proposed method over alternative approaches, paving the way for cost-efficient and sustainable energy solutions in isolated regions.},

  abstract     = {In current relation extraction tasks, when the input sentence structure is complex, the performance of in-context learning methods based on large language model is still lower than that of traditional pre-train fine-tune models. For complex sentence structures, dependency syntax information can provide effective prior text structure information for relation extraction. However, most studies are affected by the noise in the syntactic information automatically extracted by natural language processing toolkits. Additionally, traditional pre-training encoders have issues such as an overly centralized representation of word embedding for high-frequency words, which adversely affects the model to learn contextual semantic information. To address proposed problem, the paper proposes a Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network Relation Extraction Model Combine Dependency Syntax and Contrastive Learning. Based on the hyperbolic graph neural network, dependent syntactic information and information optimization strategies are introduced to solve the problem of word embedding concentration. Simultaneously, to mitigate the impact of noise in dependency syntax information on the relation extraction task, a contrastive learning approach is employed. After the model learns context semantics separately in the original dependency syntax information and dependency syntax information with added random noise, it maximizes the mutual information between entity words to assist the model in distinguishing noise in dependency syntax. The experiments indicate that the proposed model in this paper can effectively enhance the performance of relation extraction on public datasets, especially achieving significantly higher precision on datasets with complex sentence structures compared to in-context learning.},

The proposed model aggregates the Conv1D, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and dropout layers to extract temporal and spatial features from IoT traffic effectively.

Since these technologies are deeply rooted in the individual’s comfort life, protecting the user’s privacy and security against the growing DoS attack has become a major challenge among researchers. In recent times, intrusion detection systems (IDS) have developed a vital part in ensuring security against these growing attacks. IDS is still unable to attain the optimum categorization performance due to a few bottlenecks. The speed and performance of the existing IDS are challenged by the intricacy of high-dimensional data and the efficacy of the conventional base classifiers. To tackle this aforementioned problem, this research article presents the hybrid IDS based on the combination of stacked feature selection methods such as Random Boruta Selector (RFS), Relief, Pearson coefficient (PCE) and Stacked learning classifiers (SLF). To reduce the dimension of the data features and to select the optimal feature sets, novel integration of RFS, Relief, PCE are deployed. As the final step, stacked classifiers are used for the classification of DoS attacks. All the trials in this framework were accompanied utilizing CICDDoS-2019 datasets and contrasted with the other similar models. The validation boundaries such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score are used to evaluate the proposed framework. With an F1-score of 96%, accuracy of 96.5%, precision of 96.0%, and recall of 95.8%, the suggested model obtained a CICDDoS-2019 score of 96%.

First, an improved (I, PSO)-fuzzy rough set model is proposed, which combines the covering-based fuzzy rough set (CFRS) and the variable precision fuzzy rough set (VPFRS). Second, inspired by the idea of attribute reduction, a novel method for determining attribute weights is introduced to optimize weight assignment in emergency decision-making. Last but not least, to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, an example of post-flood rescue force allocation in urban areas is demonstrated. Finally, the stability and superiority of the method are verified through sensitivity analysis and comparative evaluation.},

Traditional fatigue measurements may miss this complicated and ever-changing state, placing athletes at risk of injury while training. This study tests the premise that cutting-edge, real-time monitoring devices improve athlete health and performance. This research aims to reduce tiredness by developing a Fuzzy Decision Support System for Real-Time Athlete Weariness Monitoring. Fuzzy logic can handle unclear performance data, making it a more flexible and advanced alternative to standard methods. Sports athlete fatigue is complicated and dynamic, requiring improved, more precise, and real-time monitoring approaches. The FDSS-RAFM model uses fuzzy logic to account for human performance and physiology. The FDSS-RAFM model assesses athlete fatigue in a comprehensive and context-aware manner. This study’s findings can help coaches, players, and sports scientists improve training programs, reduce injury risk, and improve performance in ever-changing athletic contexts. Fuzzy decision-support systems and other cutting-edge technology can improve athletes’ health and performance, adding to sports science literature. Experimental results show that the proposed FDSS-RAFM model outperforms competing models in sensitivity (97%), specificity (89%), accuracy (96%), and dynamic adaptation error analysis (2.41%).},

Therefore, a search optimizer with a deep convolutional neural network coupled with a Deep Bidirectional long short-term memory classifier (SCN-Deep BiLSTM) is proposed to handle the abovementioned issue. The importance of SCN-Deep BiLSTM relies upon establishing the spatial information and temporal features from the ECG signals that support learning while minimizing the computational complexity associated with learning from raw signals.The SCN-Deep BiLSTM model achieves the accuracy, F-score, precision, recall, and critical success index of 0.97, 0.97, 0.98, 0.99, and 0.97, respectively for 80% of model training, whereas the SCN-Deep BiLSTM model attained 0.97, 0.98, 0.96, 0.94, and 0.96 for accuracy, F-score, precision, recall and critical success index, respectively when K-Fold is 10.

These challenges influence student performance and overall teaching quality. This article introduces a quality assessment method using fuzzy set theory (QAM-FST) to evaluate physical education teaching. The proposed method extracts and classifies all the available teaching data to compute the students' performance over sessions through fuzzy rough set differentiations over partial and complete derivatives. The complete derivatives identify the factors contributing the maximum to the teaching quality, while the partial derivatives acquire the minimal influence factors. These derivatives are clubbed together through the hierarchical process to identify the precise quality impacting factors and least impacting factors to replace or recommend alternate suggestions. The QAM-FST framework offers a comprehensive, data-driven assessment ensuring the enhancement of PE teaching quality. The QAM-FST outperforms three current models in terms of suggestion accuracy (96.8%), assessment time reduction (22.66%), and total performance evaluation efficiency (16.78%).

Therefore, a feature extraction algorithm for basketball players' foul action based on attention mechanism is proposed. On the basis of ResNet50 network model, the attention mechanism is integrated to build a basketball player foul action feature extraction model. The machine vision system is used to obtain basketball player action video as the input of the model. The space attention module and time attention module are, respectively, introduced into the video slow frame rate branch and video fast frame rate branch of ResNet50 network. By making the network give greater weight to the key areas of a single frame of video, and improving the network's attention to important video frames, the best spatio-temporal characteristics of foul actions are obtained. After fusion, the feature fusion results are input into the classifier with the cross-entropy loss function as the loss function, and the probability value of each possible foul action and the tag target probability are output, complete basketball player foul action feature extraction. The experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively identify the identification of basketball players, the cumulative matching feature value of foul action recognition can reach more than 95%, and the average accuracy is more than 70%; the F1 value and stability are high, which can reduce the error caused by data fluctuation and noise; the error rate of real-time detection is less than 4.5%, the omission rate is less than 4.7%, the detection time is lower than 14 ms, and the application effect is good.},

Therefore to support such augmentation and consumer building process, this article proposes a filtered sale streaming model to improve the circulation of new launches and to project the existing products through sustainable promotions. In this process, the comprehensive transition rule for product promotions and sale improvements is defined using fuzzy mining. The fuzzy process introduces the different performance members based on consumer access rate and sale count. The rule modifications are defined using the above factors’ decrease over filtered promotions to boost the augmentation. Using the highest possible member weights over a product, sale, and consumers, the linear improvements between the three factors are estimated over the closure observed at each sale interval.

  abstract     = {Using energy storage to solve the multiperiod OPF problem for renewable energy fluctuation is an effective way to increase operation safety and reduce the cost of power systems. However, in solving this OPF problem, model-based methods cannot accurately model uncertain scenarios, while traditional RL methods cannot satisfy the constraints well, and both methods have limitations. Therefore, we propose an RL method, ERL-HC, that does not require scene modelling and can handle general forms of physical constraints. First, a constraint policy network (CPN) is proposed that corrects the output of a neural network on the basis of the inequality generalized reduced gradient (GRG) method; the outputs of this network satisfy all constraints, and it can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Second, the critic network is improved based on the IM method to increase the sample learning efficiency by improving the agent's understanding of state interdependencies. Finally, the adaptive-tuning Lagrange multiplier method is applied in the AC framework to reduce the number of iterations of the inequality GRG in the CPN and efficiently train ERL-HC. ERL-HC was tested on two systems of different sizes. The results show that ERL-HC has a better learning ability than general safe RL algorithms, overcomes the limitations of mainstream safe RL methods in handling equality constraints, and addresses the poor generalization issues of RL methods that can handle equality constraints.},

The results show that the top three indicators are Bird Prevention Funding ( $$D_3$$ ), Habitat Distribution ( $$C_1$$ ), and Dispersal Activities ( $$D_5$$ ).

  abstract     = {School operations have changed due to information technology. Personalized teaching for preschool children requires innovative and adaptable strategies for providing the best-afford experience and learning environment. Conventional teaching approaches may not always accommodate students’ learning styles. This can lower performance and involvement. The expanding variety of pre-schoolers necessitates creative evaluation and optimization methods that promote inclusion and success for all children. The article introduces a preschool teaching evaluation model to improve the students’ learning experience. In particular, the evaluation model is designed for various assessment strategies irrespective of personalization. The proposed model inputs the students’ learning feasibility and the teaching mode to evaluate the personalization adaptability. The fuzzy decision support system improves the evaluation based on the above factors. It evaluates student-specific indicators, including attentiveness, body language, and engagement, to determine instructional flexibility. The model uses real-time classroom observations and student assessments to find realistic approaches with low-to-high fuzzy derivatives. The proposed system is designed to compute the adaptability from both factors under low-to-high fuzzy derivatives. By defining the maximum feasibility range, the teaching strategy is optimized to meet the adaptability. Thus, the low-level strategies are discarded using adaptability measures to reduce personalization failures. The proposed model is verified using adaptability, feasibility, and mode improvements. Research shows that the fuzzy decision support system makes courses more adaptive and feasible in many contexts, particularly those that involve games, audiovisual approaches, and crafts. Preschoolers, parents, and teachers indicated increased enjoyment, fewer customization failures, and greater involvement. Fuzzy-based evaluation increased feasibility ratings and approach versatility. The research provides a valuable foundation for solving classroom customization difficulties in preschool settings, emphasizing data-driven, adaptive teaching techniques. This method enables scalable applications in early childhood education through fuzzy decision-making and real-time evaluations.},

  abstract     = {The manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) algorithm suffers from a fixed parameter $$ S $$ , limiting its adaptability in balancing search capability and convergence speed during different optimization stages. To address this limitation, a success-history-based parameter adaptation strategy is proposed to dynamically adjust $$ S $$ . Furthermore, to enhance population diversity and avoid premature convergence, a randomly selected individual from the top $$ G $$ high-quality solutions replaces the current best individual in the somersault foraging behavior. Based on these improvements, a parameter adaptive manta ray foraging optimization (PAMRFO) algorithm is developed. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PAMRFO. On the IEEE CEC2017 benchmark function set, PAMRFO achieved an average win rate of 82.39% across 29 functions compared to seven state-of-the-art algorithms. On 22 IEEE CEC2011 real-world optimization problems, PAMRFO achieved an average win rate of 55.91% compared to ten advanced algorithms. Sensitivity analysis identified optimal parameter settings, and further stability analysis revealed that PAMRFO exhibits higher success rates and computational efficiency among the four MRFO variants. Population diversity and exploration-exploitation analysis demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed update mechanism in maintaining diversity and balancing exploration and exploitation. In solving parameter estimation problems for six multimodal solar photovoltaic models, PAMRFO outperformed other competing methods with a 100% success rate, highlighting its superior performance in the photovoltaic field. These findings validate the robustness, efficiency, and wide applicability of PAMRFO, providing advanced solutions for optimization problems in the new energy domain.},

Owing to transmitting data through public channels, various security issues like identity leakage, man in the middle attack, key leakage and etc., are also introduced simultaneously and still challenging to be solved. Researches and practices have shown that authentication and key exchange protocols are effective methods to solve such security issues. However, most existing security protocols for Internet of Vehicles are established on the premise that the registration process is with a secure channel, which is usually not satisfied and deviates from practical applications. Accordingly, an authentication and key exchange protocol with an insecure channel has been proposed, in which the operations of symmetric encryption and XOR encryption are adopted for all interactive processes to improve protocol security. The theoretical analysis and formal verification demonstrate that the proposed protocol satisfies security properties including authentication and confidentiality, and reduces the costs of computation and communication compared with the method with public key encryption.},

  abstract     = {Fuel cells (FCs) are increasingly attracting attention for their efficient conversion of chemical energy into electricity without the need for combustion. Their high efficiency and versatility make them a promising technology across various applications. Researchers are actively exploring ways to optimize FC systems to meet specific energy needs. Among the different types of fuel cells, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) stand out as a promising clean energy technology that generates electricity through electrochemical reactions. However, accurately modeling SOFCs, which is essential for reducing design costs, presents a challenge due to their complex and nonlinear characteristics. An ideal model should be adaptable to varying operating pressures and temperatures. This research introduces a novel approach for optimal SOFC model identification using a differential evolutionary mutation Fennec fox algorithm (DEMFFA). A real-world case study demonstrates the superior effectiveness of DEMFFA compared to existing methods. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis evaluates the influence of temperature and pressure on the model, with results indicating that the proposed method achieves higher efficiency than other approaches. The sum of the square error of the proposed algorithm is 1.18E-11 followed by the parent algorithm, Fennec fox algorithm (FFA) (1.24E-09), and some of the compared algorithms. The computational time of the proposed algorithm is 1.001 s, followed by the parent algorithm FFA (1.199 s) and some of the compared algorithms. DEMFFA offers significant potential, enhancing renewable energy, minimizing SOFC's environmental impact, and improving real-world applications like distributed power generation and hydrogen integration.},

  abstract     = {Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death. Therefore, early diagnosis of this cancer is crucial for planning patient treatment. This paper proposes a hybrid Lung Ensemble Convolutional Neural Network (LECNN) architecture for the computer-aided early diagnosis of lung cancer via CT images. The proposed hybrid approach integrates a transfer learning (TL) mechanism with ensemble learning (EL) on the basis of majority voting. Initially, CNN architectures (GoogLeNet, EfficientNet, DarkNet19, and ResNet18) are trained via TL, and the resulting CNN models are used as inputs in EL. The outputs from all the CNN architectures are evaluated via majority voting to identify the top-performing triple CNN combination, which is then utilized in the hybrid approach. The performance of the proposed method was assessed via the widely used IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset. Additionally, the impact of the elastic transformation method, a data augmentation technique, on performance improvement was investigated in the proposed method. The triple combination of the GoogLeNet, EfficientNet, and DarkNet19 CNN architectures, as part of the EL method in the hybrid approach, achieved superior performance on both the raw and augmented datasets according to the obtained performance results. The performance evaluations revealed that the proposed approach achieved more than a 5% improvement with the augmented dataset compared with the raw IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset, resulting in the highest performance. The proposed hybrid approach achieved 99% accuracy, 98.82% sensitivity, 99.48% specificity, 99.06% precision, and 98.94% F1 score on the augmented IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset. When compared with findings from previous studies using the same dataset, the proposed hybrid approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods. In conclusion, it demonstrates significant potential as a robust tool for computer-aided early lung cancer diagnosis systems and may also contribute to the development of future hybrid approaches in this field.},

  abstract     = {With the growth of the demand for wireless communication systems, when the existing algebraic model processes real-time data, the frequency adjustment is inflexible, it is difficult to quickly optimize the transmission parameters to cope with network load changes, and the long-term operation fails to effectively control the CPU frequency, resulting in increased energy consumption. To better promote the development of wireless communication systems, this article aimed to use aerial computing architecture to optimize the linear algebraic model of communication transmission frequency, to better meet the needs of today's wireless communication systems. The article first designed a communication frequency stabilization device structure to ensure high stability of the output spectrum. Then it introduced a dynamic frequency adjustment module to achieve real-time adjustment of communication transmission frequency. It then improved the data transmission rate through the design of the aerial computing perception module. This article used a frequency optimization algorithm based on linear algebra to adjust its linear relationship, optimize transmission energy consumption, and improve transmission efficiency. Finally, to verify the application effect of aerial computing architecture in optimizing the linear algebraic model of communication transmission frequency, this paper compared it with traditional dynamic adjustment models and parallel computational models. The research results showed that for packet 13, the round-trip time required to transmit the model in this article was 1.21 ms; the response time was 0.009 ms, and the total energy consumption was 89.6-W hours. The traditional dynamic adjustment model required a round-trip time of 4.92 ms, a response time of 0.093 ms, and a total energy consumption of 119.1-W hours for packet 13 transmissions. The parallel computational model required a round-trip time of 6.33 ms, a response time of 0.063 ms, and a total energy consumption of 131.4-W hours for packet 13 transmissions. The results showed that the optimized communication transmission frequency linear algebraic model using aerial computing architecture had shorter communication delay and response time, lower energy consumption, and better frequency control performance. This article highlighted the important impact of aerial computing architecture on the stability, real-time performance, and transmission rate of linear algebraic models of communication transmission frequencies, providing more ideas for the design and planning of wireless communication systems.},

Previous studies have used photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to identify arrhythmias, but there is limited research on their application for multiclass arrhythmia classification. This study introduces a Hybrid Deep Learning (HDL) model called DenseNet-ABiLSTM, which uses densely connected convolutional networks and Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (ABiLSTM) to categorize various types of arrhythmias. The model uses 1D convolutional kernels to acquire multiscale conceptual features, followed by BiLSTM to understand temporal relationships among features. The Attention Mechanism layer is presented to improve detection performance. The model categorizes arrhythmia rhythms into six types: Sinus Rhythm (SR), Early Ventricular Contraction (EVC), Early Atrial Contraction (EAC), Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), Supraventricular Tachycardia (ST), and AF. Various metrics were assessed and compared with Electrocardiogram (ECG) results to determine AM rhythms. The mean performance measures showed strong overall performance, with a mean F1 score and accuracy of 87.74% and 89.14%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The majority of daily networks and communications rely heavily on network security. Researchers in cybersecurity emphasize the necessity of developing effective intrusion detection systems (IDS) to safeguard networks. The importance of efficient IDS escalates as attackers devise new types of attacks and network volumes expand. Furthermore, IDS aims to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data transmitted across networked systems by preventing unauthorized access. Following numerous studies utilizing machine learning (ML) to develop effective IDS, the focus has shifted towards deep learning (DL) techniques as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and DL systems have become prevalent. ANNs are capable of generating features autonomously, eliminating the need for manual intervention. This paper introduces an innovative adaptive recurrent neural network-based fox optimizer (ARNN-FOX) method. The primary objective of the ARNN-FOX system is to efficiently detect and classify network intrusions, thereby enhancing network security. Data normalization is conducted to scale the incoming data into a usable format. The gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) method is proposed for selecting the optimal subset of features for the ARNN-FOX method. In the proposed approach, the fox algorithm (FOX) is utilized for the adjustment of hyperparameters in the ARNN model. The efficacy of the ARNN-FOX approach is assessed using benchmark datasets. Based on comparative results, the ARNN-FOX method demonstrates superior performance in parameters such as accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F1 Score, recall value, and precision values over existing models. The proposed ARNN-FOX-based IDS model for the network security in terms of accuracy is 15.12%, 8.79%, 6.45%, and 4.21% better than RNN, CNN-LSTM, DASO-RNN, and ChCSO-LSTM, respectively. Similarly, with respect to specificity, the suggested ARNN-FOX-based IDS model for network security outperforms RNN, CNN-LSTM, DASO-RNN, and ChCSO-LSTM by 32.43%, 8.89%, 3.16%, and 2.08%, respectively.},

This research proposes a novel fusion model for early GDM prediction. It uses conventional Machine Learning (ML) and advanced Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. Subsequently, it combines the strengths of both ML and DL algorithms using various ensemble techniques. It incorporates a meta-classifier that further reinforces its robust prediction performance. The dataset is split into training and testing sets in a 70/30 ratio. The initial steps involve exploratory analysis and data preprocessing techniques such as iterative imputation and feature engineering. Subsequently, oversampling is applied to the training set to address class imbalance which ensures the model learns effectively. The testing set remains imbalanced to maintain the credibility of the model’s performance evaluation. The fusion model achieves an accuracy of 98.21%, precision of 97.72%, specificity of 98.64%, recall of 97.47%, F1 score of 97.59%, and an Accuracy Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.91%. The model exhibits efficiency with an average processing time of 0.06 s to predict GDM. These results outperform the previous studies using the same GDM prediction dataset and demonstrate the model's superior performance. Additionally, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques are utilized to interpret the model’s decisions.

  abstract     = {In the preliminary stages of public health emergencies, many regional public health systems do not have enough medical resources to address the needs that arise from the emergencies. Additionally, due to the rapid development of emergency situations, it is difficult to accurately understand all medical material demands. Thus, we develop a multi-category emergency medical materials robust scheduling method for multi-period, which continuously schedules the availability of multi-category emergency medical materials during times of uncertain demand. First, we developed a single-period Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) model to provide a powerful strategy for scheduling multi-category emergency medical materials with little information on material demand. In the DRO model, we prioritize medical material requirements into different categories, assuming only that the means and variances of information on the demand are available to seek an optimal implementation strategy in a single period. We then combine the DRO scheduling model with the Markov Decision Process (MDP) and extend it to the multi-period Distributionally Robust Optimization Markov Decision Process scheduling model (DRO-MDP). Our DRO-MDP model provides encouraging guidelines to solve the multi-period scheduling problem of multi-category emergency medical materials in uncertain situations. A simulated experiment is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The simulation uses COVID-19 data from New Delhi, India in the spring of 2021. It is important to note that the model we propose can be easily generalized as a framework for any multi-category resource allocation problem with uncertain needs.},

  abstract     = {Suspicious event detection (SED) identifies anomalous activities in surveillance data using computer vision and machine learning techniques. However, existing approaches have high false positive rates difficulty distinguishing suspicious from normal behaviors, and limited adaptability to dynamic environments. This research introduces a novel deep learning-based SED-NET model for detecting suspicious events in public places. Initially, input images are collected from two data for detecting Suspicious events. Surveillance camera videos are converted into frames and the suspicious images are pre-processed using a Gaussian adaptive bilateral filter (GABF) to reduce noise while preserving edges. A Sobel edge detector is used to detect the fine edges in the pre-processed frames for enhancing the structural details. Di-Stream Neural Network (DSNN) is introduced with the dual-branch EfficientNet-based feature extractor that retrieves both motion and pose features. The weighted Average Fusion method is used to combine pose and motion features to classify suspicious activities using the Simplified Spiking Neural Network (SSNN). The effectiveness of the proposed SED-NET method was evaluated using specificity, accuracy, sensitivity, and F1 score. The proposed SED-NET model attains an accuracy of 98.97% for UCSD Pedestrian and 98.84% for CUHK Avenue datasets. Moreover, the proposed SED-NET improved the overall accuracy by 7.44%, 4.18%, and 2.73% better than DenseNet121, SegAD, and 3DCNN, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The hesitant fuzzy $$\beta $$ -covering rough set offers stronger representational capabilities than earlier hesitant fuzzy rough sets. Its flexibility makes it more suitable for hesitant fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making (MADM). As a result, it has become a popular research focus in decision analysis and has drawn significant attention from scholars. However, the existing hesitant fuzzy $$\beta $$ -covering rough set based on t-norms cannot handle the overlap and correlation between hesitant information well. Addressing this problem, we propose the hesitant fuzzy overlap function and hesitant fuzzy $$\beta $$ -covering $$({\mathcal {I}},$$ $${\mathcal {O}})$$ rough set (HF $$\beta $$ CIORS) models based on the hesitant fuzzy overlap function. First, we establish the definition of the hesitant overlap function and representable hesitant fuzzy overlap function on a partial order relation. Based on proposed definitions, we provide examples of representable and unrepresentable hesitant fuzzy overlap functions and offer a detailed proof to explain the unrepresentable function. Second, we construct four types of HF $$\beta $$ CIORS models and prove some of its important properties. Thirdly, we integrate the HF $$\beta $$ CIORS models with the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method and apply them to solve MADM problems. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through a practical application, and its stability and effectiveness are confirmed via sensitivity and comparative analyses. Based on these validations, our method proves effective in addressing MADM problems, offering reliable decision-making support.},

  abstract     = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the foremost reasons behind the death of people worldwide. Prevention and early diagnosis are the only ways to control its progression and onset. Thus, there is an urgent need for a detection model comprising intelligent technologies, including Machine Learning (ML) and deep learning, to predict the future state of an individual suffering from cardiovascular disease by effectively analyzing patient data. This study aims to propose a hybrid model that provides a deep insight into the data under consideration to enhance model accuracy for effectively detecting cardiovascular disease. This current research proposes a hybrid model comprising four stages. In the first stage of the proposed hybrid model, the data imbalance problem is solved using a hybrid sampling technique named Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique-Edited Nearest Neighbors Rule. In the second stage, the Chi-square is applied as a feature selection method to select the highly relevant features from the records of 1190 with 11 clinical features, curated by combining the 5 most popular datasets, including Long Beach VA, Hungarian, Switzerland, and Statlog (Heart). In the third stage, the preprocessed dataset is passed to a stacking ensemble model comprising three base learners: Random Forest Tree (RFT), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), and AdaBoost classifier and one meta-learner: Logistic Regression (LR), optimized with Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV) optimization approach, whose performance is evaluated against individual classifier. In the fourth stage, the performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and ROC_AUC score.. The comparative results prove that the proposed hybrid model scored the highest accuracy of 97.8%, 96.15% sensitivity, and 96.75% specificity and 98.6% ROC_AUC score when compared with the existing techniques and models after applying the SMOTE–ENN (for data balancing) and Chi-square (for feature selection) methods for the efficient detection of cardiovascular disease. The implementation results demonstrate that the suggested hybrid model may accurately identify cardiovascular disease among patients. It facilitates the application of robust clinical treatment strategies.},

  abstract     = {In recent studies, several machine learning and deep learning prediction models have been proposed for the early detection and classification of various stages of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Many years before the actual onset of AD, there occur several structural changes in the brain. These structural brain features can be utilized in learning the disease progression from an early stage of the disease. The various stages of pathology cause mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from normal cognition and AD from normal cognition. This work intends to develop a weighted and hybrid random forest learning model that utilizes a relevant subset of predictors to diagnose the progression of the disease. The conversion from normal cognition to MCI is identified at an early stage of the onset of structural brain changes. The importance of proposed research works lies in more early identification of significant feature that increase disease progression and appropriate interventions greatly improve subjects’ recovery. The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuro Imaging Initiative (ADNI) cross-sectional MRI data were analyzed in this study that utilized brain curvature, grey matter density, white matter density, the volume of cortical and sub-cortical structures, shape of hippocampus, hippocampal subfield volume, Mini-mental state exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Estimated Total Intracranial Volume, Normalize Whole Brain Volume, and Atlas Scaling Factor for constructing randomized trees and thus predicting the features that cause the progression of disease stages from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease that causes dementia. Based on previous studies, there is a significant shortfall in understanding Alzheimer’s disease progression from pre-MCI stages and the classification of progressive and stable MCI groups. As a consequence of this challenge discussed, whether all the mild cognitively impaired people change to AD cohorts or remain in normal cognition and identification of the structural and functional features remains underexplored. Thus, the proposed Weighted Hybrid Random Forest algorithm (WHBM) utilized the 63 features that comprise the whole brain volume. The most significant and weighted features are derived which segregate 39% of subjects with cognitively progressive MCI and 51% of subjects with normal age-related cognitive decline. This implementation model proved to give robust AD conversion probability and identify significant features with 93% accuracy and 88% sensitivity that are sufficient for future clinical inferences. The optimized model thus resulted in the prediction of disease conversion probability from Mild Cognitive Impairment to AD because of significant structural features that are key-requisite for affected geriatric cohorts.},

Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving 98.2% accuracy (a 7.5% improvement over DeepAMD) on a cross-dataset evaluation spanning 15 malware families and 45,000 apps.

However, the significant debt accumulated by these vehicles presents considerable long-term risks, including challenges to fiscal sustainability, threats to financial system stability, and disruptions to regional economic development. Timely monitoring of LGFV debt risks is essential for enabling effective interventions. This study develops a robust risk evaluation system for LGFVs by leveraging multi-source data and employing the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm. We collected and analyzed a sample of 1584 Chinese LGFVs from a major state-owned bank. Through an examination of the mechanisms underlying LGFV debt risk and a review of relevant literature, we identified seven primary categories and 20 key risk indicators to construct our risk indicator system. After comparing several machine learning algorithms, we selected the RF algorithm to build the LGFV debt risk prediction model due to its superior performance. Our findings emphasize the External Guarantee Ratio, GDP growth rate, and proportion of the tertiary industry as critical risk indicators. The model evaluation demonstrates high accuracy, underscoring its significant potential for practical application. This study contributes to the management of local government debt risks and introduces a novel methodology with potential applicability in other areas of risk management.},

This method acquires the diagnosis, care-taking, and environmental factors validated using the two levels of FDS. The first FDS handles the quality improvement and the second deals with recommendations. From the previous patient suggestions/complaints, the quality improvements are performed such that the varying inputs result in high service recommendations. The first FDS and the overall recommendations (from patients) towards the above considerations are accounted for in the second fuzzification process. This consideration assimilates the service demands and is the highest patient response for retaining the same level. Therefore, the fuzzification performs the different condition verification in the second decision-making.

To combat this, educational systems are incorporating intelligent prediction tools to help students improve their academic performance by predicting their grades. Students' demographic information, past performance in the subject, and course characteristics are some of the factors used by the grade prediction system to foretell how they will do in future. Complexity and non-linearity in the analysis of inter-variable connections pose problems for traditional prediction models. Our solution to these problems is a GGCNN, or Genetic Algorithm with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. In order to improve the accuracy of predictions, GGCNN examines educational data and finds intricate linkages. Using a graph structure, the graph convolution model emphasizes the interdependencies among academic metrics, course features, and student performance. Relationships and correlations can be better predicted with the use of this dependency metric. Use of the genetic algorithm improves the grade prediction system by optimizing the network and making better use of features. Administrators and teachers alike can find ways to boost their kids' grades through the optimization process. To test how well the system performs on different measures, we utilize the Student Performance Kaggle dataset. This continues until the convergence requirements are satisfied. With Python as its implementation, the system was able to get an accuracy of 0.98% after 100 epochs and 0.97% after 1000 epochs.},

  abstract     = {A Tenant Virtual Machine (TVM) user in the cloud may misuse its computing power to launch malware attack against other tenant VMs, Host OS, Hypervisor, or any other computing devices/resources inside the cloud environment of a Cloud Service Provider. The security solutions deployed within the TVM may not be reliable, as malware can disable them or remain undetected due to its hidden nature. Therefore, security solutions deployed outside the virtual machine are necessary. This research proposes deploying an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) at the Hypervisor layer, utilizing time series system call data and employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately detect the presence of malicious (malware) computer programs within virtual machines. The raw VMM system call traces are transformed into novel Time Series System Call patterns and utilized by a deep learning algorithm for training and building the classifier model. A deep learning model, CNN, is used to build the classifier model for detecting intrusions with high accuracy. It is capable of detecting both known and unknown malware.

  abstract     = {In today’s world, cancer stands out as one of the most perilous diseases, caused by the uncontrolled proliferation of cells within the human body. Early detection is paramount to ensuring that patients receive the necessary medical intervention in a timely manner. Recently, deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks, have proven to be incredibly effective in developing computer-aided diagnosis systems due to their remarkable accuracy in analyzing medical images. However, the process of training these neural networks from scratch is often complex and requires significant computational resources. Transfer learning has emerged as a powerful solution to overcome this challenge. This study examines the fundamental concepts of machine learning and deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic systems. It underscores the significant role of transfer learning in enhancing diagnostic accuracy. It also illustrates the various transfer learning models employed to diagnose various cancer forms, including skin cancer, brain tumors, breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and cervical cancer. This paper summarizes 151 studies conducted in recent years. In the end, the article offers a thorough discussion of the research findings, overall conclusions, and directions for future work.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vast network of interconnected physical objects that has improved the conditions for a computer-based physical world and improved efficiency. With the increase in communication in an IoT system, Internet security has decreased, and the most dangerous and sophisticated attacks in the IoT have emerged, i.e., DDoS and Botnet attacks. DDoS attacks are a serious threat to the availability of Internet services, especially since botnets can now be launched by almost anyone. In this situation, the use of an intrusion detection system (IDS) is essential to detect intruders and maintain the security of IoT networks. In this paper, a new IDS is proposed to detect IoT-Botnet DDoS attacks. This IDS is a new three-phase system, the first phase is related to preprocessing on the dataset and the second phase includes a new hybrid method for feature selection using filter and wrapper methods based on the Grey Wolf (GW) algorithm and genetics called GW-GA. In this method, the initial population is randomly selected and then at each stage, feature selection is done by both algorithms simultaneously and the final answer is compared and the best solutions are given as a new population to both algorithms and the third phase includes the use of machine learning and metaheuristic algorithms as classifiers. In the proposed method and to verify the performance, it is evaluated using the large BOT-IoT dataset. The results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the feature and also increases the classification accuracy compared to other methods, and the RF and Bagging algorithms have achieved a maximum recognition accuracy of 0.999. The dimensions of BOT-IoT have been reduced from 46 features to 12.},

  abstract     = {Credit risk assessment uses finance-based behavioural patterns for micro-lending purposes and organizations. The repayment behaviour and credit stability patterns are analyzed across varying repayment tenures and financed amounts. Due to limited borrower data and fluctuating financial patterns, micro-lending platforms have substantial hurdles when it comes to effectively evaluating credit risk. This article introduces a Collaborative Filtering Method using Lending Pattern Analysis (CFM-LPA). The proposed method is enhanced through collaborative federated learning, enabling the analysis of these patterns. This approach evaluates the return rate, credit limit, and consumer response behaviours. Federated learning processes one or more of these factors to assess diverse lending patterns. Based on these evaluations, the behavioural factor is updated for each return period, influencing the credit risk for subsequent return periods and supporting the financial stability of micro-lending operations. The model is trained individually on the identified factors, allowing the behavioural factor to be filtered. New credit risks are identified using this filtered factor from the previous return period. These insights help define new behavioural patterns for the specified credit limit. The proposed method enhances risk detection accuracy by 14.03% and improves return rate analysis by 13.28% across financed amounts. The above abstract is also graphically presented.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumor incidence and mortality rates are increasing due to unique location and treatment challenges. Early detection, robust diagnosis, and prompt treatment are crucial for better clinical evaluations. However, traditional neural network-based diagnostic methods often overlook issues such as variation in multimodality information, loss of spatial information, and under-utilization of boundary information. This study presents the Multi-View Coupled Cross-Modal Attention Network (MSegNet), a novel Transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates cross-modal attention mechanisms and a multi-view architecture. MSegNet is designed to exploit multimodal MRI data’s spatial and depth dimensions, effectively capturing nuanced intermodal relationships and modeling long-range dependencies. The proposed framework also employs three data augmentation methods, which help prevent overfitting and improve the performance of segmentation network training, enhancing the model’s robustness and generalizability. The proposed model is validated using BraTS2019, BraTS2020 and Figshate brain datasets and is compared against three state-of-the-art 3D segmentation networks. Extensive experiments, including ablation studies and hyperparameter sensitivity analyses, highlight MSegNet’s robust performance. The dice scores for the whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC) and enhancing tumor (ET) regions improved by 13. 96%, 12. 39%, and 11. 83%, respectively, while the Hausdorff distances were reduced by 3.64 mm, 2.98 mm, and 14.72 mm. These results demonstrate the model’s efficacy in enhancing segmentation precision, making it a valuable tool for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning.},

Nonetheless, obstacles such as inadequate detection accuracy persist, mostly because of varied pedestrian postures and intricate environments. This study proposes the RT-DETR-improved model to overcome these issues based on the real-time detection transformer (RT-DETR). First, we incorporate the high-low frequency (HiLo) attention into the encoder, therefore enhancing the model’s detection performance. Furthermore, we present a nonlinear feature fusion module that fuses information from various feature scales and contexts more successfully. We also introduce a novel loss function, InnerMPDIoU, to enhance detection efficacy in congested environments. To evaluate our model’s performance, extensive experiments are conducted on the CityPersons dataset. Compared to the baseline model, the RT-DETR-improved model attains a 4.2% enhancement in mAP50, a 2.0% improvement in mAP, a 2.2% rise in accuracy, and a 3.1% gain in recall.

  abstract     = {The Distributed Permutation Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem (DPFSP) is a classic issue in distributed scheduling that involves job allocation and processing order within a factory, and it is known to be NP-hard. Numerous researchers have proposed various intelligent optimization algorithms to address the DPFSP; however, there are fewer studies related to the multi-objective DPFSP problem, and the algorithms for solving this problem also suffer from poor solution quality and tend to fall into local optimization and so on. To tackle the multi-objective DPFSP, this paper proposes a novel hybrid differential evolutionary algorithm aimed at minimizing both the maximum completion time and total delay time. In this algorithm, Bernoulli chaotic mapping is applied during the population initialization process to enhance the diversity of the initial population. Additionally, an adaptive mutation factor and crossover rate are designed to balance the global and local search capabilities of the algorithm. Furthermore, a novel selection strategy is constructed based on the NEH algorithm, specular reflection learning, and Pareto dominance relation to improve the quality of the solution set when solving instances of varying sizes. This strategy enhances the algorithm's optimization ability and helps it escape local optima. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm are verified through 24 instances of different sizes. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other improved algorithms in terms of convergence, and the uniformity and diversity of the solution set, making it an effective solution for the multi-objective distributed permutation flow-shop scheduling problem.},

Drawing upon the cascade failure theory in complex networks, we employ the BA scale-free network model to construct an industrial cluster innovation network. We develop a cascade propagation model for collaborative innovation risk, addressing three dimensions: risk load, risk capacity, and load redistribution following node failures. To enhance the model, we propose a risk load distribution strategy that considers the heterogeneity among innovation entities, focusing on the similarity degree, importance degree, and cooperation degree of neighboring innovative entities. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the integrated allocation strategy significantly improves the resistance to destruction of industrial cluster innovation networks. However, under intentional attacks, the resilience of these networks remains relatively weak. Further investigation reveals that the risk load capacity enhanced by the integrated allocation strategy can somewhat fortify the resistance of industrial cluster innovation networks to such attacks. The findings offer valuable insights for risk management and stability enhancement in industrial cluster innovation networks.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic resonance image (MRI) is the primary diagnostic test used clinically for the diagnosis and assessment of a wide range of diseases. In recent years, many studies have employed artificial intelligence techniques for MRI segmentation. Deep learning methods have demonstrated potential to enhance segmentation performance. However, they still face two challenges: annotation scarcity and domain shift. The annotation of MRI is both challenging and costly, and well-annotated datasets are scarce and valuable. Moreover, due to variations in MRI machines, ensuring the independence and identical distribution between model training data and real-world data is difficult, which may lead to noisy model predictions and weak generalization ability. We aim to address the challenges through a multi-pronged approach. First, we propose a method that integrates confidence and uncertainty for generating reliable pseudo-labels. Second, we introduce a consistency learning method that employs self-perturbation at both the image and feature levels to encourage the learning of more generalized feature representations. Finally, we optimize pseudo-labels end-to-end with the teacher–student framework. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on six different MRI segmentation datasets. The results showed that our method was superior to the existing methods in DSC, ASD and HD95 metrics. In addition, we evaluated the quality and quantity of the generated pseudo-labels, and the results showed that our method generated better pseudo-labels than other methods. Overall, our proposed method shows promising potential in assisting clinicians in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {The Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) framework integrates multiple heuristic components to solve Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems through synergistic cooperation. Understanding the characteristics of these components in the underlying architecture provides crucial insights for designing corresponding methods to enhance the performance of CDCL solvers. Although numerous studies from diverse perspectives have been conducted, there remains a need to develop efficient methods and algorithms to meet the requirements for enhancing the performance efficiency of SAT solving. In this paper, we introduced two fundamental innovations: deep restart, a strategic reset mechanism that clears variable activity states while preserving learned clauses and making phase randomization, and assignment coverage time (CoverT), a novel metric quantifying the minimum—conflict count required to assign all variables at least once during search exploration. The CoverT metric provided unique insight into the characteristics of the instance structure, allowing dynamic adaptation of branching heuristics in our proposed Deep Restart-Enhanced Conflict-Driven Clause Learning algorithm framework (DR-CDCL). Experimental validation in 2021–2023 SAT Competition benchmarks demonstrated statistically significant improvements: Notably, the performance trade-off analysis revealed that while deep restart enhances solution diversity for satisfiable instances, it introduced a 2.1% overhead on unsatisfiable proofs due to clause learning pattern disruption, a phenomenon requiring further investigation. This work advances solver architecture design by establishing formal connections between exploratory search patterns and instance structural complexity. The implemented solution prototype and benchmark data are publicly available to facilitate reproducibility.},

  abstract     = {Global epidemiology of gallstones in the twenty-first century affects millions of individuals, and ultrasound diagnostics effectively assess gallbladder size and function and detect abnormalities. This study collected datasets from local hospitals and reliable online sources for analysis using advanced CV/IP tools and WEKA. Image preprocessing techniques, including cropping, resizing, and grayscale conversion, were applied to 90 ultrasound images, extracting 600 ROIs with 21 features spanning binary, histogram, and texture attributes. The dataset was divided into balanced training and validation subsets, and supervised learning algorithms were optimized via cross-validation and grid search. Circular patterns were processed iteratively, with specific dimensions (512 × 512 for width/height, 32 × 32 for radius/blur, 128 × 128 for columns/rows). The performance of various machine learning classifiers was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC-ROC, MCC, Kappa GDR, and Dice Index, ensuring strong classification of normal and abnormal samples. The random forest (RF) classifier achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 96.33%, followed by the MLP and Logit Boost classifiers with 95.67% and 95.40% accuracy rates, respectively. The RF model also exhibited the highest precision (0.9542), recall (0.9732), F1 score (0.9636), and a Dice Index (0.9649) with an MCC of 0.925, ROC area of 0.988, Kappa (0.921), and specificity of 95.34%-indicating its strong ability to balance true positives and negatives while minimizing misclassifications. The MLP classifier also performed well with a precision of 0.9477, a recall of 0.9665, and an F1 score of 0.957, while Logit Boost had similar results with a precision of 0.9411 and a recall of 0.9665. Other classifiers, such as the Bayes Net and J48 classifiers, showed slightly lower performance with accuracy rates of 94.67% but still exhibited good precision and recall, making them viable alternatives. This study highlights that the RF classifier achieved the highest superiority among other models in detecting gallbladder stones.},

  abstract     = {In skeleton-based action recognition, abstracting the human body to skeletal representations often results in the loss of crucial information, which may result in misclassification of similar actions. To address this issue, we propose a Cross-scale Spatial Refinement Graph Convolutional Network (CSR-GCN), which aims to improve action recognition accuracy by effectively capturing fine-grained features of skeleton sequences. In detail, we introduce an Attention-based Graph Pooling (AGP) module and a Cross-scale Feature Aggregation (CFA) module. The AGP module uses graph pooling to construct multi-scale skeletal sub-graphs, capturing implicit joint relationships and preserving crucial motion details. It retains global motion information while emphasizing local joint interactions, which enables a better understanding of dynamic changes in complex actions. Furthermore, the CFA module selectively integrates features from different spatial scales, enhancing feature distinctiveness while balancing global motion and local details. This multi-scale refinement of skeletal sequence representations, thereby capturing subtle dynamic changes in actions more precisely and enhancing the ability of the model to recognize and classify complex movement patterns. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method on three large-scale datasets, achieving superior accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion and accident-prone zones present significant challenges to urban transportation by causing delays, pollution, and safety hazards. However, the existing techniques do not provide real-time recommendations for minimizing congestion leaving travelers and planners with suboptimal solutions. These systems often fail to integrate accident-prone zone detection with traffic congestion management and cannot provide a real time congestion-free route. This research aims to address these challenges by developing a geographic information system (GIS)-based optimal route recommendation model GINSER using advanced deep learning techniques. The primary objectives are to detect accident-prone zones, classify traffic congestion levels, and recommend efficient routes using GIS. The proposed GINSER model utilized CCTV camera as an input image are preprocessed using an adaptive Gaussian bilateral filter (AGBF) to remove noise and enhance image quality. Faster R-CNN is used for identifying and localizing objects in accident-prone areas. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to hyperparameter tuning for improving an accuracy. A CNN-BiGRU model is utilized to classify traffic congestion levels into low, moderate, high, and congestion-free categories. GIS analyzes spatial data and traffic patterns to recommend the most efficient and congestion-free routes. The effectiveness of the proposed GINSER approach was assessed utilizing F1 score, accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity. The noise-free images using AGBF effectively enhances image quality by reducing noise leading to improved classification accuracy. PSO is utilized for hyperparameter tuning achieving a high accuracy of 95.24%. The GINSER model achieved a classification accuracy of 99.16%. The GINSER improved overall accuracy by 3.90%, 6.71%, 4.13%, and 0.70% better than TSANet, TCEVis, Ising-traffic, and AID, respectively. The proposed GINSER model offers a novel solution to urban transportation challenges by integrating deep learning and GIS technologies. Its ability to detect accident-prone zones classify congestion levels and recommend optimal routes ensures safer and more efficient mobility.},

  abstract     = {Tomatoes are the most valuable vegetable worldwide that suffer from leaf diseases, which affect long-term tomato protection. So, to protect the tomato plants from the leaf diseases, it is essential to perform appropriate control measures through early and accurate categorization of leaf diseases. Recently, automated deep learning-based methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), guaranteed accurate and timely classification of tomato leaf diseases. However, CNNs primarily capture local context features within a limited receptive field, making them effective for uniform background images. To handle complex background images, utilizing local and global context features is essential for accurate classification. To do so, it is essential to hybrid CNN architecture with other deep learning modules. This work suggests the TrioConvTomatoNet-BiLSTM framework, a hybridization of CNN architecture named TrioConvTomatoNet with a sequence module named bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). The proposed framework integrated both local and global context features for the precise classification of images with complex backgrounds. As a result, the proposed framework achieves remarkable accuracy of 99.65%, 98.83%, and 99.20% in classifying tomato leaf disease images with non-uniform, synthetic, and real-time complex backgrounds against the TrioConvTomatoNet and TrioConvTomatoNet-LSTM frameworks. Despite the fact that it requires a lesser number of training parameters and attained maximum accuracy over other existing hybrid approaches, expresses its superiority, robustness, and practical applicability. These features highlight the potential of the proposed framework in the emerging field of smart agriculture by enabling smartphone-based classification of tomato leaf diseases with real-life scenarios.},

This paper develops the circular bipolar complex intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic (Cir-BCIFL) set theory, which is an extension of the numerous existing models, such as fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, bipolar fuzzy sets, linguistic sets, complex fuzzy sets, and circular intuitionistic fuzzy sets to cope with vague and complex information. In a decision-making scenario, Cir-BCIFL set theory is considered a massive prominent and efficient tool than other existing techniques. Therefore, for the construction of the power aggregation operators, the operational laws based on algebraic and Frank norms for the Cir-BCIFL set are proposed. In this paper, we also derive the theory of Cir-BCIFL Frank power averaging operator, Cir-BCIFL Frank power weighted averaging operator, Cir-BCIFL Frank power geometric operator, and Cir-BCIFL Frank power weighted geometric operator with their basic properties, such as idempotency, monotonicity, and boundedness. Then a multi-attribute border approximation area comparison (MABAC) approach is proposed based on the developed theory. Renewable energy is the form of energy, which is formed or produced from natural and genuine resources that are continuously inexhaustible or replenished. This application goals to assess renewable energy in the European Union to evaluate the most prominent types for their usage in the best and worst conditions. Thus, to deliberate the rationality and efficiency of the designed model, we explain and discuss how to solve numerical problems related to renewable energy for choosing the best way of industrialization with the help of a multi-attribute decision-making model. Next, we indicate how the contribution of the parameters in our designed technique affects the decision-making results.

  abstract     = {Extractive Question Answering (EQA) involves extracting accurate answer spans from a background passage in response to a given question. In recent years, there has been significant interest in leveraging Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to address EQA tasks. PLMs usually function as context encoders, while GCNs are employed to capture latent semantic relationships between answer spans and the passage/question. This combined approach has shown promise, yielding notable outcomes in EQA performance. However, current graph-based methods encounter a challenge where the graph structure is predefined without sufficient justification. This graph ambiguity can potentially lead to error propagation within the subsequent graph encoder. To alleviate this issue, this paper introduces Dual-craft basEd grAph coNtrastive lEarning (DEANE) for EQA, where the graph structure and node features are context-aware and data-driven. Initially, the passage and question are represented as a connected graph. Subsequently, the adaptive augmentation strategy is introduced to generate two distinct views of the original graph via reparameterization networks, where important graph edges and node features are prioritized. Finally, a multi-view contrastive loss is leveraged to learn latent representations from augmented graphs. Empirically, our method outperforms existing graph-based approaches on six well-established EQA benchmarks. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating structural ambiguity, enhancing encoder flexibility, and improving model performance through multi-view data integration.},

  abstract     = {A key component of wireless sensor networks (WSN) is optimal coverage. For WSN to have network lifetime and optimal resource utilization, maximum coverage must be guaranteed. The unequal distribution of sensor nodes in densely populated regions contributes to the build-up of network coverage. This research suggests a revolutionary intelligent deep learning-based optimization approach for WSN coverage optimization to tackle this problem. Here, the optimal network coverage of WSN is performed by the novel enhanced deep Q-network (EDQN) algorithm, where the parameters of DQN are tuned by nature inspired optimization algorithm called hippopotamus optimization (HO) with the intention of attaining the fitness function. In order to maximize coverage, the node position is changed in the developed methodology to represent the spatial properties of the network. Along with lowering latency, the increased coverage also increases throughput and network longevity. The outcome of several network coverage optimization trials is computed, and the EDQN-HO’s impact on network coverage optimization is also determined by adjusting the parameters. The network coverage optimization studies’ simulated findings demonstrate that the suggested EDQN-HO may be effectively utilized in a variety of settings. The proposed EDQN-HO for the WSN coverage model returns superior outcomes with 18.31%, 78.95%, 10.65%, 87.5%, 83.33%, and 38.20% than the existing methods in terms of coverage rate, energy consumption, computing time, positioning error, network lifetime, and average moving distance respectively.},

In addition, in federated learning, data that is not independently and identically distributed (non-IID) makes it hard for clients to maintain personalized models.To address these issues, this paper introduces a personalized federated learning framework. This framework enhances the resource allocation optimization algorithm by dynamically adjusting the depth of model inference and the bandwidth allocation strategy, which assists devices with limited computational capabilities in completing inference tasks promptly. Furthermore, it divide the client models into global and personalized layers. Only the global layers are combined, which helps manage the diversity in data distributions. Simulation results show that the proposed FedMEM method is superior to other state-of-the-art methods, and can drastically reduce system latency.},

  abstract     = {To address the high construction cost of datasets for object detection, particularly in industrial application scenarios where sufficient sample images cannot be obtained from the Internet due to the specialized nature and diversity of objects and their working environments, this paper proposes a method to automatically generate synthetic datasets and train object detection models on them. First, 3D models of the target devices are created and rendered to ensure that the synthetic images exhibit realistic texture and detail. Next, a simulation environment is constructed and the 3D models are integrated into this environment using global domain randomization techniques. Finally, computer graphics methods are applied to automatically annotate target objects in the synthetic images. This approach effectively reduces the cost of data acquisition while maintaining the detection accuracy of the models. Several mainstream object detection models, including Faster R-CNN, SSD, and YOLO, are trained on synthetic datasets of anti-vibration dampers. Experimental results on real-world images demonstrate that models trained on synthetic data achieve relatively high accuracy. Furthermore, fine-tuning these models with a very small number of real images significantly enhances their performance. In addition, the models exhibit robustness against interference and occlusion.},

  abstract     = {During the production of an animated film, supervisors and directors hold daily meetings to evaluate in-progress material. Over the course of the several years it takes to complete a film, thousands of text notes outlining required fixes are generated. These notes are manually allocated to various departments for resolution. However, as with any manual process, a significant number of notes are either delayed, miss-assigned or overlooked entirely, which can negatively impact the final quality of the film. This paper investigates the performance of various methods for automating the distribution of review notes across relevant departments using datasets from multiple films produced by an animation studio in Madrid, Spain. Since each note can belong to multiple departments, the task is posed as a multi-label classification problem. The analysis and comparison of the results obtained with datasets from three different films, focusing on generalisation, provides critical insights for any Animation Studio evaluating the use of these methods in their process. The methods leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), including encoder-only models such as BERT and decoder-only models like Llama 2. Fine-tuning with QLoRA and in-context learning techniques were applied and evaluated across all datasets, and a cross-dataset analysis is presented. The fine-tuned encoder-only model achieved an F1-score of 0.98 for notes directed to the Animation department. Training was carried out locally on an RTX-3090 GPU, completing it in less than 30 min.},

Using CEC 2017 benchmark functions, the proposed hybrid is evaluated, and these functions’ performance is compared with the existing multiple algorithms. The statistical results are compared with the AOA, Jellyfish Search Optimization, and Harries Hawk Optimization algorithm for identifying the optimal PID controller settings considering multiple fitness functions. We consider performance indicators like PID controller parameters, rise time, settling time, and fitness values. The fetched simulation results revealed that, among all investigated fitness functions, the developed controller based on HAOARSO is the most effective algorithm for delivering global optimal solutions with less settling time and rise time, enabling the implementation on such optimization issues.

Multiple algorithms have been proposed, exploring new approaches to finding solutions for cohesive partitions of the graph. One of the most considered philosophies when defining this type of technique is the use of the graph’s adjacency matrix as input and the consideration of modularity as the function to be optimized. We propose an enhancement to this approach to community detection by incorporating high-order relationships between nodes, allowing for a more comprehensive capture of network structure. By modifying the algorithm’s input, our method improves community detection accuracy. Moreover, our proposed approach is universal, applicable to any algorithm that utilizes a matrix as input. Its value is further validated through a comprehensive set of results, comparing the original problem with the enhanced method we present. We also present a tourism case study.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of Federated Learning (FL) has enabled privacy-preserving distributed machine learning, yet its vulnerability to poisoning attacks remains a critical challenge. Existing defense methods often rely on static aggregation rules or centralized verification mechanisms, which lack adaptability to dynamic adversarial behaviors and incur high computational costs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Federated Weighted Learning Algorithm (FWLA), a novel framework designed to mitigate poisoning attacks through client-specific weight adaptation and asynchronous collaboration. The core of FWLA lies in two components: (1) a residual testing mechanism that dynamically identifies malicious clients by analyzing deviations between local and global model updates, and (2) an asynchronous training protocol that allows clients to independently upload parameters, thereby avoiding synchronization bottlenecks. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (CICIDS2017, UNSW-NB15, NSL-KDD) demonstrate FWLA’s superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, FWLA achieves 98.9% accuracy and reduces the false acceptance rate to 2.9% on CICIDS2017. The robustness analysis further reveals that FWLA maintains 83% accuracy even when 20% of clients are malicious, outperforming FedAvg and FedSGD by 12%. These improvements stem from FWLA’s ability to suppress poisoned updates through iterative weight adjustments, validated by ablation studies showing a 3.3% accuracy drop when removing residual testing. Nonetheless, FWLA has its limitations in that when the number of clients is large, it may lead to increased resource consumption, so future work will concentrate on developing strategies to reduce these resource costs.},

Key neutrosophic properties such as moments, Shannon entropy, and reliability measures of NGoD are derived. Neutrosophic parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, and a simulation study is conducted to examine parameter behavior and compare the indeterminacy between parameters. Finally, the NGoD is applied to two real-world ambiguous data sets, demonstrating the effectiveness and suitability of the neutrosophic Gompertz distribution in uncertain contexts.

Conventional tax risk appraisal techniques usually fail to estimate taxable input risks and future fiscal burdens correctly and hence are left with ineffective mitigation of risks. The proposed method forecasts the possibilities of taxable inputs and their depreciation, which results in risks over different financial quarters. The cumulative taxable input risks are updated based on the previous inputs and their claimable part to improve the risk prediction. In this prediction process, deep learning is employed; this learning model is designed with two conditional layers. The first conditional layer is responsible for identifying the taxable inputs, and the second is responsible for determining the risks due to external input changes. These two factors are combined using the previous risk factor impact to verify their existence. Based on this existing factor, the number of assessments is increased or benchmarked for further audit. The topic model accurately predicts taxable input risk by financial quarters, continuously refining risk estimates based on the incorporation of prior data. Continuous learning and benchmarking enable the model to adapt to changing tax conditions. By incorporating deep learning into tax evaluation, businesses can enhance financial stability, streamline risk management, and facilitate improved compliance. The approach simplifies business complexity and allows for more precise tax planning.},

However, the general CNN-based methods, such as ResNet and VGG, exhibit significant limitations when addressing the high degree of similarity between surface modifications and dissimilar pavements caused by changes in illumination or partial shading. To address the challenges posed by complex texture variations and surface modifications across road pavements, in this study, an enhanced method for pavement-type identification is proposed. First, an application-oriented dataset encompassing seven pavement types is constructed based on existing open-source road surface classification datasets. Secondly, the EfficientNet-Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) model is developed through the integration of a GAM module into the EfficientNet architecture. Within this model, the GAM module undergoes a process where it synergistically refines channel–spatial features, utilizing 3D permutation and multilayer perceptron operations. This enables the effective isolation of discriminative patterns, such as crack density, from complex backgrounds. Then, to mitigate inter-class confusion, a label smoothing strategy is implemented, while cosine learning rate decay is employed to ensure stable convergence during training. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high-precision recognition of various pavement types, with an accuracy rate of 98.11%, while simultaneously maintaining computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Intelligently connected automobiles have come a long way thanks to the deep integration of cutting-edge networked gadgets and advancements in automotive technology. The increasing connectivity of vehicles has introduced significant cybersecurity concerns, particularly in controller area network (CAN) bus systems, which are crucial for vehicle communication. For this, the research presents a novel hybrid model combining and integrating a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) technique to address challenges like identifying fuzzy and denial of service (DoS) attacks on the CAN bus system. The model’s efficacy is demonstrated by evaluating various cyber-attacks from the Car-Hacking dataset. An adaptive feature selection method using BFO to identify optimal CAN bus characteristics for accurate attack detection. The LSTM-based temporal pattern recognition system detects anomalous message sequences and real-time countermeasures for mitigating DoS and fuzzy attacks. Reducing attack detection time to 0.0838 s, an enhancement over LSTM-AE, suggests improving detection speed. With a higher precision of 94.6% and F1-scores of 95.8%, LSTM-BFO outperforms other models based on accuracy, precision, and F1-score under the current experimental setup.},

A fuzzy encryption search scheme and data verification mechanism are proposed in the study. First, privacy protection of the raw data is achieved through a hierarchical Mini Batch K-Means clustering algorithm and locally sensitive hash functions. Second, the study proposes a blockchain data verification mechanism that employs a fuzzy encryption search scheme, in conjunction with cloud storage and a fuzzy encryption algorithm. This mechanism is designed to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. When the number of attributes was 30, the initialization time cost of the proposed fuzzy encryption search scheme was 98 ms, which was reduced by about 51.6% compared to the blockchain-assisted sorting method. The encryption time cost of the proposed search method was 61 ms, which was reduced by about 35.6% compared to the multi-permission data access method. When the number of parallel transactions reached 1000, the transaction duration for smart contract Upload was 23.68 s, while the transaction duration for Search was 24.36 s. The proposed fuzzy encryption search scheme and data verification mechanism not only protect data privacy and ensure data integrity and confidentiality, but also have high search efficiency and low time overhead, providing better security for blockchain data.},

  abstract     = {To address NP-hard optimization challenges prevalent in engineering applications, meta-heuristic algorithms are highly regarded for their ability to provide high-quality solutions. In this study, a multi-strategy improved horned lizard optimization algorithm (MSHLOA) is proposed to overcome the limitations of the standard HLOA in terms of premature convergence and slow optimization search. The algorithm is innovated through four synergistic strategies: (1) logistic chaotic population initialization to enhance initial solution diversity; (2) dynamic lens imaging-based adversarial learning to enhance global search capability; (3) sub-linear probability decay selection-based crisscross strategy to effectively break through dimensional local optima; and (4) golden sine factor-guided local exploitation to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Experimental validation on 15 benchmark functions and the CEC2021 test set demonstrates the superior performance of MSHLOA, with an overall effectiveness improvement of 53.35% compared to standard HLOA. Statistical analyses including the Wilcoxon rank sum test (p < 0.05), Friedman’s test, and solution distribution visualization validate the robustness of the algorithm against local optimal stagnation. In the engineering optimization example, the average cost of the pressure vessel problem was reduced by 55.6%, while the optimal value with the lowest standard deviation verified its stability in terms of solution accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. These advances establish the computational efficiency and reliability of MSHLOA for engineering problems, providing a general example of an augmented meta-heuristic algorithm that offers a new, more efficient solution to engineering structural optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Overlap and grouping indices are functions measuring, respectively, the fuzzy intersection and fuzzy union of two fuzzy sets. They have been applied successfully in several fields, such as in interpolative fuzzy systems, fuzzy rule-based classification systems and comparison of fuzzy inference rules. Overlap and grouping indices can be built employing overlap and grouping functions, respectively, which are possibly non-associative aggregation functions with features that provide good results when applied to practical bivariate problems. Many studies have generalized the concepts of overlap and grouping functions to be applied in n-dimensional problems. However, the concepts of overlap/grouping indices have not been generalized in similar pattern. Since the associative property may not hold, their application in n-dimensional domains, for comparing more than two fuzzy sets at a time, is not immediate, which limit their application in such contexts. The objective of this paper is to introduce the concepts of n-dimensional and general overlap/grouping indices, with special attention to the development of their construction methods based on generalized overlap/grouping functions. As an application example, we introduce the concept of n-dimensional Jaccard index, with a construction method based on n-dimensional overlap/grouping indices, providing an n-dimensional fuzzy set similarity score.},

At first, we extend the Frank operators to PLTSs and propose the probabilistic linguistic Frank weighted averaging (PLFWA) operator based on adjusted rules of PLTSs. Further, some desirable properties of them are studied. Meanwhile, we present an innovative distance measure, deeply anchored in linguistic scale functions, designed to overcome the shortcomings of current distance metrics. What’s more, the combined weights for attributes can be obtained by the criteria importance though intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) method and the best-worst method (BWM) and the steps of the extended TODIM method for PLTSs are proposed. Finally, a numerical example for the purchase selection of electric vehicles is given, and some sensitivity and comparative analysis are used to illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of this new method.},

This field frequently encounters challenges, such as minute surface defects, a large number of model parameters, and high computational complexity. To address these challenges, a self-made SPC defect data set and an enhanced CAAB-YOLOv8n detection algorithm were developed. A CAD module was integrated into the backbone network to improve the model’s ability to detect bar-shaped features. In addition, the ASF feature fusion and RMT modules were combined to construct the ASF-CR neck structure, which enhances the model’s capability to detect small, localized defects. To expedite inference speed, the DBB-Head reparameterization module was incorporated. Experimental results show that the enhanced algorithm achieves 88.4 $$\%$$ accuracy, a mAP@50 of 90.2 $$\%$$ , and a parameter count of just 33.27 million, with a detection speed of 35.2 frames per second. The real-time requirements for SPC defect detection are met by these findings. This work lays a solid theoretical foundation for subsequent defect traceability and the optimization of printing process parameters.},

  abstract     = {Metaheuristic algorithms are crucial for solving intricate optimization problems in diverse fields. The Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), known for its efficiency and simplicity in global search, sometimes struggles with premature convergence and inadequate exploitation. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel hybrid SCA-Gazelle Optimisation Algorithm (HSCAGOA) by integrating the Gazelle Optimisation Algorithm’s (GOA) exploitation strategy. Inspired by gazelle behaviour, GOA enhances local search capabilities, improving the balance between the exploration and exploitation phases. Additionally, HSCAGOA incorporates Brownian motion and Lévy flight mechanisms to further enhance exploration capabilities. This research rigorously evaluates HSCAGOA through extensive computational experiments on 33 benchmark test problems and six engineering design challenges. Comparisons with classical SCA and various state-of-the-art optimisation algorithms show that HSCAGOA consistently achieves faster convergence and higher solution quality across diverse optimisation landscapes. To validate these results, ranking analysis is conducted using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, confirming the efficacy of HSCAGOA. Furthermore, employing the Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) method for multi-criteria decision-making enables systematic ranking and comparison of HSCAGOA’s performance against other algorithms. Additionally, a comparative analysis was conducted against renowned CEC competition winners, including LSHADEcnEpSin, LSHADESPACMA, and CMA-ES. HSCAGOA is evaluated through extensive computational experiments involving CEC 2017 benchmark test functions. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the robustness of HSCAGOA under varying configurations, including different population sizes and maximum iteration counts on CEC 2022 benchmark test functions. The findings highlight the algorithm’s adaptability and reliability in addressing complex optimization challenges. In summary, this study introduces HSCAGOA as a robust optimisation framework that mitigates the limitations of traditional SCA. It provides an effective solution for addressing complex real-world optimisation problems across different domains.},

  abstract     = {Industrial control systems (ICS) are crucial for automating and optimizing industrial operations but are increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks due to their interconnected nature. High-dimensional ICS datasets pose challenges for effective anomaly detection and classification. This study aims to enhance ICS security by improving attack detection through an optimized feature selection framework that balances dimensionality reduction and classification accuracy. The study utilizes the HAI dataset, comprising 54,000 time series records with 225 features representing normal and anomalous ICS behaviors. A hybrid feature selection approach integrating wrapper and filter methods was employed. Initially, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) identified 118 relevant features. Further refinement was conducted using filter-based methods—Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU), Information Gain (IG), and Gain Ratio (GR)—leading to a final subset of 104 optimal features. These features were used to train classification models (Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) with a 70:30 train-test split and tenfold cross-validation. The proposed feature selection method significantly improved classification accuracy, achieving 98.86% (NB), 99.91% (RF), and 97.97% (SVM). Compared to the full dataset (225 features), which yielded 97.51%, 99.93%, and 96.17%, respectively, our optimized feature subset maintained or enhanced classification performance while reducing computational complexity. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of a hybrid feature selection approach in improving ICS anomaly detection. By reducing feature dimensionality without compromising accuracy, the proposed method enhances ICS security, offering a scalable and efficient solution for real-time attack detection.},

Due to the interaction of multiple constraints, the constrained Pareto fronts (CPFs) exhibit various complex characteristics, e.g., degeneracy, discontinuity or irregularity. Most algorithms achieve poor convergence and diversity performance on these problems. Therefore, we proposed a coevolutionary framework based on constraints decomposition to solve complex CMOPs. Specifically, this framework decomposes the CMOP into multiple help subproblems with a single constraint, thereby decoupling the complex constraints. Then, multiple subpopulations optimize these subproblems to assist in solving the original problem. In addition, a two-stage strategy is used to fully utilize the auxiliary populations to search for feasible solutions. In addition, an evolutionary state detection strategy based on historical information is proposed, which is used to determine whether the evolution moves to the next stage. The framework can take the advantage of the low complexity of single-constraint problems to help algorithm search the complete feasible regions. Experiments on benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm is competitive with eight other most representative constrained evolutionary algorithms in terms of convergence and diversity performance.},

The method comprises five key processes: (1) Evaluation process: Based on the constructed multicriteria evaluation system for airport site selection, the q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy (q-ROF) information is employed to represent evaluations from large-scale decision makers, which effectively characterizes the uncertainty of information and broadens the evaluative scope. (2) Clustering process: A clustering procedure is designed for large-scale q-ROF evaluation data and weight information of criteria, identifying and removing outliers. (3) Consensus reaching process: Considering the characteristics of q-ROF evaluations and multiplicative preference relations, two adaptive consensus reaching algorithms are developed to enhance group consensus levels, thereby improving the rationality of decision-making results. (4) Weight determination process: Criteria and subcriteria weights are calculated using multiplicative preference weighting approach and a deviation maximization model, respectively, derived from aggregated group evaluations. (5) Ranking process: The q-ROF Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is applied, in conjunction with the induced q-ROF information integration paradigm, to comprehensively rank the alternative sites. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated through a case study of civil aviation branch airport planning in a specific city.},

By doing so, the generated adversarial example is designed to deceive the targeted model into interpreting it as a modified sentence, where the specified phrase has been altered. This method offers advantages compared to existing techniques, including reduced distortion since noise is only added to the targeted area, and the ability for the attacker to selectively modify or add specific words as desired. The experimental evaluation utilized the Mozilla Common Voice dataset. The results demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated using the proposed method, which only transform the specified word or phrase by adding noise to that specific region, can successfully fool the speech recognition system into misclassifying them as the intended target sentence.},

  abstract     = {In the real world, much fuzzy data is described by evaluative linguistic expressions, which typically exhibit dynamic and changing characteristics. To tackle the challenges of dynamic fuzzy knowledge acquisition and reasoning in uncertain environments, this paper proposes an incomplete dynamic fuzzy linguistic reasoning approach based on concept lattices. First, the dynamic fuzzy linguistic concept lattice is constructed based on dynamic fuzzy linguistic formal context, which can represent linguistic information more effectively in dynamic fuzzy environments. Second, to compensate for information loss, an incomplete dynamic fuzzy linguistic formal context completion algorithm involving two-pass completions is proposed. In addition, dynamic fuzzy linguistic rules are extracted using the finer relation of dynamic fuzzy linguistic concept lattices, which are utilized to construct a dynamic fuzzy linguistic rule base. On this basis, antecedent similarity degree of dynamic fuzzy linguistic rules is introduced, thereby an incomplete dynamic fuzzy linguistic reasoning approach is proposed for obtaining decision-making results. Finally, a practical example is used to verify the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Vision–language models (VLMs) pre-trained on large-scale image–text pairs have shown impressive results in zero-shot vision tasks. Knowledge transferability of these models can be further improved with the help of a limited number of samples. Feature adapter tuning is a prominent approach employed for efficient transfer learning (ETL). However, most of the previous ETL models focus on tuning either prior-independent or prior-dependent feature adapters. We propose a novel ETL approach that leverages both adapter styles simultaneously. Additionally, most existing ETL models rely on using textual prompts constructed by completing general pre-defined templates. This approach neglects the descriptive knowledge that can assist VLM by presenting an informative prompt. Instead of pre-defined templates for prompt construction, we use a pre-trained LLM to generate attribute-specific prompts for each visual category. Furthermore, we guide the VLM with context-aware discriminative information generated by the pre-trained LLM to emphasize features that distinguish the most probable candidate classes. The proposed ETL model is evaluated on 11 datasets and sets a new state of the art. Our code and all collected prompts are publicly available at https://github.com/mrzarei5/DATViL .},

  abstract     = {Optimization problems are widespread across various fields, including industry, agriculture, and healthcare. Metaheuristic algorithms (MAs) are commonly employed to solve these problems due to their flexibility and robustness. However, despite their success, MAs inspired by plant evolutionary strategies remain underexplored. This paper introduces a novel multi-population optimization framework based on the plant evolutionary strategy (PES_MPOF), which leverages plant evolutionary principles to improve optimization performance by maintaining population diversity and accelerating convergence in complex tasks. PES_MPOF integrates multiple subpopulations, each evolving according to different plant evolutionary models. These subpopulations mimic natural distribution and reproduction strategies, fostering solution diversity through both cooperation and competition. Additionally, PES_MPOF adapts population parameters based on the evolutionary performance of subpopulations, further enhancing its robustness and efficiency. The PES_MPOF algorithm was tested on the IEEE CEC 2020 benchmark suite and several classic engineering design problems. It outperforms other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, demonstrating significant improvements in global optimization, solution accuracy, and convergence speed. PES_MPOF effectively addresses the challenges of premature convergence and loss of diversity, making it a robust and efficient optimization tool. Its innovative multi-population framework, inspired by plant evolutionary strategies, enhances both exploration and exploitation. Experimental results validate its effectiveness across a broad range of optimization problems, including those with constraints.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for crack detection in oil pipes using a combination of 3D drone simulation, convolutional neural network (CNN) feature extraction, and the dynamically constrained accumulative membership fuzzy logic algorithm (DCAMFL). The algorithm leverages the strengths of CNNs in extracting discriminative features from images and the DCAMFL’s ability to handle uncertainties and overlapping linguistic variables. We evaluated the proposed algorithm on a comprehensive dataset containing images of cracked oil pipes, achieving remarkable results. The precision, recall, and F1-score for crack detection were found to be 96.5%, 97.3%, and 95.6%, respectively. These high-performance metrics demonstrate the algorithm’s accuracy and reliability in identifying and classifying cracks. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating advanced simulation techniques, deep learning, and fuzzy logic for crack detection in oil pipelines. The proposed algorithm holds promise for enhancing pipeline surveillance, improving safety measures, and extending the lifespan of oil infrastructure. Future work involves expanding the dataset, fine-tuning the CNN architecture, and validating the algorithm on large-scale pipelines to further enhance its performance and applicability.},

  abstract     = {The condition known as preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder that occurs during pregnancy and has serious implications for both the mother and the fetus. Proper management of the condition depends on early detection of preeclampsia to make a correct prognosis. In this study, we classify pre-eclampsia using three datasets: two of which are the public datasets acquired from Mendeley and Kaggle, respectively, while the third is a real-world clinical dataset obtained from a local hospital. Recursive feature elimination, principal component analysis, correlation-based feature selection, and particle swarm optimization were used to select significant features from the predictor variables of the public datasets. To improve the classification performance, several models were created, with an emphasis on ensemble learning methods. Specifically, we propose three models: the alternative classification models include the Soft Decision Fusion Model, which applies soft-voting; the Stacking-Based Classifier, which is an ensemble stacking; and the Hybrid Soft Stacking Model. These models were assessed in detail concerning their quantitative indicators for the AUC-ROC criterion. The performance of our proposed models in the public datasets was an AUC-ROC of more than 95% and in the clinical dataset an even higher 96%. These ensemble methods accurately show that they have effective results in improving the precision and reliability of pre-eclampsia forecasts. With the help of real and public clinical data, the present work presents an effective and ecological approach that can help healthcare professionals make appropriate and timely decisions about the management of pre-eclampsia. In particular, the results of the Hybrid Soft Stacking Model look quite convincing in terms of predictive value, so the model could be considered a useful tool in the clinical context.},

  abstract     = {Concept mapping is a knowledge representation method used to represent and understand concepts, entities, and the relationships between them, which are referred to as hyponymy–hypernymy semantic relations. These relations are primarily used to describe the hierarchical and categorical relationships between different concepts or entities. The detection of hyponymy–hypernymy semantic relations is an important task in the field of natural language processing, crucial to many downstream tasks such as information extraction, automatic reasoning, and personalized recommendations. These tasks often require understanding the semantic relations between concepts or entities in text for more accurate analysis and reasoning. Currently, algorithms for identifying and detecting hyponymy–hypernymy semantic relations face two main challenges: first, candidate hyponymy–hypernymy relation tuples do not exist in the same contextual sentence, failing to meet the co-occurrence requirement; second, distributed algorithms have issues with lexical memory. To address these issues, this paper proposes an improved algorithm for detecting hyponymy–hypernymy relations based on heterogeneous graph neural networks, aiming to detect hyponymy–hypernymy relations in various candidate word sets and then construct a hierarchical system. To meet the co-occurrence requirement of candidate word pairs, an open-source large model is utilized to generate contextual sentences for the candidate pairs. Sub-word features are adopted to capture the intrinsic semantic connections between nested phrases, thus alleviating the issue of reversed predictions for nested phrases. The representation of relation nodes is modified by encoding relation definitions through a pre-trained model, enabling the model to understand the semantic relations between concept nodes. To address the problem of overfitting in traditional graph attention networks, the calculation order of adjacency node aggregation is changed in the heterogeneous graph to capture dynamic attention features. In addition, a pipeline for hierarchical system construction is designed and implemented, combining the divide-and-conquer approach with loop detection algorithms. Compared to baseline metrics, the proposed method achieves a 4.14% improvement in accuracy and a 0.62% increase in F1 score on the EVALution dataset; a 4.89% increase in accuracy and a 0.71% improvement in F1 score on the Bansal dataset; and a 1.05% increase in accuracy, a 2.21% increase in recall, and a 1.79% improvement in F1 score on a self-annotated Chinese dictionary dataset.},

  abstract     = {Diabetes detection requires evidence-based recommendations that enable people to manage their health. A rising diabetes rate can lead to significant health risks and financial hardships. An early diagnosis and efficient treatment are essential to reduce the effects of diabetes. Therefore, a novel Sensor-infused QUantum CNN for diabetes Identification and Diet recommendation (SQUID) technique has been proposed in this paper, which identifies diabetes in the early stage using an IoT system and provides diet recommendations for reducing diabetes. The proposed SQUID system collects data from remote patients using IoT sensors and uses the Namib Beetle Optimization (NBO) technique to select the features. The prediction phase uses the Quantum CNN technique for classifying the input into diabetes and non-diabetes. After prediction, the suggestion phase will provide the diet recommendation using the fuzzy rule for the person affected with diabetes through the mobile application. The efficacy of the proposed SQUID framework has been assessed using specific parameters such as Accuracy (AC), Precision (PN), F1 score (F1_S), Recall (RL) and Diagnostic Odds Ratio (DOR). The SQUID framework achieves a higher AC of 98.69%, whereas HCBDA, IWBSOA, e-diagnosis and GlucoBreath achieve the AC of 92%, 94%, 96.5% and 97.35% in the diabetes dataset. In the diabetes prediction dataset, the proposed SQUID model achieves a higher accuracy of 98.87%, whereas existing techniques such as HCBDA, IWBSOA, e-diagnosis and GlucoBreath achieve the AC of 91.35%, 93.56%, 97.21% and 96.43% in diabetes prediction dataset respectively.},

The fuzzy decision process is used to validate and extract new possibilities of the translated patterns.

Despite the progress in deep learning, issues such as occlusion, distraction from the background, and motion pattern variability still exist, thus restricting the generalization ability of current models. Most methods are based only on spatial or temporal features and cannot efficiently capture both in one framework, causing lower accuracy in realistic situations. In response to these shortcomings, a multilevel feature extraction approach was proposed by integrating spatial and temporal features to improve the action recognition precision. The method captures RGB frames, optical flow, spatial saliency maps, and temporal saliency maps to enable an overall inspection of video streams. Efficient feature extraction was achieved by applying a pre-trained Inception V3 model and then bidirectional gated recurrent units (Bi-GRUs) to include sequential modeling. An attention mechanism was also included to boost the classification process by focusing on key temporal segments. UCF101 and HMDB51 benchmark datasets evaluated the efficiency of the strategy. The model’s accuracy was 98.13% on UCF101 and 81.45% on HMDB51, which validated the superior discrimination ability of the model in processing heterogeneous human actions. These results confirm that the provided framework is an efficient and discriminative action recognition approach, thus suitable for applications requiring extensive motion analysis and real-time deployment.},

  abstract     = {Cultural and creative products are extensive, difficult to mass produce, and undersupplied. They can demonstrate their distinctive qualities through multifunctional design while raising cultural and economic value. Three circumstances often emerge when cultural and creative customers purchase stationery: purchasing inclination, purchasing behavior, and reflection. Limited mass manufacturing, undersupply, and the need to balance cultural and commercial value are common cultural and creative product issues. Hence, this study proposes a fuzzy context-aware neural recommendation algorithm (F-CANRA) to analyze consumers’ purchase behaviors regarding cultural and creative products (CCPs). A graph neural network (GNN) is established by studying users’ cultural and creative product-buying behavior. In this environment, a fuzzy decision support system (FDSS) could assist in making product recommendations for artistic and innovative actions (e.g., artwork, music, crafts, etc.) by taking into account a variety of criteria, including users’ preferences, current trends, cultural importance, and the fuzziness of these factors (e.g., a user’s approximate preference for “modern yet traditional” designs). This article proposes a decision-making framework utilizing a fuzzy decision support system (FDSS) integrated with a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). This framework aims to prioritize design elements, develop cultural and creative design components, and identify and analyze the key criteria influencing user needs. This research shows that the strategy may assist industrial designers in creating better color schemes for creative and cultural products by incorporating group users’ visual preferences into purchasing intention via multiuser decision consistency. The simulation outcome demonstrates that the suggested model increases the purchase intention prediction ratio of 97.8%, customer emotional satisfaction ratio of 98.5%, product development ratio of 96.2%, recommendation accuracy ratio of 95.2%, and product design costs of 7.3% compared to other existing models. As these outcomes show, the approach can help companies and industrial designers create CCPs that are culturally important and financially feasible. The F-CANRA platform provides a strong answer to the challenges of tailored product suggestions and well-informed design choices by connecting sophisticated algorithms with the cultural industry's complex requirements.},

However, their limited interpretability hinders practical deployment in real-world agricultural settings. To address this, we explore advanced CNN architectures, namely ResNet-50 and EfficientNet, augmented with attention mechanisms. These models enhance accuracy by optimizing depth, width, and resolution, while attention layers improve transparency by focusing on disease-relevant regions. Experiments using the PlantVillage dataset show that basic CNNs achieve 46.69% accuracy, while ResNet-50 and EfficientNet attain 63.79% and 98.27%, respectively. On a 39-class extended dataset, our proposed EfficientNet-B0 with attention (EfficientNetB0-Attn), integrating an attention module at layer 262, achieves 99.39% accuracy. This approach significantly enhances interpretability without compromising performance. The attention module generates weights via backpropagation, allowing the model to emphasize disease-relevant image regions, thereby enhancing both accuracy and interpretability.},

  abstract     = {Complex neurological illnesses necessitate modern facilities’ computational methods for precise mapping and categorization of brain activities. For the diagnosis and tracking of conditions including epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s, precise brain mapping is essential. When it comes to diagnostic accuracy and scalability, traditional methods frequently encounter problems, including data heterogeneity, low resolution, and computational inefficiencies. Dealing with large-scale imaging datasets, enhancing the reliability of disease categorization in varied patient groups, and overcoming the limitations of cross-modality data fusion are the primary challenges. The multimodal neuro-cognitive imaging computational technique (MN-CICT) has been suggested in this research to overcome the above challenges. MN-CICT thoroughly extracts and analyses structural and functional brain data by integrating multiple imaging modalities, such as MRI, fMRI, PET, and CT. Improved resolution and interpretability of neurological mappings are achieved by the use of adaptive feature extraction, multimodal data fusion, and advanced machine learning techniques by MN-CICT. Because of its focus on computing efficiency, the framework additionally seems well suited for use in real-time scenarios. Neurodegenerative disease research, therapy planning, and clinical diagnostics are among the many areas that can benefit greatly from the framework. In comparison to current methods, the simulation results show a considerable decrease in processing time and an improvement in classification accuracy. This exemplifies its promise to enhance diagnostic results and simplify neuroimaging operations. The MN-CICT is a revolutionary method to brain imaging, which paves the way for the development of novel applications in the fields of brain–computer interfaces, customized medicine, and automated diagnostics.},

  abstract     = {To create a fusion image with more information, complementary data from similar images taken by multiple types of sensors are combined into a single image through the process of infrared and visible image fusion. Existing fusion approaches based on machine learning still struggle with how to better preserve the detail information in the source images. To improve and supplement the fusion image information, a hybrid reinforcement learning system based on fuzzy logic and convolutional network and filtering designed to fuse visible and infrared images is used in this work. This hybrid reinforcement learning system was optimized using algorithms including wild horse optimization (WHO), genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to improve specific fusion metrics such as image correlation, similarity coefficient, image entropy, and signal-to-noise ratio. The system aims to preserve the detail information in the final image by adding thermal information from the infrared image to the visible image, which is achieved by performing a series of fusion operations on the input images, including image detail enhancement with the help of a convolutional network and meaningful image fusion with fuzzy logic semantic model and filtering operations to increase clarity. As part of the validation process, the advantages of the proposed algorithm were compared with other classical algorithms using the TNO dataset. Successfully, the proposed method has been able to increase the SSIM parameters to 1.8594 and PSNR to 61.42. Based on the experimental results, our proposed method outperforms previous fusion methods in terms of subjective and objective evaluations.},

  abstract     = {Recent deep learning techniques driven by large datasets demonstrate the significant impact of feature learning in remote sensing for land use and cover classification, particularly exemplified by CNNs. While the pre-trained models showed good classification performance, they struggled to classify remote-sensing images with high precision accurately. In this study, we introduced XNANet, a self-attention-based CNN network for image classification. Bayesian optimization has been used to initialize the hyperparameters of the proposed model to improve training on the radiographic images. We suggested a novel network-level approach via the fusion of deep structure utilizing tiny-32 ViT and XNANet. For the first time, the tiny-32 vision transformer architecture has been utilized for RS images and combined with XNANet through network-level fusion. Following the fusion process, the model focused on RS image datasets and obtained deep features from the self-attention layer. The features that have been extracted are subject to selection, utilizing a novel meta-heuristic feature selection algorithm, RF-DE. The selected features are categorized using three popular classifiers. The proposed architecture’s experimental process was executed on the AID, RSSCN7, and SIRI-WHU datasets, resulting in accuracies of 98.9%, 99.3%, and 99.7%, respectively. Similarly, RF-DE was evaluated against six popular feature selection algorithms, yielding accuracies of 98.9%, 99.3%, and 99.7%, respectively. An in-depth statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate the suggested ensemble and RF-DE and demonstrate that the fusion model attained enhanced accuracy with RF-DE. Furthermore, recent techniques and proposed methods are compared, demonstrating enhanced precision, recall, and accuracy.},

The developments in deep learning provide educational institutions with new data-based methods to develop professional development training programs. Entrepreneurial Skill Augmented Neural Network (ESANN) presents itself as a deep learning framework that serves to individualize educator training while upgrading their acquisition of entrepreneurial skills. The model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks, and a Transformer-based recommendation engine to deliver adaptive, real-time feedback and optimize training pathways based on individual learning patterns. A model training process used data from 300 teachers, including their activity records, questionnaires, and evaluation feedback, to achieve valid model outcomes. Educators received assessment through an established entrepreneurial competency framework at the commencement and completion of ESANN-based instruction. The quantitative evaluation included measuring skill score improvement between participants in the ESANN group and those in traditional training through accuracy metrics evaluated within ten-fold cross-validation methods. Members of the training group that received ESANN training outperformed traditional training participants by 24% in their entrepreneurial competency scores. The developed model delivered 92.5% predictive accuracy, surpassing other baseline approaches regarding performance efficiency and accuracy. ESANN serves as a deep learning framework for educational development, which provides individualized and flexible learning solutions for teacher training on a large scale. These findings highlight artificial intelligence's (AI) transformative potential in fostering entrepreneurial education through real-time, data-informed feedback.},

  abstract     = {Growing environmental concerns, especially those related to carbon emissions from production and supply chain activities, have highlighted the need for sustainable practices. Implementing policies that incentivize low-carbon operations is crucial. To foster sustainable development, implementing penalties for high-emission commercial activities is crucial. This study investigates a sustainable production-inventory system for a product with a power-pattern demand, considering limited shelf life and gradual deterioration. The analysis integrates carbon emissions from stockholding, transportation, and deterioration, along with the impact of shortages on total costs. Two distinct scenarios are examined: Case I (without deterioration) and Case II (with deterioration). Each case is further divided into two models: one allowing shortages and the other prohibiting them. The primary objective is to determine an optimal production-inventory policy that maximizes profit per unit time while accounting for carbon emission taxes related to transportation, storage, and deterioration. Numerical results demonstrate that the total cost in Case I (without deterioration) is significantly lower than in Case II (with deterioration), with reductions of $$24.89\%$$ and $$22.02\%$$ , respectively. These findings underscore the financial implications of deterioration and shortages on sustainable inventory management. The proposed model offers valuable insights for decision-makers seeking to optimize production cycles, manage carbon footprints, and develop sustainable supply chain policies.},

To address this issue, this article applied transfer learning into the field of aerobics posture evaluation and achieved automation and objectivity of posture evaluation through BERT-PTA (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers-Prototype-based Transfer Assistants) domain adaptive methods. BERT and PTA methods were chosen because BERT’s bidirectional language understanding and transfer learning capabilities can effectively adapt to the language instructions in the field of aerobics, and PTA’s posture tracking and humanized computing features provide an accurate and user-friendly solution specifically for the assessment of aerobics poses. First, a BERT-PTA model was established based on the collection of aerobics posture data. Second, the BERT-PTA model was used to extract features from the preprocessed posture data. Next, a convolutional neural network was used to construct a key point localization model for aerobics poses, and transfer learning was used to train and fine-tune the model. Finally, experimental verification was conducted on using transfer learning to improve aerobics posture evaluation. The results showed that the precision of using transfer learning to improve aerobics posture evaluation was 4.88% and 8.86% higher than that of the other two methods, respectively. The recall rate of using transfer learning to improve aerobics posture evaluation was 3.45% and 7.14% higher than that of the other two methods, respectively. The evaluation efficiency of using transfer learning to improve aerobics posture evaluation was 6.52–7.69% higher than that of the other two methods, respectively. In short, using transfer learning to improve aerobics can provide more scientific guidance for aerobics sports.},

These technologies utilize live and predictive network data to advance the network to its full potential, proactively resolving performance issues prior to the impact on subscribers. By employing predictive forecasting and active monitoring, these systems also assess future interconnection requirements and determine the optimal time and location to increase capacity to achieve the highest possible return, months in advance. This yields a network that is consistently operational and provides exceptional performance, customized to the strategic business objectives, and prepared to satisfy the growing performance requirements of future 5G use cases. Linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy sets (LIFSs) offer an adequate base to represent and manage unpredictability linked to intuitionistic assessments and linguistic structures. Aggregation operators (AOs) play a critical role in enhancing the decision-making (DM) procedure by adeptly managing preferences and uncertainties in multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problems. This leads to decisions that are both more accurate and reliable. Dynamic AOs, which adjust to time-varying data, further improve flexibility and precision in DM. This research builds upon these concepts to develop novel AOs, including the LIF dynamic Dombi weighted averaging operator (LIFDyDWA), and the LIF dynamic Dombi weighted geometric operator (LIFDyDWG), and illustrates their key structural properties. An algorithm is also proposed to address the challenges of handling imprecise data in DM using the LIF dynamic Dombi aggregation approaches. These strategies are successfully applied to present a solution to an MADM problem concerning the selection of an optimal strategy to enhance the efficiency of telecommunication network systems to demonstrate their effectiveness and superiority. A comparative analysis is provided to validate the efficacy and advantages of the suggested methods over existing approaches.},

Recent advances in portfolio optimization have shown promising capabilities of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to dynamically allocate funds across various potential assets to meet the objectives of prospective investors. The reward function plays a crucial role in providing feedback to the agent and shaping its behavior to attain the desired goals. However, choosing an optimal reward function poses a significant challenge for risk-averse investors aiming to maximize returns while minimizing risk or pursuing multiple investment objectives. In this study, we attempt to develop a risk-adjusted deep reinforcement learning (RA-DRL) approach leveraging three DRL agents trained using distinct reward functions, namely, log returns, differential Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown to develop a unified policy that incorporates the essence of these individual agents. The actions generated by these agents are then fused by employing a convolutional neural network to provide a single risk-adjusted action. Instead of relying solely on a singular reward function, our approach integrates three different functions aiming at diverse objectives. The proposed approach is tested on daily data of four real-world stock market instances: Sensex, Dow, TWSE, and IBEX. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach based on several risk and return performance metrics when compared with base DRL agents and benchmark methods.},

Faced with the challenges of diversified demand and uneven supply of elderly care services in the context of an aging population, existing matching methods have significant shortcomings in subjective preference expression, objective evaluation integration, and consideration of time factors. Therefore, a many-to-one matching model in picture fuzzy environment to achieve the best matching scheme between the elderly and pension institutions is constructed in this study. By using the minimum variance method and cumulative prospect theory, subjective preference satisfaction and objective matching results for the elderly and pension institutions are obtained, respectively. Combined with regret theory, the two are compared to obtain adjusted satisfaction, and an innovative time satisfaction index based on expected check-in time is proposed to construct a three-objective optimization model that includes virtual subjects. The research in this paper expresses the subjective evaluation of two-sided subjects in the form of picture fuzzy preference relation, which enriches the research of picture fuzzy theory.

  abstract     = {Image anomaly detection plays a critical role in industrial quality control, medical diagnostics, and security surveillance, yet existing unsupervised methods often suffer from limited detection accuracy and poor adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose UAD-ADC, a novel framework that automatically identifies anomalies in images without requiring labeled training data. Our approach integrates deep representation learning with adaptive clustering to effectively separate normal patterns from anomalies by learning robust feature representations and dynamically refining decision boundaries. A key innovation is our intelligent sample selection mechanism, which enhances model stability by prioritizing high-confidence normal samples during training, along with an iterative optimization strategy that progressively improves anomaly discrimination. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UAD-ADC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, with particular effectiveness under varying anomaly ratios. These advancements pave the way for more reliable and scalable unsupervised anomaly detection in practical scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Though the widespread use of multi-UAV systems offers significant tactical and operational advantages, achieving efficient and secure collaborative planning remains a critical challenge in dynamic threat environments. Traditional methods struggle to balance path optimization with threat avoidance, particularly in fluctuating environments where UAVs must adapt to changing threats. To address this, an enhanced Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm is proposed for multi-UAV collaborative planning in dynamic threat zones. Our research integrates a priori knowledge of threat zone locations, speeds, and directions with real-time data on the UAVs position relative to the threat zones to effectively manage dynamic threat zones, allowing UAVs to dynamically decide whether to navigate around or through these zones, thus significantly reducing trajectory costs. To further improve search efficiency and solution quality, strategies such as greedy initialization and K-means clustering are incorporated, enhancing the algorithms multi-objective optimization capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that the dynamic threat zone crossing strategy significantly reduces trajectory costs compared to the traditional bypass strategy. Furthermore, the enhanced GWO algorithm outperforms both the traditional GWO and MP-GWO algorithms in terms of trajectory cost and convergence accuracy. Our approach provides novel insights and methodologies for the advancement of multi-UAV collaborative trajectory planning, while extending the applicability of the GWO algorithm in complex environments},

The data characteristics generated by SIP flood attacks may overlap and confuse with normal traffic characteristics, and the network traffic characteristics will dynamically change over time, thereby affecting the accuracy of SIP flood attack detection. Therefore, an SIP flood detection technique based on BiGRU algorithm is proposed for covert networks in multi-agent systems. This technology is divided into two levels of detection. The primary detection collects and analyzes the hidden network data of multi-agent systems, and determines whether the traffic is abnormal by calculating the Renyi entropy value; abnormal traffic enters the second-level attack detection stage, extracting abnormal traffic from multi-agent covert networks and using the BiGRU model to learn features bidirectionally to determine whether it is an SIP flooding attack. If it is, the result of the SIP flooding attack on the multi-agent covert network is output. The experimental results show that this technology can accurately determine abnormal traffic and accurately detect the time, attacker IP, and attack frequency of SIP flooding attacks in the hidden network of multi-agent systems.

  abstract     = {Worldwide, the wheat industry encounters major obstacles caused by stripe rust disease, triggered by the fungus Puccinia striiformis. This disease results in considerable losses of wheat crops and has significant economic repercussions. Accurate detection of crop diseases is vital for sustainable agriculture and food security. By effectively identifying and managing crop diseases, yield losses can be prevented and global food production can be ensured. This not only protects farmers’ livelihoods but also contributes to human health and well-being by safeguarding the food supply. Wheat plays a crucial role in Pakistan’s agriculture, covering 37% of the cultivated land and contributing 70% to total production. Stripe rust, a serious fungal disease, heavily affects wheat yield, causing a global loss of 5.5 million tons annually. Current models exhibit shortcomings in accurately detecting wheat stripe rust, necessitating improvements for more precise identification and diagnosis of the disease. Fortunately, recent advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in object-detection accuracy, thus offering hope for better disease management. The purpose of this study is to introduce a method to minimize losses by accurately and promptly detecting stripe rust disease, thereby avoiding the need for manual inspection. To achieve this goal, we propose a vision transformer and a hybrid model to identify wheat stripe rust by analyzing multi-spectral and high-resolution image data. Additionally, we utilize two models, ViT-Base/16 and a transformer, which prove to be highly effective in accurately detecting diseases using the same datasets as the vision transformer model. The proposed method provides optimal results with a vision transformer and a hybrid approach with 98% accuracy and 97.9%, respectively. ViT-Base/16 and transformer models achieve an accuracy of 98% and 95%, almost. Using an improved vision transformer, we achieved precise detection of wheat stripe rust compared to previous methods. This has various benefits, such as safeguarding yields, reducing costs, supporting sustainable agriculture, facilitating crop monitoring, and improving disease management.},

This method is based on the use of discrete implication functions defined on a finite chain. Furthermore, a bijective correspondence between the set of implication functions on the aforementioned subset of discrete fuzzy numbers and the set of discrete implication functions defined on the discrete chain is shown. Basic properties of these implication functions are thoroughly investigated, concluding that they are preserved under the proposed construction method.

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is a major global health problem, with the WHO estimating approximately 2.3 million new cases every year. In this study, we present a new approach to improve the early detection of breast cancer using deep learning methods and visual inspection of histopathological images. In a world where access to a doctor with specialised knowledge is limited, this study attempts to address the important limitations of current diagnostic strategies that facilitate the efficient detection of diseases. In the proposed method, we use transfer learning with a combination of classifiers, such as SVM, decision trees, and K-nearest neighbours, while implementing two different feature extraction approaches, PCA for dimensionality reduction and no PCA. The approach includes a full evaluation system using metrics such as recall, accuracy, precision, and ROC curves to evaluate the performance of the models. This yields major performance gains for almost all classifiers. The experimental results showed that the SVM classifier with PCA feature extraction obtained the best accuracy of 99.5% with 99.2% precision and 99.6% recall, indicating a significant improvement over the current approach. Even without PCA implementation, the Decision Tree classifier also performed well, scoring 99.4% accuracy. In particular, the application of PCA improved the accuracy of the Boosted Tree from 82.9% to 91.01%. The execution times of classifiers varied significantly; for example, SVM, which is the fastest one as of now, with an execution time without PCA of 38.24 s. This study suggests a potential clinical tool that combines advanced deep learning methods and subsequent classification in real healthcare systems to improve breast cancer detection capabilities. This shows that the high accuracy of this framework, coupled with its computational efficiency, makes it an invaluable tool for real-life clinical applications, which could minimise misdiagnosis and lead to better patient outcomes through earlier detection of respiratory viruses worldwide, especially in remote areas with limited health-care resources.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is a prevalent cancer type in women worldwide, and therefore it is necessary to do early detection that is accurate for effective treatment. However, traditional ways of diagnosing through mammogram or histopathological examination may take more time and also require an interpretation from an expert. In the past few years, deep learning techniques especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have changed medical imaging by making possible automated diagnosis which is fast. In this study, an integrated breast cancer detection approach using BreakHis images is proposed focusing on balanced accuracy rate analysis to solve imbalanced datasets problem. The methodology starts with pre-processing these images by means of Adaptive Fuzzy Filter which removes the artifacts while improving the image quality. The next step involves superpixel segmentation through SLIC-K-Means-BIRCH followed by feature extraction using SIFT with Bag of Features (BoF). The extracted features are analyzed with machine learning models such as Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Decision Tree (DT), Softmax Discriminant Classifier (SDC), SVM using RBF kernel and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) as well as deep learning models ResNet-50, VGG16, VGG19 and EfficientNet-B0. Data augmentation techniques such as image rotation and brightness adjustments were applied to enrich our dataset. R-Adam hyperparameter tuning technique was utilized to optimize these deep learning models. Results show that the modified SLIC-K-Means-BIRCH segmentation, when combined with the SIFT with BoF and EfficientNet-B0 optimized with R-Adam, yields a classification accuracy of 99.11% on augmented images. In addition, balanced classification rate analysis confirmed that this method could classify breast cancer from an imbalanced dataset effectively.},

In the client, we present a multi-granularity dynamic knowledge graph embedding model that improves the capability of dynamic knowledge graph embedding representation by focusing on multi-granularity temporal facts from the perspective of knowledge utilization. On the server, we design a multi-granularity aggregation rule to accommodate multi-party information aggregation at different granularities.

Climatic data and services are crucial for agriculturalists to withstand the rising frequency of strong meteorological conditions, which negatively impact crop yields. Weather forecasts play a key role in managing resources for agricultural operations, enabling farmers to plan and protect their crops from natural disasters. In addition, global warming has fueled climatic unpredictability, creating challenges like hurricanes that damage the foundational roots of agricultural production. In recent times, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been predominantly adopted for daily forecasting climatic conditions, including rainfall, maximum temperature, and humidity. However, the existing models for climatic prediction require improvements in computational complexity and performance. This research article proposes the ensemble Residual Long Short-Term Memory (R-LSTM) along with Artificial Gorilla Troops Optimized Deep Learning Networks (AGTO-DLN) as a solution for climatic condition prediction to boost crop–yield production. Performance metrics for the proposed model examining precision, F1 score, accuracy, specificity, and recall operate through evaluation using 5,04,647 climatic parameters with various advanced learning techniques. The proposed method achieved 97.2% accuracy and 96.9% precision together with 96.5% recall and 96.6% specificity and 97.5% F1 score.

As the population ages, the need for early and accurate diagnostic tools has become increasingly critical to mitigate the impact of the disease. Recent developments in medical imaging technologies, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), alongside the application of artificial intelligence (AI), have provided new avenues for improving the early detection and diagnosis of AD. This study focuses on leveraging these advancements to enhance the accuracy of AD diagnosis through a novel two-stage algorithm. The proposed model combines an improved 3D DenseNet segmentation model with an enhanced ST-MBV3 classification model. The first stage of the proposed algorithm involves processing the collected images. The resulting brain MRI images are then segmented using an enhanced 3D DenseNet model, thereby constructing a comprehensive dataset for AD classification. In the second stage, the segmented images are then classified using the ST-MBV3 model, a deep learning architecture designed for high-accuracy classification. Experimental results demonstrate impressive classification accuracies, including 98.6% for distinguishing between AD and normal control (NC), 95.97% for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus NC, 94.57% for AD versus MCI, and 93.12% for AD/MCI/NC classification. The proposed approach offers promising results for automated and accurate AD diagnosis. This method could play a crucial role in advancing diagnostic procedures and improving patient outcomes.},

  abstract     = {During product design and manufacturing stages, unexpected challenges often occur, leading to product development or production failures. These failures can adversely affect the manufacturer's production efficiency, profitability, and reputation. Therefore, the industry often uses the failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) approach to assess risk and identify possible risk factors. Moreover, with the rapid advancement of science and technology, shortened product life cycle, and the need for diversified product functions, factors such as time constraints, increased product manufacturing complexity, and difficulties in handling cross-domain information have made risk assessment in the design and manufacturing stages increasingly complex and challenging. These complexities can be considered a complicated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. Due to the nature of the data, qualitative and quantitative data may coexist. On the other hand, decision-makers often lack a comprehensive understanding of cross-field expertise and information, leading to incomplete and inaccurate fuzzy information judgments. This, in turn, hinders their ability to provide accurate assessments of decision-making parameters in risk assessment issues. To address these challenges, this study integrates the FMEA method, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, and the neutrosophic set (NS). It then applies these methodologies to numerical examples from an aerospace electronics manufacturing project for analysis and calculation. Compared with other research methods, the experiment results revealed that the novel NS-based risk analysis method yields more reliable and accurate rankings in failure mode risk in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Complex many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) generate multiple challenges for obtaining convergence alongside diversity within extensive multi-dimensional solution areas. Optimization approaches currently face limitations when trying to balance exploration and exploitation especially when resources become limited. MaOCO represents the Many-Objective Cheetah Optimization Algorithm which draws its concepts from the hunting behavior of cheetahs. MaOCO includes adaptive search functions that use attack and sit-and-wait approaches to optimize exploration and exploitation capabilities. MaOCO produces hypervolume (HV) results that exceed NSGA-III and MaOMVO by 50% while also delivering inverse generational distance (IGD) results which reach 40% better than both competing methods. The algorithm demonstrates superior efficiency in solving complex MaOPs, because it requires lower computational costs by 15%. MaOCO successfully traverses Pareto-optimal fronts according to theoretical evaluations, and its modular structure allows for both scale-up and hybridization features. The implemented applications of this approach include optimizing energy systems along with designing structures for engineering projects. Future researchers plan to integrate MaOCO with additional metaheuristic techniques to improve its performance when dealing with dynamic and irregular Pareto front problems.},

  abstract     = {The non-contact and directional nature of acoustic fault diagnosis offers a distinct advantage for fault detection in complex environments, ensuring the safe and stable operation of rotating machinery. However, challenges such as complex working conditions and data imbalance significantly hinder the effectiveness of acoustic-based diagnostic systems. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Collaborative Perception Information Aggregation Guidance Network (CPAGN). In the proposed method, a Stem layer is utilized at the front end to extract nonlinear acoustic features. Subsequently, the collaborative perception layer integrates local frequency information extraction, multi-receptive field temporal information fusion, and redundancy reduction, thereby capturing the time-frequency variations of acoustic signals under complex operating conditions and enhancing condition awareness. Finally, inter-layer feature correlation computation is employed to generate global channel guidance, facilitating the effective interaction and fusion of global information. The CPAGN successfully extracts critical acoustic features and identifies essential fault information, demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalizability in handling data imbalance. To validate the effectiveness of CPAGN, comparative experiments were conducted on two datasets, comparing it with several existing deep learning methods. The results indicate that CPAGN excels at capturing fault information from acoustic signals, achieving superior diagnostic performance in complex working conditions and imbalanced data scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The heating process of steel slabs is a critical stage in the production of medium and thick plates, significantly impacting production costs and energy efficiency. Existing research faces two major scientific challenges in gas consumption accounting and prediction for medium-thick steel slabs: (1) due to the dynamic movement of slabs, high-temperature environments, and structural constraints, it is difficult to directly measure slab temperatures and accurately quantify heat loss during the reheating process; and (2) traditional methods lack systematic consideration of batch integrity and the heat absorption ratio during the heating process, leading to low accuracy in energy consumption accounting and prediction. This paper proposes an innovative gas consumption accounting and prediction method based on batch integrity and heat absorption ratio, integrating metallurgical mechanisms and industrial big data. In the accounting phase, a 2D heat conduction finite difference method is used to calculate the heat absorption of slabs, and the batch energy consumption is allocated proportionally based on heat absorption ratios. In the prediction phase, XGBoost models are employed to predict batch gas consumption, with results distributed to individual slabs using the heat absorption ratio.},

  abstract     = {The subtle differences between edible and toxic mushroom species make classification difficult. Traditional methods often result in errors which led to misclassifications and conventional machine learning models often struggle in feature extraction due to subtle differences in mushroom species. Deep learning models, such as DenseNet architectures, offer potential solutions, but due to model complexity, deep architecture and large number of parameters these models suffer from overfitting and computational costs. These can be handled by optimizing the model. This study’s primary goal is to enhance the precision and reliability of mushroom classification through deep learning by enhancing the DenseNet-121 structure. This is done through the implementation of more sophisticated model regularization techniques and automating the hyperparameter optimization process. The study intends to show how model architectural changes and optimization approaches can offer solutions to issues like overfitting and significant resource expenditure on computation and ultimately improve mushroom classification systems for efficiency and efficacy. The study analyzes the basic DenseNet-121 model as well as a modified DenseNet-121 with frozen upper layers which preserve important lower level features. Automated hyperparameter tuning is done with KerasTuner, while dropout and weight decay regularization methods are used to control overfitting. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and other graphical methods. The enhanced DenseNet-121 model surpasses the standard DenseNet-121 in mushroom classification. While DenseNet-121 obtained an overall accuracy of 0.90 along with a macro average precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.90 $$-$$ 0.91, Modified DenseNet-121 achieved 0.97 for all those metrics. The improvements increased the precision and recall for all the classes which means the model has less trustability and more accuracy in classification. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of architectural modifications and regularization strategies in improving model performance. Despite problems such as possible over-reliance on pre-trained features and computational complexity, the modified DenseNet-121 is useful for accurate mushroom classification. Future study could look into improving freezing procedures and lowering computational demands to extend applicability.},

  abstract     = {In existing literature, moral hazard is often modeled as a constant. However, moral hazard can be “fuzzy” rather than “precisely defined.” As moral hazard is dynamic and variable, exhibiting both constancy and differentiation, its representation through fuzzy intervals—rather than fixed constants—has emerged as a meaningful research direction. This paper integrates fuzzy set theory into credit default analysis, combining moral hazard, fuzzy risk, and credit risk in a cross-disciplinary study to explore their intrinsic interdependencies. First, a novel default intensity model incorporating market state variables and moral hazard state variables is proposed. By accounting for the fuzzy risks inherent in trading environments, the moral hazard indicators are transformed into fuzzy intervals, thereby establishing interval-based moral hazard metrics to characterize default intensity. Subsequently, to address the phenomenon of default clustering caused by default dependence in markets, a circular default intensity model involving two reference assets is constructed. Within this framework, the cross-influence mechanisms of moral hazard and fuzzy risk are further investigated. Furthermore, the proposed model, which integrates moral hazard and fuzzy risk, is applied to derivative pricing. A new pricing formula for default management costs is derived. Finally, through comparative analysis and simulation experiments, the study concludes that: (1) Under the parameter settings representing economic stagnation, the triangular fuzzy interval of survival probability narrows progressively as the credibility parameter $$\gamma$$ increases, eventually converging to a real number. (2) The cost of credit default management is significantly influenced by the number of reference assets. In trading environments where moral hazard, fuzzy risk, and credit risk intertwine, effective mitigation of their impacts on default risk requires strategic information utilization and reduction in the number of reference assets. This approach not only lowers credit management costs but also fosters the healthy development of financial markets.},

The application of machine learning algorithms enables medical researchers to examine large amounts of data accurately, which leads to the development of precise and effective treatment approaches. Lung cancer leads the list of critical healthcare issues because it remains the world’s most lethal form of cancer thus demanding innovative diagnostic tools for faster and accurate identification. The proposed study introduces an innovative method called CTGAN-RF which uses conditional tabular generative adversarial networks (CTGAN) and random forest (RF) classifier to detect lung cancer through synthetic data generation. The proposed model demonstrated superior performance by achieving a 0.9893 score of accuracy and 0.99 value for precision, F1 score, and recall. Extensive experimental evaluation for this method included testing nine classification algorithms. The implementation of different classifiers employed data balancing methods including SMOTE and borderline-SMOTE along with SMOTE ENN and unbalanced data configurations. Comparative analysis showed that CTGAN-RF consistently performed significantly better than traditional classifiers in dealing with class imbalance and improving prediction accuracy. After testing with fivefold cross-validation, the reliability of the model was further validated. In comparison to cutting-edge approaches for lung cancer diagnosis, the proposed methodology outperformed in terms of classification metrics. This in-depth evaluation of synthetic data augmentation with machine learning in lung cancer detection has helped in the development of personalized treatment strategies in the fight against such a life-threatening disease.},

  abstract     = {The growing complexity of cloud computing necessitates astute workload allocation and adaptive resource management to enhance performance while minimizing expenses and energy consumption. Conventional optimization methods, including Improved Ant Colony Optimization (IACO) and Water Wave Optimization (IWWO), face challenges in real-time adaptability, exhibit slow convergence, and are inadequate for managing rapidly varying workloads. Although IACO enhances local search efficiency and IWWO specializes in global exploration, neither adequately resolves the complexities of dynamic cloud environments. To address this gap, we propose a Hybrid DRL-IACO-IWWO model, a novel hybrid model that combines DRL with advanced iterations of IACO and IWWO. The model presents an adaptive dual-phase optimization strategy, wherein IACO conducts initial task scheduling, and IWWO enhances global optimization, informed by real-time DRL feedback. Furthermore, DRL dynamically adjusts its heuristic parameters to improve operational cost and energy efficiency, ensuring real-time adaptability. To expedite convergence, our model utilizes a wavelet transformation-based perturbation in WWO, thereby preventing premature convergence and promoting a more balanced equilibrium between exploration and exploitation. An energy-efficient scheduling mechanism is integrated to reduce energy consumption and improve cloud sustainability. The proposed model was evaluated using the workflow dataset, considering constraints, such as task deadlines, resource availability, and cost efficiency. The results indicate that our methodology outperforms leading hybrid techniques, such as ACO-GA, ACO-SMO, and WWO-GA. The proposed model achieved a scheduling duration of 1.25 s, compared to 1.75 s for ACO-GA and 1.68 s for WWO-GA, while reducing operational expenses to $23.80, lowering energy consumption to 15.6 kWh, and achieving a resource utilization score of 0.92. These findings underscore the transformative capacity of our Enhanced ACO-WWO with DRL, offering a highly efficient, cost-effective, and adaptive solution for next-generation cloud resource management.},

  abstract     = {Biased multiobjective optimization problems pose a challenge for evolutionary algorithms in obtaining high-accuracy solutions, and as the number of decision variables increases, this challenge becomes increasingly difficult to overcome. To address this issue, we propose a three-particle-based local search method (TPS) for multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). The main concept is to use three particles to maintain three equidistant values of a decision variable and gradually approach the local optimal value by adaptively adjusting their differences. Specifically, the TPS maintains a population with three particles and uses five proposed population state-transition operations to gradually move these three particles to a better state. A local optimal value can be obtained when these three particles become indistinguishable. The TPS is then embedded into an MOEA to form a new algorithm, called MOEA/TPS. To enable the TPS to search along the convergence and diversity directions, the two aggregation functions of the target problem are alternately used. Compared with twelve competitive MOEAs on various biased test problems with 30 to 2000 decision variables, our proposed algorithm demonstrates significant advantages in obtaining high-accuracy solutions.},

When the problem involves a single objective function, the optimal solution yields the best value for that objective. However, in cases with multiple objectives, selecting the best solution becomes more complex, as these objective functions often conflict with one another. For such multi-objective optimization problems, relying on analytical or exact methods is often not feasible. This paper proposes a modified MFO called multi-objective moth–flame optimization based on self-organizing mapping (MMFOSOM) to solve multi-objective optimization problems. For attaining high-quality initial moths, dual opposition-based learning mechanism is employed to generate two distinct populations, referred to as the exploration moth (EM) and the auxiliary moth (AM). In order to enhance the search capabilities of the algorithm, each population is assigned a SOM network, the adaptive neighborhood structure of which contributes to forming modal clusters in the mapping, organizing similar solutions together. In order to select the excellent individual as the training data for SOM, a novel environmental selection mechanism is introduced. To validate the effectiveness of the algorithm, experiments will be conducted on a set of multi-objective optimization test functions.

Using a simulated dataset of 100 AGA patients, we applied the fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (FWZIC) method to assign weights to 11 bioactive criteria associated with AGA. These weights informed a novel triage procedure for alopecia patients (TPAP), which stratified patients into seven severity levels (level 1: minor; level 7: severe). This study presents a computationally intelligent triage model tailored for AGA, emphasizing the applicability of fuzzy MCDM techniques in medical decision support.

  abstract     = {Cyber-physical system (CPS) security has become more important in the age of Industry 4.0 because of the quick integration of automation and the Internet of Things. The goal of this project is to create a strong intrusion detection and control system that can recognize and lessen security risks in CPS settings. The suggested approach makes use of deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. To guarantee data consistency, pre-processing procedures such as mean-based imputation and min–max scaling come after data collection. ADASYN data augmentation is used to address class imbalance, while entropy analysis and statistical techniques are used to extract key features. The intrusion detection phase uses a combination of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BI-LSTM) networks to capture both spatial and temporal relationships in the data, while a hybrid feature selection technique improves the model’s performance. A deep Q-network (DQN) handles attack mitigation and uses reinforcement learning to adjust to new threats. Detecting attack patterns with high sensitivity (0.984), specificity (0.983), and accuracy (0.991626) for dataset 1, the accuracy of dataset 2 is 0.985 for 70% of training and 0.988 for 80% of training, and the Proposed-DBID-Net architecture enhances CPS security in Industry 4.0. The evaluation phase emphasizes how crucial feature selection is to maximize the model’s accuracy. In conclusion, this study offers a thorough and flexible method for protecting CPS in Industry 4.0, guaranteeing accuracy and scalability across changing cyber threats.},

  abstract     = {A significant number of image processing and evaluation processes are presented and applied, due to their practical significance, in a variety of disciplines in the literature related to image processing and computer vision. One pre-processing approach that is frequently used to improve the information in a class of images is thresholding. By grouping correlated pixels according to the selected thresholds, the thresholding approach improves the image. For the benchmark image suite in this study, an entropy-based threshold is put into place. This study aims to investigate the thresholding performance of well-recognized fitness function called Kapur’s entropy, for a selected threshold. To facilitate the automatic identification of the optimum threshold (Th) on the benchmark images for a specified threshold value $$(Th=3, 5, 7)$$ , there is a need for an optimization algorithm that determines the optimum threshold values for the given image under study. This research proposed a self-adaptive hybrid differential evolution (DE) based transient search optimizer (TSO) called DETSO. DETSO uses the search equations of DE algorithm to improve the exploration capability of original TSO. Additionally, self-adaptivity has been included by modifying scaling factor and crossover rate using exponential decreasing and logarithmic decreasing mutation operator, respectively. The CEC 2019 numerical test problems have been used to confirm the working efficiency of DETSO. The experimental investigation confirms that utilizing a benchmark image test suite with varying dimensions, the DETSO helps to get superior results in achieving better threshold values in terms of performance metrics, such as PSNR, SSIM, FSIM, MSE, etc., compared to the other competitive heuristic algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel hybrid metaheuristic, the Hybrid Coati Optimization Algorithm with Differential Evolution (HCOADE), developed to address complex global optimization tasks and constrained engineering design problems. HCOADE integrates the exploration-driven behaviour of the Coati Optimization Algorithm (COA)-inspired by the social foraging and predation strategies of coatis-with the powerful mutation and crossover mechanisms of Differential Evolution (DE), thereby achieving a balanced and adaptive search process. The hybridization enhances global exploration and local exploitation, enabling the algorithm to efficiently navigate diverse and challenging optimization landscapes. To rigorously evaluate its performance, HCOADE is tested on benchmark suites from CEC 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2022, which encompass unimodal, multimodal, hybrid, and composition functions. It is also applied to real-world constrained engineering problems, such as pressure vessel design, cantilever beam optimization, and reinforced concrete beam design. Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art algorithms—including COA, DE, RSA, PSO, SSA, BBO, QIO, DMOA, and others—demonstrate that HCOADE consistently delivers superior solution quality, faster convergence, and higher robustness. Quantitative results show that HCOADE achieved the 1st place average rank across all four benchmark suites. It obtained top performance on 80% of the functions in CEC 2014, 66.7% in CEC 2017, 70% in CEC 2020, and 66.7% in CEC 2022. Furthermore, HCOADE outperformed or matched CEC competition-winning algorithms such as LSHADE-cnEpSin, LSHADE-SPACMA, and CMA-ES on numerous challenging functions of CEC 2017. Statistical analyses, including Wilcoxon Rank Sum Tests and ranking evaluations, confirm the significance and reliability of HCOADE’s performance. Furthermore, convergence behaviour, measurement of exploration and exploitation, and sensitivity analysis highlight the algorithm’s adaptability and stability across varied problem domains. This study contributes a computationally efficient and generalizable hybrid optimization framework, offering a promising solution for theoretical benchmarks and real-world engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {A crucial part of agriculture is detecting insects that increase yield productivity. Insects in agricultural land are both helpful and harmful. The harmful insects are detected and controlled as early as possible, but these control measures should not affect the beneficial insects that help crops to grow. The existing pest detection models are image-based models where the preciseness of the insect detection is based on their appearance in the respective image, which may lead to the misclassification of insect classes if the insects are not present in the image properly. By analyzing consecutive frames rather than a still image, the proposed approach detects live insect objects from the video rather than a still image, where the presence of insects is identified by analyzing consecutive frames. As a result, insects can be detected without relying on the appearance of a single still image, which helps mitigate insects' misclassification. A wide range of applications in computer vision has proven that deep learning approaches are highly effective and popular. This study employs a variety of three deep learning-based object detection networks coupled with multiple backbone networks to maximize their efficiency. Each model is initially pre-trained using the COCO dataset to improve its performance. Experimental results show that SSD_MobileNet_V2 outperformed other models on insect classification and detection tasks. Regarding insect classification tasks, the SSD_MobileNet_V2 achieved an accuracy and F1 score of 98.02% and 97.99%, respectively. On the insect detection task, the mAP is 98.8% at a detection time of about 0.18 s. Also, it is delivered with a smaller model size of 6.5 MB, making it suitable for handheld devices.},

We evaluated 13 pre-trained CNN models, including AlexNet, VGG19, and ResNet, with AlexNet emerging as the top performer, achieving 71% accuracy validated through statistical analysis using Duncan’s multiple range test. To further enhance accuracy, we propose a novel fusion approach that integrates shallow features—extracted via 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (2D-DFT) and Hilbert transform—from the images with deep features from AlexNet. The deep features are combined with these shallow features to create an enriched feature vector. This vector, consisting of 1000 deep features, 140 2D-DFT features, and 140 Hilbert transform features, is classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The hybrid model achieved an accuracy of 86%. Manual grain quality assessment is subjective and time-consuming; our automated framework addresses this challenge by providing a more objective and efficient evaluation. The integration of diverse features not only improves classification accuracy but also underscores the potential of combining various information sources for robust grain quality assessment.},

  abstract     = {Pavement crack detection is widely spread over road maintenance, ensuring the longevity and safety of infrastructure. Traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. In response, automated crack detection systems based on deep learning have emerged, offering more efficient and accurate solutions. However, existing models often face challenges such as large model sizes, slow inference speeds, and limited applicability in real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a novel light-weight Crack Regional Segmentation method based on YOLOv11, which introduces attention mechanisms to address challenges in pavement images, such as varying crack sizes, occlusion, and irregular surface textures. By embedding a region-based attention mechanism into the YOLOv11 network, the method enhances the model’s ability to focus on crack features. Specifically, the model network layers are progressively pruned to reduce the number of parameters and floating-point operations, thereby further improving operational efficiency and refining detection in the target regions. Furthermore, to tackle issues with blurred or indistinct crack boundaries, we present a fuzzy information-guided YOLOv11-based model, FIG-YOLO. This model integrates fuzzy logic and fuzzy membership functions to handle uncertainty in crack detection. The fuzzy membership functions are used to quantify the degree of crack features, allowing the model to better distinguish between crack and non-crack regions, especially in cases where crack boundaries are unclear. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of crack detection and segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively addresses challenges such as complex backgrounds and blurred crack edges in pavement images. This research not only provides a novel solution for the automated detection of pavement cracks but also offers insights into the development of intelligent road maintenance systems. With the expansion of large-scale datasets and the advancement of deep learning models, pavement crack detection algorithms are expected to further enhance their accuracy and efficiency, offering significant support for road infrastructure management.},

  abstract     = {The pandemic outbreak has revealed significant flaws in the complex and highly fragmented Healthcare Supply Chain’s (HSC’s). However, two major issues persist in the HSCs, leading to inefficiencies: transparency in vaccine distribution and accuracy in demand forecasting. The recent pandemic has highlighted and intensified existing vulnerabilities in HSC’s, leading to the effective utilization of digital technologies to manage them. This research proposes a novel framework that merges Blockchain (BC) and Machine Learning (ML) to bolster the HSCs amidst pandemics, by developing a framework named the Predictive BlockVax Distribution Network (PBDN) model. The proposed PBDN model utilizes BC for securing transactions and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), for precise demand prediction. Leveraging Hyperledger Besu, which represents an Ethereum client that is accessible for public use, the PBDN framework ensures BC’s privacy, scalability, and efficient network operations, while LSTM’s advanced forecasting outperforms traditional models and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. This integration showcases a significant leap in managing vaccine distribution and enhancing system resilience, fairness, and transparency. The proposed PBDN model illustrates the potential of BC and ML together to tackle pandemic-induced Supply Chains (SC’s) disruptions, providing a decentralized solution that supports autonomous, informed decision-making without third-party dependency. This approach not only addresses immediate challenges but also sets a precedent for future crisis response, emphasizing the need for robust, Transparent Supply Chain’s (TSC’s).},

Although graph convolutional network-based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance in triplet extraction tasks, they often ignore distance features and semantic information when capturing sentence information. As a result, the integration of syntactic and semantic information remains suboptimal, negatively impacting sentiment analysis performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Syntax-Semantics Graph Convolutional Network for aspect sentiment triplet extraction. Our method first extracts syntactic structural information using the probability matrix of dependency trees, from which a mask matrix is constructed based on the varying distances between words. Next, semantic information is captured via a self-attention mechanism and an aspect-attention mechanism, utilizing an attention score matrix. Finally, an interaction module is introduced to effectively integrate syntactic and semantic features. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving an average F1-score improvement of at least 1.083%.},

The satellite imagery is collected using Google Earth Pro for the region ’Tharparkar’ in Pakistan’s Sindh province. Tharparkar is one of the most drought-stricken regions in Pakistan. The proposed approach combines conventional machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN)) with ensemble methods (Bagging and Voting) in a layered fashion for detecting drought from satellite imagery. The novelty of the study lies in its layered ensemble architecture that integrates multiple conventional classifiers with ensemble techniques for improved drought detection accuracy using satellite imagery. The validation of the model is computed using the stratified split method. The developed classification model is evaluated using well-established indexes, including accuracy, precision, recall, F measure, and Area Under Curve (AUC). Among the classical models, the Decision Tree classifier performed best with an accuracy of 82.17%, a precision of 82.53%, a recall of 82. 28%, and an F1 score of 82.35%. Within the Bagging models, Bagged Decision Tree achieved the highest performance, attaining an accuracy of 84.78%, a precision of 85.14%, a recall of 84.87%, and an F1 score of 84.91%. The final-layer Voting ensemble outperformed all previous models, yielding the highest F1 score of 84.80%. Based on experimental results, the proposed model has strong potential for practical deployment in real-world environmental monitoring systems.},

  abstract     = {The concept of sustainable transport has been proposed and implemented in cities around the world to facilitate transition to sustainability. Reducing carbon emissions and increasing accessibility in an economically feasible way has been the core objective of sustainable transport initiatives in cities. The complexity of the transport systems requires a decision framework that would take this complexity as well as uncertainty into account while proposing solutions for sustainable transport issues. Current worldwide developments, such as the COVID-19 outbreak and international tensions, economic crises, and climate change, have heightened uncertainty regarding decisions that affect sustainable transportation challenges. Classical decision methods are no longer sufficient to tackle sustainable transport issues in this economically, socially, and environmentally uncertain environment. This is evidenced by the rapid proliferation of the studies using some sort of fuzzy decision systems on developing solutions for sustainable transport problems. Fuzzy decision systems provide new frameworks of decision-making that would appropriately take the uncertainty into account for the sustainable transport decisions and problems. This study provides an overview of existing research on studies that utilize fuzzy decision systems for sustainable public transport, excluding logistics transport from its scope. Additionally, a thematic analysis is conducted on the types of fuzzy decision methods and sustainable transport topics, aiming to summarize the existing literature and guide future research in this field.},

  abstract     = {In the context of a low-carbon economy, scientific methods to reduce carbon emissions have become an important issue for many ports. Carbon emissions in port areas mainly arise from vessels and handling equipment. Therefore, an effective resource assignment and equipment arrangement system could not only reduce carbon emissions, but also improve the port’s operational efficiency. This study considers factors such as the arrival order of container trailers, the cargo weight, and the number of container rehandling operations. The objective is to minimize the carbon emissions and the number of container rehandling operations in ports, for which a mixed-integer linear programming model is built. Both heuristic algorithms and hyper-heuristic algorithms are employed to optimize the container storage plan, and their applicability in storage optimization is compared. The results indicate that hyper-heuristic algorithms outperform heuristic algorithms in terms of solution quality and stability, effectively satisfying the storage requirements of the yard while minimizing the carbon emissions and the number of container rehandling operations. The results provide theoretical support for port enterprises in improving their operational efficiency and achieving their goals regarding low carbon emissions.},

  abstract     = {The rise in popularity of face anti-spoofing is attributed to its crucial role in safeguarding face recognition systems. Perpetrators use either a photo or a video to execute a face-spoofing attack on the authentication system of an authorized user, aiming to gain access to the user’s resources. Traditional face anti-spoofing detection techniques often rely on grey texture elements while disregarding RGB color intensity features in face images, which lead to a loss of certain facial information. On the other hand, RGB-based methods could introduce noise or superfluous elements that reduce the effectiveness of spoofing detection. Furthermore, in real-world situations, color disparities may be introduced by lighting, camera settings, and other elements. Therefore, a face anti-spoofing detection approach based on a novel Encoder Convolutional Neural Network (ECNN) architecture, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Local Ternary Pattern (LTP) descriptors is proposed. The proposed ECNN can more effectively extract the RGB color brightness features. It encodes the brightness intensity change of the RGB color transition, which can recognize intricate spoofing attempts. The texture descriptors of LBP and LTP are utilized to extract the texture's grayscale structural information to overcome different environmental situations. This work combined the human face's intensity RGB color and grey texture categorization parameters to increase the detection accuracy of face spoofing and produce positive experimental outcomes. We contrast our proposed method with alternative algorithms and verify its performance using three publicly available datasets, showcasing its superiority.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal learning heterogeneous graphs are very challenging because of the diverse structures and data modalities. The existing graph neural networks cannot efficiently capture both the multimodality of the data and the inherent heterogeneity of such graphs. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Representation Learning Heterogeneous Graph Neural network (MM-HGNN) to tackle these challenges. MM-HGNN introduces a novel Modality Transferability Function to quantify the heterogeneity between different modalities, which allows the model to dynamically adjust the attention scores and give precedence to unique information that is non-redundant. Additionally, it integrates modality-level attention that distributes attention in an adaptive way over different modalities according to their relevance, enhancing feature representations for tasks such as node classification. To further improve representation learning, a splicing mechanism is proposed to integrate outputs from multiple network layers, combining high-level features for more expressive node embeddings. We validate the effectiveness of MM-HGNN through extensive experiments on the IMDB and Amazon datasets. Our model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods under the Macro-F1, Micro-F1, and AUC metrics by a large margin, which well demonstrates its strong capability in dealing with the challenging multimodal and heterogeneous data. Comprehensive ablation studies further emphasize the contributions of each key component in improving the overall performance.},

This research introduces Deep Learning-based Green Optimization for Enterprise Production (DeepGreen-Opt), a deep learning-driven framework designed to analyze energy consumption patterns, predict demand, and optimize resource allocation in real time. The DeepGreen-Opt framework integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for accurate energy consumption forecasting and Adaptive Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (AHPSO) for dynamic energy optimization.

The DeepGreen-Opt framework was specifically validated across multiple industrial sectors, including automotive manufacturing, steel production facilities, and chemical processing plants, where intelligent energy management demonstrates significant operational improvements. By implementing DeepGreen-Opt, enterprises can achieve cost-effective production while aligning with sustainability objectives. The framework ensures energy-efficient operations, reducing resource waste and improving production efficiency. Experimental validation on industrial datasets demonstrates a 15% increase in energy efficiency and a 12% improvement in overall production performance compared to existing approaches.

Literature highlights challenges such as the limited expressiveness of summaries from classical protoforms, the need to explore relationships between them to find more useful patterns and refining language to improve their interpretability and usefulness. The latter is increasingly significant as the demand for explainability grows with the rise of black-box AI applications. This paper proposes SUMMARIA, a XAI support methodology by generating composite (enriched) linguistic summaries of qualitative data. A framework is formalized integrating Linguistic Data Summarization with the concept of rhetorical relation and defining the structure and quality metrics of a composite linguistic summary. Three abstract forms of composite linguistic summaries representing Evidence, Contrast and Emphasis relations are specified, inspired by Rhetorical Structure Theory. Also, a method based on Association Rules Mining, implements SUMMARIA in problem-solving via five algorithms. An empirical study tested SUMMARIA’s application on two judicial datasets and a substantially different behavior was found for four different scenarios, which reveals its sensitivity to the nature and distribution of the primary data. A human-expert validation was performed showing that the linguistic summaries are understandable and the relation type implicit in them is recognizable by the users.},

  abstract     = {Modern airports, as pivotal nodes in global transportation networks, face increasing resilience challenges from compound threats such as extreme weather events and cyberattacks. However, current assessment methods primarily rely on subjective evaluations and lack probabilistic reasoning to account for the dynamic interdependencies among resilience factors. To address this gap, this study presents a hybrid Bayesian network–best worst method (BN–BWM) framework aimed at improving the accuracy and practicality of airport system resilience assessments. While Bayesian networks are effective for modeling complex probabilistic dependencies, expert-based probability assignments often introduce subjectivity. To mitigate this, we apply the best worst method (BWM) to conduct systematic pairwise comparison. Building on this, we leverage the BWM’s systematic pairwise comparisons, conducted with 10 aviation experts, to generate conditional probability tables for the Bayesian network. The results indicate that large airports demonstrate higher resilience levels (84–85%), whereas medium-sized airports exhibit moderate resilience (79%). Sensitivity analysis identifies key factors influencing resilience, including emergency repair systems and personnel capabilities, thereby offering actionable insights into improving airport operations. This study presents a robust, data-driven framework that enhances the objectivity and accuracy of resilience evaluations, providing theoretical support for sustainable airport management and operational safety.},

  abstract     = {Hate speech (HS) has grown because of increasing social media platform usage, which includes Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook. The frequent attempts to implement automated detection systems remain unsuccessful at separating hate speech from objectionable language, because user-generated content tends toward informal, brief, and diverse expressions. The determination of hate speech within texts proves exceptionally hard, since precise context detection is needed to distinguish abusive language from neutral statements. Precision in hate speech identification and filtering stands essential, because these online content forms have negative impacts on both minority and majority groups while heightening their conflicts. The research presents a stacked ensemble classification system that classifies tweets into three groups: hate speech, abusive language, or neutral. The framework uses term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF–IDF) extracted from tweet texts for which support vector machine (SVM), together with Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, base machine learning models function as classifiers. The final model outcome results from linking several base learning models into an ensemble configuration. The Kaggle Hate Speech data set served as training material for the system, because it contained 24,784 tweets along with eight attributes. The model performance received improvement through exclusion of manually derived features. The proposed ensemble model demonstrated superior performance with 96% accuracy, while each single classifier had lower accuracy rates (SVM: 93%, Random Forest: 94%, and XGBoost: 88%). The research outcomes show stacking represents an effective method to enhance systems for detecting hate speech operating on social media platforms.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposed deep learning for designing dance movements by estimating dance poses. In this study, we proposed Fusion-based Global Dance Pose Patterns with ResNet-152 an approach that resolves class imbalance existing in dance pose datasets with the help of high-resolution global feature fusion during pose estimation. A fusion layer has been added for discerning patterns on both the local and global levels, resulting in a considerable improvement in classifier performance thereby yielding a referred reliability for discriminative power to dance pose classification applications. Refinement in feature extraction and using deep new models such as ResNet-152 for pose recognition have helped to capitalize on model overfitting and worse generalization problems. This approach indeed goes a long way in making dance pose classification more accurate and efficient with possible real-time applications, in addition to a better understanding of the dance movements themselves. Experimental results indicate promising performances, with high accuracies (0.9870), precisions (0.9851), sensitivities (0.9873), F-measures (0.9861), and Kappa (0.9841) constituting proof of the model competency. The workflow comprises a stage for data collection, pre-processing is then applied using Gaussian filtering and histogram equalization to improve image features, the class imbalance is countered using SMOTE, feature extraction on HR-Net, and global and local feature fusion leads to robust pose estimations. ResNet-152 acts as a classifier with an SGD optimizer for better model parameter optimization. This system highly accurately predicts dance poses and efficiently approaches pose estimation in various dance application fields.},

Consequently, rapid and accurate identification of wood species becomes extremely crucial. With the recent advancements in deep learning, wood classification based on digital images is currently relatively popular method. Nevertheless, there still exist some challenges, such as the difficulty in integrating plant phenological and texture features and the inability to automatically select features of inter-class images. This paper presents a multi-source feature fusion classification, which combines traditional local feature description with automatic feature extraction by deep learning. The proposed method reduces misclassification and addresses the imbalance problem in wood data. Besides, the method is validated on the microscopic cross-sectional images of 75 broad-leaved wood species, with an accuracy of 94.0%, indicating its potential for application in the classification of imbalanced wood data. The comparison experiments with other existing models on the wood dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

To address this issue, this paper proposes an end-to-end recognition technology solution for in-situ pyrolysis state of oil shale using electronic nose. The proposed solution integrates Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to capture the spatial correlations among different sensors in the electronic nose and the temporal characteristics of the data, respectively. It is designed to identify both the pyrolysis state classification and the oil shale maturity regression tasks. Our model achieves 93.87% accuracy on the task of classifying the pyrolysis stage of oil shale; the $$R^2$$ on the regression task reaches 0.93. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare its performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in this field.

  abstract     = {Energy consumption remains a critical challenge for low-power, resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices operating over Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). Addressing this issue requires the development of energy-efficient Objective Functions (OFs) within the RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) routing protocol. Traditional OFs primarily used routing layer metrics for parent selection. Therefore, our analysis demonstrates that transmission dynamics at the MAC layer significantly impact overall energy consumption. To tackle this, we introduce a cross-layer energy-efficient objective function (CL-RPL-OF) that incorporates a novel metric, energy per packet (EPP), which quantifies the energy consumed during the transmission and reception of a single data packet. This metric integrates strobe per packet rate (SPPR) and strobe packet success rate, both of which are influenced by radio duty cycling (RDC) mechanisms at the media access control (MAC) layer. The proposed CL-RPL-OF considers node-to-node communication variations arising from relative phase shifts by combining EEP with expected transmission count (ETX) and SPPR using fuzzy logic to select the best path to optimize energy consumption across both routing and MAC layers. Simulation using Cooja and real-world experimentation using the FIT IoT-LAB testbed demonstrate that CL-RPL-OF significantly improves energy efficiency, increases packet delivery ratio, and reduces strobe overhead compared to existing objective functions.},

Existing methods often rely on noisy pseudo ground truth, which introduces performance degradation such as jittering and drifting. To overcome these limitations, we propose a confidence-aware framework grounded in biomechanics. Our method adopts the SKEL model to provide anatomically constrained pose representations, reducing dependency on imprecise annotations. We further introduce a conditional normalizing flow to model per-parameter uncertainty conditioned on visual and motion features. Additionally, a novel evaluation metric, confidence-weighted procrustes aligned MPJPE, is proposed to incorporate confidence scores into performance assessment. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms existing methods on multiple datasets in both accuracy and motion smoothness. It demonstrates strong robustness against noisy annotations, and confidence estimates align closely with actual prediction errors. Ablation studies validate the contributions of both biomechanical modeling and confidence learning. Overall, our framework provides a unified and robust solution for 3D human reconstruction in real-world settings.},

A significant component of this study is the weight assignment and multiple decision levels, which enables decision makers to rank goals and customize solutions according to specific transportation needs. This technique makes decision making easier while also provides flexibility in dealing with difficult real-world situations. Furthermore, we compare our proposed model with other approaches that are currently in use, such as the intuitionistic fuzzy approach and the goal programming approach.

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are among the most extensively used deep learning methods for various computer vision tasks. Utilizing an innovative quantum adversarial denoising architecture, denoised image samples are produced from a noisy distribution. In this paper, the authors employ an architecture of quantum deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (QDCGAN) for denoising medical images.

  abstract     = {Poly-cystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent condition that impinges women in their prime reproductive years. Its primary trait is the elevated levels of androgen, a male hormone in female body and leads to several symptoms, including ovarian cysts, irregular menstruation cycles, infertility, obesity, and excessive hair development. Since PCOS exact cause is unknown and its symptoms are uncertain, a timely and accurate diagnosis is essential. In these situations, a (ML) Machine Learning-based PCOS prediction model aids in the diagnostic procedure, addresses time constraints and potential inaccuracies. A plethora of feature selection techniques have been built to discover the best optimal features for the classification of medical dataset. However, finding an efficient solution is still difficult due to noise and redundant information which may degrade the model performance. In this article, a hybrid filter-wrapper approach is proposed to identify the optimal attributes. An ensemble filter method is built, the union of top k attributes from individual filters is considered for further process. Then, Reinforcement Learning-based Binary Equilibrium Optimizer is used to find the reduced optimal features. Here, RL uses SARSA (State–Action–Reward–State–Action) to increase the population diversity in the search space, to avoid the problem of local optima, finally balances the exploration capability during the search. Then, identified optimal features are given as input to BMFK (Bonferroni Mean Fuzzy KNN) classifier and achieved 96.32% of accuracy. Further, several machine learning classifiers have been employed for the prompt diagnosis of PCOS. Finally, Random Forest has produced the highest accuracy of 95.62% than other models.},

  abstract     = {The civil aviation industry continues to face the significant problem of flight delays, which impacts operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction. This research aims to develop an innovative model that accurately predicts civil aviation flight delays and provides insights related to performance enhancement. The proposed Flight Delay Prediction Network with Spatio-Temporal Learning (FlightNet-ST) is a hybrid deep learning architecture that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNNs) to achieve this goal. The model is trained using datasets of domestic flights that include geographical, operational, and temporal data, such as geographical separation, origin–destination pairs, airline rules, scheduled departure times, and dates. The approach involves running time series data through LSTM to capture temporal dependencies, applying 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNNs) to analyze aircraft route grids dynamically, and utilizing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to discover topological patterns from spatial airport connectivity. Delay prediction is powered by a unified representation that fuses these disparate elements. Based on the experimental data, FlightNet-ST achieves a 14.47% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Additionally, an attention mechanism enhances interpretability by highlighting key aspects that influence delays, such as departure time blocks and airport-specific trends. Finally, FlightNet-ST helps with civil aviation flight delay prediction and management with its data-driven, interpretable, and robust solution. This methodology facilitates real-time operational decision-making and provides tactics to mitigate delays.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel hybrid forecasting model for coking coal prices, integrating complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, enhanced by an improved fruit fly optimization algorithm (IFOA). The approach begins with CEEMDAN decomposing the coking coal price sequence into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residual component, effectively mitigating non-stationarity and nonlinearity. High- and low-frequency IMFs are differentiated using a single-sample T-test, with high-frequency components consolidated to minimize noise interference. Subsequently, the IFOA algorithm optimizes LSTM hyperparameters, boosting both generalization and prediction precision. Empirical validation, leveraging the Platts price index for four major imported coking coal varieties, demonstrates that the CEEMDAN-IFOA-LSTM model significantly outperforms a broad range of benchmarks, including ANN, IFOA-LSSVR, CEEMDAN-LSTM, LSTM, BiLSTM, TCN, IFOA-LSTM, CEEMDAN-FOA-LSTM, CEEMDAN-PSO-LSTM, and CEEMDAN-GA-LSTM, achieving reduced root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The study concludes that this model adeptly addresses the challenges of nonlinear coupling and hyperparameter optimization, offering a reliable tool for coking coal price forecasting. Future research will aim to refine the model further to adapt to diverse market conditions and enhance forecasting accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Recent severe aviation accidents have underscored the intricate challenges within the aviation system, necessitating a more comprehensive understanding of hazards’ interrelation in flight operation. This study integrates the Threat and Error Management (TEM) framework with complex network theory to construct a Flight Operation Hazard Network (FOHN) based on 260 aviation occurrence reports. The FOHN, comprising 120 nodes (hazards) and 208 edges (causal links), exhibits unique structural characteristics: a low clustering coefficient (0.03), long average path length (4.20), and an exponential degree distribution (R2 = 0.994), confirming the absence of small-world and scale-free properties. These features reflect aviation’s defense-in-depth strategy, where sparse connectivity aims to isolate hazards. Analysis of the FOHN’s response to simulated hazard mitigation reveals its relative stability against non-targeted hazard removal but significant disruption when critical high-betweenness hazards are targeted for mitigation. The study identifies crew navigation errors as key risk mediators, bridging technical failures and organizational deficiencies. By proposing actionable enhancements grounded in these network findings—including resilience-augmented training, flight data-driven risk prioritization, and regulatory updates—this work provides a network-centric framework to address “black swan” risks in modern aviation systems.},

Accurate prediction of crimes is crucial for law enforcement agencies to prevent proactively criminal activity and allocate resources effectively. Existing methods often address architecture design and hyperparameter tuning as separate processes. We present a combination of neural architecture search and hyperparameter tuning for improved crime prediction. The study method achieved automation of architecture discovery and fine-tuning of hyperparameters by utilizing Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to explore a wide range of neural network architectures for crime prediction and optimizing the hyperparameters of the discovered architecture for peak performance in binary crime prediction, respectively. The study used three datasets: criminal cases dataset (self-collected dataset), Vancouver crime data, and Austin crime data. The criminal cases dataset is extracted from a confidential database from certain countries, focusing on sensitive parts of those countries. The Vancouver crime and Austin crime datasets were sourced from the Kaggle website. The study considered the robust rank aggregation (RRA) feature selection method to rank and select the best features to predict crime behavior in some countries. The chosen features using robust rank aggregation included current position, age range, month, prisoner condition, and identified/unidentified (ide/unide). The hyperparameter tuning model of Architecture Search (NAS +) produced superior results across all datasets with an accuracy of 89.29% (AUC-ROC = 94.82% and recall = 64.54%) in the criminal cases dataset, 60.37% (AUC-ROC = 50.00% and recall = 100.00%) in the Vancouver dataset, and 86.68% (AUC_ROC = 65.40% and recall = 100.00%) in the findings which demonstrated that the proposed approach consistently outperforms conventional methods, making it an effective solution for the prediction of real-world crimes.},

  abstract     = {As a common consumer product threatening public health, tobacco not only hinders the development of national public health, but also plays a significant impact on the national economy. The ARIMA model is reliable in learning linear or regular relationships, while the deep learn, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM), is superior when capturing and learning nonlinear relationships. Combining time-series forecasting models with deep learning technologies, the hybrid architecture could integrate advantages and optimize forecasting effect. In this paper, leveraging 2023 daily sales data from a Southern Chinese tobacco company, this study proposes a new hybrid deep learning framework that integrates ARIMA, CNN, and LSTM models to address these inherent limitations and enhance prediction accuracy. This architecture decomposes forecasting tasks into linear trend analysis and nonlinear residual learning. The ARIMA component learns the linear relationship, and the CNN–LSTM component plays the role in the residual-driven correction. They enable synergistic capture of temporal dependencies and localized anomalies and enhancing the fitting effect. This hybrid model's optimization primarily relies on the residual-driven correction mechanism in the CNN–LSTM component, which significantly enhanced the model interpretability ( $${R}^{2}$$ : 0.95, enhance 10.5% compare with ARIMA model, enhance 13.1% compare with CNN-LSTM model). This research not only advances hybrid deep learning methods, but also provides a scalable solution for precise predictions in dynamic markets.

  abstract     = {Chronic liver disease (CLD) segmentation and classification present significant challenges due to inaccurate diagnosis and misleading clinical treatment processes. In contemporary times, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) models are considered important tools for driving quantitative biomarkers for efficient stratification and computer-aided diagnosis support. However, prevailing DL models necessitate further enhancements as they rely on flawed assumptions that tumors exhibit non-complex physical structures and uniform image boundaries. To resolve this concern, this paper suggests a novel dual encoder deep learning structure named DEDSWIN-Net to mitigate this problem. The proposed framework consists of four components: a dilated convolution-based encoder, a transformer-based encoder, a multi-scale multiple feature fusion decoder (MSMFD), and a DL training model. The dilated convolution layers can retrieve fine spatial features, whereas Swin models are designed to obtain global information. Both these features are integrated by the MSMFD component that enhances segmentation. Finally, the deep learning training model is constructed using feed-forward principles for better classification of CLD. Comprehensive evaluation is conducted utilizing the LiTS2017-CT Image dataset comprising 100 hepatic disorders, and its performance is evaluated using ten powerful metrics: Jaccard Index (Jcc), dice similarity coefficient (DICE), precision (P), accuracy (Acc), specificity (Spec), recall (R), F1 score (FS), average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), Hausdorff distance (HD), and Intersection over Union (IoU). Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art DL frameworks are considered for comprehensive examination. Results demonstrate that the suggested methodology reveals supreme performance in terms of segmentation and classification with DICE: 0.984, JC: 0.92, IoU: 0.02, precision: 0.95, recall: 0.940, ASSD: 0.64, and HD: 0.32. Moreover, the exploratory outcomes prove the effectiveness of the suggested methodology in obtaining relevant characteristics, fuelling a better computer-aided diagnosis system for CLD.},

A suspicious activity database is used for further analysis to detect the activities accurately. Secondary Monitoring Phase uses stochastic gradient Grad-CAM to identify objects related to individuals in the scene using suspicious object detection. Correlations between suspicious objects and activities detected in the first phase enable the detection of these objects. The Tertiary Monitoring Phase combines the outputs of the previous phases for tracking people and objects. In Track RCNN, individuals and suspicious objects are tracked robustly and associated with multiple frames.

  abstract     = {Fitness landscape (FL) is an effective tool for describing and analyzing the real-time dynamics of the search process, offering valuable insights into the population’s varying states. In particle swarm optimization for complex optimization challenges, parameter selection significantly influences performance across various population states. However, current methods for constructing fitness landscapes demonstrate insufficient theoretical analysis of state parameters and involve high construction time costs. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a dynamic state cluster-based particle swarm optimization (DSCPSO) algorithm, which employs population phenotypic entropy based on clustering technique. (1) The algorithm provides theoretical splitting points by mathematically analyzing the population into four states: convergence, exploitation, escape, and exploration, enabling more effective parameter adaptive mechanisms. (2) DSCPSO incorporates sinusoidal chaos mapping to dynamically adjust inertia weights, allowing particles to better align with the population’s evolutionary state. (3) During the convergence state, an intelligent particle migration strategy (IPMS) enhances search efficiency within the solution space, preventing unnecessary computational resource consumption. Eventually, comparative analysis with 10 advanced existing algorithms on the CEC2017 and CEC2022 benchmark suites demonstrates that DSCPSO achieves competitive performance across over 70% of the functions, validating the algorithm’s effectiveness and superiority. In addition, the Wilcoxon-test of the algorithm verifies the validity of the algorithm, and also applies the algorithm to a high-dimensional feature selection problem, which demonstrates the ability of the proposed algorithm to solve real-world problems.},

  abstract     = {A multi-resource balanced allocation method using a genetic-heuristic fusion algorithm is proposed to address the imbalance in distributed power generation resource allocation and the over-generation problem in virtual power plants. By establishing models of wind, solar, storage, and controllable load characteristics, an optimization model is constructed with objectives of resource allocation balance and minimization of call costs, subject to constraints such as power balance. Combining the global search capability of a genetic algorithm and the local optimization capability of an ant colony algorithm, the genetic algorithm stage adopts real-number encoding and a dynamic crossover-mutation strategy, while the ant colony algorithm stage optimizes the pheromone update mechanism to avoid premature convergence. The experimental results show that this method achieves 100% accurate allocation of resources without any over-generation occurrences and reduces the resource allocation deviation rate by 32–67% compared to alternative methods. The algorithm demonstrates fast convergence, yielding solutions in less than 0.6 s across 14 repeated experiments, with an average convergence time reduction of 42% compared to traditional algorithms. Under a comprehensive fluctuation scenario with 30% renewable energy fluctuation rate and 15% load forecasting error, the system stability index remains at 0.865, demonstrating the algorithm’s efficiency and robustness under complex conditions and providing an effective approach for optimizing virtual power plant resource allocation.},

The online version starts to train itself and to make decisions to accept or reject the candidate solution with the start of the metaheuristic. The offline version uses a trained and well-tuned Q-learning and deep Q-learning based acceptance criteria to make accept/reject decisions. Our experimental study compares our proposed acceptance criteria with existing ones, such as fuzzy rule-based acceptance (FRBA) and simulated annealing-like acceptance (SALA) criteria.

  abstract     = {Computer science (CS) has changed educational processes in a wide range of academic fields and is now considered to be an essential part of modern education. This manuscript presents a novel methodology in which CS can be used to solve judgment concerns in education. The conventional education system frequently finds it difficult to deal with the ambiguities and linguistic expressions that are an integral component of human judgment and choice-making processes. By combining probabilistic uncertainty with linguistic concepts, a probabilistic linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (PLq-ROFS) presents an efficient mathematical methodology for describing inaccurate and unclear facts to handle these concerns. For aggregating the assessment data, we first propose the PLq-ROF Heronian mean operators. The maximizing deviation methodology is a helpful tool when dealing with situations where the knowledge about the attribute weights is either partially or fully unknown. To find attribute weights, this study presents the PLq-ROF-maximizing deviation methodology. We also propose the multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis (MOORA) methodology with PLq-ROFNs to evaluate the options and identify an optimal choice. Furthermore, a case study related to the judgment process on CS applications in education is provided from the PLq-ROFS perspective to illustrate the effectiveness and use of the developed technique. The numerical results show that $${\mathbb {A}}_{4}$$ (namely: skill development) is the best CS application in education.},

  abstract     = {Nanomaterials are a key component of nanoelectronics and selecting the most suitable nanomaterial for nanoelectronics remains a significant challenge for companies. The classical decision making process is often difficult and uncertain when identifying the ideal nanomaterial. To address this, we develop a novel decision making model based on a fuzzy credibility neural network with Hamacher aggregation operators. We apply the proposed model to select the most suitable nanomaterial for nanoelectronics. For this purpose, we collect information matrices from three experts regarding various nanomaterials. To analyze these matrices, we use entropy to calculate the weights of each criterion. After determining the weights, we apply fuzzy credibility Hamacher weighted aggregation operators to combine the input signals and their corresponding weights in order to compute the hidden layer information for the nanomaterials. To ensure accurate and reliable results, we apply the fuzzy credibility Hamacher weighted aggregation operator once again to the hidden layer information, aggregating it with the appropriate weights to generate the output layer information. Next, we use a score function based on fuzzy credibility numbers to calculate the score values of the output information. After this, we apply three activation functions to compute the final output of the proposed model. Based on the results, graphene is identified as the best nanomaterial for nanoelectronics. Furthermore, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the proposed model by varying the Hamacher parameter. To confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach, we finally validate the results using three well-known MCDM methods.},

  abstract     = {This study presents an innovative hybrid Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) method for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that is resilient to environmental challenges and capable of dynamically assessing sensor reliability. Built upon a loosely coupled sensor fusion architecture, the system utilizes a novel hybrid Quaternion-focused Error-State EKF/UKF (Qf-ES-EKF/UKF) architecture to process inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. This architecture first propagates the entire state using an Error-State Extended Kalman Filter (ESKF) and then applies a targeted Scaled Unscented Kalman Filter (SUKF) step to refine only the orientation. This sequential process blends the accuracy of SUKF in quaternion estimation with the overall computational efficiency of ESKF. The reliability of visual measurements is assessed via a dynamic sensor confidence score based on metrics, such as image entropy, intensity variation, motion blur, and inference quality, adapting the measurement noise covariance to ensure stable pose estimation even under challenging conditions. Comprehensive experimental analyses on the EuRoC MAV dataset demonstrate key advantages: an average improvement of 49% in position accuracy in challenging scenarios, an average of 57% in rotation accuracy over ESKF-based methods, and SUKF-comparable accuracy achieved with approximately 48% lower computational cost than a full SUKF implementation. These findings demonstrate that the presented approach strikes an effective balance between computational efficiency and estimation accuracy, and significantly enhances UAV pose estimation performance in complex environments with varying sensor reliability.},

  abstract     = {Predicting diabetic types from ocular surface eye images is a challenging task due to subtle variations in features and the potential overlap in presentations among different diabetic types. While AI-based algorithms have shown promise in distinguishing these nuances, gaps remain in the accuracy and adaptability of existing models, especially in the context of medical imaging for diabetes classification. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a novel integration of AI and medical imaging through the Manta-ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) algorithm, which leverages cyclone aging (CA) and chain foraging (CF) strategies. We couple MRFO with hierarchical feature learning to optimize the InceptionV3 model, achieving optimal hyperparameter configuration and enhancing both accuracy and computational efficiency. The novelty of this work lies in the introduction of a newly curated dataset, Di-EYENET, which is specifically designed for diabetic eye studies and contains multiclass categories (Type-1, Type-2, and non-diabetic). Di-EYENET fills a significant gap in diabetic ocular research by offering a reliable, validated resource for training models on eye image datasets with distinct characteristics. Our results demonstrate that the InceptionV3 model, fine-tuned with the newly developed EYENET weights, outperforms both traditional ImageNet weights and other pretrained models, showing a 2% accuracy improvement. This research highlights the potential of nature-inspired optimization algorithms and tailored datasets to enhance AI model robustness and adaptability in the context of medical disease diagnosis, particularly in the field of diabetic eye disease.},

Our method utilizes the focal loss for combating data imbalance in EEG datasets, the Fisher score for enhancing the discrimination capability of the classes, and the average pairwise Pearson correlation for the reduction of redundant information between features in RSVP datasets. In such a sense, GWO functions as an exploration tool of the feature space, while DE further refines good candidates through a local exploitation. CFSFs are tested with a variety of classifiers ranging from traditional classifiers to deep learning, such as support vector machine (SVM), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), etc. Compared with those traditional optimization and classification pipelines, our hybrid GWO–DE method converges faster displacement, more efficient dimension reduction, higher detection accuracy, and classification accuracy, and F1 score result showed us 98.79% and 97.7%, respectively.

  abstract     = {Osteoporosis is a bone illness that minimizes bone strength and increases fracture risk. Machine learning methods have been applied to diagnose osteoporosis. However, the accuracy of osteoporosis disease prediction has not improved, nor has the time taken been reduced. To improve the accuracy of osteoporosis disease prediction efficiently, the Rosenthal canonical correlative explainable deep convolutional generative adversarial network (RCCEDCGAN) is proposed. It consists of four main processes: data acquisition, preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. Data samples are collected during data acquisition. Preprocessing includes using multivariate linear regression to fill in missing values and a Q statistical proximal test to identify outliers. Feature selection is carried out using Rosenthal canonical variants analysis for identifying and selecting pertinent features with less time. Finally, explainable deep convolutional generative adversarial network (EDCGAN) is employed for classifying and predicting osteoporosis. The clinical decision support system utilizes EDCGANs for osteoporosis risk prediction analysis based on the Rand indexive decision stump model to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosis and treatment planning. The quantitatively analyzed results show that the RCCEDCGAN method improved by 5% in disease prediction accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and 9% specificity compared to the RR model and modified GP classifier. RCCEDCGAN method showed a p-value of less than 0.05 and a confidence interval of 95% for developing osteoporosis. In addition, the RCCEDCGAN method reduced prediction time by 8% compared to the RR model and modified GP classifier techniques. Hence, the RCCEDCGAN is an effective approach for early diagnosis and risk reduction of osteoporosis, aiding in prevention and management strategies.},

Profile clustering allows users to engage in targeted marketing, skill-matching, and collaborative networking by grouping them based on similar attributes, interests, or professional criteria. However, one key drawback of user profile clustering is its sensitivity to noisy and missing data, high-dimensional feature spaces, poor semantic understanding, and complexity limitations. To overcome these issues, a novel Hybrid Aquila Quantum Sooty tern optimization for clustering (AQST-ClustNet) approach based on user profiles (UP) has been proposed in this paper. The user profile data is preprocessed using NLP techniques involving data stemming, handling of missing data or values, removal of stop words, and data extraction for eliminating inappropriate data. A Hybrid Aquila Quantum Sooty Tern Optimization (HAQSTO) algorithm is employed for clustering the user profile into healthcare professionals, marketing professionals, software developers, and educators. The efficiency of the developed method is assessed employing various metrics, including Calinski–Harabasz score (CHS), Silhouette score (SHS), and Davies–Bouldin score (DBS). The proposed model achieves less runtime of 45 s, whereas the existing techniques, such as MCEMS, DBSTexC, and TSMIUSC-Miner, achieve runtimes of 70 s, 79 s, and 60 s. Using the effective dual-stage feature extraction and clustering approach, the complexity of clustering and a high-dimensional feature space is effectively reduced.},

  abstract     = {Healthcare needs a major shift to more measurable and affordable solutions. The answer to these challenges is to focus on restructuring the healthcare system to prevent illness, not illness, and on disease prevention and early detection. The Internet of Things (IoT) communicates with mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) in a smart environment, making it more attractive and cost-effective for consumers. Recently, MANET-IoT systems have been used in many areas of live applications. In addition, most routing protocols are for MANET, but they are not compatible with MANET-IoT. However, one of the key apparatuses of the MANET-IoT system is the loss of records due to unreliable routing. In this article, we suggest an optimal cluster founded data loss aware routing protocol, MANET-IoT, for healthcare monitoring systems (OCDL-HM). First, we introduce efficient cluster formation using the butterfly-induced sunflower optimization (BSFO) algorithm, which enhances the energy efficiency of routing. Then, the cluster head (CH) of every cluster is computed through a cuckoo search based deep probability neural network (CS-DPNN) with different design metrics. The CH node is acting as an intermediate node between cluster members and the next neighbouring CH node. After that, the next neighbouring CH node is selected by a hybrid recurrent dynamic neural network (RDNN), which provides data lossless routing between nodes. Finally, the simulation results of proposed and existing routing protocols analyzed with different simulation scenarios in terms of energy consumption, packet loss ratio, network lifetime, number of active nodes, packet delivery ratio, throughput, and latency.},

  abstract     = {In multiple criteria decision aid (MCDA) problems, evaluating and selecting alternatives across numerous criteria often presents a significant challenge. An excessive number of criteria can induce cognitive overload in decision-makers, diminishing the reliability and validity of the outcomes. To address this complexity, organizing criteria into a hierarchical tree structure has been recommended, allowing the main problem to be decomposed into more manageable sub-problems. However, existing ranking approaches rarely offer efficient tools to handle hierarchical criteria structures. This study proposes the development of hierarchical decision support systems aimed at improving the quality of decision-making. Specifically, an extension of the well-established weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) method, termed 2-Tuple WASPAS-H, is introduced. This new method generates partial pre-orders at each sub-level and an overall pre-order at the highest level, enabling a step-by-step analysis and interpretation of the problem. A major strength of 2-Tuple WASPAS-H lies in its capacity to produce detailed rankings at each node of the hierarchy, while also accommodating imprecise and ambiguous evaluations through a symbolic treatment of multi-granular linguistic assessments provided by groups of experts. To evaluate the relative importance of criteria across different levels, the 2-Tuple BWM is utilized. The proposed approach is validated through a real case study: the evaluation of water resources for olive tree irrigation. The analysis employs a four-level hierarchy of criteria, incorporating environmental, productive, pomological, physico-chemical, social, technological, and financial dimensions. Ultimately, a sensitivity analysis is undertaken to evaluate the stability and performance of the developed methodology.},

This study presents an innovative approach, named BRO (Briefly Optimized Recognition with Deep Learning (DL) for accurate and efficient tree enumeration utilizing high-resolution satellite imagery and advanced machine learning techniques, specifically leveraging DL and transfer learning for robust tree detection and counting in complex environments. Experimental results demonstrate the significant effectiveness of the BRO approach compared to baseline methods, achieving a high accuracy of 97.8%. Furthermore, BRO shows substantial improvements in counting precision, resulting in a 5% reduction in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and a 7% decrease in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over existing techniques. Beyond performance metrics, execution time benchmarks highlight BRO’s computational efficiency, processing large datasets significantly faster than conventional optimization methods, which is crucial for large-scale applications.

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the education sector by making learning more accessible, efficient, and customized. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have sparked significant interest in automating the evaluation of handwritten answers. Traditional handwritten evaluation techniques are influenced by the evaluator's mental and physical state, environmental factors, human bias, emotional swings, and logistical challenges like storage and retrieval. Although sequence-to-sequence neural networks and other existing AI evaluation methods have demonstrated promise, they are constrained by their reliance on high-performance hardware, such as GPUs, lengthy training periods, and challenges in managing a variety of scenarios. The state-of-the-art technique known as Bidirectional Encoders Representation from Transformer (BERT) has overcome the drawbacks of previous NLP techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec. But BERT depends on surface-level keyword similarity, if the keywords are different then the accuracy is not perfect. This study presents a technique that combines optical character recognition (OCR) technology with DeepSeek-R1 1.5B model to create a robust, efficient, and accurate grading system. To overcome the above-mentioned challenges, we proposed an evaluation technique that uses the Google Cloud Vision API to extract and convert handwritten responses into machine-readable text, thereby providing a pre-processed input for further evaluation in this study. The main aim of this study is to develop a scalable, automated, and effective system for grading handwritten responses by combining DeepSeek for response evaluation with the Google Cloud Vision API for text extraction. To check the performance of the proposed DeepSeek evaluation method, we compare its results with cosine similarity metrics. After testing on multiple assignments, DeepSeek’s independent evaluation method gave the best results: lowest MAE—0.0580, lowest RMSE—0.147, and strongest correlation—0.895. The finding of this technique has shown that the proposed technique is reliable and accurate.},

  abstract     = {Predicting financial risk accurately is crucial for maintaining economic sustainability and investor trust in an era of increasing economic volatility and business instability. There are several problems with traditional financial risk assessment models, including their inflexibility when confronted with high-dimensional, non-linear data and their inability to dynamically adjust to changing financial situations. Advanced forecasting models must be combined with robust optimization methods to address these challenges effectively. Conventional methods, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and linear discriminant analysis, often struggle to accurately detect early financial risks because they are deterministic and unsuited for exploring global optimal solutions. Problems like this contribute to macroeconomic uncertainty by delaying the identification of potential defaults. This research presents a new hybrid framework, the Financial Risk Prediction Framework utilizing Cuckoo Search Optimization (FRPF-CSO), to enhance prediction accuracy and optimize feature selection in high-dimensional financial datasets. This framework combines a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) with the Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) to build an adaptive learning system. CSA is used to tune the network weights and feature parameters worldwide to improve the neural model’s convergence speed and predictive ability. The system’s dynamic learning capabilities identify patterns connected to company failures and financial decline. Various real-world corporate finance datasets have been used for experimental validation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FRPF-CSO model achieves a high early warning lead time of 2.1 quarters, a prediction accuracy of 95.72%, a convergence rate of 9.87 s, a risk detection ratio of 97.63%, and a computational efficiency ratio of 98.2% compared to other existing methods.},

Hence, the research introduces a Hybridized Convolutional Neural Network for Surface Quality Control model that integrates U-Net with a ResNet34 backbone for precise defect localization and EfficientNet-B4 for defect classification, enhanced by stroboscopic illuminant preprocessing to optimize defect visibility.

The research results provide 98.2% classification accuracy, 96.5% defect localization precision, minimizes false alarms, and 98.2% recall for incoming material inspection, preventing defective inputs for industrial quality inspection. By integrating these innovations, the research helps manufacturers with a unified, scalable quality inspection platform that reduces human inspection workload by 12% while operating at production line speeds of 20.6 frames/sec and achieves 83.2 fps.

  abstract     = {Facial expression generation played an essential role in virtual avatars, television, film art, and human–computer interaction. The existing synthesis model faces difficulties due to poor generalization, unnatural distortion, identity inconsistency, and weak lip synchronization with audio. In addition, conventional approaches fail to balance expression fidelity, real-time synthesis, and identity preservation. The research difficulties are addressed by introducing the Machine Learning-based Expression Generation Model to improve the expression generation accuracy. The ML-EGM model uses spatial and temporal features to generate expression by integrating generative adversarial networks, transformer encoding, and lip synchronization. A generator synthesizes expressive face outputs in the generative framework, while the discriminator is trained to distinguish actual and created expressions. This adversarial process teaches the generator to mimic actual facial emotions. During this process, transformer encoding is applied to manage the temporal consistency using the self-attention mechanism to minimize the error and improve the similarity rate. Further, the expressions are integrated with the speech synthesis process to enhance the overall frame expression generation efficiency. The system uses the MEAD dataset to evaluate the system efficiency, in which the model attains 99.1% expression generation accuracy, which is a 5.7% improvement compared to the MFA methods. The ML-EGM model proposal sets a new standard in achieving realism in expression generation, consistency of emotion realism, and speed of synthesis; its possible use cases include virtual aides, AI avatars, deepfake image detection, robotics systems that convey expression, and emotion-sensitive human–computer systems.},

However, most previous studies relied on simulations, experts, assumptions, questionnaires, and borrowed literature, which are impractical. Therefore, this study developed two methods for the intelligent and objective acquisition of quantitative decision data based on machine learning and online review data and applied the methods to solve practical emergency problems. First, a reasonable decision index system was constructed using latent Dirichlet allocation thematic-cluster analysis of the focus word frequency from online public opinions. Python programming was then used to capture the big data of social media comments on emergencies in real time to obtain multisource comment data, which were preprocessed and visualized. Second, based on the optimized SnowNLP, emotional tendencies and statistical analyses were performed on the processed comment data, resulting in two quantitative decision matrices, which were represented as single-valued neutrosophic numbers (SVNNs) and probabilistic linguistic terms (PLTs). Next, the bidirectional projection method was extended to an environment of SVNNs and PLTs, and the alternatives were sorted and selected. Finally, a sudden natural disaster event was used as a numerical case to verify the proposed method. Through a comparative analysis, the experimental results show the practicability and feasibility of the proposed decision-making method, demonstrating the superiority and intelligence of our research. Our study can conduct real-time monitoring of emergencies and intelligently and objectively obtain quantified decision-making data, thereby providing auxiliary decision-making support for relevant emergency management departments, ensuring the positive development of public opinion, social stability, and the safety of people's lives and property.},

Its onset, influenced by factors like obesity and family history, manifests symptoms such as frequent urination. Long-term complications encompass heart, kidney, and nerve ailments. Early prediction mitigates risks. All these encompassing strategies are designed to improve prediction precision and facilitate proactive diabetes control. This research employed SMOTE methods to tackle imbalanced classes, utilizing various classification algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, Gradient Boost, and AdaBoost. Following extensive training and evaluation, the AdaBoost classifier delivered superior outcomes, achieving a 94.02% accuracy rate, an F1 score of 93.32%, and an AUC of 0.95. In the healthcare industry, accurately forecasting diabetes mellitus is crucial; however, privacy laws hinder the transfer of medical information from the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), causing delays in diagnosis. This study introduces the Federated Learning with Weighted Conglomeration Optimization (FLWCO) model as a solution to these challenges. In Centralized Learning, AdaBoost with WCO achieves an accuracy of 95.32% when tested on a Kaggle dataset consisting of 96,146 instances. During the second stage, FLWCO achieves a superior 97.27% accuracy rate compared to other federated learning techniques. The method not only guarantees privacy conformity but also decreases communication expenses. FLWCO demonstrates superiority over existing federated learning algorithms in real-world heart illness prediction. Furthermore, the proposed model can be employed to estimate the likelihood of heart disease in individuals with diabetes. This highlights the potential of federated learning, especially FLWCO, in leveraging distributed data while preserving privacy, facilitating accurate diabetes mellitus diagnosis, and addressing challenges in sharing medical information securely and efficiently.},

Its frequency as a health issue has increased significantly in recent years. Early detection of BC is the most straightforward method of coping with the diagnosis. In 2020, approximately 2.3 million women worldwide were diagnosed with breast cancer, resulting in around 685,000 deaths. Therefore, early detection of BC is crucial for effective treatment and improved survival rates. The results and assessments of many Machines Learning (ML) models for detecting BC survivability are presented in this manuscript using the BC dataset. Although the dataset is relatively small, it provides valuable insights. The data was evaluated with many ML techniques and different predictive models were built with the valuable results. Several ML techniques were applied to build predictive models, including Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Data scaling and encoding techniques, including StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler, are employed to enhance the accuracy of these machine learning models. Additionally, preprocessing steps, such as Numerical Variable Correlation, Categorical Variables Analysis, Continuous Variables Analysis, Bivariate Analysis, Balancing Classes (oversampling function) are applied to enhance the model’s performance. The results show that out of all the ML techniques tested, the k-NN method gives the most accurate predictions, which is close to 94.00%.},

We propose a novel genetic algorithm that integrates a restricted tournament selection strategy with sociological principles, named the restricted tournament selection social genetic algorithm (RTS2GA). Initially, we develop a comprehensive model for the allocation of combat resources that takes into account multiple constraints. Then, building upon the traditional Genetic Algorithm, we introduce a novel selection strategy known as restricted tournament selection to enhance the diversity of the algorithm’s population. In addition, we innovatively incorporate the concept of ‘group effect’ from sociology, adding a socialization operator to the algorithm to accelerate convergence and improve the quality of optimal solutions. Comprehensive evaluation confirms RTS2GA’s trade-off profile: though incurring added computational costs, it achieves competitive convergence speed (marginally behind PSO/MPSO; comparable to GA/DE/GA-APSO) while establishing definitive superiority in global optimization across all five benchmarks.},

This information is processed in a methodical way into a clinical ontology, which facilitates structured, semantically enhanced representation of medical entities and their relationships. The system uses a hybrid strategy based on decision trees and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance predictive performance. Decision trees offer interpretability through the identification of key decision paths, whereas GNNs utilize connected clinical ontology for richer relational analysis. Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules also enrich reasoning by deducing new knowledge from implicit relationships and patterns. The rules combine risk factors such as hypertension, cholesterol, and lifestyle to predict heart disease with high accuracy. The integration of rule-based reasoning and machine learning provides a complete and context-sensitive system. Performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) to provide solid diagnostic evaluation. The hybrid model of decision trees, GNNs, and ontology-based reasoning with boosting via Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules shows great predictive accuracy and decision support improvements. The clinical ontology provides interpretability, flexibility, and scalability for future data sets and changing medical knowledge. This work emphasizes the opportunity of combining ontology engineering, machine learning, and semantic reasoning in enhancing heart disease prediction and diagnosis. The system assists healthcare workers in making well-informed decisions, improving diagnosis accuracy, and maximizing patient management.},

  abstract     = {The use of rare earth elements in hydrogen storage processes offers significant advantages in terms of increasing technological efficiency and ensuring system security. However, this process also creates some serious problems in terms of environmental and economic sustainability. It is necessary to determine the most critical indicators affecting the sustainable use of these elements. Studies on this subject in the literature are quite limited, and this may lead to wrong investment decisions. The main purpose of this study is to determine the most important indicators to increase the sustainable use of rare earth elements in hydrogen storage processes. An original decision-making model in which Siamese network, logarithmic percentage-change driven objective weighting (LOPCOW), fractal fuzzy numbers, and weighted influence super matrix with precedence (WISP) approaches are integrated in the study. This study provides an original contribution to the literature by identifying the most critical indicators affecting the sustainable use of rare earths in hydrogen storage processes by presenting an innovative model. Fractal structures such as Koch Snowflake, Cantor Dust, and Sierpinski Triangle can model complex uncertainties more successfully. Fractal structures are particularly effective in modeling linguistic fuzziness because their recursive nature closely mirrors the layered and imprecise way humans often express subjective judgments. Unlike linear fuzzy sets, fractals can capture the patterns of ambiguity found in expert evaluations. Hydrogen storage capacity and government supports are determined as the most vital criteria affecting sustainability in rare earth use.},

  abstract     = {Dates in Saudi Arabia hold immense cultural, economic, and nutritional importance, being a staple food and a symbol of heritage. Saudi Arabia produces approximately 1.5 million metric tons of dates annually, accounting for nearly 17% of global date production, underscoring its pivotal role in the global market. Precise and automated classification of fruits is a crucial aspect of modern agriculture, yet it remains a challenging endeavor due to the diverse appearances of fruits. The classification of date fruit varieties presents additional complexities, given variations in size, shape, and texture, making it a critical focus for technological advancements. Dates are highly nutritious, providing approximately 277 cal per 100 g and serving as an excellent source of dietary fiber, natural sugars, and energy. Their substantial nutritional value makes them indispensable in addressing food security challenges and promoting global health benefits. In this paper, we introduce a novel DenseNet-based model augmented with attention mechanisms and optimized using the Nadam algorithm. Unlike traditional DenseNet variants, the model integrates attention mechanisms to enhance focus on pertinent image features, thereby improving classification accuracy under challenging conditions. To evaluate its efficacy, the model was benchmarked against several state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including DenseNet with Adam optimization, EfficientNet, GoogleNet, HRNet, MobileNet, and VGG, optimized with both Adam and Nadam algorithms. The proposed model achieved outstanding performance metrics, including 98.05% accuracy, 98.00% precision, 97.04% recall, and a 98.32% F1-score.},

  abstract     = {This study develops a centralized reinforcement learning framework, employing Q-learning, for efficient vehicle-to-grid (V2G) scheduling of large electric vehicle (EV) fleets. To address scalability challenges and inherent uncertainties in user behavior, the framework utilizes an aggregated state representation. This state captures the time-of-day, the distribution of the fleet’s state of charge (SOC) across discrete bins, and an estimated user adherence factor. The central agent learns a control policy based on this aggregated state to dynamically issue charging, discharging, or idle commands to EVs grouped within specific SOC bins. The primary objectives are to enhance power grid stability by minimizing the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) and to improve the economic viability of V2G participation for EV owners. Simulations conducted under a 40% EV penetration level (relative to a 300,000 vehicle base fleet) demonstrate the proposed method’s effectiveness: it reduced the grid PAR to 1.0683, compared to 1.0729 for a baseline uncontrolled charging scenario. Critically, the proposed method transformed the economic outcome, achieving positive average daily earnings of $1.17 per EV, in stark contrast to an average daily loss of $6.75 per EV under the baseline. These results validate the potential of the proposed intelligent, centralized control strategy using aggregated information to effectively manage large-scale V2G systems, enhance grid stability, and provide economic benefits under practical behavioral assumptions.},

  abstract     = {Predicting drill penetration rate (PR) in rock environments remains a significant challenge due to the complex interplay between rock texture, drilling fluid properties, and operational parameters. Traditional empirical models often lack generalizability and are based on inconsistent datasets, limiting their reliability. To address these limitations, this study develops a comprehensive experimental dataset using rock samples collected from various mines in Iran, tested under controlled laboratory conditions with different drilling fluids, bit loads, and rotational speeds. Texture coefficient (TC), electrical conductivity (EC), load on bit (LOB), and bit rotational velocity (BRV) were selected as input features. Four machine learning models—support vector regression (SVR), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision tree (DT)—were trained to predict PR. A biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm was employed to fine-tune hyperparameters and enhance model accuracy. Additionally, a novel hybrid error index (HEI) was introduced to comprehensively evaluate model performance. Among all models, the DT achieved the best accuracy with an HEI of 0.3753, followed by KNN, SVR, and SGD. These findings demonstrate the potential of the DT model, combined with optimized learning and a robust dataset, to reliably predict penetration rate in rock-based engineering projects.},

Meta-Learning Enabled Score-Based GANs (MLS-GAN) is a new framework we provide in this study that combines meta-learning with score-based generative models. Our method employs meta-learning to enhance the training of score-based models via the collection of priors customized to individual tasks and tactics for dynamic adaptability. This improves the generative process’s generalizability and robustness, and it also allows for more efficient learning with fewer data and hyperparameter modifications. By conducting comprehensive tests on image synthesis and data creation tasks, we demonstrate that our Meta-SB-GANs are successful. The results reveal higher-quality samples, quicker convergence, and better transferability to other domains. Integrating meta-learning with generative models can achieve state-of-the-art performance with decreased computing resources, as shown by our findings.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral Microscopic Images (HSMI) offer a more comprehensive spectral range, making them particularly useful in medical diagnostics, including early detection of cancerous tissues. Cholangiocarcinoma, a highly lethal bile duct cancer, traditionally requires a histopathological analysis of tissue samples under a microscope. However, this method is prone to subjectivity and error, often leading to delays in diagnosis, contributing to patient mortality. This study focuses on the automated diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma using deep learning techniques on microscopic hyperspectral data. Leveraging the spectral richness of HSMI, we developed a framework utilizing a modified Visual Geometry Group (VGG) architecture to process this hyperspectral data, aiming to detect cholangiocarcinoma at its early stages. With the growing role of artificial intelligence in pathology, this approach minimizes human error and enhances diagnostic accuracy. The dataset used in this study includes 880 cholangiocarcinoma tissue samples from 174 individuals, comprising 689 partial cancer regions, 49 full cancer regions, and 142 healthy scenes, all meticulously labeled by expert pathologists. Our ensemble learning technique integrates image preprocessing, spectral feature extraction, and classification, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy. The proposed system demonstrates a substantial improvement in the early detection of cholangiocarcinoma and offers a valuable tool for smart microscopy-based diagnosis, potentially facilitating the diagnostic burden in clinical settings.},

  abstract     = {Facial emotion recognition and age estimation are critical for human–computer interaction, yet existing methods struggle with variable image quality, diverse expressions, and aging patterns. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel hybrid model combining optimized image enhancement with deep feature extraction and machine learning classification. The methodology integrates three key phases: (1) image enhancement using white balancing and adaptive gamma correction to improve edge intensity (82.235 vs. 62.89 in original images) and texture clarity (gradient: 8.248 vs. 6.183); (2) feature extraction via a modified ResNet-18 trained from scratch with monochromatic inputs; and (3) SVM classification of concatenated features from original and enhanced images. Evaluated on the UTKFace dataset (1,000 images) and savory/unsavory expression datasets (600 images), the model achieves 98.75–100% accuracy, outperforming AlexNet (94.17%) and ResNet-KNN alternatives. Key findings demonstrate: (a) 5.4% higher age estimation accuracy (96.41% vs. 87.41%) with enhanced gradient metrics, (b) 3.75% improvement in emotion recognition through edge preservation, and (c) interpretable Grad-CAM visualizations validating feature relevance. The proposed system reduces misclassification errors by 60% for subtle expressions (e.g., fear vs. surprise) compared to state-of-the-art models. Practical applications in healthcare show 40% faster patient check-in processing and robust performance under low-light conditions. This work establishes that integrating physics-based enhancement with deep residual networks significantly improves reliability for real-world deployment. Future research will optimize computational efficiency for edge devices and expand multi-modal biometric integration.},

  abstract     = {Agriculture is crucial for food security but is severely threatened by crop disease and climate variability and causes severe yield loss. As the population grows worldwide, quick and accurate disease detection is critical. Deep learning, in particular through transfer learning, offers promising solutions, but most are computationally costly and unsuitable for real-time use in low-resource settings. There is limited research on lightweight models like SqueezeNet with optimized training parameters. This suggests the need for an efficient, high-accuracy, and deployable model to facilitate timely detection of tomato leaf diseases under real-world agricultural settings. This study presents a deep learning model based on the SqueezeNet framework for the detection and classification of tomato leaf diseases. Various combinations of optimizers (SGDM, ADAM, RMSProp) and learning rates (0.0004, 0.004) were employed during both training and testing phases, resulting in six configurations per case. The SqueezeNet model achieved 99.91% and 99.86% accuracy for TMC class classification during testing and training, with ADAM learning at 0.0004. ADAM at 0.0004 had ideal recall (100%) for the TH class during testing, and SGDM had 99.65% recall for the TYLCV class at the same learning rate, proving the model’s usefulness. The proposed framework is robust, with F1-Scores of 99.42% in ADAM testing at 0.0004 and 99.38% in SGDM training at 0.0004 for the TYLCV class. The model’s low misclassification rate (0–0.21%) boosts confidence. The ability to demonstrate classification performance and the minimal computational requirements of the proposed SqueezeNet-based system enhance the latter’s feasibility for use in real-time agricultural environments that are resource-constrained. Its scalability and resilience make it an excellent choice for utilization in advanced disease monitoring systems for tomato leaf diseases, facilitating quick, accurate diagnosis at the field level to facilitate enhanced precision agriculture practices.},

Such integration facilitates enhanced modeling and depiction of uncertain information within complex environments, surpassing the capabilities of complex intuitionistic and Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Despite these advantages, an urgent challenge is how to accurately evaluate the dissimilarity between CFFSs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two generalized complex Fermatean fuzzy distance measures for CFFSs as well as their weighted counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrate some key properties of the proposed distance measures, which illustrate their feasibility and effectiveness. Under certain circumstances, the proposed distance measures can be transformed into a hybrid complex Fermatean Hamming–Hausdorff and Euclidean–Hausdorff distance measures. Building on the proposed distance measures, we present a new entropy measure for CFFS. Finally, we propose a new decision-making method based on the proposed distance and entropy measures and apply the proposed method to lung disease recognition. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed distance measures effectively capture the dissimilarities between diseases represented as CFFSs, with the method achieving accurate classification results.},
