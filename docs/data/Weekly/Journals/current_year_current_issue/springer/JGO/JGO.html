  abstract     = {Linear-parametric optimization, where multiple objectives are combined into a single objective using linear combinations with parameters as coefficients, has numerous links to other fields in optimization and a wide range of application areas. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of structural results and algorithmic strategies for solving linear-parametric optimization problems exactly and approximately. Transferring concepts from related areas such as multi-objective optimization provides further relevant results. The survey consists of two parts: First, we list strategies that work in a general fashion and do not rely on specific problem structures. Second, we look at well-studied parametric optimization problems and cover both important theoretical results and specialized algorithmic approaches for these problems. Among these problems are parametric variants of shortest path problems, minimum cost flow and maximum flow problems, spanning tree problems, the knapsack problem, and matching problems. Overall, we cover the results from 128 publications (and refer to 35 supplemental works) published between 1963 and 2024.},

  abstract     = {Partial inverse combinatorial optimization problems are bilevel optimization problems in which the leader aims to incentivize the follower to include respectively not include given sets of elements in the solution of their combinatorial problem. If the sets of required and forbidden elements define a complete follower solution and the follower problem is solvable in polynomial time, then the inverse combinatorial problem is also solvable in polynomial time. In contrast, partial inverse problems can be NP-complete when the follower problem is solvable in polynomial time. This applies e.g. to the partial inverse min cut problem. In this paper, we consider partial inverse combinatorial optimization problems in which weights can only be increased. Furthermore, we assume that the lower-level combinatorial problem can be solved as a linear program. In this setting, we show that the partial inverse shortest path problem on a directed acyclic graph is NP-complete. Moreover, the partial inverse assignment problem is NP-complete. Both results even hold if there is only one required arc or edge, respectively. For solving partial inverse combinatorial optimization problems with only weight increases, we present a novel branch-and-bound scheme that exploits the difference in complexity between complete inverse and partial inverse versions of a problem. For both primal heuristics and node relaxations, we use auxiliary problems that are basically complete inverse problems on similar instances. Branching is done on follower variables. We test our approach on partial inverse shortest path, assignment and min cut problems, and computationally compare it to an MPCC reformulation as well as a decomposition scheme.},

We also consider the case in which the feasible region is given by a closed convex set, assuming that the projection operation is affordable. For both cases, we introduce regularized first-order algorithms and prove worst-case iteration and evaluation complexity results. Asymptotic convergence results are also presented. The proposed algorithm for the case of constraints given by an arbitrary closed convex set has the classical projected gradient method as a particular case. The algorithms are implemented and several numerical examples illustrate their application. From a theoretical point of view, there is no method for the low order-value problem that has a complexity analysis and for which the relation between complexity results and asymptotic results has been analyzed. From a practical point of view, one of the applications considered is the training of a neural network. In this example, it is shown that the introduced method outperforms another recently introduced method that represents the state of the art for solving low order-value problems.},

The DRO problem can be equivalently reformulated as a linear conic optimization problem with nonnegative polynomial cones when the objective function is affine in the decision variables.

  abstract     = {In transportation problems and many other planning problems, there are important sources of uncertainty that must be addressed to find effective and efficient solutions. A common approach for solving these dynamic and stochastic problems is the multiple scenario approach (MSA), which has been proven effective for transportation problems, but it does not provide flexibility for finding solutions that account for all the uncertainty of the problem. Alternative approaches for solving problems with a finite number of scenarios are the progressive hedging algorithm (PHA) and the subgradient algorithm (SA). There are many similarities between PHA and SA; however, there are some differences that lead them to have very different theoretical guarantees and performance. We present a new exact algorithm, the dynamic progressive hedging algorithm (DPHA), for which we provide theoretical guarantees that help to understand both this algorithm and the PHA from a new point of view. We also propose a DPHA-based heuristic (DPHH) and show optimality guarantees for the solution obtained. Our analysis highlights the advantages and disadvantages of the DPHA, the SA, and the MSA, which gives guidance for future research in choosing the proper method for the problem in hand. In a computational study, we consider the stochastic server location problem (SSLP) and the two-stage stochastic assignment and team-orienteering problem (TSSATOP), and we show the empirical performance of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {It is known that adaptive optimization algorithms represent the key pillar behind the rise of the machine learning field. In the optimization literature numerous studies have been devoted to accelerated gradient methods but only recently adaptive iterative techniques were analyzed from a theoretical point of view. In the present paper we introduce new adaptive algorithms endowed with momentum terms for stochastic non-convex optimization problems. Our purpose is to show a deep connection between accelerated methods endowed with different inertial steps and AMSGrad-type momentum methods. Our methodology is based on the framework of stochastic and possibly non-convex objective mappings, along with some assumptions that are often used in the investigation of adaptive algorithms. In addition to discussing the finite-time horizon analysis in relation to a certain final iteration and the almost sure convergence to stationary points, we shall also look at the worst-case iteration complexity. This will be followed by an estimate for the expectation of the squared Euclidean norm of the gradient. Various computational simulations for the training of neural networks are being used to support the theoretical analysis. For future research we emphasize that there are multiple possible extensions to our work, from which we mention the investigation regarding non-smooth objective functions and the theoretical analysis of a more general formulation that encompasses our adaptive optimizers in a stochastic framework.},

We initially transform AMP into an equivalent problem (EP) by the logarithmic transformation and the introduction of auxiliary variables. Utilizing a piecewise linear technique, we then develop a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) relaxation to determine a lower bound for the optimal value of EP. In addition, we propose a successive linear optimization (SLO) method that converges to a KKT point of EP, thereby tightening the upper bound to the optimum of EP. Also, a rectangular contraction rule is introduced to eliminate regions that do not contain the optimal solution of AMP. By combining the MILP relaxation, the SLO method and the rectangular contraction rule, we formulate a new branch-and-bound algorithm for solving EP. Moreover, the convergence and the maximum number of iterations for the algorithm are presented. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the constructed algorithm.},

For this we use an interior point method with a preconditioned conjugate gradient method solving the linear systems. The preconditioner utilizes the low-rank structure of the solution of the relaxations. In order to fully exploit this, we need to re-write the moment relaxations. To treat the arising linear equality constraints we use an $$\ell _1$$ -penalty approach within the interior-point solver. The efficiency of this approach is demonstrated by numerical experiments with the MAXCUT and other randomly generated problems and a comparison with a state-of-the-art semidefinite solver and the ADMM method. We further propose a hybrid ADMM-interior-point method that proves to be efficient for certain problem classes. As a by-product, we observe that the second-order relaxation is often high enough to deliver a globally optimal solution of the original problem.},

  abstract     = {Existing algorithms for generalized semi-infinite programs can only handle lower-level constraints containing equality constraints depending on upper-level variables (so-called coupling equality constraints) under limiting assumptions. More specifically, discretization-based algorithms require that the coupling equality constraints result in some lower-level variables being determined uniquely as implicit functions of the other lower-level and upper-level variables. We propose an adaptation of the discretization-based algorithm of Blankenship & Falk and demonstrate it can handle coupling equality constraints under the weaker assumption of stability of the solution set for these constraints in the sense of Lipschitz lower semi-continuity. The key idea is to allow a perturbation of the lower-level variable values from discretization points in connection with changes in the upper-level variables in the discretized upper-level problem. We enforce that these perturbed values satisfy the coupling equality constraints while remaining close to the discretization point, provided we can guarantee the stability of the solution in the sense that a nearby solution exists for small changes of the upper-level variables. We provide concrete realizations of the algorithm for three different situations: i) when knowledge about a certain Lipschitz constant is available, ii) when the coupling equality constraints are assumed to have full rank, and iii) when the coupling equality constraints are additionally linear in the lower-level variables. Numerical experiments on small test problems and a physically motivated problem related to power flow illustrate that the approach can be successfully applied to solve the challenging problems, but is currently limited in terms of scalability.},
