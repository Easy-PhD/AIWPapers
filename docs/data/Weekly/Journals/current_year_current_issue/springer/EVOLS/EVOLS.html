  abstract     = {Anomaly detection (AD) is a relevant problem in numerous real-world applications, especially when dealing with images. However, in real-world applications, it is common that the input data distribution can change over time, decreasing performance significantly. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the problem of Visual Anomaly Detection at Pixel-Level in the Continual Learning setting, where the model adapts to the new data while maintaining the knowledge of old data. We implement and test several AD techniques and adapt them to work in the CL setting using the Replay approach. We evaluate them using the well-known MVTec AD Dataset, where each object corresponds to a new learning task. Moreover, a significant challenge when dealing with the Replay approach is the memory occupied to store a portion of past images, which could be too heavy for many resource-constrained systems. Therefore, we propose a novel approach called SCALE, which performs high compression levels while preserving image quality through Super-Resolution techniques. Using the SCALE method to compress replay memory, in conjunction with the AD technique Inpaint, allows for obtaining the best AD results while significantly reducing memory consumption.},

  abstract     = {The overgrowth of tumor cells in the liver results in Hepatocellular Carcinoma with unfamiliar symptoms in its earlier stages. Though the treatments facilitate transplantation, freezing, etc. the recognition of such tumors is to be made early using ultrasound images. This article proposes a Disparity Learning Network for Pixel Differentiation to recognize Hepatocellular Carcinoma from ultrasound image inputs. First, the conventional textural features are extracted from the input image from which the disparity for differential pixel distribution is estimated. This disparity is computed based on pixel absence in a well-distributed region and the corresponding error occurrence. In this case, the disparity network is constructed using one conditional and one training layer for disparity classification and new distribution training. In the classification process, the absence and high-density factors are differentiated for region-wise disparity estimation. Such estimation is used for training further classifications, for differentiating non-disparity regions. The maximum disparity pixel distributed region is recognized as the infected region from the given input.},

In this study, a novel approach for ear recognition using a fusion of two powerful feature extraction techniques such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and an improved Local Optimal Oriented Pattern (LOOP) based on Spatial Pyramid Decomposition (SPD) is proposed. An efficient scheme based on Discriminant Correlation Analysis (DCA) is adopted as a feature level fusion and dimensionality reduction technique where the performance of the recognition system is evaluated using a K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) classifier. Extensive experiments on six well known benchmarks ear datasets are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Experimental results clearly indicate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of performance and complexity in comparison with the state-of-the-art ear recognition techniques.},

This paper presents a novel two-stage shadow removal method that addresses this challenge through separate shadow detection and recovery stages. In the first stage, the GLFFNet model leverages global and local channel fusion modules to precisely detect shadow regions. In the second stage, the USFNet model employs shadow localization, boundary enhancement, and frequency band extraction modules to recover shadow areas while minimizing impact on non-shadowed regions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, achieving state-of-the-art results in shadow detection and recovery. This work contributes to advancing shadow removal techniques for practical computer vision applications.

  abstract     = {The fundamental goal of prognostics is to predict a system or component’s remaining useful life (RUL), or the span of time until it fails to operate as intended, which is crucial for reducing downtime. Recently, various deep learning approaches have been used for machine prognostics. The sequential models like RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Transformer models can effectively manage implicit contexts defined within the data, such as temporal contexts. Further, the attention mechanism enables the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence. However, such models may struggle with explicitly incorporating external contextual information such as machine operating conditions. In this paper, a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based architecture is proposed for RUL prediction that explicitly embeds contextual information into the model. Context influences both the input feature weighting and the computation of the attention vector, resulting in a context-aware attention mechanism. This not only improves prediction performance but also provides interpretability by highlighting the most influential features and parts of input sequences. The proposed architecture is evaluated using two widely adopted benchmark datasets: the NASA C-MPASS Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation dataset and the Bearing dataset (IEEE PHM 2012 Challenge). Results show that incorporating context significantly improves performance over baseline and state-of-the-art methods. The model achieves up to 18.90% and 59.10% reductions in RMSE and Score on FD002, and 6.86% and 53.88% on FD004 (C-MPASS). On the Bearings dataset, it yields an 84.54% improvement in RMSE and 54.98% in Score over the best existing model. Notably, these gains are achieved using a lightweight model architecture with minimal parameters, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The increasing integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies into modern vehicles has enabled real-time access to driving data. However, analyzing this information in embedded environments remains challenging due to the continuous nature of the data streams and the limited computational resources available. This study addresses these constraints by proposing an evolving online clustering approach for real-time monitoring of driver behavior. The proposed method integrates Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) techniques with soft sensors derived from physical data captured via on-board diagnostics (OBD-II). Central to the system is the MMCloud algorithm, which incrementally updates clusters without requiring retraining, enabling adaptation to concept drift and evolving driving conditions. The methodology involves the real-time acquisition of vehicle signals, including speed, RPM, engine load, and throttle position, followed by the calculation of a soft-sensor metric known as radar area. The algorithm was deployed on a Freematics One+ device and validated through case studies conducted in varied urban driving conditions. The results indicate that the system can classify driver behavior into cautious, normal, and aggressive categories, achieving Silhouette Scores up to 0.83 and maintaining execution times between 600–700 $$\mu s$$ in most cases. These findings suggest that the approach is suitable for embedded applications requiring adaptive, real-time behavior analysis.},

This technique offers numerous benefits, including reduced travel time, lower emissions, improved fuel efficiency, and the potential to mitigate traffic congestion. Despite the aforementioned advantages, the technology is still in its developmental stages, facing several significant technical issues. Key challenges arise from the evolving nature of the vehicle platoon, including vehicle heterogeneity, external disturbances like wind affecting longitudinal dynamics, and delays or interruptions in communication networks. For these reasons, this paper conducts a simulation-based research into the impact of various factors, such as communication delays, network disconnections, external disturbances, among others, on the string stability of vehicle platoons. The simulation results reveal that network disconnections have the most detrimental effect, as they can lead to severe string instability. Other factors, such as external disturbances, do not compromise string stability but may result in steady-state tracking errors.},
