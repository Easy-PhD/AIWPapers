  abstract     = {Anomaly detection (AD) is a relevant problem in numerous real-world applications, especially when dealing with images. However, in real-world applications, it is common that the input data distribution can change over time, decreasing performance significantly. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the problem of Visual Anomaly Detection at Pixel-Level in the Continual Learning setting, where the model adapts to the new data while maintaining the knowledge of old data. We implement and test several AD techniques and adapt them to work in the CL setting using the Replay approach. We evaluate them using the well-known MVTec AD Dataset, where each object corresponds to a new learning task. Moreover, a significant challenge when dealing with the Replay approach is the memory occupied to store a portion of past images, which could be too heavy for many resource-constrained systems. Therefore, we propose a novel approach called SCALE, which performs high compression levels while preserving image quality through Super-Resolution techniques. Using the SCALE method to compress replay memory, in conjunction with the AD technique Inpaint, allows for obtaining the best AD results while significantly reducing memory consumption.},

  abstract     = {The overgrowth of tumor cells in the liver results in Hepatocellular Carcinoma with unfamiliar symptoms in its earlier stages. Though the treatments facilitate transplantation, freezing, etc. the recognition of such tumors is to be made early using ultrasound images. This article proposes a Disparity Learning Network for Pixel Differentiation to recognize Hepatocellular Carcinoma from ultrasound image inputs. First, the conventional textural features are extracted from the input image from which the disparity for differential pixel distribution is estimated. This disparity is computed based on pixel absence in a well-distributed region and the corresponding error occurrence. In this case, the disparity network is constructed using one conditional and one training layer for disparity classification and new distribution training. In the classification process, the absence and high-density factors are differentiated for region-wise disparity estimation. Such estimation is used for training further classifications, for differentiating non-disparity regions. The maximum disparity pixel distributed region is recognized as the infected region from the given input.},

  abstract     = {Biometric identification through ear image analysis and recognition has emerged as a promising biometric system due ear uniqueness and stability in varying environmental conditions. In this study, a novel approach for ear recognition using a fusion of two powerful feature extraction techniques such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and an improved Local Optimal Oriented Pattern (LOOP) based on Spatial Pyramid Decomposition (SPD) is proposed. An efficient scheme based on Discriminant Correlation Analysis (DCA) is adopted as a feature level fusion and dimensionality reduction technique where the performance of the recognition system is evaluated using a K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) classifier. Extensive experiments on six well known benchmarks ear datasets are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Experimental results clearly indicate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of performance and complexity in comparison with the state-of-the-art ear recognition techniques.},
