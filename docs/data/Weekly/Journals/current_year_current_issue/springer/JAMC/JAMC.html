However, such inequalities for twice-differentiable functions remain relatively unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by establishing a novel Boole’s identity via the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral for twice-differentiable functions. Twice-differentiable functions allow for the use of second-order derivatives, which provide more precise information about the curvature and behavior of functions compared to first-order derivatives. This leads to sharper inequalities and better numerical approximations. Based on this identity, several fractional Boole’s type inequalities are derived, where the absolute value of the second derivatives is convex. The results include detailed error bounds, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach in practical computations. Illustrative examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate their computational applicability.},

Through investigating the potential advantages of fractal operators, we develop a more precise and sophisticated mathematical model, evaluate the existence and uniqueness of solutions, Ulam–Hyers (UH) stability, and present numerical results that highlight the improved performance offered by this innovative approach.

The primary goal is to investigate the effects of vaccine characteristics on the Mpox burden in Nigeria and the DRC and to estimate the number of cases and deaths averted in each country due to vaccination. To this end, an extended Mpox model incorporating a vaccinated population is presented, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted using the partial rank correlation coefficient to identify the most significant parameters affecting the control reproduction number, the infected human population, and the deceased human population. The criteria for the global stability of the Mpox-free equilibrium were established using the Lyapunov function, and a numerical simulation was performed to estimate the number of cases and deaths that could be averted through the implementation of vaccination in both countries. We examined the Mpox mortality burden across different age groups in Nigeria and the DRC using Years of Life Lost (YLL) as a metric. The study emphasizes the severity of Mpox in this demographic segment by indicating that older age groups would have a lower fatality rate. Also, the estimate suggested that approximate of 40 years and 43 years can be lost per individual due to Mpox in Nigeria and DRC respectively. Furthermore, the probability of a major outbreak in these regions was estimated, along with the required herd immunity threshold needed to curtail the spread of the disease. The results of this study suggest that vaccination significantly impacts the transmission and mortality rates of Mpox in Nigeria and the DRC, emphasizing that achieving high vaccination coverage is crucial for reaching the herd immunity threshold and preventing outbreaks. These findings underscore the considerable benefits of vaccination in controlling Mpox transmission and reducing the disease burden in Nigeria and the DRC. By implementing robust vaccination programs and proactively addressing associated challenges, we can work toward achieving herd immunity and preventing Mpox outbreaks not only in these countries but also in other regions where the disease remains a threat.},

This article introduces a novel epidemiological model that incorporates re-infection dynamics with a Crowley–Martin incidence rate, along with the effects of constant vaccination and preventive measures. The model is structured into susceptible, infected, and recovered compartments, and its dynamic properties are rigorously analyzed. Key aspects such as the basic reproduction number $$(R_n)$$ , stability conditions, boundedness, non-negativity, and bifurcation behavior are explored. Using Lyapunov function, we establish the globally asymptotic stability of Hepatitis B Virus-free equilibrium for $$R_n < 1$$ and identify a transcritical bifurcation at $$R_n = 1$$ . Additionally, we demonstrate that the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotic stable for $$R_n>1$$ . The results of our numerical simulations, which employ NSFD scheme, validate our findings and demonstrate its superior efficiency when compared to RK4 and Euler methods. Specifically, NSFD produces faster and more accurate results. Our findings emphasize the critical role of vaccination, re-infection and preventive measures in HBV transmission dynamics, offering valuable perspective for public health strategies aimed at controlling HBV spread.},

Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we derive the basic reproduction number R0 and establish that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R0 < 1, while the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R0 > 1. Utilizing optimal control theory, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control solution, which is obtained using Pontryagin’s minimum principle and Hamiltonian theory. This approach significantly reduces control costs and achieves efficient and cost-effective epidemic containment. Furthermore, the model optimizes the allocation of prevention and control resources under constrained conditions, enhancing control efficiency while alleviating socioeconomic burdens, thereby offering a sustainable framework for long-term epidemic management. Numerical simulations validate the model’s stability and the effectiveness of the optimal control strategy, demonstrating that vaccination and quarantine measures effectively suppress epidemic spread. These findings provide robust guidance for practical epidemic prevention and control, enabling health authorities and policymakers to implement targeted measures, such as prioritizing vaccine distribution, determining optimal coverage rates, and strategically planning quarantine zones and durations. Such measures effectively curb the transmission of infectious diseases and safeguard public health.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop and analyze an efficient Legendre-Fourier spectral approximation for solving nonlinear eigenvalue problems in complex domains. The main idea is to employ the domain mapping method to convert the nonlinear eigenvalue problem on a complex domain into an equivalent form on a standard circular domain. Based on this, an effective Legendre-Fourier spectral method is implemented by utilizing Legendre polynomials and Fourier series approximations in the radial and tangential directions, respectively. As the initial step, we establish a priori error estimates for standard circular regions. Then, we define a new class of projection operators, demonstrate their approximation properties, and further prove the error estimates for approximating eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenfunctions. Subsequently, by employing region mapping techniques, we extend the algorithm to address nonlinear eigenvalue problems in two-dimensional complex domains, and validate its convergence and spectral accuracy through numerical examples.},

The convergence of these methods is affirmed in both the mean- and mean-square senses under suitable boundary conditions. To evaluate the stability of numerical solutions, the numerical threshold $${R^h}$$ is introduced, paralleling the significance of the analysis threshold in stochastic age-structured population models. Numerical solutions are considered stable for $${R^h} < 1$$ and unstable for $${R^h} > 1$$ . Furthermore, the method is shown to maintain the basic reproduction number $${R_0}$$ for any sufficiently large step size, allowing the asymptotic behavior of these models to be represented graphically through numerical processes.

In this paper, a Filippov system with the threshold control strategy is proposed to investigate the effects of threshold and intermittent control strategy on bacteria-resistant model, which consists of an untreated subsystem coupled to a treated subsystem. The proposed model has been analyzed theoretically using the Filippov convex method and Utkin’s equivalent control method. In particular, the existence and stability of the real equilibria, virtual equilibria, pseudo-equilibrium, sliding segments, and sliding bifurcations are analyzed. The global stability of the real and pseudo-equilibrium indicates that the drug control strategy can be effective in keeping the concentration of resistant bacteria below the threshold range. Finally, the simulations are given to verify the conclusions.},

This paper proposes an uncertain multifactor volatility model under the exponential Ornstein–Uhlenbeck mean reversion process, modeling volatility in the long and short term. Then the European option pricing formula is derived and a numerical method is provided to price European options. Finally, an empirical analysis is performed based on the CSI 300 ETF option and gives a pricing forecast for option contracts compared to the real option price to verify the validity of the model.},

The numerical solution of this system is then obtained through computational methods. The effectiveness of the algorithm is confirmed through both theoretical analysis and numerical testing. Additionally, the obtained solutions are presented both numerically and graphically, and compared with existing methods, showing that the proposed algorithm provides higher accuracy than conventional approaches.},

In order to comprehensively understand the stability of IMEX methods in time discretization, we use Fourier method for analysis and draw a stability domain graph. To further improve the accuracy of numerical solutions in spatial discretization, a fourth-order compact finite difference scheme is designed. For the linear complementarity problem of the American options, we ingeniously combined IMEX high-order methods and operator splitting methods. Several numerical experiments are provided to investigate the accuracy and convergence order of IMEX high-order methods for pricing European and American options in both time and spatial.

RqDTM is a modified version of the differential transform method designed for q-deformed equations, while VIM uses an iterative scheme. We compare the accuracy and efficiency of the solutions obtained from these methods and present numerical results.

The aim is to explore the effect of asymptomatic infections and their management on disease dynamics. The effective reproductive numbers of three models are derived, and their global dynamical properties are proven by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions. The sensitivity analysis of effective reproduction numbers is obtained by the PRCC method. The comparative result shows that the relevance of transmission, hospitalization and recovery rates of symptomatic patients weaken dramatically when asymptomatic infection is considered. Meanwhile, differences in the sensitivity of influences associated with asymptomatic infections further confirm transmission heterogeneity. It also reveals that vaccine coverage is a crucial factor that affects the dynamics of disease. Additionally, this study examines numerical simulations to assess the effectiveness of various sensitivity-related interventions. Both theoretical and numerical results consistently reveal that neglecting asymptomatic infection will underestimate the extent of infections. Moreover, considering the transmission heterogeneity of asymptomatic infection and strengthening the management for higher-transmission subgroup, can minimize critical vaccination coverage and achieve disease control.},

Following this, we analyze the stability of positive constant equilibria, discovering that memory delay can trigger Hopf bifurcation, leading to the emergence of spatially inhomogeneous periodic solutions. This finding suggests that memory-based diffusion facilitates pattern formation, contrasting with the outcomes of models that include only phytoplankton-taxis. Numerical simulations demonstrate that varying toxin input rates can lead to the extinction of phytoplankton and zooplankton, and that increasing the delay may also cause population collapse.},

The model contains two populations namely the plant and the vector population. The vector population follows theta logistic growth as theta logistic growth curve is a more natural choice in comparison with the classical logistic growth curve model. We have also include the effects of roguing and pesticide spraying on dynamics of the mosaic disease. We examine how different values of $$\theta $$ might impact crop survival during vector invasion by utilizing control measures which enhances the biological realism of the model. For the analytical analysis of the theta-logistic model system, we derive the discreet-time version of the continuous model. The analytical results are validated by numerical simulations. The results show that the system is stable when $$\theta $$ lies below a threshold value and unstable via limit cycle oscillation when $$\theta $$ crosses the critical value that lasts until $$\theta = 1$$ . The critical value of $$\theta $$ is 0.485 and this value depends on other parameters such as the infection rate, roguing and insecticides spraying. This study shows that the results obtained from theta-logistic model are more applicable for proper management of mosaic disease in Cassava.},

The fractional-order system is transformed into a discrete model through a discretization process. The fixed points are analyzed for both their existence and uniqueness. We then assess the local stability of the two fixed points using linearization techniques, and use the center manifold theorem and bifurcation theory to identify conditions for period-doubling and Neimark–Sacker bifurcations. To verify our findings, we perform numerical simulations and compute the maximum Lyapunov exponents to confirm the presence of chaotic behavior.},

  abstract     = {In engineering and social research, linear systems are commonly used to address real-life problems of various dimensions. Therefore, many studies start by developing linear systems and then finding their solutions. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Pythagorean fuzzy sets in capturing and representing complex forms of uncertainty, particularly when understanding the distinctions between membership and non-membership is crucial. This paper pioneers the finding a solution for a general (square or nonsquare) Fully Pythagorean Fuzzy Linear Equations System (FPFLES) with arbitrary triangular Pythagorean fuzzy numbers and fills a critical gap in the existing literature. Since an FPFLES consists of the sum of the multiplications of each arbitrary parameter and variable, and the fuzzy multiplication operation includes the min and max operators, a nonlinearity situation is observed in each equation. To overcome this situation, a transformation from fuzzy multiplication to inequalities is applied, and thus, a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem is formed. Depending on whether the MIP problems created by changing the constraints have an optimal solution, FPFLES has an exact solution or an approximate solution. The types of solutions are examined using a distance measure definition available in the literature. This paper also defines restricted and relaxed approximate solutions for FPFLES by determining whether the left-hand sides obtained from the substitution of solutions are completely covered by the right-hand sides of the equations. The approach is illustrated with some numerical examples, and the numerical results are analyzed within the distance measure to determine the closeness between the left-hand and right-hand sides of the system.},

  abstract     = {This study looks at how rumors spread, especially online, where false information can quickly spread to millions of people, disrupt public order, infringe on privacy, and endanger public safety. A dishonest user targets friends and strangers with marketing accounts on mobile social networking sites to propagate rumors. In this article, we propose a fractional order nonlinear mathematical framework explaining how rumors spread widely on Facebook and Twitter about different life interest topics with the Caputo operator. For the fractional-order Caputo model, there is an analytical solution verified with the Lipchitz condition for boundedness, positivity, and feasible solutions. The existence and uniqueness of solutions are established using the Banach contraction principle. We conduct qualitative analyses to validate the model and assess control efficiency by calculating the fundamental reproductive number. Additionally, we identify equilibrium points for rumor-free situation. Chaos control will use the regulate for linear responses approach to stabilize the system according to its equilibrium points. The global stability of equilibrium points is confirmed using the Lyapunov function. A numerical iterative approach based on the Newton polynomial interpolation is employed for the numerical approximation of the proposed problem. Numerical simulations have been conducted to illustrate the superior performance of the fractional-order model at different fractional-order values and the surface face graph shows the complete dynamics of rumor propagation in a time scale frame for different factors. This model can capture all historical information of the system under consideration, a capability not present in classical (integer-order) differential equations. The results, which are backed up by graphical representations, show how well the novel method solves this fractional model and how useful it is in combating the spread of rumors.},

The suggested algorithm is computationally efficient, has greater stability, is straightforward to implement on computers, and demands less computer memory. This approach first converts these equations into a class of integral equations and then uses the proposed approach to estimate the solution. Some theorems have been proposed to demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the suggested approach. In addition, an estimate of the error bound for this approach is provided.

  abstract     = {When analyzing the competitive dynamics within a system, the relationships among its objects can exhibit variability depending on different attributes or perspectives. Spherical fuzzy soft theory offers a valuable framework for parameterizing problems involving vague data, combining the properties of spherical fuzzy sets and soft sets. This paper introduces the novel concept of spherical fuzzy soft competition graphs and spherical fuzzy soft economic competition graphs, a comprehensive framework for modeling and analyzing complex competition dynamics in various domains. By amalgamating the principles of spherical fuzzy sets and soft computing, this approach effectively captures and quantifies uncertainty and vagueness intrinsic to real-world competitive interactions. This paper presents an extension of the graph model, incorporating spherical fuzzy soft $$\kappa $$ -competition graphs, which sheds light on competition and economic competition-dependent systems. An application to the domain of illicit cross-border movements demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. It subsequently presents the algorithmic framework for constructing these competition graphs, enabling the assessment of truthness, abstinence, and falseness interactions among competing entities within a system. This paper also delves into comparative analyses, highlighting the unique advantages of spherical fuzzy soft competition graphs over existing models.},
