  abstract     = {As digital ecosystems, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), evolve, cyber threats have become increasingly sophisticated, posing greater challenges for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Artificial intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), enhances cybersecurity through log analysis, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence. However, optimizing NIDS for real-time detection in dynamic, resource-limited contexts remains a significant challenge. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of modern AI-driven methodologies for enhancing NIDS, focusing on transformer-based techniques, graph-based models, and hybrid approaches incorporating explainable AI. LLMs, as transformer-based models, are effective in analyzing complex network data for better anomaly detection and threat prediction. Graph-based models, including Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are well-suited for relational data modeling and multistage attack identification. Hybrid frameworks combine various methods to improve generalizability, accuracy, and interpretability. The paper also highlights challenges such as data privacy and the need for lightweight architectures, which pave the way for sophisticated, adaptive cyber defenses against emerging threats.},

  abstract     = {To address the strong coupling between schema linking and structural parsing in text-to-SQL tasks for small-scale language models, as well as the neglect of SQL skeleton guidance in existing decoupling methods, this paper proposes SKT-SQL, a multi-stage decoupling framework. The framework redesigns the generation process through a three-stage decoupling mechanism: (1) leveraging a schema decoupler to eliminate irrelevant schema items and reduce semantic noise; (2) predicting query hardness to generate an abstract SQL skeleton, forming a structured template with operator logic; (3) utilizing the skeleton as dynamic prompts to guide a transformer-based seq2seq T5 model in precisely filling specific schema items, followed by execution-guided beam search to derive the final SQL query. This "structure-first, entity-later" paradigm eliminates the need to simultaneously resolve syntactic complexity and schema correlations, significantly reducing cognitive load. Experiments on the Spider 1.0 benchmark show that SKT-SQL-base achieves 80.8% execution accuracy (EX), surpassing the 12 $$\times$$ larger T5-3B model by 6.4% and outperforming T5-base by 22.9%. Compared to existing decoupling-based methods, this framework still demonstrates prominent application value, with skeleton prompting notably enhancing small-scale model performance. This study proves that explicit modeling of SQL syntactic skeletons can break through the structured semantic parsing bottleneck of small-scale language models, offering a novel paradigm for database interaction tasks in low-resource scenarios.

  abstract     = {The ability to efficiently resolve conflicts in interactive constraint-based applications is critical for user experience and system reliability. Conflict resolution can be regarded as a specific type of explanation, often denoted as diagnosis. Existing work on integrating machine learning with diagnostic reasoning emphasizes on the combination of hitting set approaches with probabilistic reasoning and memory-based machine learning. An alternative to such two-phase diagnosis approaches is direct diagnosis, which focuses on determining diagnoses without predetermining conflicts. In this article, we utilize diagnosis knowledge from the past to improve diagnosis efficiency while also maintaining user-defined preference criteria. Our approach integrates model-based collaborative filtering (feed-forward neural networks) and other machine learning approaches (e.g., logistic regression and random forest) with direct model-based diagnosis (FastDiag). The re-ordering of constraints as input to the diagnosis algorithm increases the efficiency of diagnostic reasoning for determining preference-preserving diagnoses. Through experiments on real-world configuration knowledge bases (B2C, BusyBox, EA and Linux kernel), we demonstrate significant runtime improvements and high accuracy in diagnosis prediction. With this, we also contribute to the growing body of literature on combining machine learning and constraint-based reasoning.},

Initially, many users approach LLMs as traditional software tools, employing structured, machine-like prompts. However, after their first interaction, a notable shift occurs, such as increased politeness, more natural language phrasing, and shorter, more contextually nuanced prompts. That is, users increasingly adopt conversational behaviors typical of human-to-human communication and, in turn, this suggests a cognitive transition in the way users perceive and engage with AI systems. Analyzing over 200,000 conversations with computational linguistics methods, we find initial indications supporting this change. These insights have implications for AI design, trust, and ethical concerns, highlighting the need for further research beyond a mostly computational perspective to strengthen our findings on how users cognitively frame their interactions with AI.},

To bridge this gap, we propose two novel models: SurvCBM (Survival Concept-based Bottleneck Model) and SurvRCM (Survival Regularized Concept-based Model), which integrate concept-based learning with survival analysis to handle censored event time data. The models employ the Cox proportional hazards model and the Beran estimator. SurvCBM is based on the architecture of the well-known concept bottleneck model, offering interpretable predictions through concept-based explanations. SurvRCM uses concepts as regularization to enhance accuracy. Both models are trained end-to-end and provide interpretable predictions in terms of concepts. Two interpretability approaches are proposed: one leveraging the linear relationship in the Cox model and another using an instance-based explanation framework with the Beran estimator. Numerical experiments demonstrate that SurvCBM outperforms SurvRCM and traditional survival models, underscoring the importance and advantages of incorporating concept information. The code for the proposed algorithms is publicly available.},

Initially, multimodal feature fusion is achieved through the interaction of text features with video features and audio features respectively. Subsequently, two feature vectors related to text are subjected to deep interactive fusion to generate a comprehensive modal representation, thereby enhancing the expression of text-related information. Then, the model clearly employs a multi-scale feature pyramid network structure for feature extraction at multiple scales, effectively fusing sequence information in the integrated modal representation and capturing key sequence features in multimodal data. Finally, the multimodal fusion module integrates the final modal representation for more effective Multimodal Sentiment Analysis(MSA). Experimental results demonstrate that the AIMS model outperforms existing sentiment analysis models on the CMU-MOSEI, CMU-MOSI, CH-SIMSv2 and MELD datasets.},

To address these issues, we propose a textual and structural dual enhancement (TSDE) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph data augmentation, thereby improving the performance of KGC models. To overcome the problem of low-quality entity descriptions, we designed a sampling algorithm to capture multiple paths surrounding entities, transforming this path information into text and integrating it into our carefully designed prompt templates to guide LLMs in generating high-quality descriptions enriched with contextual semantics. Additionally, to address the structural sparsity of KGs, we represent each entity description as a vector and calculate cosine similarity to identify a set of highly similar entities for each entity. We then assign similarity relations to these highly similar entity pairs to generate additional similar triples. After sampling these newly generated similar triples at a specified ratio, we incorporate them into the training set. We validated the effectiveness of the TSDE framework on two publicly available datasets: FB15k-237 and WN18RR. Experimental results demonstrate that the TSDE framework significantly enhances KGC model performance by refining entity descriptions and enriching KG structures.},

A unique metric based on the Average Confidence Score of these models is used to implement dynamic ensemble strategy selection. We test the proposed technique on JUDVLP-QADB.v1, a freshly created question-answering dataset from public Indian government domains. On the JUDVLP-QADB.v1 dataset, the technique improved Exact Match and F1 score significantly. Our ensemble technique selection experiments are two-step. First, we run the same group ensembles with varied language model settings. Second, we combine the best-performing ensembles from different groups to generate cross-group ensembles, and finally we present a novel system for dynamically selecting the ideal ensemble technique. The suggested technique chose the RoBERTa ensemble for the same group and the RoBERTa and DistilBERT ensemble for the cross group during the assessment. After dynamically picking the right ensemble model, we received a maximum Exact Match score of 69.01 and an F1-Score of 83.69. These values show a 15% and 10.31% increase above baseline models. Our study found that dynamically selecting ensembles based on a parameter improves question-answering system performance on the JUDVLP-QADB.v1 test dataset. Our novel ensemble selection method simplifies the procedure by lowering the difficulty of picking from $$\left( {\begin{array}{c}n\\ 2\end{array}}\right) $$ different combinations of ensembles from a set of n models.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal recommendation aims to predict usersâ€™ future behaviors based on historical interaction data and item multimodal information. Previous studies face two main issues. First, due to the complexity and high dimensionality of multimodal features, existing methods fail to effectively extract them, and their rich semantic information is often overlooked. Second, false positive and negative noise in user behavior data interferes with preference modeling-especially in Graph Convolutional Network(GCN)-based models, where such noise propagates through the graph and affects node representations. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge distillation-based collaborative graph diffusion multimodal recommendation model (DiffKD). Specifically, DiffKD adopts a teacher-student framework, where the teacher extracts semantically rich multimodal features and transfers knowledge to the student via a transfer loss. To reduce noise while retaining key interactions, a diffusion model adds and removes noise to generate a user-item graph, which is fused with the original to form a collaborative graph. Finally, a multimodal feature encoder enhances user and item representations by combining high-order collaborative signals from the user-item graph with semantic relationships derived from the item-item graph. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that DiffKD outperforms the strongest baseline by an average of 6.78%.},

  abstract     = {Existing KG-based LLM reasoning methods often neglect the importance of KGâ€™s structural information for reasoning, facing challenges when dealing with complex structures and large amounts of irrelevant information, particularly in knowledge graph question answering (KGQA). To address this issue, this paper proposes a KGQA model named Reasoning via Dynamic Planning on Graph (RDPG). It is based on an Adaptive Path Generation (APG) method put forward by us. RDPG aims to strengthen LLMsâ€™ reasoning capabilities by integrating knowledge reasoning paths in KGs. The APG leverages LLMsâ€™ interactive learning capabilities to dynamically adjust the depth and number of generated relation paths, constructing optimal path structures suitable for the current reasoning task. The generated reasoning paths meet the semantic requirements of the questions while avoiding unnecessary noise. Specifically, RDPG first dynamically generates candidate relation paths as reasoning plans based on the input question and LLMsâ€™ real-time feedback, ensuring that the reasoning paths contain highly relevant information from the KG. Then, the model further alleviates the LLMsâ€™ hallucination problem caused by irrelevant noise or missing information through path correction and expansion, providing a faithful reasoning foundation for LLMs. Finally, LLMs combine their built-in knowledge with retrieved external knowledge from KG, enhancing the reasoning process through Chain-of-Thought to meet complex reasoning demands. Experimental results demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches on two benchmark datasets. Additionally, further experiments validate the plug-and-play feature and effectiveness of our APG method in multi-hop KGQA tasks, indicating it applicable to different LLMs and KGs with strong adaptability and extensibility.},
