  abstract     = {The selection of smartphones is a complex decision-making process influenced by multiple criteria such as technical specifications, brand reputation, price, battery capacity, internal storage, and user preferences. The ambiguity and uncertainty around phenomena are handled by fuzzy sets. Picture fuzzy (PF) sets are an extension of fuzzy sets used for managing uncertainty in more complex situations when fuzzy sets are unable to produce reliable results. This paper outlines a framework in PF environment to solve the problem of selection of smartphone based on different factors. A new PF knowledge measure is proposed to measure the amount of knowledge linked to PF sets, and its reliability is tested using some numerical examples. A new PF accuracy measure is proposed based on the suggested knowledge measure and is used to find the pattern similarity of unknown patterns with given pattern. A new score function is proposed to compare the PF numbers, which can get around the drawbacks of existing score functions. A modified combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) technique is provided to select the best smartphone by using suggested scoring function and accuracy measure. Lastly, to prove the effectiveness of the suggested method, a comparative analysis carries out with the other existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Traditional assessments of visual pattern memory difficulty rely predominantly on the number of items, overlooking other potential influential factors. This study aimed to identify and analyze several variables affecting performance in a visual pattern memory task. We conducted a computer-based visual pattern memory experiment with 20 participants. The paradigm systematically manipulated both the quantity and spatial arrangement of target stimuli while controlling for eye movements. Performance data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and linear mixed models (LMMs) to identify significant predictors of task difficulty. Performance was influenced by the number and spatial relationships of target and non-target stimuli, their distance from the display center, and participants’ selection strategies. Dense stimulus patterns facilitated better recall than distributed configurations, suggesting an advantage of chunking strategies. Additionally, a left-side selection bias emerged, which was affected by target distribution. This study highlights the complexity of difficulty scaling in a visual pattern memory task. It demonstrates that incorporating multiple quantified aspects of visual stimuli, including spatial configuration, target distribution, and behavioral strategies, is essential for developing adaptive cognitive training programs that rely on spatial information processing.},

  abstract     = {Sarcasm is a complex linguistic act in which the literal meaning is opposite to the true attitude. Multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) aims to identify whether a given multimodal data sample is sarcastic. Although existing methods have achieved impressive success, they ignored sarcastic information in text and potential clues in images and failed to fully explore cross-modal feature representation and inconsistency between modalities. To solve the above problems, we propose a knowledge enhanced and incongruity perceiving network (KEIPN) for MSD. We design a text knowledge pretraining module that includes RoBERTa models enhanced with biased sentiment knowledge and sarcasm knowledge. Next, we develop an image knowledge amalgamation module to integrate different types of knowledge into visual model, enhancing its visual understanding capability. Pretrained language and visual models can extract better feature representations. Then, we propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation module to model the relationship between text and images and achieve adaptive weighted fusion. Finally, we design an incongruity perception module to capture the inconsistency between images and text and weight the loss using keyless attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets MMSD and MMSD2.0 demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},

  abstract     = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is an attractive and challenging fine-grained subtask in the natural language processing (NLP) community. In prior works, the relevant research has achieved significant progress in leveraging external knowledge to strengthen the sentiment representation in ABSA. However, the prior simple utilization of external knowledge hurts the model’s comprehension of the diversity of sentiment. Therefore, this paper proposed a novel ABSA approach to achieve multi-dimensional understanding of sentiment, namely triple-dimensional graph attention networks (TDGAT). Preliminarily, a task-oriented prompt template is designed to evoke the pre-trained language model (PLM) generation ability, which would provide the essential semantic features for sentiment understanding. To avoid the errors caused by the single-dimension external knowledge, TDGAT constructs triple-dimensional sentiment graphs depending on valence, arousal, and dominance, respectively, which enhance the model’s sentiment comprehension ability greatly. Besides, this work also leverages GATs to evacuate the sentiment relations through exploiting the constructed graphs, which would largely assist to learn an optimal ABSA model. Eventually, to uncover the optimal sentiment exploration perspective, extensive experiments are conducted on five public and available benchmark datasets, and the related results show the proposed TDGAT outperforms the-state-of-art baselines with different sentiment perspectives.},

A key challenge in sentiment classification is high dimensionality, as it often leads to reduced model performance due to redundant or irrelevant features. Removing such features, a common practice in machine learning and data processing, helps create an optimal feature space by reducing the number of input variables. This study proposes a novel multi-view ensemble learning model that integrates ElasticNetCV-based feature selection across multiple text representations—namely, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), DistillBERT, and Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic evaluation of ElasticNetCV applied to both traditional and contextual embeddings within a unified model. The selected features are used to train a multi-view soft voting ensemble model incorporating Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as base classifiers. Experiments on Yelp, Amazon, and IMDB datasets demonstrate notable F1-scores of 97.1%, 91.2%, and 95.4%, respectively, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Understanding customer-perceived value is essential for driving strategic supplier development and operational excellence in modern supply chains. As customer sentiments increasingly manifest in social media, natural language processing (NLP) techniques carry the potential of extracting actionable insights from unstructured data. This study proposes a novel decision-making model that combines aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) with fuzzy inference systems (FIS) to support supplier evaluation based on customer value perception. Bridging symbolic and sub-symbolic AI, the model quantifies sentiment polarity, subjectivity, and aspect relevance from social media content, integrating this information into a multi-stage fuzzy logic framework for large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM). Unlike conventional supplier evaluation methods, this approach operationalizes concept-level affective information by fusing customer sentiment information with supply chain operational data. An illustrative application in the smartphone industry demonstrates the model’s ability to analyze social media data from the X platform and generate quantitative indicators reflecting customer value perception. The model effectively incorporates these insights into supplier evaluation, highlighting suppliers’ strengths and areas for improvement. The results show that sentiment-informed supplier assessment enables more responsive and customer-aligned development strategies. The proposed approach highlights the benefits of integrating sentic computing principles into supply chain analytics, showing the model’s capability to capture customer perceptions and make them a driver for continuous improvement initiatives in supplier development.},

It explores the role of the AI’s curiosity triggering and response behaviors in stimulating and sustaining student curiosity, affecting the frequency and complexity of student-initiated questions. The study further assesses how AI interventions shape student engagement, foster discovery curiosity, and enhance team performance within the IMD learning environment. Using a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm, a human experimenter dynamically adjusts the AI tutor teammate’s behavior through a large language model. By employing a mixed-methods exploratory design, a total of 11 high school students participated in four IMD tasks that involved molecular visualization and calculations, which increased in complexity over a 60 min. Team performance was evaluated through real-time observation and recordings, whereas team communication was measured by question complexity, and AI’s curiosity-triggering and response behaviors. Cross recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA) metrics reflected structural alignment in coordination and were linked to communication behaviors. High-performing teams exhibited superior task completion, deeper understanding, and increased engagement. Advanced questions were associated with AI curiosity triggering, indicating heightened engagement and cognitive complexity. CRQA metrics highlighted dynamic synchronization in student-AI interactions, emphasizing structured yet adaptive engagement to promote curiosity. These proof-of-concept findings suggest that the AI’s dual role as a teammate and educator indicates its capacity to provide adaptive feedback, sustaining engagement, and epistemic curiosity. Future research will refine AI strategies by integrating multimodal data to enhance curiosity-driven learning.},

Besides that, a novel event-triggered mechanism, which utilizes both on the latest sampled state and a non-negative threshold, is implemented to enhance the efficiency of resource utilization. The computing cost is reduced, and the communication resources are saved by reducing the number of sampling times and the amount of data transmission, thus improving the system efficiency. It is proved that the closed-loop system is semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) in probability and the Zeno behavior is prevented through the analysis of Lyapunov stability theory.

However, existing approaches often rely on a single linear comparison module at the end of the feature extraction pipeline and commonly utilize pre-trained models from other domains, which might not generalize well to specific datasets such as those involving bearing faults. In this study, we propose a novel few-shot learning model, namely the Multiple Local-Global Correlation-based Deep Neural Network (MLGCN), for bearing fault diagnosis. The model is designed by simultaneously learning nonlinear data distributions and embedding representations in an end-to-end fashion. Inspired by human perceptual mechanisms that focus attention on task-relevant information, we introduce a Selective Kernel Attention Feature Extractor module to dynamically capture diverse and critical signal features, which is especially effective in limited data conditions. In addition, we present the Multiple Dual Local-Global Cross Attention (Dual LGCA) module to leverage the full feature hierarchy for enhanced similarity learning, enabling hierarchical similarity reasoning—akin to human comparison strategies that integrate multi-scale contextual cues. The proposed model is assessed using two popular bearing fault benchmarks, including the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and Paderborn University (PU) datasets, in distinct experiments to assess its accuracy under limited data and its generalization to real bearing damages.

Early detection of nutrient imbalances, such as inadequate nitrogen levels, is essential for optimizing plant growth and achieving high agricultural productivity. Nitrogen plays a vital role in various plant processes, including the synthesis of chlorophyll, proteins, amino acids, and nucleic acids, all of which are crucial for proper plant development. Deficiency in nitrogen can lead to observable changes in plant morphology, such as reduced leaf number, discoloration, and stunted growth. Recent advancements in imaging technologies have facilitated the development of computer vision-based plant phenomics, enabling rapid, non-invasive, and automated detection of plant stress. In this study, we propose an automated deep learning (DL)-based phenotyping approach to detect and classify nitrogen deficiency in plant leaf images. The method employs EfficientNet-B0, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, to identify and categorize stress symptoms associated with nitrogen insufficiency. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated on two datasets, using key metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results show that the EfficientNet-B0 model achieves an accuracy of 97.9%, outperforming the baseline model, which reached an accuracy of 93.2%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning model in accurately detecting nitrogen deficiency in plants, offering a promising tool for precision agriculture applications.},

  abstract     = {Product color emotional design (PCED) systems are characterized by a power-law distribution; this is manifested as a small number of colors constituting a large number of emotional connections of users, and the majority of colors constituting a small number of emotional connections of users. This will lead to the neglect of the potential connections between colors, thus causing the inability to generate a product color design scheme based on color interactions. Consequently, the reliability of the design scheme ultimately undermines the reliability of the design scheme. For this reason, this paper proposes a PCED method based on interdependent networks (INs) and cascading failure (CF). First, a web crawler, word processing, clustering, and complex network analysis are utilized to construct the product color emotion dataset. Then, based on this dataset, the INs of color emotion are constructed, and the initial failure node in the color emotion network is determined based on a variety of important node judgment methods. Finally, the color scheme that meets the user’s emotional needs is generated via the CF-based product color scheme generation rules. The PCED of a high-speed rail business seat is provided as an example to verify the validity of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The healthcare industry has witnessed significant advancements with the adoption of smart wearable devices, enabling remote patient monitoring and treatment. However, these technologies introduce critical security risks, including session hijacking, data manipulation, and spoofing attacks, which can compromise patient privacy and safety. This study proposes a secure framework integrating a ridgelet neural network optimized with the addax optimization algorithm (AOA) to detect and mitigate threats in wearable healthcare systems. The proposed three-layered framework consists of (1) an analytics layer, which utilizes a ridgelet neural network for classifying wearable device data as malicious or non-malicious, (2) a blockchain layer, ensuring the integrity and secure storage of verified patient data, and (3) a user layer, facilitating authorized access to healthcare providers. The framework demonstrates superior performance in detecting malicious data, achieving an accuracy ranging from 98.5 to 99.5%. The blockchain layer ensures data transparency, immutability, and security, significantly reducing the risks of cyber threats. The proposed approach enhances the security of wearable healthcare technology by effectively classifying threats and safeguarding patient data, offering a trusted and resilient health data management solution.},

  abstract     = {Mental illnesses affect almost 15% of the world’s population, with half of the cases emerging before age 14. Improved methods for predicting mental distress among adolescents, particularly in vulnerable populations, are needed. This study utilized traditional machine learning techniques to predict mental health status at age 17. We assessed the correlates of mental health outcomes in a sample of 632 adolescents with general mental distress (i.e., total difficulties score of 17 or higher) at age 11, who participated in the UK Millennium Cohort Study. Predictors measured at ages 11 and 14 were included in the analysis. Mental health status at age 17 was best predicted using a Balanced Random Forest model (AUC 0.75). Explainability techniques enabled the identification of several critical factors, such as school environment, emotional distress, sleep patterns, patience, and social network at ages 11 or 14, which were able to differentiate participants with poor or good mental health outcomes at age 17. Individuals experiencing persistent mental distress between the ages 11 and 17 were most likely to suffer from unhappiness and academic struggles. Our results point to potentially modifiable factors associated with the progression of mental distress in adolescents at high risk. These factors could pave the way for improved early intervention and preventive strategies for vulnerable young people during adolescence.},
