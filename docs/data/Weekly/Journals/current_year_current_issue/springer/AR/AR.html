  abstract     = {Multi-robot teams provide an effective solution for delivering multiple types of goods, such as food or medicine, to various locations of demand. This work presents a Voronoi-based coverage control approach to the multi-resource allocation problem, and considers a heterogeneous team comprising robots with different resource types and capacities. The team must supply resources to multiple demand locations. Demand of resources may change over time, and fluctuate in overall demand, which is represented over the environment as a time-varying density function. From the demand density, robots minimize their respective locational cost, adapting and moving to areas of higher demand. Robots must adhere to supply constraints and replenish resources over time to ensure persistent resource coverage. This paper therefore investigates how to enable persistent deployments, wherein robots must continually alternate between serving demand or replenishing resources. We explore four algorithms for resource replenishment, which vary in communication, forecasting, and information assumptions. Simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate a need-based auction algorithm, which aims to minimize service blackouts, produces the best performance for a heterogeneous team. We also present a discussion on acceptable alternatives for homogeneous teams without communication.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous robots are increasingly deployed for long-term information-gathering tasks, which pose two key challenges: planning informative trajectories in environments that evolve across space and time, and ensuring persistent operation under energy constraints. This paper presents a unified framework, mEclares, that addresses both challenges through adaptive ergodic search and energy-aware scheduling in multi-robot systems. Our contributions are two-fold: (1) we model real-world variability using stochastic spatiotemporal environments, where the underlying information evolves continuously over space and time under process noise. To guide exploration, we construct a target information spatial distribution (TISD) based on clarity, a metric that captures the decay of information in the absence of observations and highlights regions of high uncertainty; and (2) we introduce Robust-meSch ( RmeSch ), an online scheduling method that enables persistent operation by coordinating rechargeable robots sharing a single mobile charging station. Unlike prior work, our approach avoids reliance on preplanned schedules, static or dedicated charging stations, and simplified robot dynamics. Instead, the scheduler supports general nonlinear models, accounts for uncertainty in the estimated position of the charging station, and handles central node failures. The proposed framework is validated through real-world hardware experiments, and feasibility guarantees are provided under specific assumptions.

  abstract     = {Swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly becoming vital to our society, undertaking tasks such as search and rescue, surveillance and delivery. A special variant of Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) has emerged as a promising approach for the safe management of these swarms by combining the scalability of distributed computation with dynamic swarm motion control. In this DMPC method, multiple agents solve local optimization problems with coupled anti-collision constraints, periodically exchanging their solutions. Despite its potential, existing methodologies using this DMPC variant have yet to be deployed on distributed hardware that fully utilize true distributed computation and wireless communication. This is primarily due to the lack of a communication system tailored to meet the unique requirements of mobile swarms and an architecture that supports distributed computation while adhering to the payload constraints of UAVs. We present DMPC-Swarm, a new swarm control methodology that integrates an efficient, stateless low-power wireless communication protocol with a novel DMPC algorithm that provably avoids UAV collisions even under message loss. By utilizing event-triggered and distributed off-board computing, DMPC-Swarm supports nano UAVs, allowing them to benefit from additional computational resources while retaining scalability and fault tolerance. In a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove that DMPC-Swarm guarantees collision avoidance under realistic conditions, including communication delays and message loss. Finally, we present DMPC-Swarm’s implementation on a swarm of up to 16 nano-quadcopters, demonstrating the first realization of these DMPC variants with computation distributed on multiple physical devices interconnected by a real wireless mesh networks. A video showcasing DMPC-Swarm is available at http://tiny.cc/DMPCSwarm .},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based on LiDAR in dynamic environments remains a challenging problem due to unreliable data association and residual ghost tracks in the map. In recent years, some related works have attempted to utilize semantic information or geometric constraints between consecutive frames to reject dynamic objects as outliers. However, challenges persist, including poor real-time performance, heavy reliance on meticulously annotated datasets, and susceptibility to misclassifying static points as dynamic. This paper presents a novel dynamic LiDAR SLAM framework called DynaLOAM, in which a complementary dynamic interference suppression scheme is exploited. For accurate relative pose estimation, a lightweight detector is proposed to rapidly respond to pre-defined dynamic object classes in the LiDAR FOV and eliminate correspondences from dynamic landmarks. Then, an online submap cleaning method based on visibility and clustering is proposed for real-time dynamic object removal in submap, which is further utilized for pose optimization and global static map construction. By integrating the complementary characteristics of prior appearance detection and online visibility check, DynaLOAM can finally achieve accurate pose estimation and static map construction in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments are conducted on the KITTI dataset and three real scenarios. The results show that our approach achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at https://github.com/HITSZ-NRSL/DynaLOAM.git .},

  abstract     = {This work addresses the challenge of grasping a target object in cluttered environments, even when it is partially visible or fully occluded. The proposed approach enables the manipulator to learn a sequence of strategic pushing actions that rearrange the scene to make the target object graspable. Our pipeline integrates image morphological processing with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), using GR-ConvNet to predict grasp points for the target. When the object is considered ungraspable, a soft actor-critic (SAC) model guides optimal pushing actions. A novel clutter map is introduced, encoding environmental clutter into a quantitative score that informs the decision-making process. The system shows improved performance with a discount factor ( $$\gamma $$ ) of 0.9, demonstrated through comparative analysis with and without the clutter map. We also compare models trained in discrete versus continuous action spaces to evaluate the impact of action space on DRL effectiveness. The pipeline generalizes well to diverse objects and integrates directly with hardware, requiring no additional training for real-world deployment.},
