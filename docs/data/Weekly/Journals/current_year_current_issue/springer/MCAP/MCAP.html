  abstract     = {In this article, we are dealing with two important issues that arise in the competing risks analysis of series system lifetime data. First, we deal with incomplete lifetimes of the system’s components, observed under a Type-I progressive hybrid censoring scheme. Second, we examine situations where the exact cause of failure of any system is unknown. To address these issues, we develop models incorporating cause dependent and time dependent masking probabilities. The Maxwell distribution is considered as the lifetime model for components, and parameter estimation is performed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. In a simulation study, the derived methodology is explored for varying sample sizes and different censoring patterns under cause and time dependent masking mechanisms. For real-life illustration, the data set of 10,000 hard drives is analyzed. To choose a better model in the presence of various masking options, the predictive power and deviance information criterion are also explored.},

  abstract     = {We present closed-form solutions to the problem of pricing of the perpetual American compound lookback options on the maximum drawdown with fixed strikes in the Black-Merton-Scholes model. It is shown that the optimal exercise times are the first times at which the underlying risky asset price process reaches either lower or upper stochastic boundaries depending on the current values of its running maximum and maximum drawdown processes. The proof is based on the reduction of the original double optimal stopping problem to a sequence of two single optimal stopping problems for the resulting three-dimensional continuous Markov process. The latter problems are solved as the equivalent free-boundary problems by means of the smooth-fit and normal-reflection conditions for the value functions at the optimal stopping boundaries and at the edges of the three-dimensional state space. We show that the optimal exercise boundaries are determined as the maximal and minimal solutions to the appropriate first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations.},

  abstract     = {The Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) is an informed MCMC method that is used to sample from a target distribution of interest. Its proposal distribution makes use of the gradient of the target’s log-density in order to generate suitable candidates for the chain. This sampler is quite efficient in the stationary phase, but displays a notoriously erratic behaviour out of stationarity. The Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm with annealed proposals (aMALA) is a generalization of the usual MALA that features two tuning parameters: the usual step size $$\delta$$ and a parameter $$\gamma$$ that may be adjusted to accommodate N, the dimension of the target distribution (with $$\gamma =1$$ corresponding to MALA). It has been established in Boisvert-Beaudry and Bédard (Stat Comput 32(1):5, 2022) that aMALA with $$1<\gamma \le 2$$ usually outperforms MALA, even in high-dimensional contexts where the latter should become optimal. The results of this paper demonstrate that the computational cost of aMALA is $$\mathcal {O}(N^{1/3})$$ in its non-stationary regime and that it may be as small as $$\mathcal {O}(N^{1/5})$$ in stationarity. This is in contrast to MALA, whose cost is $$\mathcal {O}(N^{1/2})$$ out of stationarity and $$\mathcal {O}(N^{1/3})$$ in its stationary regime. Hence, in virtually any situation of practical relevance where we study an N-dimensional target distribution (with $$N<\infty$$ ) and/or the algorithm is started out of stationarity, the MALA with annealed proposals turns out to be superior to MALA, and as easily implemented/tuned as the latter.},
