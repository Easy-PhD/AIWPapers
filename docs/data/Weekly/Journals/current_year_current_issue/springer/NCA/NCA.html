  abstract     = {Nowadays, frequent maintenance and repair of mechanical equipment whose goal is to deter the suspension time of railway infrastructures are proven to be ineffectual. It also results in loss of reliability as well as consuming unnecessary means and costs, since at least half of the precautionary maintenance activities are considered redundant. Despite this spending, operators are struggling to adequately maintain their assets—resulting in unacceptably frequent delays and cancellations and low levels of satisfaction among rail users. Thanks to the increasing availability and sophistication of advanced analytics, operators have a significant opportunity to create solutions to long-standing maintenance challenges. The role of predictive maintenance and especially that of Design-Out Maintenance constitute the necessary procedure that can predict in time any hardware failures, while reducing the damage or wearing down of the overall operational equipment. This can increase the effectiveness of the railways, while significantly reducing the overall expenditure needed for the repair and maintenance of the industry’s infrastructure. This paper proposes a predictive railways maintenance strategy based on deep learning techniques. Specifically, and in order to achieve the exact remaining useful life of the railway equipment, a hybrid neural architecture of long short-term memory autoencoder network is used. The purpose of this suggested architecture is the automatic feature extraction of dynamic time series and their utilization on a prediction model, which can predict with high accuracy the remaining useful life of the railway’s mechanical equipment.},

  abstract     = {Automatically extracting knowledge from diverse datasets is a valuable task that helps experts explore new types of data while reducing the time spent on manual annotations. This is particularly important for emerging fields such as emergency management and environmental monitoring. Traditional unsupervised methods often struggle to capture experts’ intuitions or integrate non-formalized knowledge. On the other hand, supervised methods typically require a substantial amount of prior knowledge to function effectively. Constrained clustering, a semi-supervised approach, addresses these challenges by allowing experts to incorporate their knowledge into the clustering process. However, it often yields suboptimal results because it is difficult for experts to provide constraints that are both informative and coherent. Building on the idea that it is easier to critique than to construct, this article introduces a novel method called I-Samarah, an incremental constrained clustering approach. This method alternates between a clustering phase, where expert-provided constraints are applied, and a critique phase, where experts provide feedback on the clustering results. Through an iterative process, the method refines the clusters, improving their alignment with expert knowledge. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of I-Samarah using remote sensing image time series, comparing it to other constrained clustering methods in terms of result quality and to supervised methods in terms of annotation efficiency.},

Nowadays, energy demand data are data coming from smart meters and have to be processed in real-time for more efficient demand management. In addition, electricity prices data can present changes over time such as new patterns and new trends. Therefore, real-time forecasting algorithms for both demand and prices have to adapt and adjust to online data in order to provide timely and accurate responses. This work presents a new algorithm for electricity demand and prices forecasting in real-time. The proposed algorithm generates a prediction model based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, which is incrementally updated in an online scenario considering both changes to existing patterns and adding new detected patterns to the model. Both time-frequency and error threshold based model updates have been evaluated. Results using energy demand from 2007 to 2016 and prices data for different time periods from the Spanish electricity market are reported and compared with other benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Early detection and accurate classification of brain tumors using MRI scans are crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment planning. However, with the growing patient population and the increasing volume of MRI data, as well as limitations like noise in image data and poor resolution, accurate and rapid diagnosis becomes challenging. To address these issues, AI systems are needed to support radiologists by offering a second opinion. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have significantly improved MRI-based brain tumor diagnosis. Despite these improvements, challenges such as the need for higher computational power, difficulty processing large and high-resolution datasets, and limitations of classical vector space. However, quantum computing and quantum computing-based AI methods, by leveraging properties such as superposition and entanglement, have the potential to process data in parallel, handle higher-dimensional data more efficiently, and solve certain problems that classical methods struggle with, more quickly and efficiently. In this study, we proposed four different hybrid quantum–classical integrated neural network (HQCINN) models featuring various multilayer parameterized quantum circuit architectures, which we refer to as “shallow and deep circuits,” designed based on properties such as “entanglement capability, circuit loss, and the number of trainable parameters.” These models aim to distinguish between glioma, meningioma, pituitary and non-tumor classes. The performance of these models was compared to classical DL models, revealing that quantum models provide higher accuracy and lower loss values with fewer parameters. Additionally, when the HQCINN model with the best performance was applied to a brain tumor dataset consisting of CT images, it demonstrated consistent performance across different patient data distributions and imaging modalities, thereby showing strong generalization capability. These results suggest that HQCINN approaches could provide significant advantages in medical imaging tasks, particularly in complex datasets like brain tumor classification.},

Due to the low prevalence of AML, reviewing large CT datasets retrospectively is time-consuming. Developing an artificial intelligence (AI) model to identify the AM region can help radiologists manage workloads and improve diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a U-shaped network architecture with two attention mechanisms to maintain long-range dependencies and enhance localization. We propose a parallel multi-head self-attention (MHSA) module called wide-MHSA (W-MHSA), along with a dilated depth-wise parallel path connection (DDWPP) to support upsampling stages. Additionally, an expanding convolution block is combined with W-MHSA in the encoder to ensure a lightweight design. Our proposed model demonstrates superior segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art networks, showing strong potential for clinical application in AM lesion detection workflows.},

Accurate demand forecasting has become a critical tool for decision-makers, as it allows better resource allocation, inventory management, and strategic planning. Recurrent deep learning methods, which use gating mechanisms to maintain an internal state aligned with time series data, are among the most widely used approaches to improve forecast accuracy. Despite their success, these models still exhibit significant untapped potential that could be realized by rethinking the design of their gating mechanisms. To address this, we introduce a novel demand forecasting method inspired by Kolmogorov–Arnold networks (KANs), featuring a modified recurrent architecture with a restructured gating mechanism. This innovation leverages KAN principles to enhance the model’s capacity to capture intricate temporal dependencies and adapt to evolving demand patterns. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its ability to provide more accurate and reliable demand forecasting results.},

Symbolic processing in conventional artificial intelligence has strong inference abilities but is not well suited for handling large amounts of ambiguous data. Contrastingly, neural networks can easily handle large amounts of ambiguous data but are not well suited for making complex inferences. Therefore, the authors realized the unification of the knowledge base, including ambiguous data, using a network that combines a memory network and recurrent neural network. The novelty of the proposed network is that matching, which is a unification process, is highly efficient and substitution, which is a unification process, is robust. The proposed network enables highly efficient matching by grouping multiple terms and processing them in a memory network. Furthermore, it can handle unknown words even during substitution because it uses a recurrent neural network to perform substitution. The experimental results show that the proposed network can achieve more efficient unification of ambiguous data than the baseline. This study combines symbolic processing and deep learning and suggests that it contributes to the realization of complex inferences from large amounts of ambiguous data, which has proven challenging in conventional research. Furthermore, the use of unification, which handles large amounts of ambiguous data, facilitates the development of inference systems with human-interactive interfaces. This allows humans to obtain inference results without knowing the representations of the knowledge base.},

  abstract     = {Roller bearings play a crucial role in mechanical systems, where their operational condition directly impacts system performance and lifespan. However, detecting early-stage bearing faults during routine maintenance remains a challenge due to the cost and technical limitations of current fault diagnosis methods, often resulting in reduced accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a bearing fault diagnosis method based on the MBConv Vision Transformer (MB-ViT) with frequency feature fusion. Specifically, we introduce a novel approach that transforms bearing fault signals into RGB images by combining Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF) images, thereby enhancing feature representation and improving fault recognition. Additionally, recognizing the limitations of the traditional Vision Transformer (ViT) in capturing local features, we introduce the MB-Multi-Head Self-Attention (MB-MSA) module to overcome this challenge. Experimental results using data from Case Western Reserve University and Xi’an Jiaotong University show that feature fusion significantly improves fault diagnosis accuracy, while the MB-MSA module enhances both diagnostic precision and robustness. MB-ViT achieves an accuracy of 99.90 $$\%$$ in bearing fault diagnosis tasks, demonstrating its superior performance. In summary, the proposed model outperforms existing ViT-based methods, providing a promising solution for bearing fault diagnosis and supporting the advancement of next-generation industrial technologies.

  abstract     = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis task aims at predicting the sentiment polarity of a specific aspect in a sentence. Recent works have shown that attention-based and syntax-based approaches have gradually become mainstream methods. However, attention-based models may erroneously utilize unrelated context words as cues for prediction in sentences with long-range word dependency information. Besides, methods based on graph neural networks have been applied to model syntactic structure information, although great outcomes have been achieved, these methods are overly dependent on the precision of the syntactical dependency tree, which may lead to suboptimal dependencies between words and thus introduce noise. Effectively incorporating semantic relevance information and syntactic structure information remains a challenging task. To address the shortcomings referred to, we propose the dependency relationship-enhanced graph convolutional network (DREGCN) model, which utilizes a dual channel to integrate semantic relevance information and syntactic structure information. Specifically, in the syntactic channel, we preserve the original dependency tree to obtain global syntactic information, while introducing an aspect-oriented reconstruction tree to capture local syntactic information. Additionally, in contrast to previous studies where context words and aspect words were modeled separately, we propose cosine networks in the semantic channel to enhance information interaction between contexts and aspects. The experimental results show that our DREGCN model has a strong advantage on the three publicly available datasets.},

  abstract     = {Due to the expensive and time-consuming nature of obtaining pixel-level annotations for real-world images in semantic segmentation, using readily available synthetic data to train models is practical. This allows the model to adapt to real-world images without needing additional annotations. This process has been explored extensively in the context of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). Despite numerous studies proposing novel adaptation strategies, many have largely overlooked the role of the student network and the crucial impact of spatial relationships between pixels on pseudo-label generation. To address pseudo-label noise and enhance the quality of pseudo-labels, three simple yet crucial modification modules are employed: (1) Student Network Reverse-Guiding The Teacher Network: Replace low-confidence pseudo-labels generated by the teacher network at the current position with high-confidence pseudo-labels generated by the student network. (2) Pixel-Space Self-Modification: Leverage the spatial distribution characteristics between pixels by replacing unreliable low-probability labels within a specified range with high-probability labels identified by different categories of pixels within the same range. (3) Small Connected Component Elimination: Identify small connected domains within a specified range that are below a certain threshold and replace the labels within these domains with the label having the highest number of pixels in the surrounding area. In summary, the improvements introduced by these three modules increased the mIoU from GTA to Cityscapes to 76.8 and from Synthia to Cityscapes to 67.9, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed modules in enhancing model segmentation performance.},

It addresses the problem of limited personalization and static content delivery in traditional language learning platforms. The objective is to design a hybrid ITS that adapts to individual learner performance, knowledge level, and emotional feedback. The proposed system integrates rule-based classification, ontology-driven knowledge structuring, semantic similarity algorithms, and sentiment analysis using a BERT-based deep learning model. Learners are initially categorized using pre-assessment rules, and idioms are then recommended based on difficulty, domain relevance, and previous learning outcomes. Feedback is analyzed in real time to guide dialogue and content adaptation. The methodology was evaluated through controlled user interaction scenarios. Results indicate a 25% improvement in quiz performance and a 30% increase in learner engagement, compared to a baseline non-adaptive version. Learners received personalized recommendations, adaptive quizzes, and emotionally responsive system messages, improving motivation and retention. However, limitations include the scalability of rule-based logic, difficulties in culturally interpreting idioms, and occasional inaccuracies in sentiment detection. Future work will explore reinforcement learning for dynamic adaptation and multilingual support for broader applicability. In conclusion, the system demonstrates that combining symbolic and deep learning techniques in ITS significantly enhances the learning experience. It offers a replicable model for personalized, intelligent, and emotionally aware instruction in domain-specific language learning.},

  abstract     = {Gait recognition is an emerging biometric technology that identifies individuals based on their unique walking patterns with gait sequences and variations serving as strong biometric features. Unlike other biometric modalities, it can operate over long distances without requiring active participation from the subjects, thus having wide application in security and surveillance. The performance of gait recognition can be significantly affected by variations such as view angle, posture, clothing and occlusion. Despite the advances in deep learning, these variations still pose a challenge. Specifically, a person’s appearance differs based on walking directions, impacting the accuracy of gait recognition. Existing works primarily address appearance-level variation and do not explicitly suppress the influence of walking direction. We propose a novel approach to remove the influence of walking direction in gait recognition via an adversarial process. We introduce a three module framework—the Feature Extraction Network (FEN), Gait Recognition Network (GRN) and the Direction Estimation Network (DEN). We implement an adversarial training paradigm with walking direction as the adversarial parameter in which we simultaneously train the FEN to enhance recognition capabilities of GRN while hindering DEN’s ability to estimate the walking direction, thus learning direction irrelevant gait recognition features. We train our model on the benchmark datasets, CASIA-B and OU-MVLP. Furthermore, we provide the first experimental demonstration showing that adversarial learning actively avoids direction-related features forming more compact clusters with better inter-class separability while maintaining comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art gait recognition models.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms have been widely employed for solving expensive optimization problems. To address high-dimensional expensive optimization problems, we propose an evolutionary sampling-assisted particle swarm optimization method, termed ESPSO. ESPSO consists of some evolutionary sampling-assisted strategies. It first improves the initialized population with some elite samples by evolutionary sampling. Secondly, during the optimization process, the method builds a local radial basis function model using the personal historical optimal data of the population to approximate the objective function landscape. Finally, surrogate-assisted local search and surrogate-assisted trust region search are designed to find promising candidate solutions for replacing individuals in the population to accelerate the search process. Behavioral research experiments of ESPSO verified these strategies have led to improvements in the search efficiency of the algorithm in various aspects, such as initialization, population update, and optimal solution promotion. We compared ESPSO with five state-of-the-art SAEAs using 18 benchmark functions, which show that ESPSO outperforms the other compared SAEAs and get the best average ranking of 2.194.},

The results show that the CoABC based on the hybrid encoding mode can train the optimal SLFNs for classification tasks with average test accuracy of 85.12%.

  abstract     = {Software defect prediction (SDP) models rely on various software metrics and defect data to identify potential defects in new software modules. However, the performance of these predictive models can be negatively impacted by irrelevant, redundant metrics and the imbalanced nature of defect datasets. Additionally, the previous studies mainly use conventional machine learning (ML) techniques, but their predictive performance is not superior enough. Addressing these issues is crucial to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of SDP models. This study presents a novel approach to SDP using a multi-filter wrapper feature selection technique (MFWFS). To identify a subset of relevant and informative features, we leverage the combination of filter techniques—Information gain (IG), Chi-square (CS), and Relief-F (RF) method, and a wrapper technique—Opposition-Based Whale Optimization Algorithm (OBWOA). One-dimensional-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an attention mechanism is employed to enhance the classification performance of the predictive model by efficiently integrating the selected characteristics into abstract deep semantic features. We undertake experiments on seventeen open-source software datasets on four performance measures—AUC, G-mean, F-measure, and MCC and compare the obtained results with existing state-of-the-art ML and hybrid algorithms. The experimental findings demonstrate the greater efficiency of our approach, highlighting the usefulness of the multi-filter wrapper feature selection technique and 1D-CNN with attention to SDP.},

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) is an effective population-based optimization approach that has been widely used to deal with scientific and engineering problems. However, the performance of DE method is largely dependent on its trial vector produce strategy, namely, mutation strategy, crossover operation and its corresponding control parameters. As claimed by the ‘No free Lunch theorem’, each mutation or crossover strategy has its fatal flaws; hence, the DE method having a single operation strategy cannot solve all types of optimization problems. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-strategy DE (MS-DE) in this study. First, the proposed algorithm uses combined mutation strategies including two powerful mutation strategies and selects them in a probabilistic way. Second, an improved crossover operation is introduced to tackle the stagnation problem. When a stagnation occurs, DE employs the top p-best vector to conduct crossover operation. Third, the control parameters are tuned in novel adaptation schemes. Finally, a local search is utilized in the proposed method to accelerate the convergence. The proposed MS-DE method is examined on CEC2017 test suite, and experiment results confirm its outperformance over several state-of-the-art DE methods. Furthermore, the proposed MS-DE is applied to two constrained engineering problems. The comparison results on these two problems also demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed MS-DE.},

  abstract     = {Infectious lung diseases, such as pneumonia and COVID-19, pose significant threats to global health, with high mortality rates and substantial burdens on healthcare systems. Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for effective management and treatment. This study addresses the limitations of existing diagnostic methods by proposing advanced techniques based on computer-aided diagnosis systems and enhanced machine-learning algorithms. The methodology involves the development of novel algorithms for image enhancement, segmentation, feature selection, and classification. A kurtosis-based multi-thresholding grasshopper optimization algorithm is proposed for image segmentation, reducing complexity and enhancing the accuracy of lesion identification. An improved rider optimization algorithm is also introduced for feature selection, aiming to prioritize relevant features and reduce dimensionality effectively. Furthermore, an enhanced support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for lesion classification is presented, utilizing linear mapping to generate feature scores for regions of interest. This facilitates the evaluation of the loss function and improves classification results. The approach’s effectiveness is demonstrated using datasets comprising chest X-ray and CT scan images from the LIDC-IDRI and Montgomery datasets. The improved optimization algorithms were trained and tested over the chest X-ray and CT scan image datasets. An improved SVM classified the lesions with an accuracy of 99.9% for chest X-ray images and 99.8% for CT scan images. The results proved that the improved SVM adequately classifies lung diseases from the chest X-ray and CT scan images. The findings suggest that the proposed methodologies significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing pneumonia and COVID-19 from medical images. By addressing the limitations of existing diagnostic techniques, this research contributes to improving healthcare practices and ultimately reducing the burden of infectious lung diseases on a global scale.},

  abstract     = {The artificial hummingbird algorithm is a global search mechanism with many applications in engineering design, but it tends to stall in high-dimensional problems with locally optimal solutions. To address this issue, this paper enhances an artificial hummingbird algorithm by using a chaos map and opposition-based method for population initialization to combat the lack of population diversity, the imbalance between exploration and exploitation, and the algorithm’s premature convergence. The randomness of chaos maps has been leveraged to prevent solutions trapped in local optima and facilitate faster convergence. Moreover, an opposition-based population can serve as a better initial solution and accelerate convergence when compared to random initialization. Two numerical test suites are used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm: 50 benchmark functions and the CEC 2018 benchmark test suite. The outcomes are compared to eight other cutting-edge metaheuristic algorithms. Wilcoxon rank sum test, Friedman test, and mean absolute error are used to conduct additional statistical analysis on the data. Moreover, experiments are conducted on the aforementioned 57 real-world optimization problems to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. The outcomes are contrasted to the algorithms SASS, MAgES, EnMODE, and COLSHADE (which won the CEC2020 Competition on Real-World Single-Objective Constrained Optimization). All quantitative and qualitative results on benchmark functions, statistical tests, as well as real-world optimization problem results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive and preferable to the metaheuristics considered in the experiments. Hence it is concluded that the proposed algorithm balances exploration and exploitation more effectively and the population initialization technique is conducive to augmenting the search capabilities of the artificial hummingbird algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Traditional flexible job shop scheduling ignores transportation or considers production and transportation separately. With factory digitalization and the widespread use of automated guided vehicles (AGVs), the isolated scheduling of production and transportation is no longer sufficient to meet increased productivity demands. Thus, integrated scheduling has become an inevitable option. Previous research has not sufficiently explored the domain knowledge of flexible job shop scheduling problem with finite transportation resources (FJSP-T), and thus the optimal solution cannot be found in an acceptable time using meta-heuristic algorithms. This paper explores FJSP-T to enhance the efficiency of the entire production system, and the objective is to minimize the makespan. The transportation situations of FJSP-T are analyzed, and it has been identified that the key to solving the problem is considering continuous transportation of AGVs. Further, the active decoding method and the initialization method considering continuous transportation are designed. A hybrid algorithm (HA) is proposed, which incorporates local search into the genetic algorithm, and various neighborhood structures for local search are designed. Finally, the superiority of the active decoding method is proved experimentally, and the algorithm performance is tested on two sets of famous benchmark instances (including 67 instances). Compared with other state-of-the-art reported algorithms, the proposed method obtains the new best solutions for 6 instances, and all solutions are not lower than previous results. Meanwhile, the computational time is only a few seconds. As a result, the proposed HA has significantly improved in solving FJSP-T regardless of the solution accuracy and the computational time.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) plays a crucial role in developing classification models by reducing the number of features used while improving their predictive power. It is a challenging problem that can be viewed as an NP-hard optimization task. To tackle this problem, powerful wrapper-based metaheuristic algorithms are employed, as they have the ability to search for nearly optimal feature subsets in the vast search space. However, these algorithms often face challenges such as getting trapped in local optima and striking a balance between exploration and exploitation. To address these challenges, this study proposes an improved version of the white shark optimizer (WSO) called the improved WSO (IWSO). The IWSO incorporates two efficient strategies, namely opposition-based learning (OBL) and Gaussian mutation (GM), to overcome the limitations of the original method. OBL enhances exploration by considering opposite solutions, while GM prevents premature convergence and improves the exploitation capabilities of the algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed IWSO is evaluated using various benchmark datasets and assessed using standard evaluation metrics. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the IWSO is capable of discovering new optimal solutions across different test cases. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applied to a real-world problem involving the identification of apple diseases, further validating its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Spam emails are sent to recipients for advertisement and phishing purposes. In either case, it disturbs recipients and reduces communication quality. Addressing this issue requires classifying emails on servers as either spam or ham. Numerous methods have been proposed for this classification task. Among them, logistic regression (LR) stands out for its simplicity, speed, and ease of implementation. However, LR suffers from low detection rates caused by the gradient descent algorithm used in its training phase. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method based on the clonal selection algorithm (CSA), renowned for its success in optimization problems due to its local and global search capabilities. Despite CSA’s effective optimization performance, it suffers from robustness and slow training time. Therefore, the CSA and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms are hybridized to improve CSA’s robustness and are parallelized to reduce the training time significantly. This hybrid method is employed to optimize the weights of LR by minimizing the cost at the output of LR. The empirical results denote that the proposed method, named CSA–ABC–LR, yields better classification performance compared to state-of-the-art models reported by previous studies, demonstrating an accuracy rate of 99.13% on the Enron-1 dataset, 99.22% on the CSDMC2010 dataset, and 94.49% on the Spambase dataset.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose a novel approach to balance exploitation and exploration. The proposed approach is the Evolutionary Swarm Intelligence (ESI) optimizer, which combines an exploration-biased strategy with an exploitation-biased operator. The algorithm is built based on the collective behavior of biological groups, imitating their intelligence behavior. The biological evolutionary process, inspired by genetic algorithms, is applied to every individual in the algorithm. Both swarm intelligence and genetic algorithms have been widely used in practical problems, and their reliability has been proven. ESI is characterized by both spatial group intelligence behavior and temporal biological evolution. To test the performance of ESI, we used a classic test set from IEEE CEC2017 and 22 practical problems from IEEE CEC2011. The popular training tests of the dendritic neuron model were also included in the control trials. We compared ESI with some typical swarm intelligence algorithms and classic algorithms to evaluate its performance and ability to solve practical problems. The experimental results show that ESI outperforms other algorithms in terms of basic performance and the ability to solve practical problems.},

  abstract     = {The discount {0–1} knapsack problem (D {0–1} KP) is a new variant of the knapsack problem. It is an NP-hard problem and also a binary optimization problem. As a new intelligent algorithm that imitates the leadership function of wolves, the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) can solve NP problems more effectively than accurate algorithms. At the same time, the GWO has fewer parameters, faster calculations, and easier implementation than other intelligent algorithms. This paper introduces a method of adaptively updating the prey position of wolves and a differential evolution operator with a scaling factor that adaptively changes according to the number of iterations, and selects which operator to use for iteration by the value of the search agent parameter. Finally, it combines the improved greedy repair operator based on D {0–1} KP to form the adaptive grey wolf optimization with differential evolution operator (de-AGWO). The experimental results of the standard test function prove that the algorithm in this paper has a significant improvement in function optimization performance. And the experimental results of D {0–1} KP shows that the proposed algorithm yields superior solution outcomes, except for unrelated datasets, and exhibits significant advantages when solving strongly correlated datasets. Finally, it is verified that more than 80% of the iterations utilize the grey wolf evolution operator, highlighting that the core of the algorithm remains the GWO.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning is one of the core components of its entire autonomous control system. The main challenge lies in efficiently obtaining an optimal flight route in complex environments, especially in mountain areas. To address this, we propose a novel version of arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA), named parallel and compact AOA (PCAOA). In PCAOA, the compact technique can save the memory of UAV and shorten the calculation time, and the parallel technique can quicken the convergence speed and improve the solution accuracy. In addition, the flight path generated by PCAOA is smoothed with cubic B-spline curves, making the path suitable for a UAV. The performance of PCAOA is demonstrated on 23 benchmark functions. Experimental results show that PCAOA achieves competitive results. Finally, the simulation studies are conducted to verify that PCAOA can successfully acquire a feasible and effective route in different mountain areas.},

MWOA can improve the convergent ability and maintain the balance of exploitation and exploration to avoid local optimum.
