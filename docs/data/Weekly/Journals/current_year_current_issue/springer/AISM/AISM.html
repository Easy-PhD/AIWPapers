  abstract     = {This paper focuses on vector-valued composite functionals, which may be nonlinear in probability. Our goal is establishing central limit theorems for these functionals when employed by mixed estimators. Our study is relevant to the evaluation and comparison of risk in decision-making contexts and extends to functionals that arise in machine learning. A generalized family of composite risk functionals is presented, which encompasses coherent risk measures, including systemic risk. The paper makes two main contributions. First, we analyze vector-valued functionals and provide a framework for evaluating high-dimensional risks. This enables comparison of multiple risk measures and supports estimation and asymptotic analysis of systemic risk and its optimal value in decision-making. Second, we derive new central limit theorems for optimized composite functionals using mixed estimators, including empirical and smoothed types. We give verifiable conditions for central limit formulae and demonstrate their applicability to several risk measures.},

  abstract     = {We study inference on the mean vector of the normal means model in sparse asymptotic settings when it is modelled by broad classes of one-group global–local continuous shrinkage priors. We prove that the resulting posterior distributions contract around the truth at a near minimax rate with respect to squared $$L_2$$ loss when the global shrinkage parameter is estimated in empirical Bayesian ways or arbitrary priors supported on some appropriate interval are assigned to it. We then employ an intuitive multiple testing rule (using full Bayes treatment with global–local priors) in a problem of simultaneous testing (with additive misclassification loss) for the components of the mean assuming they are iid from a two-groups prior. In a first result of its kind, risk of our testing rule is shown to asymptotically match (up to a constant) that of the optimal rule in the two-groups setting.},

In particular, simple formulas for the computation of Kendall’s measure of association are derived and the asymmetry properties are investigated. Also, the multivariate extreme-value attractor of the beta copula is identified and it is shown that the beta family is closed under conditioning and belongs to the class of one-factor copulas. The sampling properties of the rank-based maximum-likelihood estimator are investigated with simulations and the usefulness of the beta copulas for the modeling of multivariate datasets is illustrated on triathlon data.},

  abstract     = {To check the mutual independence of a high-dimensional random vector without Gaussian assumption, Yao et al. (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, 80,455–480, 2018) recently introduced an important test by virtue of pairwise distance covariances. Despite its usefulness, the state-of-art test tends to have unsatisfactory size performance when the sample size is small. The present paper provides a theoretical explanation about this phenomenon, and accordingly proposes a new test in high dimension, low sample size contexts. The new test can be even justified as the dimension tends to infinity, regardless of whether the sample size is fixed or diverges. The power of the proposed distance covariance test is also investigated. To examine our theoretical findings and check the performance of the new test, simulation studies are applied. We further illustrate the proposed method by empirical analysis of a real dataset.},

  abstract     = {In the mean-median-mode triad of univariate centrality measures, the mode has been overlooked for estimating the center of symmetry in continuous and unimodal settings. This paper expands on the connection between kernel mode estimators and M-estimators for location, bridging the gap between the nonparametrics and robust statistics communities. The variance of modal estimators is studied in terms of a bandwidth parameter, establishing conditions for an optimal solution that outperforms the household sample mean. A purely nonparametric approach is adopted, modeling heavy-tailedness through regular variation. The results lead to an estimator proposal that includes a novel one-parameter family of kernels with compact support, offering extra robustness and efficiency. The effectiveness and versatility of the new method are demonstrated in a real-world case study and a thorough simulation study, comparing favorably to traditional and more competitive alternatives. Several myths about the mode are clarified along the way, reopening the quest for flexible and efficient nonparametric estimators.},
