  abstract     = {In many time series classification tasks, each instance is described by multiple channels (i.e., signals). This introduces an additional computational burden as the time and resources to train a classifier increase as more channels become available. This is problematic as some tasks can be described by a huge number of channels. However, not all channels may be necessary as some could be irrelevant or redundant, and including these can (dramatically) increase run time while yielding no benefit in terms of predictive performance. Therefore, it can be useful to automatically select a subset of the channels to include in the analysis. We propose TSelect, a novel scalable and classifier-agnostic approach that automatically selects a relevant and non-redundant subset of the channels for multivariate time series classification (MTSC). Experimentally, we show on a large benchmark suite that TSelect (1) eliminates on average 62% of the channels, (2) significantly improves a classifier’s run time without sacrificing predictive performance, and (3) outperforms the two state-of-the-art channel selectors (ECS and ECP) on the majority of the experiments.},

  abstract     = {Influence maximization is a fundamental problem in network analysis, focusing on identifying a subset of nodes in a social network to maximize the spread of influence. In this paper, we present an approach for tackling the Influence Maximization (IM) problem, integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques with attentive Graph Neural Networks (GATs). Our study builds upon a prior algorithm (S2V-DQN-IM) and progressively refines it towards IM-GNN, ultimately achieving competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods on classic IM. Through experiments on benchmark datasets, we empirically validate the effectiveness of graph attention mechanisms and positional encoding, using the graph magnetic Laplacian, to reach state-of-the-art performance in terms of influence spread. Building on this success, we extend our IM-GNN framework to incorporate topic-awareness in TIM-GNN, recognizing the inherent topical nature of real-world diffusions. By harnessing probabilistic techniques, we construct topic-aware social graphs using real cascades and assess the effectivenesss of TIM-GNN on them. Our extensive experimental results validate the utility of our topic-aware approach, demonstrating significant advances over existing topic-aware IM methods. Finally, in order to improve upon performance (latency) at query time, we develop a variant of TIM-GNN, called TIM-GNN $$^x$$ , by using cross-attention mechanisms. We show it maintains comparable overall spread performance as its predecessor, while achieving a 10x-20x speed-up.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal knowledge graphs, which integrate visual and textual data, have been widely utilized in various applications. Despite their potential, they often suffer from incompleteness due to the large amount of undiscovered valuable triple knowledge within the graph. This has led to a surge in research on multimodal knowledge graph completion. However, existing methods often face challenges such as irrelevant noise in multimodal data and limitations of straightforward multimodal fusion, which can lead to suboptimal model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive multimodal graph learning approach for efficient knowledge graph completion. We first introduce an adaptive multimodal knowledge capture module designed to integrate entity-related multimodal knowledge. This module includes a relation-aware modal view construction process to achieve semantic meaning consistency, along with link-aware point-to-face interactions for coarse-grained multimodal capture and adaptive point-to-point interactions for fine-grained multimodal extraction. We then propose a two-stage multimodal graph fusion module, which includes a cross-modal augmentation module to perform first-stage multimodal fusion between the entity graph and visual/textual graph, as well as a dynamic selection fusion module to conduct the second-stage fusion between entity-visual and entity-textual graphs. Our method demonstrates superior effectiveness through empirical evaluations on three common datasets.},

  abstract     = {Sequential data is ubiquitous—it is routinely gathered to gain insights into complex processes such as behavioral, biological, or physical processes. Challengingly, such data not only has dependencies within the observed sequences, but the observations are also often high-dimensional, sparse, and noisy. These are all difficulties that obscure the inner workings of the complex process under study. One solution is to calculate a low-dimensional representation that describes (characteristics of) the complex process. This representation can then serve as a proxy to gain insight into the original process. However, uncovering such low-dimensional representation within sequential data is nontrivial due to the dependencies, and an algorithm specifically made for sequences is needed to guarantee estimator consistency. Fortunately, recent theoretical advancements on Block Markov Chains have resulted in new clustering algorithms that can provably do just this in synthetic sequential data. This paper presents a first field study of these new algorithms in real-world sequential data; a wide empirical study of clustering within a range of data sequences. We investigate broadly whether, when given sparse high-dimensional sequential data of real-life complex processes, useful low-dimensional representations can in fact be extracted using these algorithms. Concretely, we examine data sequences containing GPS coordinates describing animal movement, strands of human DNA, texts from English writing, and daily yields in a financial market. The low-dimensional representations we uncover are shown to not only successfully encode the sequential structure of the data, but also to enable gaining new insights into the underlying complex processes.},

Despite achieving promising results, existing methods face significant efficiency challenges due to the overwhelming presence of irrelevant candidate entity pairs–with over 96% of candidate pairs lacking meaningful relations in typical datasets. This computational burden severely limits the practical applicability of ERE systems. To address these limitations, we propose FastERE, a fast framework that introduces three key innovations: (1) a pruner-based Entity Pairs Selection Module that dynamically filters irrelevant entity pairs before relation extraction, reducing computational overhead while improving sample quality; (2) an efficient task reformulation that frames NER as sequence tagging with adjacent attention mechanisms and RE as grouped triplet prediction with masked parallel packing; and (3) a multi-task learning framework with prefix-enhanced shared encoders that enables effective feature interaction while maintaining task independence. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FastERE achieves 6-20 $$\times $$ speedup over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive accuracy, with F1 scores of 69.9% and 67.0% on ACE05 and ACE04 respectively.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate two problems faced in detecting/predicting intracranial hypertension (ICH) onsets. The first challenge is that intracranial pressure (ICP) can be measured only invasively, drilling a hole in patients skull. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel metadata supported scale space attention (SSA) network to accurately and non-invasively predict intracranial hypertension (ICH) onsets, relying on supporting multi-variate data streams, including electroencephalogram (EEG), arterial blood pressure (ABP) and electrocardiogram (ECG). In particular, we propose a coupled network, integrating a convolutional neural network with scale space attention (CNN-SSA) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. This, however, opens up a new challenge—EEG readings at different health centers may rely on hardware with different numbers of sensors, which would render models not shareable across centers. To tackle this second challenge, we propose two alternative techniques: the first alternative relies on a multi-variate multi-scale neural network (M2NN) to impute missing EEG channels; the second alternative, on the other hand, identifies a core subset of EEG channels, shared by different centers, that can still provide accurate ICH predictions. We conduct rigorous experiments to substantiate our proposed method’s effectiveness—the results show that ICH can be predicted accurataly by relying on supporting data modalities, if we can properly attend the data at multiple scales and across modalities. Additionally, an ablation study demonstrates that the various components of our approach are essential in providing accurate ICH predictions.},

  abstract     = {Identifying overlapping communities in complex networks is an important aspect of network analysis. This task, however, becomes extremely difficult when working with large-scale directed weighted networks, such as social media networks like Facebook, X, LinkedIn, biological systems, collaboration networks, neural networks, etc., which may consist of millions of entities. There are very few algorithms available for this task, and most are merely extensions of well-known algorithms designed for undirected networks. Besides, these algorithms often produce disjoint and low-quality community structures. On the other hand, evaluating overlapping community structures in directed weighted networks is also a major challenge due to the lack of specific quality measure designed for such networks. To address these challenges, we developed an algorithm called Community Detection in Directed And Weighted Networks (CD-DAWN). It is designed to identify overlapping communities in large, complex networks by selecting and expanding seeds, without needing any prior knowledge about the communities. We also developed a directed weighted overlapping modularity ( $$Q_\text {dwo}$$ ) to evaluate overlapping community structures in directed weighted networks, which is the first such measure to the best of our knowledge. To evaluate the effectiveness of CD-DAWN, we performed extensive experiments on both real-world and artificial networks. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline algorithms, accurately detecting high-quality and stable overlapping communities in complex networks.},

  abstract     = {Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown promise in addressing a variety of tasks, even with limited data availability. However, their adoption is hindered by the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes. A key challenge in explaining SNNs lies in the absence of an inverse mapping between high-dimensional input feature vectors and the low-dimensional embedding space. Therefore, computing direct distances between input features becomes meaningless. Existing autoencoder-based explanation methods face several limitations. These include poor image reconstruction quality due to insufficient data and the omission of final distance layer of the SNN during the explanation process. While the Siamese Network Explainer (SINEX) can explain audio and grayscale images, it does not support RGB images. To overcome these challenges, we propose a method called Features Distance-based eXplanation (FDbX). This approach identifies salient features using ridge regression, trained on perturbed SLIC-segmented images. To enhance the selection of important features, we incorporate Bayesian analysis, which assigns importance scores to features. To provide a comprehensive explanation of the decision route, we construct a mathematical model that represents important features and their Hamming distances as a bipartite graph. In this graph, nodes represent features and edges denote distances between feature pairs. The resulting explanation heatmaps highlight critical image segments, offering more intuitive and visually informative explanations than existing methods. We evaluate stability and faithfulness of our method using stability indices such as $$R^2$$ and mean squared error. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce Variable and Coefficient Stability Indices for image datasets.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) has garnered substantial research interest, particularly in applying multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs). Previous studies have proposed various approaches to address the MKGC problem, including a variety of knowledge graph embedding techniques and approaches based on large language models. However, these methods face two limitations. First, many models embed entities and relations in a regular embedding space, failing to capture multi-modal components’ hierarchical semantics. Second, existing methods struggle to learn hybrid relations between entities of different modalities, which constrains the performance of MKGC models. In this paper, we propose a novel model, Hybrid Relations-guided MKGC with Hierarchical Embeddings (HRHE), to address the aforementioned limitations. Specifically, HRHE projects MMKGs into a polar coordinate system to capture hierarchical semantics and facilitate intra-inter-class interactions. Subsequently, HRHE introduces a general hybrid relations learning approach to discover implicit relations among entities of different modalities. Noting that our work can flexibly employ various neural network architectures, including convolutional neural networks, multi-layer perceptrons, and linear graph networks, to infer the implicit associations of MMKGs. Finally, an objective function is defined to leverage the inferred hybrid relations in guiding the modeling process of MMKGs. We investigate HRHE using two widely evaluated benchmarks and show that HRHE achieves better results than state-of-the-art MKGC baselines. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that constructing hierarchical semantic space and utilizing implicit associations among entities of different modalities can advance MKGC.},

Previous research has leveraged large-scale visit records to predict a user’s next visit POI based on the behavior of similar users. However, with the increasing emphasis on privacy preservation, there is a shift towards zero-shot recommendation that does not require training and only uses individual visit history data. As a better alternative to traditional zero-shot recommender systems, this paper proposes a novel zero-shot recommender system leveraging the ability of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to understand human behavior called ZeroPOIRec. ZeroPOIRec involves a profiler module that enables LLMs to extract individual user preferences from multiple aspects, including spatio-temporal patterns and individual characteristics, and a recommender module that enhances the zero-shot POI recommendation performance via candidate refinement and prioritization. Through experiments using a benchmark dataset and a newly introduced real-world dataset with semantic variables, we demonstrate that, despite ZeroPOIRec being a zero-shot approach, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation performance.},

To address these challenges, a model named JammyTS is proposed, which Joins an attention mechanism and a memory network for Temporal Scoping of facts. Specifically, JammyTS leverages attention to adjust the distribution of weights dynamically in memory networks and builds attention capsule-based networks to reduce the impact of noise in external resources. Furthermore, two linear classifiers are separately trained to infer the end and beginning timestamps of facts for inference of non-continuous temporal ranges.

  abstract     = {To be robust, AI systems need to quickly detect and effectively react to novelties in their environments. Novelty is characterized by a sudden change in the environment where this is little time to collect new data and retrain. This is particularly true for smart home systems, where novelties abound and accurate handling is required for reliable health monitoring and home automation that can react quickly and effectively to the novelties. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian nonparametric method, called OTACON, for novelty handling. OTACON finds surprising situations using change point detection and adapts accordingly. To evaluate this proposed approach, we design a smart home novelty generator that embeds novelties of varying type and difficulty into CASAS real-world smart home datasets. We observe that OTACON outperforms a state-of-the-art method for eight types of novel scenarios, in some cases even outperforming its own pre-novelty baseline. The results provide evidence that this method can boost AI systems in their ability to handle a variety of unexpected situations.},

  abstract     = {Data-analysis tasks often involve an iterative process, which requires refining previous solutions. For instance, when analyzing social networks, we may obtain initial communities based on noisy metadata, and we want to improve them by adding influential nodes and removing non-important ones, without making too many changes. However, classic optimization algorithms, which typically find solutions from scratch, potentially return communities that are very dissimilar to the initial one. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the OptiRefine framework. The framework optimizes initial solutions by making a small number of refinements, thereby ensuring that the new solution remains close to the initial solution and simultaneously achieving a near-optimal solution for the optimization problem. We apply the OptiRefine framework to two classic graph-optimization problems: densest subgraph and maximum cut. For the densest-subgraph problem, we optimize a given subgraph’s density by adding or removing k nodes. We show that this novel problem is a generalization of k-densest subgraph, and provide constant-factor approximation algorithms for $$k=\Omega (n)$$ refinements. We also study a version of maximum cut in which the goal is to improve a given cut. We provide connections to the maximum cut with cardinality constraints and provide an optimal approximation algorithm in most parameter regimes under the Unique Games Conjecture for $$k=\Omega (n)$$ refinements. We evaluate our theoretical methods and scalable heuristics on synthetic and real-world data and show that they are highly effective in practice.},

  abstract     = {Tensor factorizations have been widely used for the task of uncovering patterns in various domains. Often, the input is time-evolving, shifting the goal to tracking the evolution of the underlying patterns instead. To adapt to this more complex setting, existing methods incorporate temporal regularization but they either have overly constrained structural requirements or lack uniqueness which is crucial for interpretation. In this paper, in order to capture the underlying evolving patterns, we introduce t(emporal)PARAFAC2, which utilizes temporal smoothness regularization on the evolving factors. Previously, Alternating Optimization and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers-based algorithmic approach has been introduced to fit the PARAFAC2 model to fully observed data. In this paper, we extend this algorithmic framework to the case of partially observed data and use it to fit the tPARAFAC2 model to complete and incomplete datasets with the goal of revealing evolving patterns. Our numerical experiments on simulated datasets demonstrate that tPARAFAC2 can extract the underlying evolving patterns more accurately compared to the state-of-the-art in the presence of high amounts of noise and missing data. Using two real datasets, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithmic approach in terms of handling missing data and tPARAFAC2 model in terms of revealing evolving patterns. The paper provides an extensive comparison of different approaches for handling missing data within the proposed framework, and discusses both the advantages and limitations of tPARAFAC2 model.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging communication-efficient and collaborative learning paradigm of machine learning with privacy guarantees. As these advancements unfold, adapting FL for fairness-aware learning becomes crucial. In this context, we propose a pre-processing fairness and utility (balanced accuracy) enhancing agnostic federated learning framework (Fed-FUEL) that mitigates discrimination embedded in the non-independent identically distributed data. We contribute a novel adaptive data manipulation method that mitigates discrimination embedded in the data at client side during optimization, resulting in an optimized and fair centralized server. This pre-processing approach abstracts the model architecture from the equation, offering a significant advantage in a federated environment. This abstraction not only facilitates a broader application across diverse model architectures without necessitating modifications but also sidesteps the potential complexities and inefficiencies associated with model-specific in-processing methods. Extensive experiments with a range of publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the competing baselines in terms of both discrimination mitigation and predictive performance. Our model effectively adapts to both statistical and causal fairness notions, as shown through our experiments.},

  abstract     = {Traditional machine learning techniques assume that data is drawn from a stationary source. This assumption is challenged in contexts with data streams for presenting constant and potentially infinite sequences whose distribution is prone to change over time. Based on these settings, detecting changes (a.k.a. concept drifts) is necessary to keep learning models up-to-date. Although state-of-the-art detection methods were designed to monitor the loss of predictive models, such monitoring falls short in many real-world scenarios where the true labels are not readily available. Therefore, there is increasing attention to unsupervised concept drift detection methods as approached in this paper. In this work, we present an unsupervised and interpretable method based on Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN) and Markov Chains (MC), referred to as RMIDDM (Radial Markov Interpretable Drift Detection Method). In our method, RBF performs, in the intermediate layer, an activation process that implicitly produces groups of observations collected over time. Simultaneously, MC models the transitions between groups to support the detection of concept drifts, which happens when the active group changes and its probability exceeds a given threshold. A set of experiments with synthetic datasets and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrated that the proposed method can detect drifts at runtime in an efficient, interpretable, and independent way of labels, presenting competitive results and behavior. Additionally, to show its applicability in a real-world scenario, we analyzed new COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations to identify new waves as concept drifts and generate Markov models that allow understanding of their interaction.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge graphs are multi-relational data that contain massive entities and relations. Recently, graph neural networks have been reported outstanding performance in modeling knowledge graphs. However, most existing methods based on graph neural networks are limited by expensive labeled information and high-time-space complexity for large-scale Multi-relational Knowledge Graphs (MKGs). In this paper, we propose the Multi-relational Knowledge Graph Contrastive Learning (MKGCL) method, an end-to-end framework with contrastive learning to solve label problems, which considers the local structure of subgraphs and alleviates algorithm complexity. Firstly, MKGCL extracts relational subgraphs according to the relation types of MKGs. The node representations are learned with a graph neural network encoder, and the representations of different relational subgraphs are obtained by pooling related node representations. Secondly, contrastive learning is used to take fully advantage of multi-relational data and heterogeneous structures for MKGs. MKGCL contrasts node-level and subgraph-level embeddings to capture more structural information in MKGs. Moreover, the number of relational subgraphs for model training has a vital impact on time and space complexity for MKGs. By learning small-size samples, the MKGCL method achieves well results while reducing algorithm complexity. Finally, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that MKGCL yields better link prediction performance than existing methods.},

The increasing availability of energy consumption data from buildings has opened up the possibility of implementing data-driven methods to improve Demand Side Management (DSM) operations in energy utilities. In this context, the current paper proposes a novel indexing approach for buildings and appliances using a multiple network. The multiple network is constructed from a time series dataset, where each network represents a different time granularity. A quasi-clique-based clustering technique is applied to the multiple network to group similar subsequences based on recurring patterns. From the resulting clusters, an indexing measure is derived to quantify the stability of buildings and appliances. This paper presents a detailed analysis of changes in the stability index across various granular levels. A comparative study with existing state-of-the-art clustering techniques establishes the superiority of the proposed method.},
