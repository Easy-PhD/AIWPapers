  abstract     = {The Persistent Perfect phylogeny, also known as Dollo- $$1$$ , has been introduced as a generalization of the well-known perfect phylogenetic model for binary characters to deal with the potential loss of characters. In Bonizzoni et al. (2012) it has been proved that the problem of deciding the existence of a Persistent Perfect phylogeny can be reduced to the one of recognizing a class of bipartite graphs whose nodes are species and characters. Thus an interesting question is solving directly the problem of recognizing such graphs. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding Persistent Perfect phylogeny existence in maximal graphs, where no character’s species set is contained within another character’s species set. Our solution, that relies only on graph properties, narrows the gap between the linear-time simple algorithm for Perfect Phylogeny and the NP-hardness results for the Dollo-k phylogeny with $$k>1$$ .},

The adjacent factor swap of a word is a generalization of the concept of cyclic permutation of a word wherein, a subword of the word is decomposed in to two non-overlapping factor parts and swapped. Since there can be multiple ways in which a word can be divided into factors, the adjacent factor swap of a word forms a set. In this paper, we study some properties of adjacent factor swap of a word. We characterize words with the minimum and the maximum number of elements in their adjacent factor swap. We then study the distribution of palindromes in the adjacent factor swap of a word. For a palindrome w, we give a tight bound on the maximum number of palindromes in the adjacent swap of w, if the number of distinct letters in w is half its length. We also provide a slack bound on the maximum number of palindromes in the adjacent swap of a given word.},

The nondeterministic approach facilitates a more realistic modelling of complex systems, where multiple potential behaviours can arise from a given set of reactions. Our aim is to explore different types of nondeterminism in reaction systems, investigating their behavioural properties, and examining the connections between the behaviour of asynchronous reaction systems and the behaviour of restricted reaction systems.},

A reaction is enabled by a state (a subset of entities), if all its reactants are present in that state and none of its inhibitors. The result of a set of reactions on a given state is a new state that consists of the products of the reactions that were enabled at the original state. In this paper, we further investigate enabling equivalence. This relation equates two sets of reactions for which the states that enable all their reactions simultaneously, are the same and, moreover, their results on those states are the same. From the point of view of enabling equivalence, sets of reactions act as if they were a single (combined) reaction. We show how combined reactions characterize enabling equivalence classes. Furthermore, enabling equivalence induces a partial order in the form of a cover relation on its equivalence classes. The resulting partially ordered set turns out to be a lattice and we demonstrate how this lattice relates to the enabling cover relation introduced earlier for single reactions.},

The theorem leads to the convergence rate of the normalized distance in the quantum state density matrix for the OQSF algorithm. Finally, in numerical simulations, we employ the algorithm for online estimation of a 4-qubit quantum system, using the normalized distance of the density matrix as a metric.

For each such insertion operation, it is common to state various decision problems using important computational models, and to study whether these problems are decidable or not. Here, we generalize this approach by studying any possible insertion operation that can be defined as long as they produce every string in some lower bound language and no strings outside some upper bound language. We create two different such classes of insertion operations called general contextual insertion operations and general concatenative insertion operations. Several problems (so-called language equations) are shown to be undecidable no matter how an insertion operation is defined, so long as it belongs to one of these classes of operations. Several problems are also shown to be decidable, as long as the insertion operation satisfies some simple conditions. This general approach covers many different insertion operations that have been defined and studied in the literature, from classical operations such as concatenation and shuffle, to bio-inspired insertion operations, and we are able to demonstrate many stronger decidability results than what was previously known.},

Consequently, many different variants of the learning models of SN P system prevail among the new research results. Although large proprietary deep learning models are still based on the continuous neural network paradigm, spiking neurons are attractive because of their low-energy demands. The purpose of this paper is to provide an up-to-date overview of learning paradigms and techniques for SN P systems. After a brief introduction of the structure and function of SN P systems, we summarise recent approaches to learning and adaptation in SN P systems, including Hebbian learning, Widrow-Hoff algorithm, fuzzy approaches, nonlinear SN P systems, gated and long short-term memory inspired SN P systems, convolutional SN P systems, and more.},

In these scenarios, the most common positions for installing BSs are rooftops, which, however, given the complex topography and diverse building structures, present significant challenges when identifying suitable locations. This paper proposes an enhanced method for rooftop detection, integrating diffusion models based on super-resolution with segmentation using convolutional neural networks. Starting from the input image, a super-resolution model is applied to generate sliding windows on which re-inference is performed, thereby improving both the resolution and prediction accuracy for this type of object. By refining these detections, the placement of 5 G base stations is undertaken in a practical, industrial way, thus allowing network operators to perform a more real-world network optimization. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in detection accuracy, directly contributing to more efficient 5 G base station deployment in densely populated urban areas. This methodology offers a scalable, adaptable, and effective solution based on the context of the images it applies to.},

As AI models grow in complexity, precision, and computational power, their energy consumption rises exponentially, raising serious concerns about the sustainability of their widespread adoption. The field of green learning aims to mitigate these concerns by developing energy-efficient AI solutions. In this work, we propose a method to preserve the accuracy of photovoltaic (PV) power generation forecasting while reducing the environmental impact through dataset size reduction. Our approach employs a heuristic strategy that iteratively reduces the training dataset until a cutoff point is reached, balancing predictive accuracy and environmental efficiency. Experimental results using publicly available PV generation datasets demonstrate that the proposed data reduction method decreases training time by up to 17.13%, with only a 1.47% decline in prediction accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of the method to substantially reduce the carbon footprint of AI applications with minimal performance degradation.},

This study focuses on minimizing waste and maximum lateness in a one-dimensional version of the BPP, which is particularly relevant in industrial contexts. The goal is to develop a constructive heuristic algorithm that can be adapted to various situations. We model the BPP as a Deterministic Markov Decision Process with discrete state and action spaces, where policies are represented by arithmetic expressions involving state variables. This approach allows for a clearer explanation of the decision process, in contrast to other methods like neural networks. To evolve these policies, we use Genetic Programming (GP). Trained on a set of BPP instances, the resulting policies are effective for solving new, unseen instances. In the experimental study, we explore different GP settings, including varying sets of symbols. The results reveal valuable insights about the importance of state variables, indicating that a smaller selection of them may yield the best results. The evolved policies are compared with an exact method from the literature, achieving similar outcomes but with significantly less computational time.},

Inference of L-systems involves the automated learning of these models/grammars from data; and inductive inference involves learning an L-system from a sequence of strings initially generated by an unknown L-system. This paper studies the computational complexity of inductive inference of a variety of different types of context-free L-systems (deterministic or nondeterministic, tabled or not, and allowing erasing or not). Because this inference is sometimes trivial for nondeterministic L-systems, it is more useful to find the smallest L-system that can generate the sequence of strings, in terms of either the number of rewriting rules, or (when there are tables), the number of tables. For all of the types of L-systems studied, finding an L-system with the smallest number of rewriting rules is $$\textsf {NP}$$ -complete. However, in all cases, if the number of rewriting rules is fixed, then finding an L-system of any type studied, or finding the smallest L-systems in terms of the number of rewriting rules, or the smallest in terms of the number of tables, can always be done in polynomial time.},

  abstract     = {Self-assembly refers to the process by which small, simple components mix and combine to form complex structures using only local interactions. Designed as a hybrid between tile assembly models and cellular automata, the Tile Automata (TA) model was recently introduced as a platform to help study connections between various models of self-assembly. However, in this paper we present a result in which we use TA to simulate arbitrary systems within the amoebot model, a theoretical model of programmable matter in which the individual components are relatively simple state machines that are able to sense the states of their neighbors and to move via series of expansions and contractions. We show that for every amoebot system, there is a TA system capable of simulating the local information transmission built into amoebot particles, and that the TA “macrotiles” used to simulate its particles are capable of simulating movement (via attachment and detachment operations) while maintaining the necessary properties of amoebot particle systems. The TA systems are able to utilize only the local interactions of state changes and binding and unbinding along tile edges, but are able to fully simulate the dynamics of these programmable matter systems. Since the signal-passing tile assembly model, a mathematical model of “active” DNA-based tile self-assembly, has been shown to be able to simulate the TA model, our result provides a bridge showing how DNA-based self-assembling tiles can simulate the behavior of the amoebot model of programmable matter.},

  abstract     = {The growing energy consumption of cloud infrastructure has attained levels that are no longer viable, necessitating the development of energy-aware scheduling algorithms. This work focuses on optimising the scheduling of scientific workflows, which requires extensive computation to achieve time-efficient results, often at the cost of excessive energy consumption. To address this challenge, a multi-fitness evolutionary algorithm that integrates multiple heuristic functions in a cooperative manner to minimise energy consumption is proposed. The approach not only facilitates the reuse of heuristics but also provides novel insights into the interplay between energy consumption and makespan, traditionally viewed as conflicting objectives. This flexible framework demonstrates its adaptability for optimising both total energy consumption and completion time, offering a robust tool for sustainable workflow scheduling.},

In this paper, we primarily seek to understand the complexity landscape of the problems pertaining to computing these widths. One such problem involves deciding whether the maximal universal width or maximal existential width of an AFA is bounded by a given integer k. For the case of a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), we give a polynomial time algorithm for computing maximal existential width. We also present a polynomial time algorithm for computing the existential width of a general AFA, under the assumption that the AFA’s universal width is bounded by a fixed integer $$\ell$$ . Finally, we reconsider the problems of computing existential and universal widths for AFAs over a unary language and demonstrate that both problems can be solved in polynomial time.},

  abstract     = {Structure guides computation in biological and artificial neural networks. However, the nature of the relationship between structure and function, in this context, is unclear. For example, there is still debate on whether constraining a network with biological detail confers a non-trivial functional advantage over a network without such constraints. To shine light on this topic, we highlight five experiments which employ biological constraints onto artificial neural networks using empirically-guided wiring diagrams, or connectomes, from an adult fruit fly, a larval zebrafish, and from the Mammalian MRI (MaMI) dataset, and impose these onto reservoir-based recurrent neural networks, while studying changes in performance and prediction dynamics on synthetic and naturalistic time series data. We observe that fly-constrained networks are better at making predictions from chaotic input data, and in executing multiple mutually exclusive tasks simultaneously, all with a robustness to hyperparameter variations, some of which may lead to chaos. Separately, we find that the global clustering coefficient of the fly network improves performance and variance on time-varying predictions. We also report that an empirical functional connectome from the optomotor response circuitry of a larval zebrafish validates its own behaviour, and that this is interrupted by rewiring. Finally, using the MaMI dataset, we determine that rewiring degrades multifunctional capacity, and that more multifunctional networks have a higher mean degree centrality. Collectively, these findings suggest that biological topology constraints confer distinct advantages to arbitrarily-weighted networks.},

In particular we disprove the belief that the propagation speed of a given ant’s highways is uniquely determined. Our simulations show that, for some rules, different highways appear with very unequal frequencies, in some cases only a few times in a billion runs. This suggests that those highways that appear as the only possible asymptotic behaviour of some rules, might be accompanied by several very infrequent highways which are very hard to find.},

In this work, we tackle a lexicographical goal programming scenario minimising makespan firstly and total energy consumption lately. We propose a hybrid evolutionary algorithm based on a genetic algorithm, incorporating heuristic seeding and a post-processing step using constraint programming. The experimental study shows that the proposed approach is able to meet tighter makespan goals than previously published methods, while offering a 32% improvement in energy consumption when goals are met.},

Such a process can be defined for any finite subset S of a group, and we refer to such a process as simply “solitaire”. We develop a general theory of solitaire, and then concentrate on the simplest possible example, solitaire for the plane $$\mathbb {Z}^2$$ , and S the triangle shape (equivalently, any three-element set in general position). In this case, we give a polynomial time algorithm that puts any finite subset of the plane in normal form using solitaire moves, and show that the solitaire orbit of a line of consecutive ones—the line orbit—is completely characterised by the notion of a so-called fill matrix. We show that the diameter of the line orbit, as a graph with edges the solitaire moves, is cubic. We show that analogous results hold for the square shape, but indicate some shapes (still on the group $$\mathbb {Z}^2$$ ) where this is less immediate. We then explain in detail the connection of the solitaire to TEP and more generally permutive subshifts. Namely, the solitaire is a closure property of various sets of subsets of the group that can be associated to such a subshift, such as the independence, spanning and filling sets.},

  abstract     = {Recent research into analog computing has introduced new notions of computing real numbers. Huang, Klinge, Lathrop, Li, and Lutz defined a notion of computing real numbers in real-time with chemical reaction networks (CRNs), introducing the classes $$\mathbb {R}_\text {LCRN}$$ (the class of all Lyapunov CRN-computable real numbers) and $$\mathbb {R}_\text {RTCRN}$$ (the class of all real-time CRN-computable numbers). In their paper, they show the inclusion of the real algebraic numbers $$\text { ALG} \subseteq \mathbb {R}_\text {LCRN}\subseteq \mathbb {R}_\text {RTCRN}$$ and that $$\text { ALG} \subsetneqq \mathbb {R}_\text {RTCRN}$$ but leave open whether the inclusion is proper. In this paper, we resolve this open problem and show that $${ ALG} = \mathbb {R}_\text {LCRN}$$ and, as a consequence, $$\mathbb {R}_\text {LCRN}\subsetneqq \mathbb {R}_\text {RTCRN}$$ . However, the definition of real-time computation by Huang et al. is fragile in the sense that it is sensitive to perturbations in initial conditions. To resolve this flaw, we further require a CRN to withstand these perturbations. In doing so, we arrive at a discrete model of memory. This approach has several benefits. First, a bounded CRN may compute values approximately in finite time. Second, a CRN can tolerate small perturbations of its species’ concentrations. Third, taking a measurement of a CRN’s state only requires precision proportional to the exactness of these approximations. Lastly, if a CRN requires only finite memory, this model and Turing machines are equivalent under real-time simulations.},

We then prove several results regarding the strict self-assembly of certain classes of fractal shapes in the aTAM including the construction of a universal tileset which, given the correct seed assembly, strictly self-assembles with nearly any desired fractal dimension. Additionally, we discuss a long standing conjecture in tile-assembly, that a class of fractals called discrete self-similar fractals cannot strictly self-assemble in the aTAM, and provide evidence that sparsity, rather than fractal dimension, is a more promising differentiating factor between shapes that can and cannot strictly self-assemble.},
