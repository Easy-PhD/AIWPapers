  abstract     = {Given a multigraph $$G=(V,E)$$ , the edge-coloring problem (ECP) is to color the edges of G with the minimum number of colors so that no two adjacent edges have the same color. This problem can be naturally formulated as an integer program, and its linear programming relaxation is referred to as the fractional edge-coloring problem (FECP). The optimal value of ECP (resp. FECP) is called the chromatic index (resp. fractional chromatic index) of G, denoted by $$\chi '(G)$$ (resp. $$\chi ^*(G)$$ ). Let $$\Delta (G)$$ be the maximum degree of G and let $$\Gamma (G)$$ be the density of G, defined by $$\begin{aligned} \Gamma (G)=\max \left\{ \frac{2|E(U)|}{|U|-1}:\,\, U \subseteq V, \,\, |U|\ge 3 \hspace{5.69054pt}\textrm{and} \hspace{5.69054pt}\textrm{odd} \right\} , \end{aligned}$$ where E(U) is the set of all edges of G with both ends in U. Clearly, $$\max \{\Delta (G), \, \lceil \Gamma (G) \rceil \}$$ is a lower bound for $$\chi '(G)$$ . As shown by Seymour, $$\chi ^*(G)=\max \{\Delta (G), \, \Gamma (G)\}$$ . In the early 1970s Goldberg and Seymour independently conjectured that $$\chi '(G) \le \max \{\Delta (G)+1, \, \lceil \Gamma (G) \rceil \}$$ . Over the past five decades this conjecture, a cornerstone in modern edge-coloring, has been a subject of extensive research, and has stimulated an important body of work. In this paper we present a proof of this conjecture. Our result implies that, first, there are only two possible values for $$\chi '(G)$$ , so an analogue to Vizing’s theorem on edge-colorings of simple graphs holds for multigraphs; second, although it is NP-hard in general to determine $$\chi '(G)$$ , we can approximate it within one of its true value, and find it exactly in polynomial time when $$\Gamma (G)>\Delta (G)$$ ; third, every multigraph G satisfies $$\chi '(G)-\chi ^*(G) \le 1$$ , and thus FECP has a fascinating integer rounding property.},

  abstract     = {Email communication is used by around 87% of the business communities for internal and external communication. The detection of emotion in email communication along with visual analytics is a frontier laden with potential but still it has its challenges. They face challenges such as measuring effect of emotional cues, lack of capability for visualizations, integrating seamlessly into existing platforms and implementation of multimodal analysis. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a multimodal architecture known as EmoMAC that will help in analysing emotions in emails. By incorporating the multimodal data of the MELD dataset, it enhances the comprehensive interpretation of emotional dynamics. For textual analysis, the proposed model includes DelighT transformer with attention scaling and multi head attention incorporated into the model. For the extraction of dynamic visual features from videos, Dynamic Spatio Temporal Feature Pyramid Network with Pyramid Pooling (DSTFP) is used. Other features such as the sender-receiver relationship, the time stamps, which are obtained from the contextual schemes can easily be incorporated by the Bias Induced Sparse Hierarchical Attention Module (BiSHAM) which utilizes a bias aware attention module for feature fusion. For versatility in new task or data EmoMAC utilizes MAML algorithm for adaptability. Using Meaningful Neural Network (MNN), EmoMAC integrates text, image, and contextual data for emotion detection within emails. Rigorous evaluation accuracy of 90.10%, precision of 95.23%, recall of 91.65%, F1 score of 92.45%, and wa-F1 score of 88.47% validates EmoMAC’s efficacy in capturing emotional nuances and provides insights for visual analytics of emotions within email.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss several reformulations and solution approaches for the problem of minimizing a polynomial in binary variables (P). We review and integrate different literature streams to describe a methodology consisting of three distinct phases, together with several possible variants for each phase. The first phase determines a recursive decomposition of each monomial of interest into pairs of submonomials, down to the initial variables. The decomposition gives rise to a so-called quadratization scheme. The second phase builds a quadratic reformulation of (P) from a given quadratization scheme, by associating a new auxiliary variable with each submonomial that appears in the scheme. A quadratic reformulation of (P) is obtained by enforcing relations between the auxiliary variables and the monomials that they represent, either through linear constraints or through penalty terms in the objective function. The resulting quadratic problem (QP) is non-convex in general and is still difficult to solve. At this stage we introduce the third phase of the resolution process, which consists in convexifying (QP). We consider different types of convexification methods, including complete linearization or quadratic convex reformulations. Mathematical properties of the different phases are formally established and some relations between them are clarified. Finally, we present some experimental results which illustrate the discussion and which support the practical relevance of quadratic reformulation methods.},

  abstract     = {Let $$G=(V\cup T,E)$$ be a graph where $$V\cup T$$ is the set of vertices, with T a subset of distinguished vertices, called terminals, and E the set of edges. Given a weight function $$w: V\rightarrow \mathbb N{\setminus } \{0\}$$ associated with the nonterminal nodes, the multi-terminal vertex separator problem consists in partitioning $$V\cup T$$ into $$k+1$$ subsets $$\{S, V_1,\dots , V_k\}$$ such that there is no edge between two different subsets $$V_i$$ and $$V_j$$ , each $$V_i$$ contains exactly one terminal and the weight of S is minimum. In this paper, we characterize the polytope of the solutions of this problem for two classes of the graph, and we show that the two linear systems are totally dual integral. Then, we study the polytope for the graphs that are decomposable by 1-node cutsets. We show that if G decomposes into $$G_1, \dots , G_k$$ , then the polytope in G can be obtained from those in $${\bar{G}}_1, \dots , {\bar{G}}_k$$ , where $${\bar{G}}_1, \dots , {\bar{G}}_k$$ are graphs related to $$G_1, \dots , G_k$$ , respectively. We also derive a procedure for composing facets and give some algorithmic consequences for solving the problem in G from $${\bar{G}}_1, \dots , {\bar{G}}_k$$ .},

  abstract     = {With the increasing awareness of environmental protection and the rapid development of the vehicle industry, vehicle trade-in has become an important initiative to promote the consumption of new energy vehicles (NEVs) and product upgrading. This study analyzes the decision-making of a vehicle manufacturer and changes in market demand by considering discriminatory government subsidy and consumer preferences. Results show that government subsidy policy not only significantly affects consumers vehicle purchase choices, but also profoundly influences manufacturers’ optimal NEVs range R&D investment and marketing strategies. Specifically, when demand for trade-in fuel vehicles (FVs) or NEVs is constrained by higher initial purchase costs or higher trade-in subsidies (with lower production costs for FVs or lower trade-in subsidies), focusing merely on subsidizing trade-in NEVs is optimal for incentivizing the manufacturer to increase the optimal investment in range R&D (highest profit). Conversely, in the absence of demand constraints, this is related to the purchase subsidy for NEVs. In addition, the extended section explores the impact of simultaneously subsidizing trade-in FVs and NEVs on manufacturers’ technological innovation and profitability. We find that the effectiveness of the new proposed subsidy depends on the production cost of FVs as well as the level of the subsidy. Specifically, under demand constraints for trade-in FVs, as subsidies for both trade-in FVs and NEVs increase, manufacturers’ technological innovation investment under the simultaneous subsidy scenario will be lower than in the case of subsidizing only NEVs. However, when the production costs of FVs are high, simultaneous subsidies can lead to higher profits for the manufacturer compared to subsidizing only NEVs.},
