  abstract     = {Renewable Energy Systems and Electrical Vehicles are penetrating the power system exponentially. This penetration of both systems reckons stable working of the overall system and power balancing in the system to maintain frequency and voltage stability. This paper employs soft computing techniques to achieve power balancing in a photovoltaic (PV)-integrated grid with electric vehicle (EV) loads. Power system stability is improved through the use of an orthogonal real and reactive power controller. Soft computing techniques like Fuzzy Logic Controller and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System(ANFIS) are applied to the Orthogonal Controller (DQ controller) to control the power quality disturbances. The system consists of two loops: the power stability loop, which regulates the Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) connecting the photovoltaic (PV) system to the grid, and the bidirectional power flow loop, designed to manage vehicle-to-grid and grid-to-vehicle power exchanges. A MATLAB based simulation is developed using Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) controllers to visualize their performance. The performance enhancement of these soft computing techniques is evaluated in comparison to the traditional Proportional-Integral (PI) controller. The topology of the bidirectional controller is adopted with dual converters instead of a single bidirectional converter in the proposed study. Although the cost of the setup increases, but the adoption in performance-intensive applications would make it a relevant topological variation. It is observed that the advanced soft computing techniques of FLC and ANFIS performed better than the PI controller considering harmonic reduction, power factor enhancement and voltage regulation as the criterion of performance. Considering advanced algorithms for the performance evaluation has given a good percentage change in harmonic reduction which is measured in terms of Total Harmonic Distortion. A significant improvement in the THD is observed while using the ANFIS algorithm as opposed while using the PI controller. The results demonstrated by the ANFIS controller surpassed the other controllers in minimizing THD and effectively managing the combined impact of PV penetration and EV loading on the grid.},

  abstract     = {The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has significantly impacted global health, creating an urgent demand for efficient and accurate diagnostic methods. Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging has emerged as an essential tool for early detection; however, issues such as low contrast and poor image quality can hinder accurate classification. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates VGG16 and ResNet101 architectures through a channel-wise attention fusion mechanism. This innovative design allows the model to adaptively emphasize the most informative features across both networks, improving diagnostic accuracy. To further enhance performance, we introduce Exposure Region-Based Modified Adaptive Histogram Equalization (ERBMAHE), a novel image enhancement technique that improves contrast and detail visibility in CXR images. Additionally, we employ Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to visualize and interpret the discriminative regions used by the model during prediction, thereby enhancing the model’s explainability and clinical trustworthiness. The system is trained using five-fold cross-validation with data augmentation to ensure robustness and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed attention-based hybrid model, when paired with ERBMAHE-enhanced images, achieves a test accuracy of 97.94%, precision of 99.06%, F1-score of 97.92%, and recall of 96.80%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. This framework provides a promising tool for rapid, interpretable, and reliable COVID-19 diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited healthcare settings.},

This paper introduces an innovative scheduling model incorporating real-time AGV battery status as a key parameter, using a machine learning algorithm to predict energy consumption and optimize task allocation accordingly. The primary objective is to extend AGV battery life, reduce energy consumption, and contribute to environmental sustainability, all while maintaining high operational efficiency. In addition to the scheduling algorithm, we present a comprehensive application framework designed to integrate this optimization model into real-world factory environments. This architecture leverages cloud-edge computing to process real-time data from AGVs, enabling dynamic scheduling adjustments and seamless execution of tasks. The proposed approach has been experimentally validated, demonstrating improvements in energy efficiency when compared to a conventional AGV scheduling strategy. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of our solution in improving energy efficiency while maintaining high performance in AGV operations. By providing the necessary infrastructure for data input, processing, and output implementation, the framework ensures that the algorithm can be effectively deployed and scaled in industrial settings.

Various mathematical and statistical models have been used in the past for modelling the yarn properties. Machine learning (ML) models have started to make their way in the textile industry since they are able to counter several limitations of the mathematical and statistical models. In this work, an attempt has been made to predict three properties of cotton yarns (tenacity, unevenness and hairiness) using two decision tree-based ML models, namely Random Forest and XGBoost. These models yielded better results compared to traditional models and existing ML models (ANN, SVM and KNN). Particularly, XGBoost performed better than all other models and also gave the best predictions (MAPE = 2.53, 2.69 and 2.13; R2 = 0.776, 0.881 and 0.937; RMSE = 0.496, 0.731 and 0.144; and MAE = 0.375, 0.548 and 0.115 for tenacity, unevenness and hairiness, respectively) for all three yarn quality parameters for unseen test data. Synthetic data was also generated to improve the generalisability of the XGBoost model and it was found that the prediction accuracy improved with the synthetic data. Significance test of input features was conducted to analyse the importance of cotton fibre properties. The results reveal that there is a good agreement between the outcome of ML models and established perception of fibre-yarn property relationships.},

However, the diverse composition of AAM complicates the prediction of its properties, necessitating empirical and somewhat arbitrary material parameter designs. To address this challenge, this study proposes a soft computing framework employing machine learning and heuristic algorithms for predicting the compressive strength and fluidity of AAM, as well as for optimizing material parameters. Microchemical compositions (e.g., CaO, SiO2, Al2O3) serve as input parameters for the first-time prediction of AAM engineering properties. Firstly, a Particle Swarm Optimization-based XGBoost model (PSO-XGBoost) and corresponding evaluation metrics were developed to predict compressive strength and fluidity based on 11 input parameters. Feature importance analysis revealed that water-to-binder ratio (W/B) is the most critical parameter governing AAM properties. Secondly, leveraging the data mapping capabilities of PSO-XGBoost, the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm was employed for inverse analysis to optimize material parameters. $${\text{MAPE}}_{multi - objective}$$ reduced the prediction error from 18.84% to 0.27%, demonstrating the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed parameter design methodology.},

With our increasing reliance on interconnected systems, the vulnerability to sophisticated threats has become pronounced. In response, Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a formidable tool, offering the potential to revolutionize cybersecurity strategies. It encompasses algorithms and models designed to produce new content, often indistinguishable from human-generated data, thus holding promise not only for creative content generation but also for offensive and defensive cybersecurity applications. This paper explores the intersection of Generative AI and cybersecurity, conducting a critical analysis of the current state of generative AI techniques and their practical implementations in cybersecurity. Specifically, we delve into key generative AI methodologies such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders, evaluating their efficacy in addressing cybersecurity challenges. Through a comprehensive examination of existing literature, case studies, and emerging trends, our objective is to insight into the promises, challenges, and ethical considerations associated with integrating generative AI into the cybersecurity landscape. This paper contributes to the cybersecurity field by synthesizing existing literature, identifying trends, and highlighting areas for future research and development in the realm of generative AI for cybersecurity. We emphasize the potential for enhanced security through the adoption of generative AI techniques while stressing the importance of robust defenses against potential misuse by malicious actors.

This paper introduces Cell Division Optimizer (CDO), a new meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by the two cell division processes: mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is used to model exploitation whereas Meiosis is used for exploration. The method incorporates genetic diversity using mutation and crossovers, enhancing the algorithm’s ability to avoid premature convergence at local optima. The proposed method is evaluated over 50 well-known benchmark functions which include simple, unimodal, multimodal, and complex landscape benchmarks. Experiments are also performed for two classical engineering problems to verify the applications of CDO in real-world problems. This performance is compared with eight state-of-the-art algorithms including recently proposed methods and their specialized variants. A statistical analysis was performed to verify the significance of the results. Statistical analysis of 390 sub-experiments shows that CDO significantly outperformed competitors in 280 cases. In our experiments, it is seen that CDO consistently results in giving better solutions which is verified by studying the standard deviation among the results of the experiments. Finally, a convergence analysis is conducted for all the chosen methods. In most experiments, CDO converges to the global best earlier than the other algorithms, while avoiding local optima values.},

The testing results reveal that the proposed improved butterfly optimization algorithm-SVM model improves the short-term wind power prediction accuracy, with a mean value of less than 0.21 compared with those of the butterfly optimization algorithm-SVM, particle swarm optimization-SVM, genetic algorithm-SVM, and back propagation neural network models. High-precision short-term wind power prediction can be used to establish a reasonable economic dispatch plan for power systems and improve the economic benefits of wind farms.},

  abstract     = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated its transformative impact in creating learning models, processing extensive datasets, and executing intricate calculations rapidly. Nevertheless, achieving optimal performance with AI models demands substantial investment in powerful and expensive high-end hardware. The learning models running on the hardware are complex, requiring massive data and huge training time. However, the race to achieve higher accuracy and computational limitations of AI further poses a threat to the environment and thus provides motivation to develop AI technology that is cost-effective, scalable, and suitable for resource-constrained environments, Frugal Artificial Intelligence, or Frugal AI. The objective of this paper is to present a detailed survey of the latest concepts and applications of Frugal AI. The definition, concept, history, and evolution of Frugal AI are discussed in the paper. The article presents the key characteristics of Frugal AI, as well as the ethical considerations and techniques needed for developing Frugal AI systems. Further, the challenges in Frugal AI are discussed along with potential future research directions. The paper concludes by highlighting the role of Frugal AI in Industry 4.0. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of Frugal AI and will help researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to better understand the technology and aim for sustainable and green computation.},
