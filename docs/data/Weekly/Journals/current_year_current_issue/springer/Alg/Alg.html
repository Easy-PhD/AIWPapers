  abstract     = {Let d be a (well-behaved) shortest-path metric defined on a path-connected subset of $$\mathbb {R}^2$$ and let $$\mathcal {D}=\{D_1,\ldots,D_n\}$$ be a set of geodesic disks with respect to the metric d. We prove that $$\mathcal {G}^{\times }(\mathcal {D})$$ , the intersection graph of the disks in $$\mathcal {D}$$ , has a clique-based separator consisting of $$O(n^{3/4+\varepsilon })$$ cliques. This significantly extends the class of objects whose intersection graphs have small clique-based separators. Our clique-based separator yields an algorithm for q-Coloring that runs in time $$2^{O(n^{3/4+\varepsilon })}$$ , assuming the boundaries of the disks $$D_i$$ can be computed in polynomial time. We also use our clique-based separator to obtain a simple, efficient, and almost exact distance oracle for intersection graphs of geodesic disks. Our distance oracle uses $$O(n^{7/4+\varepsilon })$$ storage and can report the hop distance between any two nodes in $$\mathcal {G}^{\times }(\mathcal {D})$$ in $$O(n^{3/4+\varepsilon })$$ time, up to an additive error of one. So far, distance oracles with an additive error of one that use subquadratic storage and sublinear query time were not known for such general graph classes.},

  abstract     = {We use the reconfiguration framework to analyze problems that involve the rearrangement of items among groups. In various applications, a group of items could correspond to the files or jobs assigned to a particular machine, and the goal of rearrangement could be improving efficiency or increasing locality. To cover problems arising in a wide range of application areas, we define the general Repacking problem as the rearrangement of multisets of multisets. We present hardness results for the general case and algorithms for various restricted classes of instances. By limiting the total size of items in each multiset, our results can be viewed as an offline approach to Bin Packing, in which each bin is represented as a multiset. In addition to providing the first results on reconfiguration of multisets, our contributions open up several research avenues: the interplay between reconfiguration and online algorithms and parallel algorithms; the use of the tools of linear programming in reconfiguration; and, in the longer term, a focus on extra resources in reconfiguration. A preliminary version of this paper appeared in the proceedings of the 18th International Conference and Workshops on Algorithms and Computation (WALCOM 2024).},

  abstract     = {We consider two natural variants of the problem of minimum spanning tree ( $$\text {MST}$$ ) of a graph in the parallel setting: MST verification (verifying if a given tree is an $$\text {MST}$$ ) and the sensitivity analysis of an MST (finding the lowest cost replacement edge for each edge of the $$\text {MST}$$ ). These two problems have been studied extensively for sequential algorithms and for parallel algorithms in the $$\textrm{PRAM}$$ model of computation. In this paper, we extend the study to the standard model of Massive Parallel Computation ( $$\textrm{MPC}$$ ). It is known that for graphs of diameter D, the connectivity problem can be solved in $$O(\log D + \log \log n)$$ rounds on an $$\textrm{MPC}$$ with low local memory (each machine can store only $$O(n^{\delta })$$ words for an arbitrary constant $$\delta > 0$$ ) and with linear global memory, that is, with optimal utilization. However, for the related task of finding an $$\text {MST}$$ , we need $$\Omega (\log D_{\text {MST}})$$ rounds, where $$D_{\text {MST}}$$ denotes the diameter of the minimum spanning tree. The state of the art upper bound for $$\text {MST}$$ is $$O(\log n)$$ rounds; the result follows by simulating existing $$\textrm{PRAM}$$ algorithms. While this bound may be optimal for general graphs, the benchmark of connectivity and lower bound for $$\text {MST}$$ suggest the target bound of $$O(\log D_\text {MST})$$ rounds, or possibly $$O(\log D_\text {MST} + \log \log n)$$ rounds. As for now, we do not know if this bound is achievable for the $$\text {MST}$$ problem on an $$\textrm{MPC}$$ with low local memory and linear global memory. In this paper, we show that two natural variants of the $$\text {MST}$$ problem: $$\text {MST}$$ verification and sensitivity analysis of an $$\text {MST}$$ , can be completed in $$O(\log D_T)$$ rounds on an $$\textrm{MPC}$$ with low local memory and with linear global memory, that is, with optimal utilization; here $$D_T$$ is the diameter of the input “candidate $$\text {MST}$$ ” T. The algorithms asymptotically match our lower bound, conditioned on the 1-vs-2-cycle conjecture.},

  abstract     = {In Path Set Packing, the input is an undirected graph G, a collection $$\mathcal{P}$$ of simple paths in G, and a positive integer k. The problem is to decide whether there exist k edge-disjoint paths in $$\mathcal{P}$$ . We study the parameterized complexity of Path Set Packing with respect to both natural and structural parameters. We show that the problem is W[1]-hard with respect to vertex cover number, and W[1]-hard respect to pathwidth plus solution size when input graph is a grid. These results answer an open question raised in Xu and Zhang (in: Wang L, Zhu D (eds) Computing and combinatorics—24th international conference, COCOON 2018, Qing Dao, China, July 2–4, 2018, proceedings. Lecture notes in computer science, vol 10976, pp 305–315. Springer, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-94776-1_26 ). On the positive side, we present an FPT algorithm parameterized by feedback vertex number plus maximum degree, and present an FPT algorithm parameterized by treewidth plus maximum degree plus maximum length of a path in $$\mathcal{P}$$ . These positive results complement the hardness of Path Set Packing with respect to any subset of the parameters used in the FPT algorithms. We also give a 4-approximation algorithm for maximum path set packing problem which runs in FPT time when parameterized by feedback edge number.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are general-purpose optimisation algorithms that maintain a population (multiset) of candidate solutions and apply variation operators to create new solutions called offspring. A new population is typically formed using one of two strategies: a $$(\mu +\lambda )$$ EA (plus selection) keeps the best $$\mu $$ search points out of the union of $$\mu $$ parents in the old population and $$\lambda $$ offspring, whereas a $$(\mu ,\lambda )$$ EA (comma selection) discards all parents and only keeps the best $$\mu $$ out of $$\lambda $$ offspring. Comma selection may help to escape from local optima, however when and how it is beneficial is subject to an ongoing debate. We propose a new benchmark function to investigate the benefits of comma selection: the well known benchmark function OneMaxwith randomly planted local optima, generated by frozen noise. We show that comma selection (the $${(1,\lambda )}$$ EA) is faster than plus selection (the $${(1+\lambda )}$$ EA) on this benchmark, in a fixed-target scenario, and for offspring population sizes $$\lambda $$ for which both algorithms behave differently. For certain parameters, the $${(1,\lambda )}$$ EAfinds the target in $$\Theta (n \ln n)$$ evaluations, with high probability (w.h.p.), while the $${(1+\lambda )}$$ EAw.h.p. requires $$\omega (n^2)$$ evaluations. We further show that the advantage of comma selection is not arbitrarily large: w.h.p. comma selection outperforms plus selection at most by a factor of $$O(n \ln n)$$ for most reasonable parameter choices. We develop novel methods for analysing frozen noise and give powerful and general fixed-target results with tail bounds that are of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the decidability of fully quantum nonlocal games with noisy maximally entangled states. Fully quantum nonlocal games are a generalization of nonlocal games, where both questions and answers are quantum and the referee performs a binary POVM measurement to decide whether they win the game after receiving the quantum answers from the players. The quantum value of a fully quantum nonlocal game is the supremum of the probability that they win the game, where the supremum is taken over all the possible entangled states shared between the players and all the valid quantum operations performed by the players. The seminal work $$\text {MIP}^*=\text {RE}$$ ( Ji et al. MIP ∗ = RE, 2020; Ji et al. Quantum soundness of the classical low individual degree test, 2020) implies that it is undecidable to approximate the quantum value of a fully nonlocal game. This still holds even if the players are only allowed to share (arbitrarily many copies of) maximally entangled states. This paper investigates the case that the shared maximally entangled states are noisy. We prove that there is a computable upper bound on the copies of noisy maximally entangled states for the players to win a fully quantum nonlocal game with a probability arbitrarily close to the quantum value. This implies that it is decidable to approximate the quantum values of these games. Hence, the hardness of approximating the quantum value of a fully quantum nonlocal game is not robust against the noise in the shared states. This paper is built on the framework for the decidability of non-interactive simulations of joint distributions (Ghazi et al. in: 2016 IEEE 57th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), Los Alamitos, 2016; De et al. in: Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, Philadelphia, 2018; Ghazi et al. Proceedings of the 33rd Computational Complexity Conference, 2018) and generalizes the analogous result for nonlocal games in Qin and Yao (SIAM J Comput 50(6):1800–1891, 2021). We extend the theory of Fourier analysis to the space of super-operators and prove several key results including an invariance principle and a dimension reduction for super-operators. These results are interesting in their own right and are believed to have further applications.},

  abstract     = {Parameterized Inapproximability Hypothesis ( $$\textsf{PIH}$$ ) is a central question in the field of parameterized complexity. $$\textsf{PIH}$$ asserts that given as input a 2- $$\textsf{CSP}$$ on k variables and alphabet size n, it is $$\textsf{W}$$ [1]-hard parameterized by k to distinguish if the input is perfectly satisfiable or if every assignment to the input violates 1% of the constraints. An important implication of $$\textsf{PIH}$$ is that it yields the tight parameterized inapproximability of the $$k$$ - $$\textsf{maxcoverage}$$ problem. In the $$k$$ - $$\textsf{maxcoverage}$$ problem, we are given as input a set system, a threshold $$\tau >0$$ , and a parameter k and the goal is to determine if there exist k sets in the input whose union is at least $$\tau $$ fraction of the entire universe. $$\textsf{PIH}$$ is known to imply that it is $$\textsf{W}$$ [1]-hard parameterized by k to distinguish if there are k input sets whose union is at least $$\tau $$ fraction of the universe or if the union of every k input sets is not much larger than $$\tau \cdot (1-\frac{1}{e})$$ fraction of the universe. In this work we present a gap preserving $$\textsf{FPT}$$ reduction (in the reverse direction) from the $$k$$ - $$\textsf{maxcoverage}$$ problem to the aforementioned 2- $$\textsf{CSP}$$ problem, thus showing that the assertion that approximating the $$k$$ - $$\textsf{maxcoverage}$$ problem to some constant factor is $$\textsf{W}$$ [1]-hard implies $$\textsf{PIH}$$ . In addition, we present a gap preserving $$\textsf{FPT}$$ reduction from the $$k$$ - $$\textsf{median}$$ problem (in general metrics) to the $$k$$ - $$\textsf{maxcoverage}$$ problem, further highlighting the power of gap preserving $$\textsf{FPT}$$ reductions over classical gap preserving polynomial time reductions.},
