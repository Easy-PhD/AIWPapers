  abstract     = {Problem definition : Inpatients are often treated as the “captive audience” for hospital diagnostic services, and they are notified only when service capacity is available. This arrangement causes significant chaos and inefficiencies in hospital operations. Methodology/results : We propose an innovative scheduling approach called “advance notice” to manage hospital diagnostic practices. Advance notice is a brand-new scheduling paradigm in between classic allocation scheduling and advance scheduling. Patients are placed in a common queue waiting to be called for service, and they will be provided both a fixed preparation time and a guaranteed service time window in advance. The advance notice policy enjoys the benefit of allocation scheduling (giving the provider flexibility in using her capacity) and that of advance scheduling (reducing patient online waiting). It calls for two decisions: who to serve now and who to send advance notices to. We formulate a Markov decision process model to optimize these decisions dynamically. Via a novel variable transformation, we reveal the hidden anti-multimodular structure of the problem and show how the optimal decisions should be adjusted in response to changes in the system load. Beyond solving the model for daily operations, we further investigate how the service and preparation time windows as system-level controls can be used to manage system performance. Our numerical study, populated by real data from a large academic medical center in the United States, demonstrates significant improvement in operational efficiency by switching from current practice to our proposed advance notice policy. Managerial implications : The advance notice policy strikes a fine balance between the two classic scheduling paradigms; it gives the provider flexibility in using her capacity as in allocation scheduling, and it reduces patient online waiting as in advance scheduling. Although it is motivated by healthcare applications, the advance notice policy offers a promising cutting-edge approach to improving general appointment-based services. Funding: The work of Z.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) is ubiquitous to address uncertainties inherent in operations management (OM) problems. Recently, an alternative goal-driven framework, robust satisficing (RS), is proposed. RS aims to attain a prescribed target, such as avoiding overshooting the cost budget, as much as possible under uncertainty. The goal-driven modeling philosophy fits many OM problems, yet there is a lack of direct comparisons between DRO and RS. In this paper, we uncover connections between DRO and RS. Methodology/results : Suppose both models are based on the Wasserstein metric and consider a risk-aware convex objective function affected by uncertain parameters. We demonstrate that they share the same solution family. We establish the correspondence between the radius parameter in DRO and the target parameter in RS such that the optimal solutions to the two models coincide. Inspired by the globalized distributionally robust counterpart (GDRC), we extend the analysis to GDRC and the globalized robust satisficing (GRS). We reveal that GDRC and GRS have the same solution families as DRO and RS, respectively. More importantly, we establish novel results on the equivalence of DRO, GDRC, RS, and GRS models under previously stated conditions. Managerial implications : The equivalence results help unify performance bounds of DRO and RS models. Specifically, each model now has an additional set of theoretical guarantees from the other model, and any bounds derived for one model automatically apply to other equivalent models via some parameter mapping. Despite the theoretical equivalence result, the performance of the DRO and RS models can vary depending on how the model parameters are selected. The experimental findings show how these differences emerge when transitioning from theory to practice. Additionally, the experiments provide insights for practitioners, such as how the use of cross-validation can help reflect the true model preferences, particularly when only a few validation points are set.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Many innovations today are data driven. To improve the algorithms of these products, firms make substantial investments in data collection. However, the data are limited for an individual firm, which caps the benefits of the algorithms. Data sharing among the firms can help alleviate this problem, but firms may be reluctant to share their proprietary data, because doing so may result in a loss of competitive advantage. Motivated by this tension, we ask the following two questions. First, when do firms voluntarily share their data and when are they reluctant to do so? Second, how does voluntary data sharing compare with the corresponding centralized data sharing (as if a government were to decide the level of data sharing to promote innovation)? Methodology/results : Using a game-theoretic model, we identify two key factors that determine the answers to the questions: (i) the relationship between firms’ data sets and (ii) the degree of uncertainty associated with the innovation. We find that firms voluntarily share data if their data sets are complements or if the uncertainty is high. Moreover, relative to the centralized data sharing, firms voluntarily share too little (respectively, much) data when their data sets are complements (respectively, redundant) and the uncertainty is moderate (respectively, high). Managerial implications : Our findings provide plausible explanations on data-sharing practices, for example, why firms in the autonomous vehicle industry voluntarily share their proprietary data. We also shed light on the antitrust issues associated with data sharing, where too much voluntary data sharing can reduce firms’ data collection incentives and stifle competition. Moreover, if the government considers subsidizing firms’ data collection efforts to accelerate innovation, cost subsidies are particularly effective when paired with mandatory data-sharing regulations. The government should exercise caution under voluntary data sharing because higher subsidies may not necessarily lead to higher innovation. Funding: Z.

We set out to study a UGC platform’s optimal dynamic operational policies in its different stages and the impact of various constraints and innovations. Methodology/results : We adopt a hybrid of the Bass diffusion model and the replicator equation in evolutionary game theory to capture the creator and viewer base growths and analyze the dynamic operational decisions of a UGC platform, including promotion, advertising, and revenue sharing in an optimal control framework. We find an interesting mirroring structure between the platform’s early- and mature-stage optimal advertising and creator wage policies. An analysis of the optimal policies reveals a coherent rationale behind the dynamic management of the UGC platform around the relationship triangle. We also show that the platform should generously share advertising revenue with creators and may adopt loss leading shortly after as opposed to right at launch. We further explore the impacts of celebrity creators, liquidity constraints, paid advertisement removal, sponsored content, and viewer tipping.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : A company’s project portfolio is an important success factor. Employing strategic buckets to segment the overall budget into budgets for different project types is a commonly used approach for managing project selection. Strategic buckets typically refer to sets of projects of a certain type, such as safe and risky projects. A strategic bucket specification defines the number of buckets and thresholds between them. This paper addresses the question of how different strategic buckets specifications affect decision makers’ project selection behavior. Methodology/results : We develop a behavioral model of the effect of strategic buckets on project selection and use laboratory experiments to analyze how bucket specifications affect project selection decisions. For various strategic bucket specifications where a rational decision maker would allocate the budget to projects of the project type matching their risk preference only, we find that actual decision makers have the tendency to allocate the budget evenly among buckets and among project types within buckets. This observation can be explained by the naïve diversification bias, and we observe this effect in experimental settings with different selection processes, project definitions, and subject pools. Managerial implications : Our findings allow companies to better understand the effect of buckets guidelines on actual project selection behavior and to manage their project portfolio selection by choosing the right bucket specification.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Online retailers face the challenge of converting website traffic into actual purchases and profits. Specifically, the study examines how effective different forms of retargeting strategies are for engaging consumers who visit online stores but leave without making a purchase. Methodology/results : A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the impact of retargeting strategies offering free shipping (FSR) and free returns (FRR) on customer purchasing behavior and profitability. The key findings reveal that simple product reminders do not significantly boost purchases. In contrast, FSR and FRR implemented late in the shopping process led to significant increases in both purchase rates (18.6% and 31.6%) and targeting profitability (28.2% and 37.8%), respectively. Additional analyses with advanced machine learning methods of causal forest algorithms identified significant heterogeneity of the FSR and FRR effects. FRR was particularly effective among younger customers with less experience on the platform and when the abandoned product was of higher value. In contrast, FSR was more effective among older customers with longer tenure and when the product price was lower. Managerial implications : The findings benefit academics, managers, and decision makers by emphasizing the need for personalized retargeting strategies that address customers’ perceived risks, particularly in the later stages of the shopping process. The research highlights the importance of tailoring retargeting strategies to specific customer profiles to maximize effectiveness and retail profitability. Funding: L.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In practice, supply chain parties often have limited capital, requiring them to seek financing and bear bankruptcy risk. In this paper, we behaviorally investigate a trade credit contract between a supplier and a capital-constrained retailer, the latter of which may face bankruptcy risk. After the supplier proposes a wholesale price, the retailer purchases a quantity through trade credit if its initial capital is insufficient and repays the supplier after demand is realized. If demand is too low, the retailer goes bankrupt. Methodology/Results : Through a controlled-laboratory experiment with human participants, we investigate how a retailer’s exposure to bankruptcy risk, which we vary through its initial capital, affects supply chain decisions and outcomes. We find that the presence of such bankruptcy risk leads to decisions that systematically differ when compared with a setting without bankruptcy risk. Among others, the retailer significantly understocks when exposed to bankruptcy risk, and the supplier attempts to offset this effect by offering a lower wholesale price. The resulting effect is that expected profits for the retailer, supplier, and supply chain are all significantly different than the baseline predictions. To account for these observed decisions, we show that a behavioral model of reference dependence and fairness organizes the data well. Managerial implications : Our work demonstrates that the presence of bankruptcy risk for a retailer significantly alters supply chain decisions in systematic ways, which has direct consequences on profits.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We present a continuous-time Bayesian model for managing inventory in a retail setting when inventory records are inaccurate. In our formulation, the inventory level and its record have separate dynamics. The former is driven by the demand and unobservable loss process, whereas the latter is driven by the demand and transaction error process. Methodology/results : We analytically characterize the dynamics of the retailer’s belief on the shelf inventory level and prove that the optimal restocking policy is a threshold policy. In contrast to prior conjectures, we show that transaction errors play a prominent role in increasing the uncertainty in the shelf inventory distribution. In addition to this confounding effect, the presence of transaction errors breaks the retailer’s ability to calculate this distribution by tracking a small set of sufficient statistics: it remains a function of the entire observed history. Hence, computing the optimal restocking policy, even though we obtain its exact analytical form, remains numerically intractable. We tackle this “curse of dimensionality” by dynamically adjusting the problem’s underlying information filtration. This effectively projects the dynamics of the inventory level onto a manifold that is adaptively adjusting to the information revealed by the inventory record process. Managerial implications : Adding this extra layer of adaptation, implemented by dynamic filtration , enables us to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by an arbitrary degree. We show that the resulting implementable policy, which is optimal for the chosen dynamic filtration, also exhibits significant robustness to model misspecification.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Companies operating global supply chains face growing policy uncertainties that affect the costs of importing raw materials (RM) and finished goods (FG) from low-cost to developed countries, as well as the relative profitability of production in different countries. This has prompted the need for diversified global supply chains often involving the addition of onshore production alongside existing offshore facilities. Motivated by recent developments in the U.S. clean energy sector, this paper adopts a game-theoretic model to analyze a global firm’s reshoring capacity decision and output quantity competition with a domestic manufacturer under policy uncertainty. We examine the effects of these policies on operational decisions and profitability for both firms. Methodology/results : We show that the impact of FG tariffs depends on two opposite effects: an output quantity effect that leads to reduction of reshoring investment as the expected unit cost in serving the market increases and an overflow demand effect that encourages more reshoring investment to minimize the overflow of unsatisfied production to offshore locations. RM tariffs do not affect overflow production, and the output quantity effect will always dampen reshoring investment. Because consumer tax credits directly influence market demand, when firms’ output decisions are made after demand and therefore policy realization, the output quantity effect is absent. The overflow demand effect and stimulated higher demand will incentivize higher reshoring investment. Furthermore, we show that higher tariffs hurt the global firm’s profit as tariffs increase its average output cost, whereas tax credits can benefit the firm. Although both policies are intended to protect domestic firms, they may negatively affect their profit when the global firm’s reshoring capacity is high, intensifying competition between them. Finally, the existence of domestic competition will reduce reshoring investment when domestic manufacturing is efficient. However, when global firms have significant cost advantage, the presence of domestic competition may encourage aggressive reshoring investment. Managerial implications : For global firms, investing in reshoring capacity creates a “real option” in production allocation in serving the market, and the provided operational flexibility enhances competitiveness in an uncertain environment. For policymakers, it is crucial to carefully consider the tariff level, which stage of a supply chain to execute trade restrictions on, and tax credit amounts to be used. Very high tariffs on moderate size markets may have unexpected effect on reshoring. Trade and industrial policies should be carefully analyzed for their effectiveness, accounting for cost disadvantages of domestic competitors and market demand strength. Funding: X.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Imperfect produce—edible but cosmetically flawed fruits and vegetables—is often excluded from store shelves, contributing significantly to food waste. Commercializing imperfect produce presents a promising opportunity to reduce waste. This study examines how grocery retailers can best choose from three common retailing strategies: discarding imperfect produce, bunching it with cosmetically perfect produce, or differentiating by selling perfect and imperfect produce separately at different prices. Methodology/results : We develop analytical models that capture consumers’ purchase behaviors under each retailing strategy. These models account for varying consumer preferences and quality perceptions to determine optimal retailer choices and their implications for food waste reduction. Our analysis identifies the specific market conditions under which each retailing strategy becomes optimal. We then examine two widely discussed policy interventions aimed at reducing food waste: educating consumers to improve their perception of imperfect produce and relaxing the tolerance limits for the amount of imperfect produce allowed into retail stores. We find that educating consumers about the value of imperfect produce may inadvertently reduce sales of perfect produce through cannibalization, potentially leading to increased amounts of unsold perfect produce and lower profits. This economic pressure can cause retailers to switch from the differentiating strategy to the discarding strategy, paradoxically increasing food waste. Additionally, relaxing tolerance limits may merely shift food waste from farms to retail stores when retailers employ discarding or differentiating strategies. Our study incorporates three extensions—upcycling imperfect produce into by-products, adopting mixed strategies that combine approaches, and implementing full-shelf ordering policies—which confirm the robustness of our main findings. Managerial implications : This research provides retailers with actionable insights for selecting optimal strategies to manage imperfect produce based on specific consumer preference profiles and market conditions. For policymakers, we offer recommendations that highlight the potential unintended consequences of well-intentioned interventions, suggesting more nuanced approaches to effectively reduce food waste.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Although many retailers allow consumer returns via money-back guarantees (MBGs) to stimulate consumer demand, some may choose not to. Most existing literature emphasizes factors from the marketing side. However, it is not uncommon that the returned products from unsatisfied consumers are further returned to the upstream manufacturer. How the upstream manufacturer–retailer interactions impact the downstream MBG policies is unclear. Methodology/results : We adopt a multiunit bilateral bargaining framework to model the firms’ interactions in distribution channels consisting of a manufacturer and two competing retailers. Interestingly, we find that both bargaining power and contract forms play important roles in determining equilibrium MBG decisions. When both retailers possess the same bargaining power, both retailers offering MBGs arises in equilibrium under the wholesale price contract, whereas the equilibrium MBG decisions depend on the bargaining power under the two-part tariff contract. Particularly, when the manufacturer is relatively weak in the negotiation with retailers, only one channel provides MBGs. When the retailers possess different bargaining powers, regardless of the contract forms, the asymmetric MBG decisions arise when one retailer is significantly more powerful in negotiation with the manufacturer than the other. The channel associated with the retailer with lower bargaining power provides an MBG, whereas the other may not. We further extend our analysis to situations where retailers can salvage the returned products with positive values by themselves, and the manufacturer negotiates with retailers sequentially to confirm our main findings. Managerial implications : Our results suggest that manufacturers should carefully develop product return policies when trading with symmetric retailers under coordinating contracts or asymmetric retailers with imbalanced power distribution.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Many service and manufacturing systems use both capacity rationing (CR) and priority to differentiate among their customers. We model these as a two-class nonpreemptive priority M / M / c queueing model and the practice of CR; an arriving low-priority customer can directly enter service only when the number of idle servers is higher than the CR level, k . For these systems, we separately discuss two important features that are common in practice but ignored in the literature; supply is narrowly matched with demand, and service rates are heterogeneous, reflecting different customer types. Methodology and results : When the service times of both classes are identical, our asymptotic results indicate that for a system with a large number of servers, the nondegenerative CR level does not exceed O ( c ) . When the service times of classes differ, we derive exact solutions for different performance measures of interest using queueing and Markov chain decomposition. We numerically demonstrate the impact of system parameters on these performance measures and provide insights on the CR level. Management implications : We show that as predicted by the asymptotic analysis, an O ( c ) CR level can significantly reduce the waits of high-priority customers with little effect on low-priority customers’ waiting. We establish that this insight is robust to heterogeneous service times across classes and other system parameters, such as the number of servers and the arrival rates of the classes.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a multiperiod, multiproduct, dynamic pricing problem with price adjustment costs known as “menu costs.” In this setting, decision makers, such as retailers or online platforms, incur a fixed menu cost whenever prices are updated between periods as well as a variable menu cost that linearly scales with the number of between-period price changes. From a demand standpoint, the random number of customers arriving in each period is assumed to be arbitrarily distributed, whereas purchasing decisions are dictated by a time-dependent multinomial logit choice model. Methodology/results : Our first main contribution consists of establishing fundamental hardness results for the dynamic pricing problem of interest, unveiling inherent computational hurdles even when stripped down to its simplest form. On the positive side, we identify grocery retail as a particular application domain whose distinguishing features allow us to develop a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS), through which optimal expected revenues are shown to be approachable within any degree of accuracy. In this context, our methodology synthesizes compact enumeration ideas, novel coupling arguments, and approximate dynamic programming techniques. Managerial implications : Finally, we present two extensive numerical experiments aimed at studying the impacts of menu costs, albeit from distinct vantage points. Both studies make use of a large and diverse test bed of problem instances that we painstakingly construct from a NielsenIQ scanner grocery data set. Given the novelty of incorporating menu costs within dynamic pricing environments, we use the first set of numerical experiments to present what constitutes one of the first close looks at how these price adjustment costs shape pricing patterns and influence optimal gross margins in a multiproduct setting. The second set of experiments is used to evaluate the efficacy of our FPTAS, ultimately showing its mean revenue performance to be within 1%–2% of optimal. In this way, not only do we break ground from a theoretical perspective when it comes to multiproduct dynamic pricing problems in the presence of menu costs, but we also extensively demonstrate the practical viability of our approach.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Many services rely on the prosocial behavior of consumers that benefits the wider community for effective delivery, such as bike-sharing schemes, self-service checkouts in grocery stores, and pathology screening services, yet there are frequent challenges in motivating honest, cooperative user behavior in these services. We build on existing research to argue that the degree of anonymity of users toward the service provider can be used to facilitate their prosocial behavior. Anonymity has two effects: It removes the ability of individuals to build a public reputation as someone who is prosocial, but it also removes accountability to others. Although studies have examined the effect of reputational motivation, studies of the effect of accountability on prosocial behavior have been limited to laboratory and online settings, where accountability, mostly toward their peers or to a “higher power,” only benefited other participants. Thus, little is known about how accountability toward the service provider can affect prosocial behavior that benefits the wider public. Methodology/results : We investigate this context with a unique proprietary data set from a pooled asymptomatic pathological screening program. We find that increasing anonymity by removing names from test kits distributed by the service provider decreased voluntary participation by 22%. Social pressures in larger groups partially substituted for the reduced accountability from removing names, providing an insight that can help mitigate reduced accountability in settings where anonymity is preferred. Managerial implications : For managers, we emphasize the value of accountability to the service provider as a motive for prosocial behaviors such as honesty and cooperation. For policymakers, we provide insight into designing healthcare screening and public interaction services.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Digital platforms provide sellers with the opportunity to leverage data analytics products, granting them convenient access to statistical analyses of their business data. To promote the adoption of data analytics products and facilitate the growth of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), a world-leading E-commerce platform initiated a “Democratizing Data Analytics” (DDA) campaign in May 2021, which gives free data analytics products access to all sellers on the platform. Leveraging a unique panel data set of over 370,000 sellers and a natural experiment, our study seeks to identify the causal effect of data analytics product adoption on seller performance. Methodology/results : This natural experiment led to a sharp increase in SMEs’ adoption of data analytics. Employing look-ahead propensity score matching (LA-PSM) coupled with difference-in-differences methods, we find that sellers who adopted an analytics product experienced a 14.4% increase in the number of transactions and an 18.8% increase in their revenue. We further explore the rich heterogeneity across sellers and find that younger, smaller sellers, and sellers with fewer cumulative transactions, benefit more from data analytics adoption, highlighting the value of data analytics product adoption for SME growth. Finally, we uncovered the intermediate process and mechanisms underlying such growth by examining how SMEs use data analytics and detailed operational decisions they make. After the adoption of data analytics products, sellers (1) spend more on advertising; (2) edit product titles, descriptions, and images more frequently; and (3) carry more new product stock keeping units and more product categories. Managerial implications : Our research indicates SMEs significantly benefit from adopting data analytics, underscoring the pivotal role these tools play in promoting their growth and development. Meanwhile, platforms or digital economies can increase their gross merchandise volume (GMV) by providing data analytics products to their sellers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study how to leverage patient-specific information to improve a hospital’s operational efficiency. We use abdominal surgery as the clinical setting and study the heterogeneous effects of surgical volume on surgery duration. We develop a framework for using patient-specific information by addressing three important questions: (1) Is the effect of surgical volume heterogeneous across patients with different features? (2) If so, how could patient-specific information that captures the heterogeneous effects of surgical volume on surgery duration be generated? (3) What is the value of patient-specific information in helping a hospital improve its operational efficiency? Methodology/results : Using an instrumental variable approach to address potential endogeneity issues, we first use a regression model to show that the average effect of surgical volume on surgery duration is significant. Then, we use a regression model with interaction terms to show that the effect of surgical volume is heterogeneous. After that, we apply an instrumental variable forest approach to obtain patient-specific volume effects. Finally, we use patient-specific volume effects and an optimization model to assess the potential value of patient-specific information in improving a hospital’s operational efficiency. We find the that total duration of surgeries could be reduced by 2.5%–8.9% if patient-specific volume effects are considered. Managerial implications : This study provides a framework for understanding treatment effect heterogeneity and using patient-specific information to improve a hospital’s operational efficiency. We provide empirical evidence that the effect of surgical volume is heterogeneous and address the challenges of estimating heterogeneous effects for different patients. Our framework can help hospital administrators to better match patients with surgeons, improving a hospital’s operational efficiency.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The COVID-19 pandemic imposed unprecedented stresses on global supply chains (GSCs), compelling companies to reassess their supply chain structures and strategies. This crisis has also heightened awareness among businesses, consumers, and policymakers about the critical importance and far-reaching implications of GSC design and management. This unique moment presents a generational opportunity for Operations Management (OM) researchers to document and understand the ongoing restructuring of GSCs. Methodology/results : By analyzing microlevel data on U.S. customs import shipments (2019–2021), we uncover shifts in GSC strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Firms diversified suppliers within existing sourcing locations and reallocated volumes among them. Whereas dependence on China decreased, imports from other Asian nations like India and Vietnam, as well as North American countries like Canada and Mexico, increased. Industry-specific differences were pronounced, and a notable shift toward lower-frequency, higher-quantity shipments was also observed. Managerial implications : Beyond the challenges of COVID-19, recent years have witnessed other major supply chain disruptions, due to causes such as geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, and port worker strikes. We offer actionable insights for executives designing supply chain strategies to prepare for similar disruptions as they increase in frequency and severity. We identify future research avenues aimed at enhancing the resilience and adaptability of GSCs in a continuously evolving environment.

We study the causal relationship between drug shortages and medication errors using a natural experiment: hurricane damage to factories that produce heparin, an essential medication used frequently in hospitals. Methodology/results : We collect data on medication errors from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting System and drug sales from IQVIA’s National Sales Perspective. Applying the synthetic control method, we find that hurricane-related heparin supply disruptions increased medication error rates by 152%. In addition, we find significant spillover effects. The disruption increased medication error rates of a substitute drug, enoxaparin, by about 114%. Managerial implications : Our study uses an exogenous event to show that medication supply chain disruptions may negatively impact hospitals’ quality of care. We contribute to the literature by empirically linking the effects of supply chain disruptions to downstream service quality.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Responding to large hurricanes requires the deployment of food, shelter, and medical assistance to relieve the immediate needs of the victims. These services are supported by, and eventually fully transitioned to, local resources, such as grocery stores. However, disparities in local infrastructure and services may result in low-income communities bearing a disproportionate burden from these disasters. We investigate this possibility by testing for differences in the percentage change in paid prices, stockouts, and substitutions for grocery products between low-income and high-income communities following three large Atlantic hurricanes. Methodology/results : We use major disaster declarations by the U.S. federal government, and marry this information to U.S. Census Bureau data on household demographics and third-party data on grocery store sales. Using a triple-difference regression specification, we find that low-income communities in the disaster zones endure higher average percentage price increases within grocery categories compared with high-income communities. We provide evidence for several mechanisms that can contribute to this outcome—higher percent price increases at the product level, more frequent stockouts of low-priced products, and a larger increase in stockout-based substitution from low-priced products to high-priced products. Managerial implications : Product pricing, stockouts, and stockout-based substitutions are important topics in operations management practice and research. We provide empirical evidence across these outcomes of sustained heterogeneous effects by community income level in the aftermath of a hurricane. These findings can inform private and public sector responses to hurricanes, including pricing, prepositioning target goods, strategic overstocking, grocery store access, and structuring cash-and-voucher (C&V) programs that anticipate the disaster-induced substitution patterns of different community types.
