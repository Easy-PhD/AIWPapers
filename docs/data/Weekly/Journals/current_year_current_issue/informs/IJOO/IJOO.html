  abstract     = {We propose and analyze a new data-driven tradeoff (TRO) approach for modeling uncertainty that serves as a middle ground between the optimistic approach, which adopts a distributional belief, and the pessimistic distributionally robust optimization approach, which hedges against distributional ambiguity. We equip the TRO model with a TRO ambiguity set characterized by a size parameter controlling the level of optimism and a shape parameter representing distributional ambiguity. We first show that constructing the TRO ambiguity set using a general star-shaped shape parameter with the empirical distribution as its star center is necessary and sufficient to guarantee the hierarchical structure of the sequence of TRO ambiguity sets. Then, we analyze the properties of the TRO model, including quantifying conservatism, quantifying bias and generalization error, and establishing asymptotic properties. Specifically, we show that the TRO model could generate a spectrum of decisions, ranging from optimistic to conservative decisions. Additionally, we show that it could produce an unbiased estimator of the true optimal value. Furthermore, we establish the almost-sure convergence of the optimal value and the set of optimal solutions of the TRO model to their true counterparts. We exemplify our theoretical results using an inventory control problem and a portfolio optimization problem.

  abstract     = {Energy production throughout the world is transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable sources such as wind power and solar power. This transition has been gradual—over half of the world’s electricity is still produced by coal, oil, and gas—but must accelerate to meet global emission targets. This paper examines the contributions that mathematical optimization and equilibrium models can make to help accelerate this transition. The models we catalog cover a range of physical scales and timescales. Our focus is on novel model formulations that can help overcome the challenges of the transition by unpicking the complexity inherent in many settings and quantifying the trade-offs that must be made when developing energy policy.

  abstract     = {We study a cardinality minimization problem that simultaneously minimizes an objective function and the cardinality of unsatisfied soft constraints. This paper proposes two continuous approximation methods that reformulate the discrete cardinality as complementarity constraints and difference-of-convex functions, respectively. We show that under suitable conditions, local and stationary solutions of the approximation problems recover local minimizers of the cardinality minimization problem. To demonstrate effectiveness, we apply the proposed methods to applications where violating as few preference conditions (or soft constraints) is desired. Our numerical study supports the use of methods based on our new approximations for cardinality minimization that produce comparable solutions with other benchmark formulations.

  abstract     = {The rapid deployment of robotics technologies requires dedicated optimization algorithms to manage large fleets of autonomous agents. This paper supports robotic parts-to-picker operations in warehousing by optimizing order–workstation assignments, item–pod assignments, and the schedule of order fulfillment at workstations. The model maximizes throughput, managing human workload at the workstations and congestion in the facility. We solve it via large-scale neighborhood search with a novel learn-then-optimize approach to subproblem generation. The algorithm relies on an off-line machine learning procedure to predict objective improvements based on subproblem features and an online optimization model to generate a new subproblem at each iteration. In collaboration with Amazon Robotics, we show that our model and algorithm generate much stronger solutions for practical problems than state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, our solution enhances the utilization of robotic fleets by coordinating robotic tasks for human operators to pick multiple items at once and by coordinating robotic routes to avoid congestion in the facility.
