  abstract = {Heritage railways are railway operations that are not mainstream and serve as a reminiscence of past railways to build a cultural and national identity. They are among the main forms of heritage tourism. The heritage railway industry differs fundamentally from other forms of tourism and travel because of the significantly large fraction of volunteers in its workforce; additionally, heritage railways are of an extremely smaller scale than mainstream railways, with lower annual revenues. Although the regular railway industry extensively uses mathematical decision-making technologies for its daily operations, there is little evidence and few case studies demonstrating such value for heritage railways. Among the first of such studies, we present our experiences in using mathematical optimization models that improved the workforce allocation at a premier UK-based heritage railway company: Swanage Railways. Our collaboratively developed optimization models show four hours of reduction in weekly overtime for some employees during emergencies. If volunteers are efficiently integrated into the workforce, we find a reduction in overall workload by 26.7% for some of the existing employees. Finally, our models present a potential to reduce staffing costs by up to 35% if an hourly wage system is used instead of a fixed salary system. History: This paper was refereed.},

  abstract = {Collaborations between researchers and businesses can significantly benefit both parties. However, it can be challenging for researchers to form lasting ties with businesses. The challenge is particularly salient for early career researchers who have yet to build track records and for new technology ventures that must carefully allocate their scarce resources. Our purpose is to articulate the benefits and key success factors of such researcher-venture collaborations. We do so with a case study of a now-prominent European crowdinvesting platform with which we have collaborated since its nascence. Our collaboration yielded significant impact for academia by advancing scholarly knowledge and for the venture through both concrete and intangible benefits. In addition to data and insight, the collaboration also introduced new practices in the venture’s data-driven decision making. Building on our experiences and interviews with key managers, we propose seven key success factors for mutually beneficial researcher-venture collaborations: pursuing collaborations proactively, cultivating agility, being physically present, respecting business priorities, communicating results promptly, translating research to business language, and leveraging institutional backing. We offer practical guidance for early career researchers on how to build successful collaborations with technology ventures. The study provides insights for ventures into the benefits of collaborating with researchers. History: This paper was refereed.

  abstract = {Operating rooms (ORs) are some of the most expensive and critical resources for hospitals, and therefore OR access and utilization are of high importance. We developed a unique method to overbook surgeon blocks: assigning more OR block time than we have OR capacity available, to improve OR access. The challenge lies in managing the process of overbooking and ensuring fairness so that no one surgeon is more affected by overbooking compared with others. Using mixed-integer quadratic programming, we enable block overbooking while applying a consistent definition of fairness. This effort was implemented into routine operations through our simplified process, and it was deployed as a web tool for the surgical staff to manage and communicate decisions. Overbooking blocks contributed an additional 2% and 3.5% to OR utilization at the two campuses where it was deployed. This work enables surgeons, scheduling managers, and surgical leadership to manage operating room use beyond physical capacity, reliably and optimally. History: This paper was refereed.},

  abstract = {This tutorial addresses the challenge of incorporating large language models, such as ChatGPT, in a data analytics class. It details several new in-class and out-of-class teaching techniques enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Here are three examples. Instructors can parallelize instruction by having students interact with different custom-made GPTs to learn different parts of an analysis and then teach each other what they learned from their GPTs. Instructors can turn problem sets into AI tutoring sessions: a custom-made GPT guides a student through the problems and the student uploads the chatlog for their homework submission. Instructors can assign different labs to each section of a class and have each section create AI assistants to help the other sections work through their labs. This tutorial advocates the natural language programming (NLP) paradigm, in which students articulate desired data transformations with a spoken language, such as English, and then use AI to generate the corresponding computer code. Students can wrangle data more effectively with NLP than with Excel. History: This paper was refereed.},

  abstract = {Rehabilitation care consists of a wide variety of treatments organized in appointment series for individual and group therapy. Blueprint scheduling is a tactical approach to support appointment booking at the operational level. A blueprint schedule prescribes both the timing of group therapy sessions and the allocation of therapist and treatment room capacity to these sessions and thus defines which appointment types can be booked on which time slots. It facilitates providing treatment at the right time, by the right therapist(s), at a suitable location, and with a therapy load equally spread over day and week. This paper presents a structured generic approach for tactical capacity planning in multidisciplinary rehabilitation care. The generic approach includes optimization of a blueprint schedule using mixed-integer linear programming that was integrated in a decision support tool. We applied our approach in the rehabilitation center of Sint Maartenskliniek in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. The resulting blueprint schedule enables Sint Maartenskliniek to meet demand for rehabilitation care at the right time, by the right therapist(s), and at a suitable location while spreading the therapy load. Our approach can be applied in similar multidisciplinary care settings, potentially improving quality of care, quality of labor, and costs of care. History: This paper was refereed.

  abstract = {Previous research describes 10 contextual complications that exist in the application of applying analytical models and how they impact the models and modeling approaches themselves. These complications are pervasive and, because they affect the constructs of the modeler, must be better understood by practitioners who implement such models and researchers in order to increase the robustness, appropriateness, and usefulness of the models themselves. This research surveys the extent of the presence of these factors and the extent to which they affected modeling efforts in 76 different published applications via an author survey. It finds that the factors are pervasive and their importance to the appropriateness and success of the modeling efforts is high. Further, it finds a strong interaction factor between them, with underlying business and project constructs on which the factors align. As a result, it seems that a line of research geared toward identifying and overcoming these factors would aid in the application of analytical models and demonstrate the applied value of the profession. For practitioners, it is of high value to be aware of and consider these contextual factors when implementing models in order to improve their probability of success.
