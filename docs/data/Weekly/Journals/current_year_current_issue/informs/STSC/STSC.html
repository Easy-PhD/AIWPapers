  abstract     = {Reference points form an essential element of organizations’ problemistic search and adaptation behavior. Yet, if search is triggered by shortfalls compared with peers but alternatives are discovered on the fly, it is not clear whether and when peer comparison leads to better search outcomes. We contribute to the literature by studying how reference points guide search and which outcomes they allow organizations to achieve. Specifically, we develop a model of search in complex landscapes in which agents’ search behavior is guided by an upper (aspiration-level) social reference point and a lower (survival-point) social reference point. In our model, agents move across a subjective “terraced” landscape that is a simplified transformation of the “real” one. The vertical positions and shapes of these terraces are determined by the agents’ reference points and change over time as a result of their own and their peers’ performance evolution. In turn, these terraces define the search space that is navigated and the outcomes that can be reached. We show that the upper and lower bounds play fundamentally different roles in the search process, with the upper bound being more important in the short run and the lower bound more important in the long run. Studying heterogeneous populations, we find that reference points drive dynamic trade-offs between how easily decision makers can reach their aspiration level and how much they benefit from doing so. We highlight the importance of both internal fit between reference points and external fit with environmental factors.

  abstract     = {We introduce a newly available data set containing U.S. copyright records for 1978–2021. The data include nearly 19 million copyright registrations, as well as more than 12 million records of copyright renewals, terminations of granted rights, rights transfers, and other activities. The data include both raw and processed files, along with code books, documentation, and our data processing scripts; we provide tips and guidelines for using these data. We facilitate further research by linking copyright registration records with firm identifiers in Compustat as well as U.S. federal litigation data. We then use the data for three descriptive exercises. First, we characterize the relative usage of patenting and copyright protection across firms and industries. Second, we document the propensities for firms registering copyrights to be involved in copyright litigation. Third, we compare actual data on the incidence of copyright and patent registration with commonly used proxies: advertising and research and development expenditure. We hope that the availability of these data can facilitate progress on copyright research to parallel the broader intellectual property literature that has blossomed since patent data became widely available.

  abstract     = {We build upon theories and studies regarding inventors and strategic leadership to explain how inventor CEOs are likely to drive a firm’s strategic change. We explain why inventor CEOs have the unique attributes of divergent thinking and intrinsic motivation and, accordingly, pursue strategies that deviate from the past. We further suggest that the positive relationship between inventor CEO status and strategic change is strengthened by CEO liberalism, CEO career variety, and industry dynamism. Using a comprehensive longitudinal database of S&P 1500 firms, we test our theoretical predictions and find empirical support for most of our hypotheses except for the moderating effect of industry dynamism. In highlighting the prevalence of inventor CEOs and showing how this achievement-based experience of CEOs is related to strategic change, our study identifies an important and novel antecedent of this important strategic outcome.

  abstract     = {I argue that early residents of a U.S. state have left imprints in the state constitution to reflect their religious preferences. Such imprints help explain the varying constitutions across U.S. states, which in turn affect the present-day female representation in corporate leadership. Analyzing a firm-level data set supplemented by a state-level sample and extensive robustness checks, I find that the prevalence of Protestantism at the time of a U.S. state’s admission to the Union is positively related to female representation in the leadership teams of S&P 1500 firms. One mechanism for the persistence of the Protestant imprinting is state constitutions’ emphasis on equality issues. In addition, the historical Catholic immigration to different states, serving as a counter-imprinting force, has weakened this effect. My study contributes to imprinting theory by considering dynamics and developing a regional-level institutional imprinting perspective. I also contribute to a more nuanced understanding of historical antecedents and contemporary firm consequences of subnational institutions, tracing the persistent heterogeneities among firms to some deep historical roots.},

  abstract     = {Much research has examined whether family firms led by family or professional CEOs differ in terms of financial performance. Yet, whether family CEOs promote or hinder innovation remains an open question. Given the importance of innovation as well as the ubiquity of family enterprises, this is a major gap. In this study, we focus on a large sample of Danish firms and examine the patenting performance (in terms of patent counts and citations) of these firms. We exploit the gender of departing CEOs’ first-born children to yield exogenous variations in the decision to appoint a family or professional CEO. Our difference-in-differences results indicate that appointing a family CEO leads to an increase in patent counts and citations relative to appointing a professional CEO. These effects are driven by incoming family CEOs who hold a university degree in engineering and, to a lesser extent, business. Appointing a family CEO also leads to fewer job terminations, which suggests that the increase in patenting might stem from higher job stability and tolerance for failure among employees. Our study has implications for the growing literature on the management of family firms and, more broadly, for strategy research on CEO succession.
