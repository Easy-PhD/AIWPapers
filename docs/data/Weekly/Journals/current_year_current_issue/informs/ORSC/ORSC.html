  abstract     = {This research examines the impact of contract framing on supplier learning activities within buyer-supplier relationships, an area previously overshadowed by a focus on internal organizational learning mechanisms. Grounded in regulatory focus theory and organizational learning theory, this study assesses how promotion and prevention contract framing influences suppliers’ exploration and exploitation activities. Survey data from 135 buyer-supplier relationship dyads reveals that promotion and prevention framing distinctly affect suppliers’ learning activities. Specifically, during the duration of the contract, (a) compared with prevention contract framing, promotion contract framing has a stronger positive impact on the supplier’s exploration learning activities; and (b) compared with promotion contract framing, prevention contract framing has a stronger negative impact on the supplier’s exploitation learning activities. This study also reveals how the portfolios and clusters of contract framing influence supplier learning activities. Finally, this study reveals that different learning activities result in varied outcomes for the buyer, with exploration boosting continuity and exploitation improving performance. This contribution broadens the understanding of contract framing’s psychological effects on supplier behavior, offering new insights into the dynamics of organizational learning activities and contract design.

  abstract     = {How do firms overcome the challenge of absorbing distant knowledge? Scholars argue that organizations need knowledge that is distant from their existing knowledge base to create novel innovative output, whereas others argue, in contrast, that organizations need knowledge to be similar to the firm’s knowledge base in order to absorb it. We argue that organizations can improve their ability to identify and comprehend knowledge from a distant knowledge category through learning associations made by a category link—a familiar tangible component previously used by somebody else in the distant knowledge category. We test our arguments using a sample of patents in which the material graphene is used as a component across diverse patent classes (i.e., knowledge categories). We find that increasing experience with category-linking graphene enables an organization to patent in increasingly distant graphene-linked patent classes and also increases the number of patents in such classes. We also find that the extent to which category-linking graphene is prominent in a distant knowledge category enhances the effect of graphene experience on a firm’s ability to absorb knowledge from the distant knowledge category. We, thus, present a novel internal mechanism by which an organization can absorb distant knowledge.},

  abstract     = {As the world of work continues to evolve, employees are increasingly seeking to do more than manage the bifurcated domains of work and home. Instead, amid greater demands at work alongside greater valuation of leisure, employees are striving to thrive at work without sacrificing their free time. To explore this tension, we adopt an agentic, blended, and future-oriented perspective of the work-nonwork interface and examine leisure-work synergizing as a unique practice for employees to find synergies between leisure and work. Drawing on foundational theorizing on workplace thriving, we theorize that strategically integrating work into leisure activities in an attempt to build work-relevant competencies can inspire (via self-assurance) and hinder (via fatigue) employee thriving at work. To test these predictions, we first conducted a series of validation studies to demonstrate the conceptual relationship among leisure-work synergizing and other work and nonwork constructs. Then, using an experience sampling design, we generally found support for the bolstering effects of leisure-work synergizing on thriving through self-assurance. Moreover, segmentation preference—a theoretical moderator related to this unique boundary blurring practice—significantly influenced the proposed relationship between leisure-work synergizing and fatigue. Taken together, our research expands our understanding of the work-nonwork interface and the utility of leisure activities for working adults, integrates work-nonwork research with positive psychology to reveal nonwork agents of thriving, and highlights a novel blended practice to help scholars and managers better understand how employees can “have their cake and eat it too.” Funding: This work was supported by Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia.},

To do so, we link data on 160,065 U.S. startups from Crunchbase to their activities on the open source software development platform GitHub. In a matched sample of firms with and without GitHub activities, difference-in-differences models reveal a substantial increase in the likelihood of being funded after early stage startups engage with open source communities on GitHub. This relationship is weaker for firms that employ GitHub for internal development only. Startups developing novel technologies tend to benefit more from engaging with open source communities, unlike those in highly competitive environments. This heterogeneity highlights a potential trade-off between engaging with open source communities and appropriability. To provide insight regarding mechanisms, we classify startups’ technology use-cases on GitHub using machine learning and exploit data on product launches. Our results from these additional analyses support the notion that one important channel potentially driving our findings is the access to external knowledge for technology development provided by open source communities. Engaging with these communities may thereby aid startups in innovating and creating a (minimum) viable product. Funding: A. Conti and C.

  abstract     = {Empirical laws and regularities, such as Klepper’s shakeout pattern for industry evolution or Gibrat’s law for firm size, have shaped our understanding of organizations. Despite decades of research into profit patterns, no such widely applicable empirical regularities have been found for the “dependent variable of strategy”: long-term value capture. This study reports the discovery of a simple law governing this variable’s distribution. A four-parameter normal log-normal (NLN) mixture distribution very well fits observed data of listed firms’ 20-year long-term profit (LTP). The distribution correctly describes, for instance, a remarkable asymmetry in value capture: fewer than 1% of all firms in the data set generated 73% of the total LTP. Though the NLN law applies across different industries, geographies, and time periods, its distributional parameters vary. These parameters provide a novel and precise description of differences across settings in economic outcomes, such as the rise of “superstars.” More broadly, the law’s discovery raises profound questions relating to competitive strategy, evolutionary path dependence, the structure of technological opportunity, and social inequality.

  abstract     = {Organizations and the decision makers within them are increasingly subject to inconsistent performance feedback—feedback that contains elements that are incompatible with each other—which can lead to multiple interpretations of performance feedback. When this occurs, decision makers often recode inconsistent performance feedback as successful and continue with their current strategies, which allows them to avoid any self-threat from negative elements of performance feedback but implies that they do not learn from inconsistent performance feedback because they do not change. In contrast, we explore whether decision makers can learn from inconsistent performance feedback. Leveraging over 10 years of complete behavioral records in an online community and a laboratory experiment, we study how decision makers respond to inconsistent performance feedback stemming from multiple evaluators who do not agree on performance quality. Consistent with prior work, we find that decision makers change their strategies less after inconsistent performance feedback. Departing from prior work, we show a corresponding increase in clarification efforts aimed at better understanding which performance strategies work well. Importantly, clarification efforts mediate improved future performance. Our results suggest that inconsistent performance feedback can trigger deeper learning and enhanced performance, contributing to performance feedback theory and research on the microfoundations of organizational learning.

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing contests allow firms to seek ideas from external solvers to address their problems. This research examines solvers’ use of developmental feedback from different sources and of different constructiveness when generating ideas in contests. I theorize a source effect in solvers’ feedback use where they use seeker feedback more than peer feedback, even if both give identical suggestions for their ideas. I also show how the source effect affects solvers’ use of constructive and less constructive feedback from the respective sources. An insight is that compared with their use of peer feedback, solvers’ use of seeker feedback is more extensive at any level of, but less sensitive to, feedback constructiveness. An implication is that solvers may underuse constructive peer feedback and overuse less constructive seeker feedback. Such behaviors can be solver optimal (in terms of improving solvers’ winning prospects) but not seeker optimal (in terms of enhancing ideas for seekers’ problems), as constructive feedback is likely to improve idea quality, whereas less constructive feedback may hurt it. I propose a priming intervention of a feedback evaluation mechanism to mitigate the source effect in solvers’ feedback use—in a way, the intervention can cause solvers to behave more optimally for the seekers. A field survey and three online experiments test the theorizing and proposed intervention. I discuss the contributions and implications of this research for various stakeholders in crowdsourcing contests.

  abstract     = {It is widely believed that university and corporate research are complementary: companies invest in research in part to develop the capacity to absorb the knowledge emerging from universities. However, as we show in this paper, corporate research in the United States emerged when American universities were behind the world frontier in scientific research. Why, then, did for-profit businesses choose to invest in creating new knowledge, much of which could spill over to rivals, and whose conduct presented many managerial challenges? We argue that corporate research in America arose in the 1920s to compensate for weak university research, not to complement it. Using newly assembled firm-level data from the 1920s and 1930s, we find that companies invested in research because inventions increasingly relied on science but American universities were unable to meet their needs. Large firms close to the technological frontier and operating in concentrated industries were likely to invest in research, especially in scientific disciplines where American universities lagged behind the scientific frontier. Corporate science seems to have paid off, resulting in novel patents and high market valuations for firms engaged in research. Funding: A. Arora, S. Belenzon, and J.

  abstract     = {High-potential programs offer a swift path up the corporate ladder for those who secure a place on them. However, the evaluation of “potential” occurs under considerable uncertainty, creating fertile ground for gender bias. We document that men are more likely than women to be designated as high potential, and unpack how gendered responses to employees’ expressions of passion—one of the most commonly used criteria used in evaluating potential—both penalize women and advantage men in high-potential selection processes. First, and based on prior research on gender display rules, we suggest that expressions of passion are viewed as a less appropriate emotional display for women than men, giving rise to a female penalty. Second, and drawing on shifting standards theorizing, we posit that expressions of passion shift evaluators’ predictions of candidates’ diligence more meaningfully for men than women, creating a male advantage—particularly for men who are reasonably high but not exceptional performers. We provide supporting evidence across two studies examining placement into high-potential programs in a real talent review setting ( N = 796) and a preregistered experiment that uses videos featuring trained actors ( N = 1,366), supported by two supplementary studies ( N = 1,590). Taken together, this work sheds light on the ways the increasing emphasis on passion in contemporary workplaces may exacerbate gender inequalities. Progressing our understanding of gender bias beyond gendered reactions to criteria that penalize women (i.e., backlash), our work also unveils a novel and particularly pernicious form of gender bias driven by gendered inferences about passion that advantage men.

  abstract     = {In response to persistent gender inequality in corporate leadership, many countries have implemented board gender diversity reforms, either through legislation or by revising governance codes for board appointments. Whereas these reforms aim to enhance women’s representation and influence in leadership roles, their effects on corporate outcomes, such as innovation, remain unclear. This study develops a two-mechanism institutional contingency model to investigate how board gender diversity reforms affect firm innovation through representation and empowerment mechanisms. Using a unique hand-collected data set on worldwide board gender diversity reforms and a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design, we find that these reforms significantly improve innovation outcomes, with the empowerment mechanism having a stronger positive effect than the representation mechanism. Additionally, we show that rule-based reforms, although they are effective at increasing female board representation, often lead to symbolic compliance and tokenism, which limits their ability to enhance innovation. In contrast, comply-or-explain reforms, which emphasize empowerment and genuine engagement, yield more meaningful progress in firm innovation. Our findings also reveal that countries with higher prereform gender disparities and a larger pool of qualified female directors experience greater innovation gains following the implementation of these reforms. By distinguishing between the effects of representation and empowerment, this study provides a nuanced understanding of how gender diversity regulations can serve as catalysts for innovation and offers valuable insights for policymakers designing reforms to promote gender equality and economic outcomes.

To shed light on this issue, we focus on the revealing case of the U.S. tobacco industry between 1980 and 2016. Combining structural topic modeling and discourse analysis to explore the extensive media discussions surrounding the industry, we find that stigmatization unfolds through three phases. These were each characterized by discursive struggles, which resulted in contested stigma extensions about establishing harm (1980–1992), assigning responsibility (1993–2010), and creating new norms (2011–2016). We develop a process model highlighting three key mechanisms in stigmatization processes: attention , which shifts focus to new issues and discussions; stigma construction work , where the stigmatizers use discursive strategies to establish stigma; and resistance work , where targets use discursive strategies to slow down stigmatization. The interplay of these mechanisms reveals that stigmatization is neither linear nor complete but characterized by partial and contested stigma extensions . While acknowledging the limitations of our case, our study advances research by showing how industry stigmatization persists even when challenged, opening new avenues for future research in related settings.

The personal and professional resources required for navigating relationships with dissimilar work colleagues can be particularly costly for those in minority groups who are most often different from their relational partners. Drawing from interviews conducted with Black women executives, we examined how these women experience relational triggers that emphasize their differences from others because of their limited numbers at their level. Our findings indicate that Black women executives respond to these relational triggers by engaging in perspective-taking and status reflexivity to understand others’, and their own, perspectives on the identity and status differentials present in the interaction. Through an introspective process, these women assess and address gaps in how they believe their partners see them and how they see themselves, which prompts them to either reduce or maintain perceived gaps depending on the importance of the interaction partner. We also explore how reducing or maintaining the perceived gap ultimately influences how Black women think, feel, or behave toward their relational partner (i.e., relational valence) in ways that may shape how they interpret future interactions. This study advances workplace relationships research by integrating intersectionality literature and by considering how minority perspective-taking and status reflexivity can be useful in navigating relationships across difference.},

  abstract     = {A growing body of literature has sought to understand the strategic drivers of corporate activism, emphasizing the ideological composition of a firm’s workforce as its salient internal driver. Despite these advancements, however, the heterogeneity in its effect remains underexplored, leaving it unclear when employee ideology is more likely to translate into activism. I address this gap by considering competitors’ actions—another important driver uncovered in the scholarship—as a key source of heterogeneity. I examine how these actions can shape the external context in which a firm’s employees evaluate the value of its activism, thereby influencing the firm’s incentives to act on employees’ preferences. My central conjecture is that activism by so-called ideological opponents of a firm’s employee base will be a particularly strong driver of its own activism. This is because actions taken by competitors who hold stances opposite to those valued by a firm’s employees can create a temporal window during which the firm can gain enough employee appreciation for its activism—particularly counter-activism opposing the stance of the competitor. Leveraging the donation records of corporate foundations to advocacy nonprofits as a novel channel for studying corporate activism, I find support for this conjecture. Consistent with my theory, I further find that this effect is driven by firms whose employees hold homogeneous ideological preferences and arises primarily around issues with strong ideological contention.

  abstract     = {Scholarship regarding occupational gender segregation has almost exclusively focused on women’s experiences (e.g., as targets of discrimination in masculine domains), yet understanding factors that perpetuate men’s underrepresentation in traditionally feminine occupations is equally important. We examine a consequential dynamic early in the job search process in which individuals come to learn that an occupation that fits them is perceived as feminine versus masculine. Our research develops and tests the prediction that femininity or masculinity of occupations will exert a stronger impact on men’s (versus women’s) interest in them such that men will be less interested in gender-atypical occupations than women. Across five studies ( n = 4,477), we consistently observed robust evidence for this prediction among diverse samples, including high school students (Study 1), unemployed job seekers (Study 2), U.S. adults (Study 3), and undergraduates (Study 4) and using experimental and archival methods. We observed this asymmetry after controlling for alternative accounts related to economic factors (e.g., expected salary), suggesting that they alone cannot fully explain men’s lack of interest in feminine occupations as previously discussed in the literature. Further, we consistently observed that men, compared with women, show heightened sensitivity to gender-based occupational status, and this greater sensitivity explains men’s (versus women’s) reduced interest in gender-atypical occupations. Though past scholarship suggests that increasing pay is key to stoking men’s interest in feminine occupations, our research suggests that targeting men’s underlying psychological concern—sensitivity to gender-based occupational status—may be an underappreciated pathway to reducing gender segregation.

  abstract     = {This study explores how organizations, together with their customers, solve problems in the face of disruptions, a process I call “participatory improvisation.” Drawing on interviews, ethnographic observations, and archival data collected from an underground restaurant, Secret Kitchen, and the theory of interaction order, I develop a process model of participatory improvisation with a two-part structure. First, I find that an organization must lay the foundation for participatory improvisation by establishing alternative conventions (e.g., expect and embrace the unexpected). Second, these conventions facilitate mutual face work by both the organization and customers in response to disruptions, thereby protecting interactions from breakdowns. When alternative conventions are not established, participatory improvisation may be ineffective, and interactions may be severely threatened. These findings contribute to the literature on organizational improvisation by uncovering how organizations can foster participatory improvisation and how it unfolds in situ. They also reveal an alternate way for customer-facing organizations to achieve their goals beyond routinization.

  abstract     = {We develop a unified framework to examine the implications of two primary approaches to strategic decision making under uncertainty: designing and shaping future scenarios vis-à-vis testing theories about future scenarios. We conducted a three-arm randomized controlled trial involving 308 early stage entrepreneurs, dividing them into three groups—design-based training, theory-based training, and a control group—and tracked them over approximately 1.5 years. Our findings reveal that both approaches reduce the need for information in decision making and lead to higher commitment rates. The design-based approach encourages action despite negative beliefs, resulting in less frequent and later project termination. In contrast, the theory-based approach promotes a more conservative termination rule, leading to earlier and more frequent project abandonment. Although the theory-based approach is associated with higher average performance upon survival, the design-based approach fosters breakthroughs for decision makers. In sum, the design-based approach is well-suited for innovative ventures that gather information to shape their environment, whereas the theory-based approach is optimal for pursuing high performance under lower degrees of uncertainty.

  abstract     = {One of the most important features on which to judge the merit of any academic paper is the strength of its theory. Although commentary about what constitutes strong theory is widespread, there is no holistic account of the full range of existing perspectives. To address this oversight, I construct a typology composed of six dimensions of strong theory: importance, interestingness, actionability, generality, simplicity, and accuracy. This typology provides a lens to examine a vexing problem: the effort to increase the strength of a theory on one dimension will usually compromise its strength on others. Despite this reality, authors experience pressure in the review process to optimize theories on all six dimensions. I explain how the expectation to build theories that cannot possibly be built (what I call the fruitless search for unicorn theories) is driven by historical forces. The study of organizations emerged not from one source but from a half-dozen distinct traditions, including applied scientists who study time-sensitive problems, disciplinary scholars who identify universal laws of human behavior, and empiricists who prefer a tight link between concepts and measures. Review teams are often composed of referees who hail from different traditions and possess divergent views on theory. Even when each reviewer has concerns that are reasonable in isolation, authors often confront unrealistic expectations when reviewers’ preferences are aggregated. To mitigate this problem, I recommend that authors, reviewers, and editors (1) prioritize fewer dimensions in any single theory and (2) emphasize distinct dimensions in different theories on the same topic.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the impact that social movements have on firm innovation through private politics. We argue that firms strategically respond to private politics by investing in new technologies that address movement-advocated issues material to firms’ performance. Although both contentious private politics—when activists contentiously target firms—and cooperative private politics—when activists and firms collaborate—catalyze innovation, they do so in different ways. Contentious private politics increases the amount of innovation that firms undertake by drawing managerial attention to movement-advocated issues material to the firm, prompting search for solutions to those issues. Conversely, cooperative private politics provides firms access to new knowledge that encourages firms to search for solutions in areas more distant from their existing knowledge and in so doing, increase innovation involving distant recombination on material issues. We find support for our arguments in a matched sample of firms contentiously targeted and with activist collaborations on climate change issues and firms that were not targets of private politics on those issues but had otherwise similar histories of climate-related innovation and relationships with climate movements and other environmental movements. Supplementary analyses corroborate the mechanisms that undergird our theoretical predictions; contentious private politics is associated with more innovation closer to a firm’s expertise, whereas cooperative private politics is associated with innovations that draw on more distant knowledge. We also find that when collaboration follows contention, their respective impacts on innovation are reduced, which may result from firms seeking collaborations for their legitimacy-granting benefits after contention rather than the learning opportunities they offer.
