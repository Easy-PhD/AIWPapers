  abstract     = {In the freight transport spot market, carriers face several challenges, including handling small-sized loads, managing short lead times, and dealing with uncertainties that can disrupt their existing networks and capacity. In this context, auction platforms assist carriers in developing strategies to maintain productivity and service levels. This paper introduces the freight transportation game, an online auction-based platform specifically designed for the freight spot market. The game equips players, acting as carriers, with tools to develop transportation strategies, optimize routes, and propose competitive rates to maximize profits. Players engage in decision making and competition, with key performance indicators evaluating their decisions. The game includes two scenarios; the first helps students understand the operational challenges that carriers face in spot market auctions, whereas the second encourages cooperation to enhance performance and overcome obstacles. Designed for a three-hour session, the game can be integrated into courses on supply chain management or transportation systems. The practical learnings for students from the game include understanding the complexity of constructing transport plans, recognizing the challenges of using online auction-based platforms, and experiencing the difficulties of managing spot market requests despite their benefits.

  abstract     = {In view of the long wait times for women and the lack of accessibility for LGBTQ+ individuals when they use restrooms, this case provides a set of analytical tools to evaluate wait time disparity among users for different restroom configurations. A stadium manager who faces complaints about excessive restroom wait times aims to retrofit the restroom layout to improve both efficiency, measured in terms of wait time, and fairness, measured in terms of totalitarian and Rawlsian scores. Given that customers have diverse preferences over the use of restroom types, in three modules, students learn to (i) evaluate queuing parameters for a mix of heterogeneous populations, (ii) evaluate queuing metrics for various restroom layouts and discuss their wait time disparities, and (iii) evaluate and discuss the fairness of access to restroom facilities from a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) perspective. By completing this case, students gain an understanding of service systems, learn about process flexibility concepts, and become familiar with DEI concepts and measures. The primary objectives of the case for students are to understand the trade-offs between efficiency and fairness, develop an understanding of multiobjective problems, and improve their skills in employing queuing concepts and tools.

  abstract     = {The article presents a case exercise that teaches students how to apply mathematical programming to a real-life context. The case deals with the management of the food donation supply chain. The case, using a project-based approach, proposes a realistic scenario that simulates the consulting interaction with a nonprofit company, Logica&Co, which acts as a two-sided platform connecting supply and demand. The objective is to define an effective strategy to collect and deliver food donations, using either bike or e-bike, from local businesses to soup kitchens, covering a semester-long timeframe. The form of the problem exhibits nonlinear characteristics, but the design allows for adjustable difficulty levels. Students can assess their performance during the class period thanks to an interactive offline tool, the SoS simulator , which is publicly available for download and can be customized by instructors. The case was proposed as a competitive group challenge for students of the bachelor’s or master’s program in management engineering at Sapienza University of Rome. However, given the embedded characteristics of flexibility, it can be easily adjusted for heterogeneous curricula of undergraduate- and graduate-level courses in engineering programs (this opportunity is extensively discussed in the Case Article and the Teaching Note). The students appreciated both the teaching methodology and the teamwork aspects and highlighted the utility of the SoS simulator tool.

  abstract     = {Social justice considerations are critical in today’s engineering education. As an example, access to electricity will be crucial to the development of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by powering essential sectors and services that would yield economic growth and an improved quality of life. Because infrastructure investments are often allocated to urban areas, it is important for stakeholders to equally prioritize rural electrification in their efforts to achieve universal electrification. These stakeholders make decisions on allocating infrastructure investment based on their underlying values and preferences. It is therefore important to introduce and integrate ideas of fairness and social justice into the engineering curriculum. Our paper investigates the influence of social justice education on decision preferences among students tasked with planning electricity systems. We engaged graduate and undergraduate students in a discrete choice experiment to determine their preferences for equality. In our study, we find that an interactive social justice education module can be effective in increasing equality preferences among non–U.S.-citizen students by 22%. Among students with relatively low preferences for equality, we find that the education module was effective in increasing preference by 18% on average and up to 191%, which translated into more equitable resource allocation. As such, we show that an education intervention for stakeholders may be effective in improving equitable electrification in SSA. The preference elicitation and education module presented in this paper could be repurposed by instructors to include other contexts in their course content (e.g., money, water, housing, etc.) or to people wanting to educate decision makers about social justice.

By incorporating a commitment to iteration and communication as the core of the project experience, Agile with Scrum fosters an impactful, realistic, and engaging student consulting experience. This approach enhances decision making, presentations, and team dynamics. This article discusses how one supply chain management course embedded Agile with Scrum into a client consulting project to convert a mediocre experiential learning opportunity into a transformative one.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we finish describing the project and the experimentation of Ricerca Operativa Applicazioni Reali (ROAR; in English, Real Applications of Operations Research), a three-year project for higher secondary schools. ROAR is composed of three teaching units addressed to grades 10, 11, and 12, respectively. To improve students’ interest, motivation, and skills related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines, ROAR integrates the teaching of mathematics and computer science through operations research. Its implementation started in 2021 in a grade 10 class at the scientific high school IIS Antonietti in Iseo (Brescia, Italy). We provided the details of the first two units in previous papers. Here, we focus on the third and last unit, carried out from October 2022 to January 2023, with the same students, then in a grade 12 class. Similarly to the first two units, we describe objectives, prerequisites, topics and methods, the organization of the lectures, digital technologies used, and a challenging final project that, this time, involved the manufacturer company Filtrec S.p.A. with a case. After analyzing the feedback from students, teachers, and practitioners engaged in the experimentation, we reflect on the entire experimentation and provide some insights to replicate a similar experience.

  abstract     = {This case asks students to solve a multiobjective optimization decision problem applied to school district zoning. In the case, residential areas in a school district must be assigned to middle schools having capacity limits. The operational considerations on the decision are the weighted distances traveled between students’ residences and their assigned middle school campuses. The ethical considerations pertain to equity in education and are measured using the numbers of economically disadvantaged students assigned to each middle school. This problem, including its two objectives, is motivated by a real zoning problem faced by a school district. Publicly available data from the school district and its rezoning efforts are used to populate the case. To complete the case, students model and solve an optimization problem both with and without the ethical considerations included. In doing so, they observe how ethical considerations can change the outputs generated by the optimization model. Evidence is provided from student surveys to indicate how completion of the case impacts perceptions of the importance of and understanding of how to include ethical considerations in optimization modeling. Results indicate statistically significant increases in those perceptions.
