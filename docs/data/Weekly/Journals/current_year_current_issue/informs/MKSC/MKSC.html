  abstract     = {When gathering information to make decisions, individuals often have to delay making a decision because the process of gathering information is interrupted, and the individual is not yet ready to make a decision. The paper considers a model of choice deferral based on time-varying search costs, potentially based on search fatigue, in which individuals have to strategically decide whether to defer choice when information gathering is interrupted, taking into account the current available information, and when they will be able to resume gathering information. We find that individuals are more likely to defer choice when information gathering is interrupted less frequently, when individuals can resume gathering information sooner, and when they discount the future less. We also consider the case in which individuals incur costs of restarting a process of information gathering and cases in which the individual has greater or less information about the extent of search fatigue. The paper also considers optimal pricing, user interface design, and retargeting decisions, and it shows how they should respond to the length of consumer browsing sessions and gaps between browsing sessions. The paper illustrates the importance of modeling fatigue and interruptions in the search process. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {When multiple groups of consumers reside in the same market, we determine that we can write each group’s conditional choice probabilities (CCPs) as a function of unobserved consumer heterogeneity. Moreover, we can specify choice probabilities of one group as a function of another by shifting the unobserved component. Armed with our novel CCP estimator, we develop an approach to identify and estimate a dynamic discrete demand model for durable goods with nonrandom attrition of consumers and continuous unobserved consumer heterogeneity but without the usual need for value function approximation or reducing the dimension of state space by ad hoc behavioral assumptions. We illustrate the empirical value of our method by estimating consumer demand for electric vehicles (EVs) in the state of Washington during the period of 2016–2019. We also determine the impact of a different federal tax credit based on the electric range of a car rather than the size of the battery, which was the existing policy during the data period, and we evaluate how best to seed a nascent market that presents indirect network effects to drive faster adoption. Should the government incentivize adoption through consumer tax credits or through EV infrastructure? History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {As consumers become increasingly concerned about their privacy, firms can benefit from committing not to sell consumer data. However, the holdup problem prevents firms from doing so in a static setting. This paper studies whether reputation consideration of the firm can serve as a commitment device in a long-run game when consumers have imperfect monitoring technology. We find that a patient enough monopoly can commit because its reputation will suffer from a persistent punishment if consumers detect the data sale. In contrast, reputation may fail to serve as a commitment device when there are multiple firms. The penalty for selling data is temporary when consumers do not know exactly which firm sold the data. In addition, selling data imposes a negative externality on other firms, but each firm does not take it into account in equilibrium. We characterize conditions under which duopolistic firms lose the ability to commit even if they are arbitrarily patient. Reputation cannot serve as a commitment device under any conditions as the number of firms increases because each firm is penalized less for selling the data but not rewarded more for not doing so. Lastly, we explore several ways of restoring firms’ commitment power through regulation. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Short-form videos have taken over social media and attracted attention from advertisers. But doubts remain about the advertising efficacy on these platforms. In a large-scale randomized experiment on ByteDance, we show that advertising spillover plays a pivotal role in the advertising campaign. Most of the advertising effect comes from advertising spillover beyond ByteDance with exposed users being eight times more likely to convert from outside than from within ByteDance. When considering advertising spillover outside ByteDance, the average cost per conversion, which brands commonly use to evaluate the cost of campaigns, shrinks by 5 or 25 times, depending on the methods used to calculate it. Advertising spillover can also affect a brand’s targeting strategy. Whereas commonly used demographic variables by the automobile brand are effective for target marketing with only platform data, they are not when considering advertising spillover outside ByteDance. Instead, a behavioral variable proposed herein (prior brand home page visits) effectively moderates the advertising effect but has no impact when ignoring advertising spillover in the analysis. Our findings underscore the importance of information sharing between platforms and brands, which in practice is typically not the case. History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Retailers often use store flyers to communicate the availability, price, and promotions of their products. Many households inspect store flyers for promotions, and the majority still prefer to receive store flyers in print. Yet, many are said to throw out store flyers unread, creating excessive waste that is environmentally damaging because of the excess use of paper, ink, and logistics. Legislation to reduce the distribution and waste associated with unsolicited store flyers has been proposed, but if and how much such a cut in distribution would affect households’ grocery shopping behavior remain unclear. This paper investigates a recent policy change by seven Dutch municipalities that implemented a ban on unsolicited store flyers by moving from an opt-out policy to an opt-in policy at some point between 2018 and 2020. Using household scanner data, the authors assess changes in shopping behavior along nine comprehensive dimensions relevant to retailers, brand manufacturers, and policymakers using a stacked, synthetic difference-in-differences approach. Although store flyer distribution decreased by 50% under the new policy, the drastic change did not substantially affect grocery shopping behavior. These findings are robust to different time windows and modeling approaches. History: Puneet Manchanda served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Targeted marketing policies target different customers with different marketing actions. Although most research has focused on training targeting policies without managerial constraints, in practice, many firms face managerial constraints when implementing these policies. For example, firms may face volume constraints on the maximum or minimum number of actions they can take or on the minimum acceptable outcomes for different customer segments. They may also face similarity (fairness) constraints that require similar actions with different groups of customers. Traditional optimization methods face challenges when solving problems with either many customers or many constraints. We show how recent advances in linear programming can be adapted to the targeting of marketing actions. We provide a theoretical guarantee comparing how the proposed algorithm scales compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks (primal simplex, dual simplex, and barrier methods). We also extend existing guarantees on optimality and computation speed, by adapting them to accommodate the characteristics of targeting problems. We implement the proposed algorithm using data from a field experiment with over 2 million customers and six different marketing actions (including a no-action “Control”). We use this application to evaluate the computation speed and range of problems that the algorithm can solve, comparing it to benchmark methods. The findings confirm that the algorithm makes it feasible to train large-scale targeting problems that include volume and similarity constraints. History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {We study how a particular form of social ties (i.e., professional ties proxied by past employment) affects price and profitability in business-to-business (B2B) markets. Although most of the work on social ties focuses on information diffusion in business-to-consumer markets, we ask the following. Do B2B buyers receive higher or lower prices from sellers with whom they have professional ties? Can professional ties benefit both buyers and sellers and create win-win exchanges? Answering these questions is challenging because it is difficult to observe B2B prices, the individual decision makers (IDMs), and elements of differentiation that drive price variation. Moreover, potentially endogenous formation of social ties exacerbates the identification challenge. We resolve these challenges by leveraging proprietary data from the Federal Reserve on the repo market, the largest market for short-term loans with daily transactions of more than $2 trillion. In addition, we use financial disclosure laws to unmask IDMs at sellers and use LinkedIn to reveal their ties. We leverage exogenous movement of IDMs in and out of decision-making positions to identify the effect of professional ties on price. We show that a seller IDM, who is the buyer’s former employee, charges the buyer 1/4 basis points more than other buyers with no ties (i.e., 25 basis points relative to median price, or 13% of average cross-sectional price variance). The mechanism driving this price increase is “supply reliability.” Sellers with a professional tie to the buyer act more reliably toward that buyer during supply-demand imbalances. We perform several robustness checks, including leveraging the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to show that an exogenous increase in the aggregate cash supply diminishes the effect of professional ties, consistent with a supply reliability mechanism. Our work suggests professional ties can affect B2B prices beyond observable supply-demand dynamics and provide value for sellers and buyers. History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor.

An exploratory survey shows that many consumers desire sustainable products and are willing to pay more for them, but some consumers dislike sustainable products and want to pay less for them. Using a theoretical model where firms are horizontally differentiated and two groups of consumers have divergent preferences for sustainable products, we investigate the strategic implications of sustainable consumption. First, our analysis shows that when consumers’ dislike for sustainable products is moderate, the price could increase as the dislike increases. Moreover, price could decrease if consumers’ desire for sustainable products increases. Second, we find that competing firms’ profits can decrease with consumers’ desire for sustainability but increase with consumers’ dislike for sustainability. Third, we clarify when and why enforcing minimal sustainability standards for products can backfire and reduce consumer surplus. Finally, we extend the model to capture additional facets of sustainable consumption, such as multiproduct firms, sustainable luxury goods, and political orientation of consumers, and tease out its counterintuitive implications for the firms supplying sustainable products.

However, how an expert constructs a specific set of recommendations and how it subsequently affects consumer choices and outcomes have been understudied. We propose an empirical framework that econometrically recovers experts’ recommendations and combines them with heterogeneous consumers’ choice of products or services. We then apply the framework to examine kidney disease patients’ choice of dialysis facilities. Using detailed data on more than 16,900 U.S. patients with kidney disease who had consultations with over 750 physicians between 2015 and 2017, we study physicians’ dialysis facility recommendations and patients’ subsequent choice of facilities. We find that physicians are more likely to recommend facilities with which they are affiliated and those close to patients. Policy simulations suggest that quality information provision through five-star ratings has likely lowered mortality, thereby helping patients. In contrast, reducing conflicts of interest by banning the usage of affiliation as a basis for physicians’ facility recommendations can inadvertently hurt patients as evidenced by an increase in mortality. The study provides relevant consumer-centric insights into recent efforts to change market regulations and policies in this healthcare market. History: Puneet Manchanda served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Modern media firms require automated and efficient methods to identify content that is most engaging and appealing to users. Leveraging a large-scale data set from Upworthy (a news publisher), which includes 17,681 headline A/B tests, we first investigate the ability of three pure–large language model (LLM) approaches to identify the catchiest headline: prompt-based methods, embedding-based methods, and fine-tuned open-source LLMs. Prompt-based approaches perform poorly, while both OpenAI embedding–based models and the fine-tuned Llama-3-8B achieve marginally higher accuracy than random predictions. In sum, none of the pure LLM–based methods can predict the best-performing headline with high accuracy. We then introduce the LLM-assisted online learning algorithm (LOLA), a novel framework that integrates LLMs with adaptive experimentation to optimize content delivery. LOLA combines the best pure-LLM approach with the upper confidence bound algorithm to allocate traffic and maximize clicks adaptively. Our numerical experiments on Upworthy data show that LOLA outperforms the standard A/B test method (the current status quo at Upworthy), pure bandit algorithms, and pure-LLM approaches, particularly in scenarios with limited experimental traffic. Our approach is scalable and applicable to content experiments across various settings where firms seek to optimize user engagement, including digital advertising and social media recommendations.

  abstract     = {Mass shootings in the United States have become more frequent, often targeting retail locations such as shopping malls that attract high foot traffic. We combine detailed data on mass shootings with debit and credit card transaction data at individual stores to assess the economic impact of mass shootings. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we find that affected stores experience lower demand, smaller order sizes, decreased foot traffic, and reduced customer dwell times, resulting in a significant decline in retail revenues. We also find the impact of mass shootings diminishes with distance, adversely affecting stores within a radius of up to 1.25 miles. Additionally, we examine the likelihood of store closures after incidents and factors contributing to store survival. Overall, we estimate the annual economic cost of mass shootings at $27 billion in lost revenues to retail businesses. Consistent with consumers’ fear and safety concerns, we observe heterogeneous effects by business type (e.g., nonessential stores are more impacted than essential stores), channel substitution from in-person to online shopping, and moderation by local exposure to gun-related violence.

  abstract     = {As businesses increasingly rely on granular consumer data, the public has increasingly pushed for enhanced regulation to protect consumers’ privacy. We provide a perspective based on the academic marketing literature that evaluates the various benefits and costs of existing and pending government regulations and corporate privacy policies. We make four key points. First, data-based personalized marketing is not automatically harmful. Second, consumers have heterogeneous privacy preferences, and privacy policies may unintentionally favor the preferences of the rich. Third, privacy regulations may stifle innovation by entrepreneurs who are more likely to cater to underserved, niche consumer segments. Fourth, privacy measures may favor large companies who have less need for third-party data and can afford compliance costs. We also discuss technology platforms’ recent proposals for privacy solutions that mitigate some of these harms but, again, in a way that might disadvantage small firms and entrepreneurs.
