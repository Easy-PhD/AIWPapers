  abstract     = {Self-regulating hydrogels represent the next generation in the development of soft materials with active, adaptive, autonomous, and intelligent behavior inspired by sophisticated biological systems. Nature provides exemplary demonstrations of such self-regulating behaviors, including muscle tissue’s precise biochemical and mechanical feedback mechanisms, and coordinated cellular chemotaxis driven by dynamic biochemical signaling. Building upon these natural examples, self-regulating hydrogels are capable of spontaneously modulating their structural and functional states through integrated negative feedback loops. In this review, the key design principles and implementation strategies for self-regulating hydrogel actuators are comprehensively summarized. We first systematically classify self-regulating hydrogels into sustained regulation, involving continuous modulation cycles under constant stimuli and one-cycle regulation, characterized by transient transitions driven by specific chemical fuels. Thereafter, the underlying mechanisms, types of hydrogels used, fuels, oscillation periods, amplitudes, and potential applications are highlighted. Finally, current scientific challenges and future opportunities for enhancing the robustness, modularity, and practical applicability of self-regulating hydrogel actuators are discussed. This review aims to provide structured guidelines and inspire interdisciplinary research to further develop advanced hydrogel-based regulatory systems for applications such as soft robotics, autonomous sensors, responsive biomedical devices, and adaptive functional materials.},

  abstract     = {Tumor heterogeneity and complex morphologies pose significant challenges to achieving efficient therapeutic outcomes. However, the recent advent of remote-controlled transformable nanostructures has introduced a novel approach to cancer therapy, enabling precise size, shape, and phase changes in nanoparticles in response to external stimuli, such as light, ultrasound, and magnetic fields. These materials offer noninvasive strategies to effectively navigate the dynamic and complex morphologies of tumors, providing unprecedented control over therapeutic targeting and precision in patient-tailored treatments. The real-time modulation of nanomaterial structures optimizes interactions with the tumor microenvironment, improving circulation, endothelial permeation, deep tumor penetration, and subcellular targeting. This review discusses cutting-edge strategies to remotely control the morphology of nanomaterials, emphasizing their integration into modular cancer theranostic platforms. These systems are engineered to target cancer cell membrane receptors and cytoplasm, subcellular organelles, immune cells, and difficult-to-reach areas including the blood–brain barrier and deep-seated tumors. We also explore the potential of multimodal theranostics including dual-triggered, combinatorial, and synergistic therapies that combine therapeutic action with real-time imaging guidance. This review presents a clear and insightful roadmap, unveiling how these cutting-edge advancements open new horizons for adaptive, personalized therapies with exceptional potential to overcome the complexities of metastatic tumor treatment and advance clinical translation.},

Gel-based ionic circuits exploit the intrinsic characteristics of ions, such as their mass, diversity, and local accumulation, to achieve selectivity, hysteresis, and chemical-electric signal transduction. Their dynamic and nonlinear behaviors not only emulate traditional solid-state electronic systems but also exhibit unique functionalities and operating mechanisms extending beyond established electronic paradigms. In this review, we categorize gel-based ionic circuits into four major functional classes: passive circuit elements, active circuit elements, power sources, and noncircuit elements.

This review examines the roles of in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and neutron scattering (NS) in advancing our understanding of these processes. In situ TEM offers atomic-scale insights into nucleation, growth, and phase transitions, while NS provides an analysis of reaction pathways, phase evolution, and structural transformations over broader length scales. Recent advancements in hardware have greatly improved spatial, temporal, and environmental control in in situ experiments. TEM enables breakthroughs in thermally controlled synthesis, gas-phase deposition, and beam-induced fabrication, including single-atom device creation. NS, particularly in situ neutron diffraction and imaging, are essential for studying bulk-level synthesis pathways. Together, these techniques offer a multiscale view of synthesis and processing. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI), automated workflows, and multimodal characterization is highlighted as a path toward high-throughput, predictive synthesis.
