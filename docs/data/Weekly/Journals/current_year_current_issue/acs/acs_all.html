  abstract     = {Self-regulating hydrogels represent the next generation in the development of soft materials with active, adaptive, autonomous, and intelligent behavior inspired by sophisticated biological systems. Nature provides exemplary demonstrations of such self-regulating behaviors, including muscle tissue’s precise biochemical and mechanical feedback mechanisms, and coordinated cellular chemotaxis driven by dynamic biochemical signaling. Building upon these natural examples, self-regulating hydrogels are capable of spontaneously modulating their structural and functional states through integrated negative feedback loops. In this review, the key design principles and implementation strategies for self-regulating hydrogel actuators are comprehensively summarized. We first systematically classify self-regulating hydrogels into sustained regulation, involving continuous modulation cycles under constant stimuli and one-cycle regulation, characterized by transient transitions driven by specific chemical fuels. Thereafter, the underlying mechanisms, types of hydrogels used, fuels, oscillation periods, amplitudes, and potential applications are highlighted. Finally, current scientific challenges and future opportunities for enhancing the robustness, modularity, and practical applicability of self-regulating hydrogel actuators are discussed. This review aims to provide structured guidelines and inspire interdisciplinary research to further develop advanced hydrogel-based regulatory systems for applications such as soft robotics, autonomous sensors, responsive biomedical devices, and adaptive functional materials.},

  abstract     = {Tumor heterogeneity and complex morphologies pose significant challenges to achieving efficient therapeutic outcomes. However, the recent advent of remote-controlled transformable nanostructures has introduced a novel approach to cancer therapy, enabling precise size, shape, and phase changes in nanoparticles in response to external stimuli, such as light, ultrasound, and magnetic fields. These materials offer noninvasive strategies to effectively navigate the dynamic and complex morphologies of tumors, providing unprecedented control over therapeutic targeting and precision in patient-tailored treatments. The real-time modulation of nanomaterial structures optimizes interactions with the tumor microenvironment, improving circulation, endothelial permeation, deep tumor penetration, and subcellular targeting. This review discusses cutting-edge strategies to remotely control the morphology of nanomaterials, emphasizing their integration into modular cancer theranostic platforms. These systems are engineered to target cancer cell membrane receptors and cytoplasm, subcellular organelles, immune cells, and difficult-to-reach areas including the blood–brain barrier and deep-seated tumors. We also explore the potential of multimodal theranostics including dual-triggered, combinatorial, and synergistic therapies that combine therapeutic action with real-time imaging guidance. This review presents a clear and insightful roadmap, unveiling how these cutting-edge advancements open new horizons for adaptive, personalized therapies with exceptional potential to overcome the complexities of metastatic tumor treatment and advance clinical translation.},

Recent advancements in hardware have greatly improved spatial, temporal, and environmental control in in situ experiments. TEM enables breakthroughs in thermally controlled synthesis, gas-phase deposition, and beam-induced fabrication, including single-atom device creation. NS, particularly in situ neutron diffraction and imaging, are essential for studying bulk-level synthesis pathways. Together, these techniques offer a multiscale view of synthesis and processing. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI), automated workflows, and multimodal characterization is highlighted as a path toward high-throughput, predictive synthesis.

The simultaneous generation of reactive oxygen species and depletion of GSH holds promise for amplifying oxidative damage and enhancing therapeutic outcomes yet remains a challenge. In this work, we present a Type-I supramolecular photosensitizer designed to deplete GSH through a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism while concurrently generating superoxide radicals. This photosensitizer is constructed through the supramolecular host–guest assembly of cyclodextrin-conjugated N -hydroxyphthalimide ( CD-NHPI ) and a BODIPY-based photosensitizer ( BDP ). Upon light irradiation, electron transfer from CD-NHPI to BDP forms a radical ion pair: CD-NHPI +• and BDP –• . CD-NHPI +• undergoes deprotonation to yield an oxygen-centered radical that oxidizes GSH by directly abstracts hydrogen atoms from GSH, while BDP –• concurrently reduces molecular oxygen to superoxide radicals. As a result, this photosensitizer exhibits remarkable photocytotoxicity and significant antitumor efficacy in mouse models. This work offers a strategy for synergistically photocatalytic oxidation of antioxidants and generation of reactive oxygen species for PDT.},

  abstract     = {A promising class of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists is the non-nucleotide, small molecule, dimeric amidobenzimidazoles (diABZI), which have recently been incorporated into polymer- and antibody-drug conjugates to improve pharmacokinetics and modulate biodistribution for disease-specific applications. These approaches have leveraged diABZI variants functionalized at the 7-position of the benzimidazole for conjugation and tunable drug release from carriers. However, since this position does not interact with STING and is exposed from the binding pocket when bound in an “open lid” configuration, we sought to evaluate the activity of macromolecular diABZI conjugates that lack stimuli-responsive release and are instead conjugated to polymers via a stable amide linker. By synthesizing stable mPEG-diABZI conjugates and N , N -dimethylacrylamide (DMA) homopolymers from a diABZI-functionalized reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) agent, we found that these conjugates could activate STING in vitro with similar kinetics to highly potent diABZI analogues. Our data indicate that although diABZI-DMA conjugates enter cells via endocytosis, they can still colocalize with the ER, suggesting that intracellular trafficking processes can promote the delivery of endocytosed macromolecular diABZI compounds to STING. Furthermore, we demonstrated the in vivo activity of these macromolecular diABZI platforms, which inhibited tumor growth to a similar extent as small molecule variants. In conclusion, we have described new chemical strategies for the synthesis of stable macromolecular diABZI conjugates with unexpected immunostimulatory activity─findings that have potential implications for the design of polymer-diABZI conjugates and further motivate investigation of endosomal and intracellular trafficking as an alternative route for STING activation.},

  abstract     = {Alternating current (AC) electrolysis offers a promising strategy for modulating redox states in metal-catalyzed reactions, yet its mechanistic basis remains poorly understood. Here, we uncover how AC frequency synchronizes with key steps in a Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling cycle to control product selectivity between C–N and C–C coupling. We show that optimal C–N selectivity arises from minimizing the exposure of a key intermediate, Ni II (Ar)Br, to reducing conditions that otherwise promote off-cycle Ni I species and undesired C–C homocoupling. By developing a simple cyclic voltammetry-based method, we accurately predict the optimal AC frequency across diverse aryl bromides and amines, eliminating the need for time-consuming trial-and-error reaction optimization. The predicted values align well with experimentally determined frequencies, validating the approach. This work establishes a mechanistic foundation for integrating AC waveform control into metal catalysis and highlights its potential for advancing selective electrochemical transformations in synthetic and medicinal chemistry.},

  abstract     = {The C–H functionalization represents a universal and important method for constructing new C–C bonds by carrying out reactions directly on inert C–H bonds. The major challenges are to control the site-selectivity and chemoselectivity because most complex organic compounds have many similar C–H bonds or different functional groups, such as a C═C bond or O–H bond. Here, we develop a versatile copper cluster (Cu 3 NC (NHC) ) with high stability and dynamic catalytic sites. Unlike traditional copper catalysts (which activate diazoesters to form intermediate Cu-carbenes, catalyzing cyclopropanation and O–H insertion), the Cu 3 NC (NHC) , as a versatile catalyst, has resolved the site-selective and chemoselective challenges of the C(sp 3 )–H bond and C(sp 2 )–H bond functionalization by forming Cu 3 NC (NHC) stabilized carbocations. Moreover, turnover number (TON) values of the C–H functionalization are elevated to a whole new level (up to 123,200). Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) demonstrate that site-selectivity and chemoselectivity derive from the energy differences among these key intermediates. The diverse applicability of Cu 3 NC (NHC) provides a generic platform for optimizing chemical reactions and fostering their innovative development, thereby promoting the rapid development of the intersection between cluster chemistry and organic chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Alkali metal cations (AMCs) are known to play pivotal roles in modulating electrocatalytic systems, significantly affecting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). While their macroscopic effects are well recognized, the molecular-level interactions of AMCs at the electrochemical interface remain poorly understood. Here, using constant-potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover that AMCs (Li + , Na + , and K + ) act as molecular switches that trigger a pseudo-outer-sphere ORR mechanism. In this mechanism, surface-adsorbed water molecules serve as dynamic bridges that simultaneously mediate interfacial electron transfer and proton transport. As a result, the reactive zone extends beyond the catalyst surface, overcoming the spatial constraints of traditional inner-sphere pathways. Crucially, H 2 O 2 is generated directly within the outer Helmholtz plane via reduction of AMC-O 2 complexes, effectively bypassing the catalyst surface and avoiding over-reduction. This results in significantly enhanced selectivity and production efficiency. Our results demonstrate that AMCs activate interfacial coupling to unlock alternative reaction pathways, while concurrently elucidating the critical yet often overlooked role of solute molecules in governing electrocatalytic behavior. This work establishes a framework for the understanding of electrolyte-catalyst coupling and provides principles for designing next-generation electrochemical systems.},

While extensive research has been conducted on the structure-dependent chemical activity of 2D materials, the influence of structural transformation during the reaction has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we report the layer-dependent chemical reactivity of MoS 2 during a nitridation atomic substitution reaction and attribute it to the rearrangement of Mo atoms. Our results show that the chemical reactivity of MoS 2 decreases as the number of layers is reduced in the few-layer regime. In particular, monolayer MoS 2 exhibits significantly lower reactivity compared with its few-layer and multilayer counterparts. Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals that MoN nanonetworks form as reaction products from monolayer and bilayer MoS 2 , with the continuity of the MoN crystals increasing with layer number, consistent with the local conductivity mapping data. The layer-dependent reactivity is attributed to the relative stability of the hypothetically formed MoN phase, which retains the number of Mo atomic layers present in the precursor. Specifically, the low chemical reactivity of monolayer MoS 2 is attributed to the high energy cost associated with Mo atom diffusion and migration necessary to form multilayer Mo lattices in the thermodynamically stable MoN phase. This study underscores the critical role of lattice rearrangement in governing chemical reactivity and highlights the potential of 2D materials as versatile platforms for advancing the understanding of materials chemistry at the atomic scale.},

  abstract     = {Phage display is an ideal platform for selecting peptide hits and offers a diverse array of cyclic binders with high affinity. While many recently developed phage display platforms incorporate chemical strategies, the vast majority of these are detrimental to the phage life cycle due to cross-reactivity with the capsid protein. In contrast, enzyme catalysis, which combines high efficiency and biocompatibility, offers a promising approach for phage-based cyclic peptide display. However, enzyme-mediated cyclization approaches remain underexplored. Here, we present a tyrosinase-mediated phage display platform that enables one-step cyclization via o -quinone-cysteine coupling, which is a simple and efficient strategy that does not compromise phage infectivity. Importantly, the catalytic property of tyrosinase is highly selective and spatially constrained, allowing it to bypass native tyrosine residues in the phage and selectively recognize only the engineered tyrosine residues. Using this platform, we constructed a macrocyclic peptide library that facilitated the discovery of macrocyclic peptide inhibitors targeting therapeutically relevant proteins. Notably, the cyclic peptide ACI1 demonstrated potent inhibition of PIP4K2A kinase activity with an IC 50 value of 0.93 ± 0.05 μM, while ACP1 effectively inhibited the dephosphorylation activity of PTP1B with an IC 50 of 1.06 ± 0.25 μM. The generality and efficiency of this strategy highlight its potential as a valuable tool for the development of bioactive cyclic peptides.},

  abstract     = {Birefringent crystals are a vital class of optoelectronic materials capable of modulating and detecting the polarization state of light. The pursuit of high-performance birefringent materials has largely focused on incorporating functional units with strong polarization anisotropy and favorable alignment. In this work, we introduce a novel birefringence-active group (BAG), the five-membered ring [C 5 O 5 ] 2– , and demonstrate its potential by synthesizing four alkali metal croconate crystals: Na 2 C 5 O 5 ·2H 2 O ( NNCO·2H 2 O ), Na 2 C 5 O 5 ·3H 2 O ( NNCO·3H 2 O ), NaCsC 5 O 5 ( NCCO ), and NaRbC 5 O 5 ( NRCO ). Remarkably, NNCO·2H 2 O and NNCO·3H 2 O exhibit ultrahigh experimental birefringence values of Δ n exp(010) = 1.062 and Δ n exp(01̅1) = 0.893 at 546 nm, respectively. These exceptional values arise from the highly anisotropic nature and well-aligned arrangement of the [C 5 O 5 ] 2– units, combined with their moderate spatial density. In addition, the hydrated compounds feature wider bandgaps (2.67 and 2.55 eV) than their anhydrous analogues NCCO (2.24 eV) and NRCO (2.14 eV), thereby achieving a desirable balance between large birefringence and moderate bandgap─key criteria for optical applications. First-principles calculations and quantum chemical analysis confirm that the [C 5 O 5 ] 2– unit is the primary contributor to the observed optical anisotropy. Notably, NNCO·2H 2 O , NNCO·3H 2 O , and NCCO readily form high-quality, centimeter-scale single crystals via a simple aqueous evaporation method, with NCCO reaching up to 10 × 9 × 2.5 mm 3 . This work establishes [C 5 O 5 ] 2– as a new and effective structural motif for designing advanced birefringent materials, offering both outstanding optical performance and practical crystal growth capabilities.},

Moreover, the difficulty of developing successful deuteration platforms is compounded by a lack of means to assess the stereoisotopic purity of deuterated products. We previously reported a highly regio- and stereoselective approach for generating semideuterated cyclohexenes via tandem protonation (H + /D + ) and reduction (H – /D – ) sequences of a dihapto-coordinate tungsten-benzene complex. While NMR and HRMS analyses suggested successful deuterium incorporation, molecular rotational resonance (MRR) spectroscopy identified numerous over-, under-, and mis-deuteration impurities. At the time of publication, these impurities were attributed to H/D scrambling that could occur during thermolysis of the tungsten-bound cyclohexene ligand prior to MRR analysis. In this work, we describe the analysis of semideuterated cyclohexenes using MRR spectroscopy with an improved thermolysis apparatus that eliminates deuterium scrambling during analysis. Quantitative analysis of both racemic and enantiopure samples enables the optimization of deuteration conditions by providing multiple mechanistic insights into the formation of impurities.},

  abstract     = {The Siglec family represents one of the major classes of human glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) that regulates a broad range of biological processes through engagement with their glycan ligands. Human Siglecs have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years, as they are regarded as new immune checkpoints. The disruption of Siglec–sialoglycan interactions represents a promising next-generation strategy for cancer immunotherapy. In addition to the sialic acid moiety, it has been well established that glycan sulfation plays an essential role in the ligand binding of human Siglecs. Therefore, there is an urgent need to thoroughly understand the subtle differences in the glycan scaffolds and sulfation patterns that govern Siglec binding. N -Glycans are the most abundant class of glycans occurring in living cells, while sulfation is the most widespread postglycosylation modification of N -glycans, indicating that sulfated N -glycans serve as key ligands for human Siglecs. However, the synthetic generation of large libraries of complex sulfated N -glycans is impractical as sulfation introduces additional challenges to the already demanding process of N -glycan synthesis. Herein, we describe a de novo chemoenzymatic approach for the efficient preparation of complex sulfated N -glycans. Using this approach, a comprehensive 72-member library of sulfated N -glycans encompassing the most typical complex structures was successfully prepared. With the well-defined library (comprising 72 sulfated N -glycans and 26 nonsulfated controls), we systematically investigated the binding activities of all human Siglecs. Beyond the synthetic breakthroughs, this work provides the most comprehensive profile to date for understanding how sulfation patterns and N -glycan scaffolds affect Siglec ligand binding, which will have an immediate impact on the development of Siglec-targeted immunotherapy strategies.},

  abstract     = {Carbon-based, metal-free photocatalysts are emerging as sustainable alternatives to transition-metal-based systems due to their tunability, abundance, and environmental friendliness. Among them, carbon dots (CDs) offer unique opportunities in visible-light-driven transformations owing to their excellent photostability, electronic tunability, and surface functionalization capacity. However, the development of structurally defined CD-based catalysts that enable efficient hole transfer, a broad substrate scope, and scalability remains a key challenge. Herein, we report the first bifunctional, quasi-homogeneous CD-based photocatalytic platform that combines visible-light absorption with cooperative hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis. Using a covalent molecular design, thiol groups were precisely anchored onto the CD surface, enabling fast and efficient hole transfer and promoting the reductive quenching of the excited CD to produce thiyl radicals. This molecular tuning facilitates efficient boryl radical generation via HAT of N-heterocyclic carbene–borane (NHC-BH 3 ), and enables broad substrate applicability on boration of naphthalenes, indoles, alkenes, and polyfluoroarenes. The method is readily scalable, performing smoothly under both gram-scale batch and continuous flow conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that the thiol groups accelerate excited-state charge separation and act as hole acceptors, highlighting a hole-transfer-driven catalytic mechanism. This work demonstrates how molecularly tailored CDs can serve as multifunctional, metal-free photocatalysts and provides a new blueprint for advancing dual catalytic organic transformations under visible light.},

  abstract     = {The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paired with various electrochemical and photoelectrochemical reduction reactions used for fuel and chemical production. As there is a strong interest in performing many of these reduction reactions in strongly acidic solutions to increase the reaction rate, efficiency, or selectivity, there is also a great interest in enabling efficient and stable OER in strongly acidic solutions. In this study, we report stable photoelectrochemical OER (POER) of a BiVO 4 photoanode in 0.1 M HNO 3 (pH 1). This was achieved by using Nb 2 O 5 as a protection layer. While Nb 2 O 5 was rarely used as a protection layer for photoelectrodes in the past, we show its excellent capability to suppress both the chemical and photoelectrochemical dissolution of BiVO 4 at pH 1. After stabilizing BiVO 4 with a Nb 2 O 5 protection layer, we added Co 2+ ions to the electrolyte as an OER catalyst to enhance the POER. We found that Co (aq) 2+ can serve as a homogeneous OER catalyst without being deposited as a CoO x solid catalyst on Nb 2 O 5 . When we performed the POER using unprotected BiVO 4 with Co (aq) 2+ under the same condition, although POER was enhanced, the enhancement could not be sustained due to the chemical dissolution of BiVO 4 . After the POER, we found that a Co 3+ -containing OER catalyst was deposited on the bare BiVO 4 surface. This result suggested that the use of Co 2+ ions as a homogeneous catalyst was possible due to the inertness of the Nb 2 O 5 surface toward the adsorption or deposition of Co ions. This study enabling stable POER of BiVO 4 in 0.1 M HNO 3 using the combination of a Nb 2 O 5 protection layer and Co (aq) 2+ as a homogeneous OER catalyst provides promising possibilities for acidic POER and OER.},

A primary example of this is in singlet fission, which has the potential to boost photovoltaic efficiencies through exciton multiplication. While detailed solution-phase mechanistic studies of this phenomenon now exist, bridging the gap to practical devices has yet to be realized. We address this issue by showcasing several different ways to steer the excited-state relaxation of new fission-active pentacene and fission-inactive anthracene oligomers, highlighting how the balance of inter- and intramolecular coupling plays a crucial role. We achieve this by engineering specific interactions via supramolecular self-assembly. These interactions promote the uncommon occurrence of strong J-aggregation in acenes. Within the aggregates, intermolecular couplings result in the formation of a strongly bound 1 TT state, which outcompetes the parasitic charge transfer process that dominates in isolated molecules. These findings highlight that balancing intra- and intermolecular interactions offers an effective strategy for regulating the singlet fission process, a critical requirement for advancing future solid-state devices and applications.},

Interestingly, crystal structures indicated dimensionally diversified coordination networks in copper(II) amino acid assemblies, including zero-dimensional (0D) discrete blocks, one-dimensional (1D) infinite chains, and two-dimensional (2D) infinite sheets. Notably, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the dimensionality of coordination networks fundamentally modulates the maximum piezoelectric strain coefficient of assemblies with the order: 1D > 2D > 0D, in which the copper(II) l -glutamate (Glu+Cu) coordination assemblies exhibited the highest value of 57.7 pC/N. The Glu+Cu crystal-based piezoelectric device produced stable open-circuit voltages exceeding 3.0 V under 55 N mechanical force, which could be fabricated into real-time monitoring systems for cervical and lumbar spine health.

Here, we present closely attached atomically dispersed Fe species and ultrafine Au-supported SrTiO 3 hollow nanotubes with oxygen vacancies (STO v ) for highly selective CH 4 conversion to CH 3 OH. An impressive CH 3 OH production rate of 7.53 mmol g –1 h –1 with a selectivity up to 95.4% has been achieved, corresponding to an apparent quantum efficiency of 15.8% at 365 nm, representing a record among all of the representative photocatalysts under comparable conditions. Experimental results and theoretical simulations elucidate that the created oxygen vacancies on SrTiO 3 without Ti 3+ facilitate CH 4 adsorption to effectively capture photogenerated holes for producing methyl radicals. In parallel, the photogenerated electrons could be rapidly extracted by the anchored Au and then transferred to the adjacent single-atom Fe sites for activating O 2 to generate the key intermediate Fe–*OOH toward highly selective CH 3 OH production. Significantly, a commendable electron transfer efficiency of 67.5% for O 2 activation is achieved on Fe–Au/STO v based on the quantitative in situ microsecond transient absorption spectra. This work provides a deep understanding of the regulation of both activity and selectivity by the engineering of adjacent sites and the investigation of electron kinetics for O 2 activation during CH 4 photo-oxidation.},

  abstract     = {The in-depth integration of gene regulation with protein modulation can enhance cellular information processing, yet it is significantly constrained by ineffective and complex protein-to-gene transduction strategies. Herein, we developed a simple protease-guided autocatalytic gene silencing platform named iPAD (intelligent peptide-programmed deoxyribonuclease) that converts the protease recognition events into versatile DNA readout signals by rationally designing a native protease-responsive cationic peptide (PP) to efficiently modulate the DNAzyme (Dz) activity. Without requiring additional chemical modifications, the multifunctional PP regulator consists simply of one cell-specific targeting peptide segment and two cationic peptide segments isolated by one protease-specific peptide substrate. The catalytic activity of Dz can be potently disrupted via the cooperatively stabilized electrostatic interactions between cationic PP and the anionic Dz. Subsequently, the Dz activity is efficiently restored via the protease-specific cleavage of the PP, which disrupts the cooperative stabilization between PP and Dz, thus achieving robust and accurate monitoring of protease activity. Molecular dynamic simulations theoretically validate that the on-demand regulation of Dz activity was indeed acquired from the programmed oligomerization of oligo-peptides. As a universal protease sensing platform, this method was successfully applied to probe Caspase-3 and thrombin, facilitating the early evaluation of tumor therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, the endogenous Caspase-3-activated Dz facilitates the construction of an autocatalytic gene regulation platform that self-adaptively upregulates the expression of apoptotic proteases, accelerating tumor cell apoptosis. This simple yet intelligent iPAD system provides a versatile toolbox for high-performance biosensing and bioengineering applications, paving the way for new strategies in smart theragnostic research.},

  abstract     = {The atom arrangement in carbon electrocatalysts is crucial for enhancing the intrinsic activity toward oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs), a key process in multiple renewable energy systems. However, the challenge of designing electrocatalysts with improved performance by manipulating atomic arrangement has been limited by synthetic constraints and a lack of understanding of the catalytic phase formation. Herein, we gain atomic-level insight into the origin of a highly active site by creating a model catalyst with a heteroatom-decorated carbon matrix of a specific configuration. The introduction of fluorine (F) during the synthesis of the nitrogen (N)-decorated carbon matrix induces structural rearrangement, converting most pyrrolic-N (P r -N) into highly stable graphitic-N (G-N), thereby achieving a N configuration predominantly composed of pyridinic nitrogen (P y -N) and G-N. The multidopant synergistic effect of F, P y -N, and G-N causes a destabilized π-conjugated electron network of the carbon matrix, resulting in a more localized electronic structure. As a result, multiple dopant configurations with high ORR activity have been explored, among which the asymmetric P y -N and G-N configurations feature the lowest theoretical ORR overpotential, ultimately enabling the optimized F@NC catalyst to exhibit excellent oxygen reduction activity. This work establishes a foundation for the rational design of metal-free carbon-based electrocatalysts toward ORR.},

Herein, we describe an experimental platform that exploits advances in electrochemical liquid-phase scanning and transmission electron microscopy (LPSEM and LPTEM) to study pitting corrosion of thin-film pure aluminum in a saline environment in real time. Galvanostatic measurements at increasing current levels showed that localized corrosion of Al begins with the appearance of blisters in parallel with nanosized pits. It progresses with the coexistence of round and fractal-like pit morphologies before transitioning to the complete fractal-like dissolution of Al at high currents. Although gas bubble formation appeared to be more pronounced at higher currents, we were able to locally probe that the gas is produced at the corrosion front, which we experimentally confirmed to be molecular hydrogen. Our findings reveal the kinetic mechanism of the early stages of localized anodic corrosion in Al, which may have more general implications for proposing corrosion resistance descriptors.},

  abstract     = {All-soluble all-iron redox flow batteries (AS-AIRFBs) represent a highly promising next-generation technology for long-duration energy storage, leveraging their low cost, decoupled energy/power characteristics, and controllable side reactions. Achieving long-term cycling stability necessitates a stable Fe 2+/3+ -ligand chelate to mitigate the electrolyte crossover, which is the main bottleneck for the flow batteries, in particular for AIRFBs. Herein, we designed a novel ligand─2-hydroxy-1,3-propanediamine tetra-sulfonate sodium salt (HPDTS)─through tailoring both ligand structure and chelate configuration. Benefiting from the macromolecular and flexible ligand framework, HPDTS dramatically accelerates the electron transfer kinetics of Fe 2+/ Fe 3+ , leading to the highest energy efficiency (EE: 71.79% at 200 mA cm –2 ) and power density (446.9 mW cm –2 at 623.39 mA cm –2 ) reported so far. In particular, unlike the traditional penta-coordinate chelate, HPDTS forms a tightly bonded symmetric hexa-coordinate Fe chelate with thermodynamic stability, which not only inhibits the side reaction (e.g., decomposition and HER) but also suppresses the electrolyte crossover when paired with a nonfluorinated proton exchange membrane. Electrochemical testing reveals the record-long lifespan of 15,000 cycles with an ultralow fading rate of 0.000741% per cycle and an ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.25%. Furthermore, practical AIRFB was also demonstrated to stably cycle for over 6500 cycles without any decay. The new molecular configuration tailoring strategies presented here provide a new paradigm for the development of high-efficiency and long-life AIRFBs.},

  abstract     = {p -Tolualdehyde ( p -TALD) is an important chemical intermediate that is widely used in the fragrance and pharmaceutical industries. Photocatalytic upgrading of p -xylene into p -TALD is a promising route but suffers from undesired overoxidation via conventional molecular oxygen-mediated oxygenation due to difficulties associated with desorbing the products from catalyst active sites. In this work, a novel photocatalytic hydroxyl radical (·OH)-mediated oxygenation route is reported for p -xylene to p -TALD conversion, in which the ·OH serves as oxygen donors to generate intermediates containing hydroxyl functional groups that readily form hydrogen bonds with surface hydroxyl groups of the P25 photocatalyst. This hydrogen bonding interaction effectively regulates the adsorption–desorption behavior of intermediates and products, thereby significantly enhancing the selectivity toward p -TALD from 45.25% to nearly 100%, delivering an impressive p -TALD production rate of 3568.8 μmol g –1 h –1 . This work provides a promising strategy for overcoming the common issue of severe overoxidation encountered during photocatalytic upgrading of organic substrates.},

  abstract     = {The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of precious metals plays a pivotal role in photocatalytic H 2 evolution, where plasmon-generated hot electrons are efficiently injected into the photocatalytic system, profoundly modulating interfacial electron transfer dynamics. Regrettably, the specific impact of the LSPR effect of precious metals on the ultrafast interfacial charge transfer and its kinetic characteristics remains inadequately explored in photocatalystic systems. To address these knowledge gaps, Au nanoparticles are incorporated into the CdS/ReS x photocatalyst to comprehensively investigate the LSPR-induced ultrafast interfacial charge transfer, ultimately boosting photocatalytic H 2 production activity. The experimental results reveal that the developed CdS/Au 0.5 @ReS x photocatalyst achieves a notable H 2 -production activity with a rate of 8.6 mmol g –1 h –1 (AQE = 35.9%), which is evidently higher than that of CdS/Au (1.8 mmol g –1 h –1 ) and CdS/ReS x (4.0 mmol g –1 h –1 ). In situ XAFS and fs-TAS characterizations confirm that the Au LSPR effect generates electron-deficient Au δ+ species and contracts Au–S bond lengths, dramatically accelerating electron transfer in the Au@ReS x cocatalyst. This plasmon-induced ultrafast charge transfer mechanism enables efficient photogenerated electron migration in the CdS/Au@ReS x system, promoting interfacial charge dynamics for exceptional photocatalytic H 2 evolution performance. The findings offer a new understanding of charge transfer mechanisms enabled by LSPR effects and create a blueprint for engineering next-generation plasmonic photocatalysts.},

  abstract     = {Stereodivergent synthesis of the structural motif bearing vicinal stereocenters is highly important for complete evaluation of their physiological activities. Branched- and enantioselective allylic alkylation using synergistic dual catalysis has emerged as a powerful strategy to access multiple molecular stereoisomers with precise control of the absolute and relative configuration. Despite impressive progress in this field, the stereodivergent allylic alkylation by employing trisubstituted allylic electrophiles to construct allylic quaternary stereocenters remains an unsolved challenge. Herein, we report a combination of iridium and magnesium catalysis for stereodivergent allylic alkylation of α-benzothiazyl acetamide by using challenging trisubstituted allylic carbonates. Such a stereodivergent process gives a range of all four stereoisomers of α-allylated acetamide products containing congested allylic quaternary and vicinal tertiary stereocenters in good yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities. The synthetic utility of this methodology is demonstrated through the preparation of key intermediates for a number of natural products. Particularly, stereodivergent synthesis of an analgesic drug derivative Me -tapentadol has been achieved, exhibiting significantly enhanced μ-opioid receptor agonistic activity compared to its parent compound.},

Among such materials, Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 (GGG) has been widely regarded as a benchmark cryogenic refrigerant for ADR systems. In this article, we report on a rare-earth fluoride, NH 4 GdF 4, whose low-field magnetocaloric effect is significantly stronger than that of GGG. NH 4 GdF 4 orders at T c = 0.85 K and exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state at low temperatures as proved by the nearest neighbor exchange interaction model and the specific heat analysis. It has excellent low-field magnetization properties, as evidenced by approaching its saturation magnetization of 160 emu/g below a magnetic field of 10 kOe. Furthermore, the magnetic entropy change of up to 38.2 J·kg –1 ·K –1 and its measured temperature change of 1.1 K at an initial temperature of 1.8 K under the magnetic field change of 0–10 kOe are greater than all reported results and much greater than the entropy change and temperature change of GGG under the same conditions. Thus, NH 4 GdF 4 is a competitive refrigerant candidate for low-field-driven ADR applications at sub-Kelvin temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Despite decades of actinyl chemistry, genuinely bent actinyl structures remain rare beyond uranium. We report the first crystallographic characterization of a bent neptunyl(VI) complex, NpO 2 Cl 2 (phen) 2 , along with a linear plutonyl species that, unexpectedly, adopts the +V oxidation state. Coordination of two 1,10-phenanthroline ligands to NpO 2 2+ enforces pronounced bending of the O yl –Np–O yl unit to 162° through steric clashes with the axial phenathroline ligand, representing the sharpest angle reported for any neptunyl(VI) complex. In contrast, synthesis with PuO 2 2+ produces a reduced linear Pu(V) species, PuO 2 Cl(phen) 2 , underscoring the redox lability and the reluctance of plutonium to distort. Raman and IR spectra yield the first experimental stretching and interaction force constants for plutonyl(V). Comparison with values for plutonyl(VI) and bent and linear uranyl(VI) and neptunyl(VI) compounds shows that reduction perturbs the actinyl bond more than bending within one oxidation state. Electrochemical and spectroscopic studies clarify phenanthroline binding to Pu(VI) and the system’s reactivity. Quantum chemical calculations indicate that bending is energetically favored in the U–Np–Pu series, but the stabilization energy decreases as the actinide atomic number increases. NBO and QTAIM analyses reveal systematic trends: increasing 5f occupancy and decreasing An–O yl bond covalency from U to Pu. These results demonstrate that ligand-induced bending in neptunyl(VI) species is not only electronically feasible but also synthetically achievable, though plutonyl(VI) is constrained by redox reactivity. This work expands the frontier of nonlinear actinyl chemistry and illuminates how structure, oxidation state, and electronic configuration interrelate across the actinyl series.},

This strategy involves a voltage-gated electro-adsorption of Ru 4 POM on CNH-modified glassy carbon anodes with favorable interfacial dynamics, maintained under electrocatalytic conditions. These conditions are reached through the continuous reconstruction of the organic/inorganic interface (catch-and-release), as probed by converging thermal, microscopic, and electrochemical analyses. In fact, control experiments reveal that both pristine and N-doped CNHs display a Ru 4 POM loading in the range 13–18 nmol mg –1 with a remarkable ∼100 mV onset potential anticipation and current enhancement in the range 400–700% compared to the homogeneous conditions. By adopting the “catch-and-release” protocol, electro-esterification of aqueous EtOH features long-term stability of the productive current in the mA range ( J chrono ≈ 2 mA cm –2 at +1.2 V vs Ag/AgCl probed up to 18 h), with Faradaic efficiencies, FE EtOAc , of >90%. This effect is attributed to the crucial role of CNHs hydrophobicity to control hydrolysis equilibria, thus outperforming the solution-phase behavior, which levels off at FE EtOAc < 60%.},

A unique aspect of polymorphs is that they exhibit different physical properties, such as solubility, melting point, density, color, hardness, and bioavailability. Here, we synthesized polymorphs of colloidal crystals engineered with DNA by slow-cooling gold nanoparticle-core programmable atom equivalents (PAEs, particles with DNA sequences that control their bonding characteristics) under salt concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 4 M NaCl. This approach yielded a diverse set of single-crystalline phases with cubic, tetragonal, and hexagonal lattice symmetries. The structural transitions observed here arise solely from the modulation of interparticle repulsion via ionic strength and thermal processing. Notably, in certain cases, we observed diffusionless phase transformations, wherein the superlattices evolve from cubic to lower-symmetry tetragonal lattices. By tuning the thermal stability and salt concentration, we captured intermediate, metastable body-centered tetragonal structures during the slow-cool process, indicating that subtle changes in free energy can direct crystallization to low-symmetry phases. This study demonstrates that thermal and ionic parameters can be tuned to access and stabilize colloidal crystal polymorphs with emergent structures and interesting functional properties.},

Herein, we report that pH-responsive renal-clearable gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of ∼2 nm in size can rapidly self-assemble into a single ∼180 nm nanosphere within individual PTEC endosomes in vivo once their isoelectric points (IEPs) overlapping the endocytic pH range (4.5–6.5), which has never been observed at the animal level. This pH-triggered one assembly per endosome delays subsequent reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated intracellular biotransformation into larger nanostructures while preserving membrane extrusion-based re-elimination. These findings reveal that endosomal acidity, alongside ROS, is a critical determinant of nanoparticle biotransformation and suggest that tailoring isoelectric points offers a route to control the subcellular assembly and clearance of renal-clearable nanomedicines at the animal level.},

  abstract     = {Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a paradigm for investigating emergent quantum phenomena, particularly through their unique charge density wave (CDW) transitions and electron correlation effects. However, the inherent semimetallic characteristics of prototypical compounds such as TiSe 2 fundamentally constrain their thermoelectric performance. Herein, we unveil a breakthrough in thermoelectric TMDs through dual chemical control of both intralayer bonding and interlayer charge dynamics under valence compensation. Through partial substitution of 1/3 Ti 4+ ions with Cr 3+ in the intralayer TiSe 6 octahedral framework, we effectively suppress antibonding orbital interactions, thereby widening the bandgap from −0.46 to 0.53 eV. Simultaneously, controlled Cu + intercalation into interlayer selenium-coordinated void octahedra (i.e., van der Waals gaps) establishes three-dimensional charge transport pathways, resulting in a remarkable 50% enhancement in carrier mobility. Meanwhile, the vibrationally anharmonic Cu–Se bonding configuration dramatically reduces the lattice thermal conductivity to one-fourth that of pristine TiSe 2 . This concerted optimization culminates in a record-breaking dimensionless figure of merit ( ZT = 0.82) at 673 K in Cu-deficient composition of Cu 0.8 CrTi 2 Se 6 , representing a 40-fold enhancement over undoped TiSe 2 and setting a new benchmark for single-phase bulk TMD thermoelectrics. Our work demonstrates how atomic-scale coordination engineering can unlock superior thermoelectric performance in traditionally “non-ideal” material systems.},

  abstract     = {To address the increasingly limited water availability, using metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) to capture atmospheric water vapor as usable resources has emerged as a promising strategy. The adsorption characteristics of MOFs as well as their step pressure (i.e., the pressure when the steep rise in water uptake, if any, occurs) directly influence the amount of collectable water and thus their harvesting effectiveness. To date, a comprehensive understanding of water adsorption behaviors and how they are influenced by MOF properties remains lacking. This study addresses this gap by systematically investigating water adsorption in >200 strategically selected MOFs with diverse features. The results demonstrate that water adsorption in MOFs is highly complex, revealing various subtypes of both non-S-shaped and S-shaped isotherms. Moreover, among S-shaped isotherms, distinct phase behaviors that, in turn, govern different adsorption mechanisms and hydrogen-bonding environments are identified, as evidenced by analyses of their macrostate probability distributions (MPDs), thermodynamic stability limits, and grand potential free energy landscapes. Further structure–property analyses also uncover key design principles: A moderate heat of adsorption is critical for enabling S-shaped isotherms, while the size of pores critically modulates the steepness of the adsorption step by controlling the phase transition nature of confined water. The density and, more importantly, the uniformity of adsorption sites are found as well to dictate the step pressure. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive overview of diverse adsorption behaviors in MOFs as well as informs general design principles for the development of advanced adsorbents for atmospheric water harvesting.},

The Ti 8 (μ 2 -O) 8 (μ 2 -OH) 4 nodes structurally mimic TiO 2 , which has shown some PCET reactivity toward reactions of H 2 , O 2 , and others. In this report, we have demonstrated that a change in crystal size induces different amounts of structural disorder to the Ti-oxo node, further changing the thermodynamics of proton/electron/hydrogen-atom transfer reactions. Using electrochemical open-circuit potential ( E OCP ) measurements, we have determined that all crystallites undergo a 1H + /1e – redox reaction, which, given the stoichiometry, can be considered as a net H atom transfer (HAT) reaction. The thermodynamics of this HAT reaction, the Ti 3+ O–H bond dissociation free energy (BDFE), was dependent on the crystal size of the MOF, as the decrease in crystal size induced more structural disorder. Our computational calculations have indicated that this difference in BDFE is due to a local change in the geometry of Ti cations, rather than the commonly invoked defects, such as the “missing-linker” defect sites. Individual proton/electron transfer (PT/ET) thermodynamics were also highly dependent on the crystal sizes. These were probed using p K a or band gaps ( E g ), respectively. These findings suggest that, particularly when MOFs are nanosized with a large amount of structural disorder, they should no longer be considered “true” single-site catalysts; this is an implicit, but widespread assumption within the MOF-based catalysis field. Implications of these findings will be contrasted with structurally similar metal oxides like TiO 2 and other redox-active MOFs.},

  abstract     = {The direct cross-coupling of unactivated alkyl halides with aryl or heteroaryl partners remains a fundamental challenge in synthetic chemistry due to their inertness and propensity for side reactions. Herein, we report a transition-metal-free electrochemical halogen-atom transfer strategy that enables efficient alkyl radical cross-coupling via convergent paired electrolysis. In this system, anodically generated α-aminoalkyl radicals mediate the activation of alkyl iodides, while aryl/heteroaryl aldehydes or nitriles undergo cathodic reduction to afford persistent ketyl radical anions or aryl radical anions. The matched redox processes facilitate selective radical–radical anion cross-coupling to furnish diverse alcohols and C(sp 3 )–C(sp 2 ) coupling products under mild conditions. This operationally simple, scalable protocol exhibits broad functional group tolerance and is applicable to a wide range of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl iodides and structurally diverse aryl and heteroaryl coupling partners. The utility of this strategy is further demonstrated in the late-stage modification of natural products, biomolecules, and pharmaceuticals.},

In particular, it can open novel pathways for the use of biomass-derived substrates or waste plastics as chemical feedstocks. We present here an efficient catalytic approach focusing on the use of earth abundant iron in the form of iron carbide nanoparticles (ICNPs) activated by magnetic induction, allowing the reaction to proceed at pressures of only 3 bar of H 2 . The activity of the ICNPs responds in real time to on/off switches of the alternating current magnetic field (ACMF, 350 kHz, 70 mT), mimicking the use of intermittent renewable electricity, and the magnetic properties of the ICNPs allow for their easy separation and reuse. The reaction proceeds with higher yield and selectivities at global temperatures more than 130 °C below thermal activation, leading to at least four times higher energy efficiency. The method was successfully applied to a range of synthetic targets and to the selective depolymerization of real polyester (PET) products.},

  abstract     = {Multiple biological barriers in vivo severely restrict the delivery efficiency of nanoparticles (NPs) to tumors. To overcome biological barriers, traditional NPs usually require a complex design, which increases the difficulty of clinical translation. Therefore, there appears to be a dilemma between the complex biological barriers in vivo and clinical requirement for a simple molecular structure of NPs. Herein, an unprecedented zwitterionic polycaprolactone-poly(4-( N , N -dimethylamino- N -acetyl sulfadiazine) benzoyl oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) (PCL–PSDMA) micelle is synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), capable of overcoming multiple biological barriers with minimalistic structure. First, the PCL–PSDMA micelle shows a zwitterionic state in a physiological environment, exhibiting long blood circulation without triggering accelerated blood clearance. Second, the PCL–PSDMA micelle traverses the blood–brain barrier effectively owing to the pathway mediated by the l -type amino acid transporter on cerebrovascular endothelial cells. Third, the PCL–PSDMA micelle converts from zwitterionic state to positively charged state in tumor extracellular environment, facilitating deep tumor penetration and enhanced tumor cellular uptake. Lastly, the zeta potential of the PCL–PSDMA micelle transforms to a stronger positive value in the lysosomal microenvironment, resulting in effective lysosomal escape. The outstanding performance of overcoming five sequential biological barriers endows the PCL–PSDMA micelle with high drug delivery efficiency to glioblastoma, leading to pronounced antitumor effect in two types of glioblastoma-bearing mice model. Overall, this work not only adds a new member to the zwitterionic family but also broadens the horizon of developing powerful NPs for antiglioblastoma drug delivery.},

  abstract     = {Well-defined heterostructures exhibit emergent properties distinct from their single-phase constituents, enabling advances across diverse technologies. Typically classified as self-assembly and epitaxy, heterointerface formation is generally assumed to proceed unidirectionally and irreversibly at bulk scales. Here we use in situ electron microscopy at 298 K to visualize the heterostructure formation from nanoscale mixtures of intrinsically immiscible salts at ambient conditions, NaCl and NaI. We find that both self-assembly and heteroepitaxy occur reversibly, governed by stochastic equilibria. During self-assembly, the system fluctuates between order and semiordered states, with kinetically favored iodide–graphene interactions and eventual formation of thermodynamically favored charge-neutral planes. The ions in the liquid state move rapidly. In the epitaxial regime, NaI layers repeatedly grow and exfoliate from a buffer layer. The observed motion of atoms driven by high interfacial energy occurs with an energy barrier of 18 kcal mol –1 or less as estimated from the Nyquist frequency of the frame rate of the movie. These observations reveal that heterointerface formation is governed by dynamic and stochastic processes, providing a framework for the understanding of the initiation stage of the heterointerface formation in high interface energy regimes such as surface and structural defects of bulk solids.},

  abstract     = {Narrow electrochemical windows and high reactivity of aqueous solutions remain critical bottlenecks for the practical application of aqueous batteries. However, the mechanisms for tuning microscopic reactivity of H 2 O molecules in aqueous electrolytes remain elusive. This study employs six ether molecules with distinct structures and solvation powers to regulate the microstructure of aqueous solutions. We reveal underlying correlations between the reactivity of H 2 O and microstructural parameters in organic-aqueous electrolytes. A more positive solvation power difference value between ether and H 2 O is appealing to drive enhanced microheterogeneity, which accordingly lowers the average Li + coordination number and reduces H 2 O cluster size. A small and isolated H 2 O cluster, which bridges the microstructural parameters and macroscopic electrolyte performance, is critical to suppress long-range H 2 O diffusion, thereby enhancing the electrochemical stability of the electrolyte. Diethyl ether with an optimal positive solvation energy difference with H 2 O forms minimal [Li(H 2 O) 4 ] + clusters and moderate anion aggregation, simultaneously enabling fast Li + ion diffusion and an expanded electrochemical window. LiMn 2 O 4 ||Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 full cells achieved 200 cycles with 97.5% capacity retention at 1 C. Additionally, a 1 Ah aqueous pouch cell delivered a high energy density of 80.93 Wh kg –1 .

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) tin halide perovskites are highly tunable and low-toxicity semiconductors, promising for next-generation optoelectronics. However, achieving air stability and excellent photophysical properties simultaneously necessitates deliberate structure tuning using organic spacer cations and A-site cations. Here, we report a series of new quasi-2D Ruddlesden–Popper tin halide perovskites using a fluorinated aromatic spacer cation, 4-fluorophenethylammonium (4FPEA), and systematically investigate the impacts of layer thickness, spacer cation, and A-site cation on the crystal structures and optical properties of (4FPEA) 2 (A) n −1 Sn n I 3 n +1 . These 4FPEA-based 2D tin perovskites, further tuned by the A-cations, exhibit uniquely undistorted 180° out-of-plane Sn–I–Sn bond angles and low octahedral distortions compared to other quasi-2D perovskites and demonstrate prolonged air stability, excellent photophysics, and amplified spontaneous emission and lasing in exfoliated microflakes. A comprehensive survey of reported n = 2 lead and tin iodide perovskites reveals that all structures can be classified into three types (tilted, balanced, and buckled) based on the structural distortion parameters of their perovskite cages. Notably, (4FPEA) 2 (A)Sn 2 I 7 are among the handful of “balanced” n = 2 perovskites with minimal distortion and excellent optoelectronic performance. The structural insights and cage-balancing approach revealed herein motivate the deliberate design of quasi-2D perovskites through the synergy of the spacer and cage cations, further paving the way for high-performance optoelectronic applications of stable tin halide perovskites.},

However, practical challenges persist, including thermal expansion anisotropy, ferromagnetism, high density, and restricted ZTE temperature windows. In this study, we have achieved a lightweight, nonferromagnetic, isotropic ZTE in Yb(Al,Mn) 2 alloys, which exhibits continuous shiftability of the ZTE temperature window across a wide range (140–650 K). By employing multiple advanced experimental techniques and combining first-principles calculations, we have elucidated that the ZTE behavior originates from valence fluctuations accompanied by local structural distortions. The latter manifests as the first two observed effects: the splitting of local bond lengths and the attenuation of atomic displacements. More importantly, the induced enhancement of hybridization between Mn-3 d and Yb-4 f orbitals is identified as the primary mechanism responsible for the emergence of shiftability over a wide temperature range. This work presents an unprecedented phenomenon of continuously shiftable ZTE temperature windows observed in the mixed-valence system Yb(Al,Mn) 2 , which holds significant potential for diverse thermal expansion control applications in advanced technological fields, paving the way for next-generation devices requiring exceptional dimensional stability. Furthermore, the modulation of valence fluctuations provides new strategies for the development of new ZTE materials in the future.},

The study offers a new mechanistic perspective to evaluate the potential contribution from the excited state molecular configuration to the performance of MOF photocatalysts. In this work, by employing MIL-101(Fe) as the study platform, we have further explored the influence of intramolecular interactions on the stability of relevant excited states and demonstrated the effective tuning of their lifetimes through the incorporation of different functional groups into the system. The correlations between the varied excited state lifetimes and coordination configurations with specific functional groups (−NH 2 or −NO 2 ) was inferred from the analyses of infrared spectroscopic data and theoretical calculations, revealing the essential role of the intramolecular interactions (i.e., between the added functional groups and the carboxylate group) in the modulation of system energetics.

To metabolically gate PROTAC activity, we developed an enzymatic activation strategy by integrating an O-GlcNAc modification to the cyclimids, ligands derived from the natural motifs recognized by CRBN. These sugar-coated PROTACs (SCPs) were designed using structural analyses of representative cyclimid degraders complexed with CRBN and target protein BRD4. We found that glycosylation of the cyclimid reduced CRBN binding and complex formation with BRD4 until enzymatic removal of the O-GlcNAc moiety by O-GlcNAcase (OGA). The requirement for enzymatic activation is demonstrated by in vitro biochemical binding, cellular degradation, and cell viability assays in engineered and native cell lines. O-GlcNAc is thus an effective mechanism to gate targeted protein degradation modalities that motivates the development of similar strategies to enhance selectivity with other protein modifications.},

Herein, we present a tumor microenvironment (TME)-activatable nanoplatform, TDR848@FPB, designed for systemic administration and enhanced covalent capture of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), enabling effective immunotherapy with minimal off-target effects and independent of localized tumor administration. This platform encapsulates a photosensitizer-conjugated, light-activated toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist, which induces immunogenic cell death and triggers a pro-inflammatory TME conducive to antigen capture upon light irradiation. TDR848@FPB covalently binds TAA-generated postphotodynamic therapy and promotes their efficient delivery to enhance dendritic cell maturation, T cell activation, and immunogenetic reprogramming of the TME. Following intravenous injection and light irradiation, TDR848@FPB demonstrates superior 1 O 2 generation capability and TAA capture efficiency, leading to significant tumor growth inhibition. Moreover, the captured TAAs and TLR agonists synergistically activate adaptive antitumor immunity, as evidenced by their potentiated T cell responses.

  abstract     = {The ultimate miniaturization of catalysts to single-atomic dimensions offers a promising route to maximize the catalytic performance through fully exposed active sites and precisely tailored electronic structures. However, the synthesis of atomically precise one-dimensional single-cluster or single-atom catalysts with the simplest periodicity remains challenging due to their thermodynamic instability. Here, we report a general strategy for fabricating single-unit-chain catalysts confined within single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), where charge delocalization dramatically enhances the catalytic performance. Through a liquid-phase assembly approach, diverse clusters and atoms can be uniformly packed into ordered single-unit chains inside SWCNTs, irrespective of their electronic properties or solubility. These identical, well-defined single-unit chains maintain intimate contact with the conductive graphene walls of SWCNTs, enabling tunable positive or negative charge delocalization across the nanotube surfaces. The resulting catalysts demonstrate remarkable activity enhancements in both redox and coupling reactions, exhibiting rate constants 7.5∼28 times greater than their isolated cluster counterparts. Mechanistic studies reveal that charge delocalization simultaneously increases the density of active sites and reduces the activation barriers. This synthetic approach and catalytic mechanism show universal applicability to various single-chain catalysts. These systems maintain nearly undiminished activity in 230 h continuous-flow reactions, highlighting their exceptional stability for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are promising next-generation rechargeable batteries due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density. However, their cycling lifespan is hindered by the poor stability of Li metal anodes. The main challenge lies in the severe Li polysulfide (LiPS) corrosion on Li metal anodes. Herein, galvanic corrosion induced by LiPSs is identified as the main cause of nonuniform Li deposition and dissolution in working Li–S batteries. Concretely, LiPSs continuously corrode the Li metal anode and thereby increase its electrode potential to different extents according to the corrosion kinetics. The electrical connection of the Li metals with different corrosion kinetics causes galvanic corrosion and consequent selective Li deposition in severely corroded locations. Consequently, spatially heterogeneous LiPS corrosion eventually induces localized Li utilization, uneven Li distribution, and accelerated cell failure. To alleviate the galvanic corrosion, a Li fluoride-rich solid electrolyte interphase is preconstructed to passivate Li metal, suppress LiPS corrosion, and extend the cycling lifespan of Li–S batteries by 57% under harsh working conditions. This work identifies the chemical nature of nonuniform Li deposition following the galvanic corrosion mechanism and highlights the importance of passivating Li metal anodes to realize long-cycling Li–S batteries.},

In particular, the phase-separation system was constituted by a mutant Fc fragment from the human IgG1 and a peptide specifically bound to the mutant Fc. Further, by tethering the phase separation scaffolds to nanobodies targeting specific cell-surface receptors CXCR4 and DR5, we could specifically activate DR5 signaling in CXCR4 + cells. Moreover, the CXCR4/DR5-targeting phase separation system efficiently induced tumor cell apoptosis and tumor growth inhibition in the xenograft model, offering a novel strategy for tumor-specific apoptosis induction.

However, the relationship between the molecular aggregation and the magnitude of nonlinear two-photon absorption cross-section remains underexplored. Here, we systematically investigate the aggregation-dependent two-photon absorption properties of the fluorophore TPAPhCN by tuning the degree of aggregation. We observe a steady increase in the two-photon absorption cross-section as the fluorophore evolves from the single molecular state to the highly aggregated state. It is found that two-photon absorption signal emerges at an early stage of aggregation that is not observable by one-photon excitation. This divergence between the nonlinear and linear optical responses enables the construction of a dual-mode optical signature, allowing TPAPhCN to function as a self-reporting probe for each aggregation state. This work presents a sensitive and structure-responsive platform for precise aggregation-state sensing in complex environments and opens new opportunities for applications in materials diagnostics and intelligent optical sensing systems.},

In this work, we report the first method for the production of adipic acid from biomass-derived γ-valerolactone (GVL) with CO 2 and H 2 . It was discovered that the Rh catalyst with an I 2 promoter in a binary solvent system of AcOH/H 2 O could catalyze the reaction efficiently at an industrially relevant temperature (140 °C). A systematic and detailed analysis of the reaction pathway was conducted via experimental and DFT studies. The tandem one-pot process permits thermodynamic leveraging by coupling the thermodynamically unfavored GVL ring-opening with highly favored hydrocarboxylation, driving the overall reaction forward to diacid products. The reaction involves three key steps, including the reduction of CO 2 to CO and H 2 O by H 2 , the ring-opening of GVL to reaction intermediates, and the hydrocarboxylation of the intermediates with CO and H 2 O. The stable GVL can maintain a low concentration of the highly reactive intermediates and prevent their hydrogenation side reactions, which favors the high selectivity of diacids. Moreover, this strategy affords access to various diacids in high yields from different lactones, and the yield of the diacids could reach 89%. This protocol opens the way for the sustainable synthesis of adipic acid from two renewable carbon resources and a green reductant (H 2 ).},

Among other scenarios, Ni-catalyzed borylation of aryl and benzyl methyl ethers via C(sp 2 )– and C(sp 3 )–OMe cleavage is a particularly attractive endeavor, given that the resulting organoboranes are privileged synthons of utmost relevance in organic synthesis and materials science. Intriguingly, the nature of the boron reagent dictates whether functionalization occurs at the C(sp 2 )– or C(sp 3 )–OMe fragment. Herein, we report a detailed study aimed at understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of this reaction and the origins of site-selectivity. We conclude that the divergency in site-selectivity arises from a different nickel speciation within the catalytic cycle. Specifically, our investigations reveal that catalytic functionalization at the C(sp 2 )–OMe bond occurs via a Ni(I) manifold in the presence of B 2 nep 2 whereas a canonical Ni(0)/Ni(II) regime is responsible for the corresponding C(sp 3 )–OMe bond-cleavage with B 2 pin 2 as coupling partner. These findings focus attention on the critical role that metal speciation might have for dictating site-selectivity in other related cross-coupling reactions.},

  abstract     = {Copper is an essential element for sustaining life. However, disruptions in copper homeostasis underpin disease, as illustrated by cuproptosis, an emerging form of cell death resulting from aberrant accumulation of copper pools in loosely bound, labile forms. Along these lines, activity-based sensing (ABS) offers a powerful strategy for tracking labile copper fluxes with metal and oxidation state selectivity by exploiting analyte reactivity for analyte detection. Traditional ABS probes for Cu(I), the major oxidation state of copper in cells, are selective but require O 2 as a coadditive, thus limiting their temporal resolution and sensitivity. Here, we present the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a first-generation ABS strategy for direct Cu(I) sensing by leveraging alkyne-directed cleavage reactivity. Copper Alkyne Probe-1 (CAP-1) features a rapid response to changes in intracellular Cu(I) pools with over 400-fold selectivity for Cu(I) over competing biological metals. We apply this probe to identify novel metal–metal crosstalk in cuproptosis, where we observe that Mn(II) exposure sensitizes cells to cuproptosis through upregulating the mitochondrial reductase FDX1 and depleting reduced glutathione, thus synergistically elevating labile Cu(I) levels. By revealing an interplay between copper and manganese in regulating cell death, this work provides a starting point for broader investigations of metal–metal nutrient crosstalk in biology and medicine.},

Herein, a series of magic-numbered cluster ions of hydrated lanthanum oxide were studied by combining laser ablation mass spectrometry, infrared photon dissociation spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations. Based on the identified most stable isomers of the clusters, a new mechanism for OH migration has been revealed, in which the vibrational rocking of OH groups results in the migration of OH groups on the surfaces of the clusters with an energy barrier less than 12 kcal/mol.

However, their large lateral dimensions make excitons sensitive to environments and enhance multiexciton emission, casting long-standing doubt on their viability as SPSs. Here, we demonstrate bright room-temperature single-photon emission (SPE) with high purity and minimal blinking from in-plane-engineered (IPE) 2D QWs incorporating a doubly gradient architecture. A compositionally graded CdSe/CdSe x S 1– x core in the in-plane direction tailors electron–hole wavefunctions to control multiexciton Auger dynamics, while a graded Cd y Zn 1– y S shell in the thickness direction suppresses interfacial strain and nonradiative defects. This design unites 0D and 2D structural advantages, achieving near-unity ensemble PLQY and bright SPE (0.6–1.2 × 10 5 counts/s, NA = 0.65). Controlling the CdSe core size via IPE, we attain 92% single-photon purity (2 nm core), and suppressed blinking with a 96.9% ON-time fraction (8 nm core). This work establishes deterministic design rules for colloidal 2D QWs as high-performance SPSs for scalable quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Selective hydrocarbon oxidation processes are central in fine and commodity chemical production and are sensitive to the nature of the active metal sites and their surrounding coordination environment. Isometallic Fe-based carboxylate MOFs (MIL-100, MIL-101, and NH 2 -MIL-101) are employed to elucidate how Fe coordination environments and framework topology influence a probe aryl (styrene) oxidation mediated by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). MIL-101 shows the highest oxygenate production turnover rates, as normalized by in situ thiophene titrations, followed by NH 2 -MIL-101 and MIL-100. Post reaction e x situ Mössbauer spectroscopy elucidates Fe(II) formation under reaction conditions that underpin increased oxygenate production turnover rates; this Fe(II) formation was enabled by the reductive elimination of halide capping ligands unique to the MIL-101 family but not present in MIL-100 that only contains hydroxyls. Defect undercoordinated Fe sites promote unproductive H 2 O 2 decomposition and secondary oxygenate formation but do not perturb primary oxygenate selectivities. Conversely, stabilizing hydrogen-bonding interactions between N–H donors and postulated benzaldehyde metallocycle transition state structures confer NH 2 -MIL-101 100% selectivity for the primary oxygenate product benzaldehyde over styrene oxide at differential styrene conversions (<3%) compared to a maximum of 59% for MIL-101. Although a fraction of linker amine moieties oxidize to form nitro groups within NH 2 -MIL-101, Fe leaching, identified as a contributor to catalyst deactivation for all frameworks, is reduced. Overall, this work showcases how seemingly subtle changes and perturbations to the coordination environments local to metal sites influence the observed reactivity, selectivity, and stability for oxidative (and other) transformations within MOF-catalyzed reaction systems throughout their lifetimes.},

Its potential for modifying nonribosomal natural products remains unexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that integrates GCE with the directed evolution of cyclodipeptide synthase (CDPS) to engineer a new class of CDPSs capable of biosynthesizing cyclodipeptides containing ncAAs. Using this approach, we achieve the efficient incorporation of 4-azido- l -phenylalanine into AlbC-derived cyclodipeptides, generating a diverse array of new-to-nature cyclodipeptides. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations provide insights into the potential catalytic mechanisms responsible for the enhanced recognition of ncAA-tRNAs by engineered CDPS variants. Furthermore, we expand the substrate scope to additional ncAAs and extend this approach to other CDPSs, enabling the creation of an even broader range of novel compounds. Together, these findings reveal the significant potential of GCE technology to precisely engineer biomolecules beyond proteins, unlocking new structural and functional diversity.},

  abstract     = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are abundantly present in space. The grandPAH hypothesis states that small PAHs are photodissociated, while large symmetric PAHs survive the harsh environments in space. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that large aromatic molecules (C n H m with n ≥ 60) can convert to buckminsterfullerene (C 60 ). In this work, we test these hypotheses by studying the products formed upon dissociative electron ionization of two isomeric C 14 H 10 PAHs, anthracene and phenanthrene. The fragment ions that are formed following H loss and H 2 loss are isolated in a cryogenically-cooled 22-pole ion trap and tagged with neon. Infrared predissociation spectra are recorded of the thus formed van der Waals bound complexes and the PAH dissociation fragments are identified based on a comparison with density functional theory (DFT) calculated spectra. The ionized PAHs undergo radical isomerization prior to the loss of H or H 2 , resulting in a highly symmetric daughter ion that is identical for the two distinctly different parent PAHs. Moreover, the product ions are found to obey the isolated pentagon rule, which also curves fullerenes and contributes to their structural stability. We propose a mechanism for the radical isomerization based on existing molecular dynamics simulations from the literature augmented by DFT calculations. This study lends credit to the grandPAH hypothesis by showing that PAH species isomerize drastically to form a new molecule that is highly symmetric. Moreover, the formation of a daughter species that obeys the isolated-pentagon rule suggests that there is a strong chemical link between interstellar PAHs and fullerenes.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of new weak supramolecular interactions and supramolecular synthons is essential for directing self-assembly processes with enhanced precision, diversity, and functionality in complex molecular architectures. Here, we report the controlled self-assembly of diverse supramolecular architectures by a new directional bonding approach through the integration of radical-based dynamic covalent chemistry and supramolecular synthons. A novel macrocyclic synthon, S1 , with a linear direction is constructed via radical-based dynamic covalent bonds from the phenothiazine building block substituted with two dicyanomethyl radicals. By coupling S1 with phenanthrene- and carbazole-based linkers with different angles, we achieve precise and controllable self-assembly. As anticipated, when S1 is paired with a 60° phenanthrene linker, a triangular superstructure, the macrocycle-bridged macrocycle M1 , is formed. Notably, coupling S1 with a nearly 90° carbazole linker yields two distinct superstructures, M2 and M3 , with triangular and quadrangular geometries, respectively. Interestingly, both the synthon and its assembled superstructures exhibit intriguing thermal association and dissociation behaviors, facilitated by the formation of stable chromogenic radicals. This dynamic process was thoroughly investigated by using VT-UV–vis–NIR, VT-NMR, and VT-EPR spectroscopies. More significantly, the reversible dissociation and association of radical-based dynamic covalent bonds enable the full thermal conversion of M2 and M3 . This study highlights the potential of integrating radical-based dynamic covalent chemistry with supramolecular synthons as an emerging strategy for the precise construction of sophisticated and multifunctional supramolecular architectures, paving the way for the development of novel stimuli-responsive materials.},

Our results reveal that although the two PF-46396 enantiomers exhibit distinct binding modes, they both possess similar anti-HIV potency. PF-46396 binding arrests IP6 dynamics in the six-helix bundle pore, and the two enantiomers induce unique IP6 orientations in the pore.

However, the chemical conversion capacity of most PBSs has inherent limitations, as whole-cell bacteria and isolated enzymes require fine-tuning of environmental conditions. Here, we report a new PBS developed by introducing free-standing ceria nanoparticles into the purple membrane (PM) of Halobacterium salinarum archaea, which can unidirectionally transfer charge carriers in response to incident photons, even after separation from living archaea at various conditions. Our microscopy, spectroscopy, and synchrotron X-ray scattering analyses confirm that the electrostatic assembly between ceria and PM creates seamless interfacial contact, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic capacity of ceria. Although the conversion of dinitrogen (N 2 ) to ammonia (NH 3 ) is thermodynamically challenging due to the triple bond in N 2 and a series of charge-transfer reactions, our PM–ceria (PMC) hybrid nanoparticle efficiently produces NH 3 by reducing N 2 using solar energy even under atmospheric pressure and room temperature while simultaneously converting glycerol into value-added derivatives. Additionally, our PMC nanoparticle involves neither toxic/precious metals nor bioengineering processes to achieve enhanced photocatalytic N 2 -to-NH 3 conversion. This study sheds light on the new aspect of PBSs by employing PM to potentially resolve the global energy and environmental challenges posed by the conventional Haber–Bosch process.},

  abstract     = {Monolayer MoS 2 is attractive for future photonics and optoelectronics for its direct-gap excitons with ultrahigh binding energies. However, the atomically thin structure is prone to nonradiative defects, challenging to scale for large-area production, and inherently limited in optical cross-section, all hindering technological integration. Stacking monolayers to increase the optical cross-section results in multilayers with diminished photoluminescence activity. Electrochemical molecular intercalation of multilayer MoS 2 weakens interlayer coupling, creating a bulk monolayer material that retains monolayer characteristics within a multilayered “bulk” architecture. However, the electrochemical process often severely degrades the optical quality and is difficult to implement for scalable thin film production. Here, we report a luminescent monolayer MoS 2 colloidal ink for scalable solution processing of large-area bulk monolayer MoS 2 membranes with thickness-scalable bright luminescence. Using perfluorinated sulfonic-acid ionomer (Nafion) as a multifunctional ligand, we achieve a stable dispersion of monolayer MoS 2 ink that can be readily processed into large-area stretchable membranes with diverse form factors. The Nafion interlayers decouple interlayer interactions while effectively passivating nonradiative defects, preserving direct-gap monolayer characteristics in thickness-scalable MoS 2 /Nafion membranes. This leads to unprecedented enhancements in both linear and nonlinear excitonic transitions, showing over 100-fold brighter excitonic photoluminescence and nearly 1000 times stronger second harmonic generation. These remarkable properties remain robust against intense laser irradiation, diverse environmental conditions, and mechanical deformations. Our studies overcome the longstanding challenge of poor optical quality in solution-processed monolayer MoS 2 ink materials, establishing a large-area, thickness-scalable platform for excitonic devices across diverse technological domains, including photonics, optoelectronics, solution-processable bioelectronics, and electrochemical sensing.},

By leveraging the antioxidant properties and thiol-mediated uptake potential of lipoic acid, we identified LA-A2B2CD3 as an optimal candidate through a structure–activity relationship study and design of experiment (DOE) optimization. LA-A2B2CD3 LNPs exhibited superior reactive oxygen species scavenging, enhanced mRNA translation, and reduced inflammatory cytokine production in vitro and in vivo . Mechanistic studies revealed that the efficient cellular uptake and the transdermal delivery capacity of LA-A2B2CD3 heavily rely on the reducible disulfide ring of lipoic acid. Application of LA-A2B2CD3 LNPs for the localized transdermal delivery of Cas9 mRNA and CD93 sgRNA in a murine model of psoriasis resulted in effective CD93 genome editing and the inhibition of the CD93–p38 MAPK–AKT–SMAD2/3 pathway, leading to significant therapeutic improvement.

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic water splitting offers a scalable and potentially low-cost route for the production of renewable hydrogen. Recently, a state-of-the-art system based on flux-mediated Al 3+ -doped SrTiO 3 , modified with Rh–Cr-based proton reduction and CoOOH water oxidation cocatalysts, achieved apparent quantum yields for unassisted water splitting of up to 93%. Herein, we focus on the role of Al 3+ doping and Rh–Cr-based cocatalyst deposition on the accumulation and reaction dynamics of the long-lived holes required to drive water oxidation. We employ in situ and operando photoinduced absorption spectroscopy (PIAS) under water splitting conditions complemented by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS data indicate that Al 3+ doping suppresses surface Ti 3+ defect states, coinciding with a 5-fold increase in the accumulation of long-lived SrTiO 3 holes observed by PIAS. Rh–Cr-based cocatalyst addition is observed to further enhance the yield and lifetime (s–10 s time scales) of these photoaccumulated holes, assigned to the efficient electron extraction by this cocatalyst. These photoaccumulated holes exhibit fast (ca. 1 s) and slow (ca. 10 s) decay phases. While the dominant fast phase is assigned to the desired water oxidation reaction, the slow phase is assigned to deeply trapped unreactive holes; the yield of these unreactive holes is suppressed by facet-selective photodeposition of cocatalysts or preillumination. These results provide key insights into how Al:SrTiO 3 functionalized by Rh–Cr-based cocatalysts accumulates oxidizing holes with lifetimes long enough to drive the kinetically challenging water oxidation reaction, thus achieving remarkably high quantum efficiencies for overall water splitting, insights which can be applied in the design of future photocatalytic materials.},

Despite its significant potential, ensuring efficacy in vivo typically requires rapid reaction kinetics, high-efficiency payload release, and stable reactants; however, relevant reports remain sparse. Herein, we developed a strain-promoted alkyne-nitrone cycloaddition (SPANC)-based click-release chemistry through installation of a carbamate-linked release moiety at the propargyl position of cyclooctyne, triggering a spontaneous elimination following click cycloaddition to achieve efficient payload liberation. This bioorthogonal click-release system demonstrates rapid reaction kinetics and high-yield payload liberation while maintaining exceptional stability under both in vitro and cellular conditions. Furthermore, we established a facile synthesis of highly click-reactive nitrones, enabling the construction of a systematic substrate library and validating the broad applicability of this strategy. In the context of implementation, our developed bioorthogonal anticancer prodrugs utilize nitrone-mediated activation to unmask anticancer activity. In 4T1 murine breast cancer models, this bioorthogonal prodrug activation strategy demonstrated significant tumor suppression with favorable safety profiles, validating the feasibility of this click-release chemistry for in vivo use.},

  abstract     = {The Li + solvation structure and the electrode–electrolyte interface critically determine the cell performance. Here, we systematically compare the effects of the coordination ability of ether with Li + on cell performance, from ultrastrong coordinating solvents (crown ethers) to a moderate coordinating solvent (dimethoxyethane) and weak coordinating solvents (diol dimethyl ethers). Compared with the moderate coordinating ether, both weak and strong coordinating ethers show improved antioxidation capability, while weak coordinating ethers facilitate faster Li + desolvation and enable better performance with the Li-metal anode. Dimethoxypropane shows a relatively better electrochemical performance owing to the coexistence of strong chelating and weak monodentate coordination with Li + . Furthermore, introducing interfacial passivators of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide and fluoroethylene carbonate further improves the cell performance and narrows the gap among solvents. Based on their respective benefits of solvents, we propose a hybrid electrolyte combining strongly coordinating 12-crown-4 (12-C-4) for Li + capture and weakly coordinating hexanediol dimethyl ether (HDE) as an ion-conductive diluent. The strong coordination of 12-C-4 with Li + and the dual anions in axial coordination facilitate the construction of an inorganic-rich cathode/electrolyte interphase, while the HDE diluent buffers the energy barrier during Li + desolvation and uniforms Li-plating. This hybrid electrolyte exhibits higher ionic conductivity and better interfacial stability with both the anode and cathode than single ether, significantly improving the cycling stability of Li//LiNi 0.85 Mn 0.075 Co 0.075 O 2 cells and bringing a new electrolyte design paradigm for high-voltage ether electrolytes.},

  abstract     = {Carbon–hydrogen bond activation is a pillar of synthetic chemistry. While it is generally accepted that Pd is more facile than Ni in C–H activation catalysis, there are no experimental platforms available to directly compare the magnitude of C–H bond weakening between Ni and Pd prior to bond scission. This work presents the first direct measurements of C(sp 3 )–H bond acidity (p K a ) and bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) for a species containing a ligated alkane–palladium interaction (R 2 CH 2 ···Pd), also known as an agostic interaction. Through standard-state equilibrium measurements and advanced computational modeling, we show that Pd acidifies C(sp 3 )–H bonds 100,000 times more than Ni (5 p K a units), indicating that acidification is a key factor making Pd a privileged metal in C(sp 3 )–H functionalization reactions. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) calculations show that this is primarily due to a greater electrophilicity of the palladium containing fragment, as forward charge transfer (Δ E CTf ) from the agostic methylene moiety into [Pd] is significantly increased. More broadly, these valuable findings help unravel fundamental performance differences between Earth-abundant and precious metals, potentially guiding future ligand design efforts for catalysis.},

  abstract     = {Zeolite-confined Rh-based catalysts have emerged as promising heterogeneous candidates for olefin hydroformylation. However, they face challenges of reactant- and product-induced Rh leaching and aggregation. Herein, zeolite framework-anchored Rh δ+ –(O–Zn) x sites were designed and are shown to have remarkable activity and stability for gas-phase ethylene hydroformylation. The bimetallic catalysts were synthesized by coencapsulating Rh and Zn species into Silicalite-1 zeolite, and the Rh δ+ –(O–Zn) x sites were in situ constructed during the induction period of the hydroformylation process through the interaction between mobile Rh-carbonyl species and framework ≡SiOZn–O(H). The change of the Zn/Rh molar ratio significantly affects the dispersion of Rh and the proportion of highly active Rh δ+ . The optimal 0.2Rh@Zn 3 -S-1 catalyst achieves a propanal turnover frequency as high as 148 h –1 at 363 K and shows no sign of deactivation during the 40 h test. In contrast, zinc-free 0.2Rh@S-1 suffers rapid deactivation due to Rh aggregation. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveals that the transfer desorption of propanal from Rh to Zn–O contributes to the redispersion of Rh during the construction of Rh δ+ –(O–Zn) x structures. Moreover, the observed HRh(CO) 2 species together with the enrichment of Rh δ+ -propionyl intermediates on the catalyst indicates that the hydrogenation of acyl species is the rate-limiting step of ethylene hydroformylation, which is further supported by kinetic analysis. This study presents a new strategy for designing stable and efficient gas-phase ethylene hydroformylation catalysts using zeolite-anchored metal species as inorganic ligands for Rh δ+ centers and provides insights into the hydroformylation mechanism occurring on the bimetallic sites.},

  abstract     = {The cytosolic iron–sulfur cluster assembly (CIA) targeting complex maturates over 30 cytosolic and nuclear Fe–S proteins, raising the question of how a single complex recognizes such a diverse set of clients. The discovery of a C-terminal targeting complex recognition (TCR) peptide in up to 25% of CIA clients provided a clue to substrate specificity, yet the molecular and energetic basis for this interaction remained unresolved. By integrating computational and biochemical approaches, we show that the TCR peptide binds a conserved interface between the Cia1 and Cia2 subunits of the targeting complex, even in the absence of the Fe–S cluster. Since this same site also mediates binding of predominantly apo-Nar1, the proposed Fe–S cluster carrier, we provide in vitro evidence for Nar1’s role as a cluster trafficking protein in the CIA pathway. We further show that Cia1–Cia2 complex formation is essential for CIA function as substitutions disrupting this interface, including the disease-linked R65W Cia1 variant, impair TCR peptide-dependent client recruitment. Our findings also clarify the role of the poorly characterized human paralog Cia2a, proposed to act solely in iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) maturation. We find that a Cia1–Cia2a complex can bind the TCR peptide, suggesting a broader role for Cia2a in Fe–S protein biogenesis, as IRP1 lacks a TCR motif. Together, these findings define a well-conserved molecular mechanism for client recognition in the CIA pathway and uncover how CIA targeting complex assembly and client identification are mechanistically linked to human disease.},

  abstract     = {The transition phase is a unique intermediate-state material with structural characteristics of two distinct phases, and the coexistence of diverse structural units endows it with intriguing chemical properties. However, preparing stable transition phase materials is a challenge. Here, a highly active transition phase is precisely captured from a birnessite-to-spinel transition via an ion-steric strategy. The intercalation of Ca 2+ affects the thermodynamics of phase transition, hinders the migration of Co 2+ , and broadens the phase transition temperature window from 450–500 °C to 400–600 °C, enabling the capture of favorable transition phase material (Ca-TP-op) with short-range ordered spinel configuration and long-range disordered MO 6 (M = Mn, Co) octahedral framework structure at 500 °C. The novel structures within transition phases promote electron transfer, alter orbital hybridization, and activate lattice oxygen. Consequently, Ca-TP-op demonstrates efficient oxygen evolution reaction activity, surpassing both the composite and mechanical mixture of birnessite and spinel. The universality of the ion-steric strategy can be demonstrated by the intercalation of Na, K, Mg, Sr, and Ba ions. This work successfully pioneers a new transition phase catalytic material system that offers insights on the development of efficient functional catalysts.},

However, specifically and quantitatively tracking Arg dynamics in situ presents a significant challenge. Herein, we developed a series of Arg probes (Rap1–9) based on the nucleophilic substitution reaction between a phenyl-activated ester and a primary amine. Among these, the optimized NIR-emission ratiometric fluorescent probe Rap-9 demonstrated the most pronounced electrophilicity at its reactive site, enabling rapid and specific detection of Arg both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, Rap-9 was successfully utilized for real-time imaging of Arg dynamics during O 2 ·– -stimulated NSC differentiation. Further studies revealed that Arg-mediated activation of the mTORC1 pathway could coordinate qNSC reactivation and neuronal differentiation by regulating mitochondrial energy metabolism from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. These findings not only enhanced our understanding of the metabolic pathways governing NSC differentiation but also offered new perspectives for neuroscience research and potential therapeutic interventions.},

DNA-based neural networks, with their potential advantages in versatility, scalability, and energy efficiency, offer a promising alternative to traditional systems. However, despite significant advancements in pattern recognition and algorithm accuracy, current DNA-based neural networks, relying on the complementary pairing of DNA nucleobases, suffer from the nonreusability of their computing materials. This limitation not only raises operational costs but also restricts their capacity for implementing learning mechanisms. Here, we introduce an unprecedented noncomplementary DNA-based perceptron (NCP) computation strategy, marking the first successful demonstration of a reusable DNA-based neural network. We present a “tagging” strategy to facilitate the scaling-up of noncomplementary DNA-based neural network. We show that 4-bit molecular pattern recognition can be simply achieved through strand-displacement reactions between four input strands and four pairs of noncomplementary DNA duplexes in the NCP, with weighting values modulated by duplex concentrations. Furthermore, a noncomplementary “winner-take-all” module enables decision-making, as demonstrated in an “I Spy” game task. Most importantly, by utilizing removable input strands (lipid–oligonucleotide conjugates), our NCP-based neural network enables reliable multicycle computations, overcoming the critical reusability challenge in DNA-based neural network computation. This work pioneers reusability in DNA-based neural networks, offering a practical path to molecular computing systems with learning capabilities.},

With the synergy of • OH-initiated oxidation, SO 4 2– activates amine ions through deprotonation, producing imine molecules as ozonation intermediates. Subsequently, HSO 4 – accelerates the formation of the intermediate aminomethanol and ozonation products. Moreover, this novel ozonation mechanism of amine salt is verified to be efficient for sulfate fine PM and is not feasible for chloride or nitrate fine PM.

Conformational dynamics underlie this process, allowing the transporter to sample at least two conformations, nominally grouped into inward- and outward-facing states. While studies of structure and dynamics have revealed atomistic insight into transport mechanisms and transport rates, the relative free energy differences among conformations remain underexplored. In this work, we quantified free energy differences between inward- and outward-facing conformations of the multidrug E. coli transporter EmrE using 19 F NMR spectroscopy. EmrE consists of an antiparallel and asymmetric homodimer, where its quaternary structure resembles the inverted repeat structures found in larger nonoligomeric transporters. NMR experiments were performed using a minimal heterodimer of EmrE, where a single mutation was introduced into one monomer of the native EmrE homodimer. We discovered that a single conservative mutation perturbed the conformational equilibrium between inward- and outward-facing states by up to 1.5 kcal/mol. Surprisingly, we also found that as little as a single fluorine atom influenced the equilibrium by up to 0.8 kcal/mol. These measurements provide quantitative evidence that subtle changes influence the free energy landscape of a transporter, suggesting a plasticity that may be beneficial in divergent evolution to tune the transport mechanism.},

Following this approach, the coimplantation of nontrivial topology and flatband structures in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) has emerged as a compelling pursuit, serving as platforms for realizing exotic quantum phases of matter through the interplay of topological states and strong correlations. However, the exploration of these intriguing properties has been largely constrained by the limited known on-surface reactions capable of creating topological flatbands in GNRs. In this work, we promote the intermolecular oxidative coupling of concealed non-Kekuléan nanographenes to construct topological flatband GNRs and GNR heterojunctions on the Au(111) surface. Utilizing Clar’s goblet as a proof of concept, we demonstrate repetitive intermolecular cyclodehydrogenation with high regioselectivity to form pentagon-embedded GNRs. The coupling of the zero modes in Clar’s goblets generates extended electronic states with evident nodes between them, arising from inherent topological frustration, thus resulting in topological flatbands close to the Fermi level and topologically protected end states. Our atomically resolved measurements obtained using scanning tunneling microscopy and noncontact atomic force microscopy, complemented by density functional theory and tight-binding model calculations, illustrate the on-surface reaction cascade and the electronic properties of the designed products. These findings open significant opportunities for the on-surface construction of low-dimensional carbon-based quantum materials.},

The concomitant nickase-induced separation of the CDN leads to the parent reaction circuit, and to the transient formation and depletion of the Met-dimer complex. By labeling the components comprising the reaction circuits with fluorophores, the dynamic transient reconfiguration of the CDN and the accompanying Met-dimer formation and separation within the cell membranes are characterized by temporal confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging. Moreover, the transient formation of the Met-dimer in the MCF-7 cell membrane induces intracellular signaling and activation of the Akt/FAK phosphorylation pathway.

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic α-C–H activation of alcohols to form aldehydes and ketones represents an important synthetic pathway, although the selective formation of C-centered radicals remains challenging due to competing O–H activation processes. While extensive research has explored heterojunction band alignment, charge transfer directionality, and component-specific redox reactions, the atomic structure at interfaces and its catalytic role have received limited attention. Here, we demonstrate a TiO 2 -CuO heterojunction photocatalyst that achieves exceptional selectivity in the oxidation of isopropanol to acetone, with a hydrogen production rate of approximately 4400 μmol/g/h. Through complementary characterization using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), we identify the formation of asymmetric Ti-O(H)-Cu + units at the TiO 2 /CuO heterojunction interface. In situ EPR reveals a ·C(OH)(CH 3 ) 2 radical intermediate, confirming that the reaction proceeds via selective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) of the α-C–H bond in isopropanol, in contrast to that of TiO 2 or CuO, which proceed via hydrogen extraction of the OH group. These mechanistic insights into interface-mediated catalysis provide new design principles for engineering atomic-scale catalytic interfaces, offering new opportunities for developing next-generation photocatalysts across diverse catalytic applications.},

  abstract     = {RNA is a key drug target that can be modulated by small molecules; however, covalent binders of RNA remain largely unexplored. Using a high-throughput mass spectrometry screen of 2,000 electrophilic compounds, we identified ligands that react with RNA in a binding-dependent manner. RNA reactivity was influenced by both the reactive group and the noncovalent RNA-binding scaffold. In addition to known RNA-reactive electrophiles such as N -acylimidazoles and bis(2-chloroethyl)amines, covalent screening enabled the surprising discovery that common thiol-reactive electrophiles (chloroacetamide) and rarely characterized electrophiles (3-chloropivalamide) cross-linked to RNA. These results suggest that electrophiles commonly used for protein targeting can also covalently modify RNA, potentially contributing to both on- and off-target effects. This insight enabled the design of an RNA-specific covalent compound by modifying a bis-benzimidazole scaffold, originally identified to bind DNA, to react selectively with the expanded triplet repeat RNA, r(CUG) exp , that causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Selectivity appears to arise from differences in the RNA and DNA binding modes, revealing that proper positioning of the electrophile toward the nucleophilic guanine residue is important for efficient covalent bond formation. Overall, this study highlights the potential of rationally designing covalent RNA-targeting small molecules.},

  abstract     = {RNA targeting represents a compelling strategy for addressing challenging therapeutic targets that are otherwise intractable through traditional protein targeting. Revolutionary approaches in RNA-focused small molecule libraries have successfully identified RNA-binding ligands but generally remain limited in diversity and impeded by a dearth of structural insight into RNA and RNA complexes. Cyclic peptides are potential structural mimics of evolutionary RNA-protein interacting motifs and can be massively diversified and selected via genetically encoded libraries, offering a complementary approach. This study introduces genetically encoded thioether cyclic peptide libraries constructed through mRNA display using a dibromoxylene linker and its fluorosulfonyl derivative that can covalently engage RNA nucleophiles. Using an optimized mRNA display workflow for RNA binders, we discovered high affinity, covalent and noncovalent binders for SNCA 5′ UTR IRE, the upstream iron-responsive element that post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of α-synuclein, an intrinsically disordered protein implicated in Parkinsonism and related neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, a stringent selection strategy employing “base-paired” target analog counterselection enhanced specificity by deenriching nonspecific electrostatic interactions mediated by polycationic residues. Further engineering hit peptides with an imidazole tag yielded selective RNA degraders in which covalent degraders showed noticeably improved potency from noncovalent counterparts. This work provides a prototype framework for evolution-driven, high-throughput, RNA-targeted drug discovery using cyclic peptides.},

Decoherence is strongly sensitive to solution phase viscosity, pointing to molecular tumbling as an important decoherence mechanism. Accordingly, immobilization of [IrBr 6 ] 2– molecules in thin polymer films results in an order-of-magnitude increase in coherence lifetime and significantly greater magnetic field sensitivity. By tuning energies of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) states, TRFE/R enables spin initialization and readout in the tissue transparency window, paving the way toward all-optical, ultrafast molecular electron spin coherence imaging in biological systems.},

To overcome this limitation, we developed cyclic dipeptide-derived hydroxylamine building blocks that enable the formation of canonical amino acids directly under modified KAHA ligation conditions. These building blocks are prepared from dipeptides and are applicable at nonobvious peptide ligation junctions, including Leu–Ile and Lys–Ile. We applied this approach to the synthesis of K48/K63 selectively protected ubiquitin monomers for chemoenzymatic ubiquitin chain formation and the total synthesis of tirzepatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist peptide therapeutic containing amino-isobutyric acid (Aib) residues and a fatty acid side chain modification.

Herein, we report a nickel-catalyzed CDC reaction between aldehydes and alkenes for the synthesis of skipped enones, leveraging aryl radicals as intermolecular HAT agents. The transformation proceeds via the in situ generation of aryl radicals from aryl bromides, which mediates HAT from both the aldehydic and allylic C–H bonds to generate acyl and allylic radicals, respectively.

The G-quadruplex represents a common motif in many high-specificity aptamers and is composed of complexed guanine residues. Here, we present a method for modulating G-quadruplex aptamer binding kinetics through use of a polycytosine strand that can destabilize quadruplex structure and accelerate target release in a predictable manner.

The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) offers a promising pathway to produce value-added chemicals and fuels, including methanol─a key chemical building block and energy carrier. This approach presents a carbon-neutral alternative to conventional, fossil fuel-based methanol production. However, replacing well-established thermochemical processes and achieving cost-competitive production requires the development of highly efficient and selective catalysts for CO 2 -to-methanol conversion, as well as systematic device-level optimization. In this Perspective, we discuss the potential of methanol production via CO 2 RR and provide an overview of recent advances in catalyst development. We also propose experimental protocols for methanol quantification, emphasizing the critical need for rigorous evaluation of catalysts to ensure the validity and reproducibility of results, and demonstrating boron phosphide as an irreproducible case. We review seminal studies on CO 2 RR by cobalt phthalocyanine to make methanol, and current understanding of the reaction mechanistic details. Lastly, we discuss the challenges associated with its translation into practical devices and outline future research opportunities to advance electrochemical CO 2 RR for methanol production at scale.},
