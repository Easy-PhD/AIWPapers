  abstract     = {Fluorine, due to its unique ability to modify the physicochemical and biological properties of parent molecules, has found wide applications as pharmacological modulators in drug development research. Consequently, the portion of fluorine-containing drugs has increased to about 20% in recent years. Among these, fluorine-containing drugs with aromatic fluoro-substitutions are more common than those with fluoro-substitutions at stereogenic centers. In fact, in the past decade, out of 116 fluorine-containing drugs approved by the FDA only 16 drugs are enantiomerically pure, featuring fluorine-containing stereogenic carbon centers. Asymmetric induction during building these drug molecules is largely achieved through either the “chiral pool” or “chiral resolution” approach, while the “asymmetric catalysis” approach remains underexplored. In order to draw the attention of the scientific community to this disparity, this review highlights the innovations (2015–2024) in asymmetric methodologies for creating molecules bearing a fluorine-containing stereogenic carbon center in the presence of organo- or organometallic catalysts. The synthetic strategies are divided into two sections based on fluorine-containing building blocks and fluorine-containing reagents, which are further classified by the reaction types. Special attention has been paid to synthetic challenges, types of substrates, products and catalysts, functional group compatibility, transition states, mechanistic insights, as well as synthetic applications.},

  abstract     = {The transport of anionic species across phospholipid bilayers is an important biological function that plays a vital role in cellular and organismal homeostasis. The function is normally performed by transmembrane transport proteins, but several diseases have been linked to malfunctioning or malregulation of these proteins (so-called “channelopathies”). As a consequence, supramolecular chemists have tried to develop synthetic molecules that can transport anions across biological membranes. While the original goal of this endeavor was the development of potential therapeutics for channelopathies, it is now clear that there are several other potential medical and nonmedical applications for synthetic transmembrane anion transporters. The medical applications of synthetic anion transporters have been widely explored, especially their potential as anticancer agents. However, there are many other applications of synthetic anion transporters that are often overlooked. These range from antibacterial activity and drug delivery, to nonmedical applications such as biomimicry, the development of optical sensors, catalysis, organic synthesis and others. In this review, we aim to highlight the versatility of synthetic transmembrane anion transporters and to convince chemists to look beyond channelopathies and anticancer activity as applications of artificial anion transporters.},

  abstract     = {In catalysis, selectivity reflects the energetic preference for the formation of a single product out of multiple possible reaction outcomes. The classic steric biasing approach in small-molecule catalysis employs steric destabilization of the undesired competing transition states to achieve energetic differentiation. In contrast, enzymes achieve high levels of rate acceleration and selectivity by accelerating the pathway leading to the major product, often through networks of attractive, stabilizing noncovalent interactions. This Review showcases selective noncovalent catalysis (NCC) with small organic molecules and transition-metal complexes. We collect and highlight examples whereby selectivity was documented experimentally to arise from selective stabilization of the transition state leading to the major product. We also showcase how synergistic experimental and computational investigations have enabled the elucidation of specific noncovalent interactions responsible for selective stabilization.},

However, creating intelligent, multifunctional soft robots demands navigating a complex, multiscale design landscape, ranging from molecular-level building blocks through multifunctional soft robotic materials to fully integrated systems. In this review, we present a structured roadmap that addresses key challenges at three critical scales. At the molecular level and nanoscale, we examine an extensive library of soft matter and functional nanomaterials that impart tunable mechanical, electrical, optical, and stimuli-responsive properties to soft robotic materials. At the microscale, we highlight effective assembly strategies, such as heterogeneous blending, bilayer integration, and additive manufacturing, enabling reconfigurable, multifunctional materials that combine rapid response, robust functionality, large deformation tolerance, and fatigue resistance. Finally, at the system level, we explore how integrating actuation mechanisms, sensing technologies, and computational tools with these advanced materials can yield intelligent, adaptive, and energy-efficient soft robotic systems. By bridging these multiscale gaps and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, this review provides near-, mid-, and long-term perspectives to guide future research, ultimately driving the development of transformative soft robots that elevate human–machine interactions.},

  abstract     = {The widespread use of radiofrequency (RF) communication has increased the exposure of organisms to electromagnetic fields, sparking a debate over the potential health effects of weak RF electromagnetic fields. While some experimental studies suggest that low-amplitude RF radiation may influence cellular metabolism or sleep patterns or even promote cancer, these claims remain controversial due to limited theoretical plausibility. Central to this debate is the radical pair mechanism (RPM), a quantum-mechanical framework proposed to mediate RF effects. Despite its role in magnetoreception and various magnetic field effects on chemical reactions, the RPM often fails to align with observations at low, nonthermal RF field strengths. This review examines these contrasting perspectives by discussing experimental findings and theoretical models that aim to explain putative biological effects of RF magnetic fields. Emphasis is placed on the challenges of reconciling theoretical predictions with empirical data, particularly in the context of weak RF exposure. Additionally, an overview of the theoretical framework used in current modeling efforts highlights the complexity of applying the RPM to biological systems and underscores the importance of critical interpretation. The goal is to clarify the state of understanding and inform future research on RPM-mediated biological effects under weak RF exposure.},

However, practical applications are often hindered by the activity limitations inherent in the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and the stability limitations associated with the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). Herein, we demonstrate structural changes induced by phase transformation in Co 1.5 Mn 1.5 spinel oxides, which yield more active octahedral sites with shortened intersite distance. This structure optimization favors a direct O–O radical coupling mechanism, which circumvents the involvement of the *OOH intermediate and prevents overoxidation of the active sites, significantly enhancing both the OER activity and stability. Consequently, the optimized CoMn-400 catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 268 mV at 10 mA cm –2 in 0.1 M KOH (310 mV for commercial RuO 2 ), and maintains negligible activity loss over 300 h’ chronopotentiometry test at a current density of 100 mA cm –2 . This simple strategy provides fundamental insights into transition metal oxide catalyst design and opens new possibilities for optimizing electrochemical energy conversion.},

One-electron oxidation of trans -(depe) 2 Fe(CH 3 ) 2 (depe = 1,2-bis(diethylphosphino)ethane) generated the corresponding isolable iron(III) dimethyl derivative that was unstable toward Fe–CH 3 homolysis. Oxidation of the corresponding iron(II) bis(aryl) complex trans -(depe) 2 Fe(tolyl) 2 resulted in rapid reductive elimination of the biaryl with formation of iron(I). These observations motivated the synthesis of the cationic iron(III) metallacycle derived from C–H activation of a neophyl ligand. This complex mediated the ortho -selective C(sp 2 )–H alkylation of a host of arene derivatives containing ketone, amide, pyridine, ester, and sulfoxide directing groups with greater selectivity and reactivity than the iron(II) counterpart. The effect of bis(phosphine) ligands was examined, where decreasing ligand lability correlated with a higher barrier. The experimental rate law, deuterium labeling studies, deuterium kinetic isotope effect experiments, and computational modeling support a reversible C–H activation step followed by rate-determining C(sp 2 )–C(sp 3 ) reductive elimination. Using design principles to minimize undesired reactivity, the iron(III) cycloneophyl complex mediated more facile and chemoselective C–H functionalization with a broader directing group compatibility than the iron(II) analog, arising from a combination of increased ligand lability, less exergonic substrate coordination, an enhanced orbital hybridization effect in C–H activation, and more facile C–C reductive elimination.},

  abstract     = {Albomycins are unusual sulfur-containing nucleosides from the species of Streptomyces that exhibit potent antibiotic activities against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria including clinical pathogens. Previous studies demonstrated that the twitch radical SAM enzyme AbmM catalyzes an oxidative sulfur-for-oxygen swapping reaction converting CDP to a 4′-hydroxy-4′-thiocytidine 5′-diphosphate intermediate in the initial step of albomycin biosynthesis. However, the fate of this intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway has remained elusive. Herein, the above intermediate after 5′-dephosphorylation is shown to undergo AbmG-catalyzed transformations via a cryptic double phosphorylation of its 4′-hydroxyl group followed by C–O bond cleavage to yield 5′-oxo-4′-thiocytidine. X-ray crystal structure analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of AbmG revealed Glu188 as the general base to perform C5′ deprotonation. Subsequent mechanistic studies using deuterated substrates demonstrated that the deprotonation at C5′ is pro - R specific and likely occurs concerted with elimination of pyrophosphate from C4′. This study not only highlights a unique nucleoside kinase with lyase activity to complete an overall dehydration reaction but also fills the gaps in the biosynthesis of the atypical thiofuranose core essential to the biological activities of albomycins.},

Leveraging the eCO 2 R side of the teeterboard calls for a fundamental understanding of the triphasic electrode process involving a complex arrangement of electric double layers (EDLs). Herein, a series of model catalysts with tailored cavernous parameters are fabricated to geometrically and spectroscopically decipher the competing HER and eCO 2 R processes that engage different proton sources. A comprehensive set of in situ/ operando spectro-electrochemical tools, including differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, vibrational spectra (Raman and Infrared), and rotating disk electrode, are combined to interrogate the geometrically modulated HER and eCO 2 R kinetics with exceptional temporal and spectral resolutions. We uncover that an overcrowded EDL zone comprising capacitively stored K + cations in closely packed nanocages disfavors eCO 2 R at high current densities via limited reaction volume, restrained CO 2 supply, and escalated water dissociation. We further show that, by meticulously crafting the mesoporous cavity structure and suitably expanding the hierarchical EDL zone, great acidic eCO 2 R performance of near-unity CO Faradaic efficiency can be achieved across a wide current range over a prolonged operation. This work offers profound insights into the spatial regulation of mass transport, local chemical environment, and EDL arrangement via tailored catalyst geometry toward high-efficiency eCO 2 R.},

The asymmetric synthesis of these compounds typically relies on oxidizing corresponding enantioenriched sulfilimines. Herein, we describe an effective catalytic system comprising CuI and an azabicyclo[2.2.1] carboxylic acid-derived amide ligand. This system enables the highly enantioselective coupling of S -alkyl sulfenamides with (hetero)aryl iodides to afford aryl alkyl sulfilimines. A wide range of functionalized (hetero)aryl iodides and S -alkyl sulfenamides are compatible under the reaction conditions, providing an attractive approach for assembling enantioenriched aryl alkyl sulfilimines. The utility of this method is demonstrated by the gram-scale asymmetric synthesis of clinical candidate TNG 260 and the formal asymmetric synthesis of three additional drug candidates.},

Despite compelling evidence supporting the existence of CH−π interactions, experimentally measuring these weak interactions remains challenging due to the coexistence of numerous stronger noncovalent interactions. Here, we construct a refined system to accurately compare the strength of CH−π interactions between phenylalanine derivatives and aliphatic amino acids through molecular exchange processes inside a protein nanopore. Based on a quantitative comparison of binding strengths, we found that CH−π interactions are primarily governed by dispersive attraction, and a more acidic C–H bond results in stronger CH−π interactions, both of which are consistent with the literature. Most importantly, we resolved the long-standing debate regarding the deuterium isotope effect on CH−π interactions and confirmed that deuterium forms weaker CD−π interactions compared to protic CH−π interactions.},

Owing to the multiple interactions between individual oligopyrrole molecules and an A–B–C-style stacking of the 2D honeycomb layers, crystalline chloride-SOF exhibits reasonable thermal stability and retains its structure upon desolvation. Treating contaminated water containing 100 mg L –1 picric acid (PA) with the desolvated form of chloride-SOF reduced the PA concentration to the low ng L –1 (ppt) level. Supporting studies provide evidence for the conclusion that the material captures PA through anion exchange and adaptive structural transformation, rather than pore-selectivity. Chloride-SOF thus showcases the potential of SOFs as structurally transformable materials useful for hazardous waste removal.},

  abstract     = {Single-atom Ni catalysts hold great promise for the acidic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), owing to their high CO selectivity. However, their performance under industrially relevant high current conditions is limited by the weak interaction between isolated Ni–N 4 sites and *COOH intermediates, restricting efficient CO 2 conversion. Here, we introduced edge-rich Ni–N 4 sites via support vacancy engineering to enhance *COOH adsorption, thereby boosting the CO 2 RR activity and selectivity in acidic media. Density functional theory calculations revealed that edge-rich Ni–N 4 sites induced an upward shift in the Ni d -band center, leading to stronger *COOH binding and improved reaction kinetics. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy images confirmed the uniform dispersion of single-atom Ni sites at the edge of the carbon support. X-ray adsorption spectroscopy further validated the successful anchoring of Ni–N 4 sites on the carbon nanotube matrix. Furthermore, in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy directly evidenced the enhanced *COOH binding on the engineered active sites. As a result, the optimized catalyst achieved a high CO faradaic efficiency exceeding 94.5% at 800 mA cm –2 , alongside a cathodic energy efficiency above 44.2% at pH = 1, suppressing previously reported benchmarks. This work establishes a versatile strategy for electronic structure modulation through edge-site engineering, offering a pathway to unlock the full potential of single-atom catalysts for the acidic CO 2 RR at high current densities.},

Electron-deficient phenols resist selective coupling due to their high oxidation potential, while monosubstituted phenols undergo uncontrolled overoxidation, making their selective transformation highly challenging. We present a strategy that harnesses in situ biphenol-boron complexation to suppress overoxidation, unlocking the selective catalytic oxidative coupling of both electron-deficient and monosubstituted phenols. This method is broadly applicable to both heterogeneous and homogeneous photocatalytic systems, each operating via distinct mechanisms. By overcoming a fundamental barrier in oxidative phenol coupling, this work not only redefines the scope of catalytic oxidative transformations but also paves the way for new advances in oxidative couplings with implications in pharmaceuticals and materials science.},

In this work, based on our developed metal-pincer nanoclusters and their unique di-coordination mode, we explored a functionalization method that allows flexible regulation of the spatial match/mismatch between the nanometal catalytic sites and the chiral organocatalytic sites of metal nanoclusters. A proline-functionalized Au 11 nanocluster was constructed as the dominant catalyst. It enables asymmetric Michael addition of aldehydes and nitroalkenes with high TON and enantio-/diastereoselectivity, affording γ-nitroaldehydes that can be further transformed into important organic molecules.

However, fusing different thermosets (A-B type fusion) remains challenging due to their distinct dynamic behaviors and variable activation energies for bond exchange. This study introduces catalyst-free solid-state C═C/C═N metathesis chemistry to achieve A-B type fusion between two distinct thermosets. Furthermore, by simply adjusting the mixing ratio of the parent thermosets, the thermal behavior, mechanical properties, activation energy ( E a ), and topology freezing transition temperature ( T v ) of the fused networks can be precisely tailored. This approach offers enhanced control over thermal and mechanical characteristics, rendering them suitable for diverse high-performance applications.

However, their practical operation suffers from sluggish kinetics and severe capacity deterioration in traditional carbonate electrolytes. Herein, ethoxy (pentafluoro) cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) and methyl (2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) carbonate (FEMC) are introduced as cosolvents to rejuvenate conventionally low-concentration (1 M) 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME)-based electrolytes. In the resultant 1 M KFSI-DME/PFPN/FEMC (3 vol %) electrolyte, the cyclotriphosphazene group of PFPN is revealed to not only mitigate the flammability of DME but also diminish the K + -DME interaction through steric hindrance. While FEMC preempts the DME-induced corrosion of the potassium anode by facilitating the formation of a KF-enriched interface. Consequently, ether cointercalation into graphite is successfully suppressed in K||graphite cells, exhibiting 96% capacity retention over 1800 cycles (a running time of 402 days). When the temperature drops from 50 to −20 °C, the K-ion full device retains a capacity as high as 89%. The study introduces a novel electrolyte regulation strategy that harmonizes intrinsic safety, rapid kinetics at subzero temperatures, and enduring cycle stability at the same time, thereby advancing the practical implementation of PIBs for the future.},

  abstract     = {Iron homeostasis is essential for the virulence of the opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus . The cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxin GrxD was recently shown to play a critical role in A. fumigatus iron metabolism via regulation of iron–sulfur (Fe–S) binding iron-responsive transcription factors and interaction with components of the cytosolic Fe–S cluster assembly pathway. Interestingly, the putative copper-binding metallothionein CmtA was also identified as a binding partner for GrxD; however, the metal-binding properties of both proteins and the nature of their interactions were unclear. Here, we addressed these open questions by recombinant expression and purification of GrxD and CmtA and analysis of their metal–protein and protein–protein interactions. Using elemental analysis and UV–visible absorption, circular dichroism, EXAFS, Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopies, we demonstrate that recombinant CmtA expressed in Escherichia coli can bind a [2Fe-2S] 2+ cluster, mononuclear Fe 2+ , Zn 2+ , and Cu + , while recombinant GrxD ligates a mixture of [2Fe-2S] 2+ and [3Fe-4S] + clusters at its dimer interface. Furthermore, we discovered that the interaction between GrxD and CmtA involves thermodynamically-driven transfer of a [2Fe-2S] 2+ cluster from GrxD to CmtA. Accordingly, coexpression of GrxD with CmtA in E. coli increases in vivo Fe–S cluster loading in CmtA, supporting a role for GrxD in delivery of [2Fe-2S] 2+ clusters to CmtA. Taken together, these results suggest that the sole metallothionein in A. fumigatus represents a unique class of fungal metallothioneins that functionally interacts with Fe–S cluster trafficking and storage proteins.},

Significantly, we established the first Glu-associated functional network map across 24 deep brain regions using a homemade high-density fiber photometry array. It was discovered that the correlations between adjacent brain regions, especially between cortex, hippocampus and thalamic populations, were significantly reduced in the hypoxic mice compared to normal mice. Overall, TympG 2 enabled spatiotemporally resolved quantification of glutamatergic activity ranging from subcellular compartments to expansive neural networks across various model organisms. This comprehensive approach not only enhances our understanding of Glu dynamics but also aids in identifying potential neurological disruptions associated with altered glutamatergic signals.},

Herein, we proposed a hydrogen-bond regulation strategy that enables reversible structural deformation of metal phthalocyanines (MPcs) by incorporating methoxy groups into the phthalocyanine framework, thereby improving the flexibility and stability of MPcs. Calculations suggested that intermediate absorption induced structural deformation in MPcs. Moreover, hydrogen-bond interactions and conformational changes enriched with substituted methoxy groups in MPcs enhance structural flexibility. Operando Raman studies revealed that these hydrogen bonds correlated with the reversible structural deformation of NiPc. The optimized catalysts, facilitated by hydrogen bonds, achieved stable operation for over 500 h at 100 mA cm –2 with >98% Faradaic efficiency in CO 2 -to-CO electrocatalytic reduction, significantly outperforming molecular catalysts lacking appropriate hydrogen-bond interactions.},

  abstract     = {The ability to selectively cleave C-heteroatom bonds is critically important in chemical science, from peptide and protein synthesis to biomolecule manipulation. For example, C-heteroatom bond cleavage is widely used in fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl/ tert -butyl (Fmoc/ t Bu)-based solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). Despite its usefulness, it has inextricable limitations, such as issues with hydrophobicity and side reactions, owing to the need for the use of a strong trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, a pervasive forever chemical) as the cleavage reagent. To overcome these drawbacks, alternative strategies to replace Fmoc/ t Bu-based protection and deprotection for SPPS are urgently needed. Here, we introduce a novel SPPS platform based on Fmoc/pyridinemethyl (Pic) chemistry, which enables the orthogonal protection of amino acid side chains and their efficient removal via photocatalytic C-heteroatom bond cleavage under mild conditions. Our approach utilizes the feedstock Pic group to cage amino acid side chains, which eliminates the need for TFA, thereby offering an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional peptide synthesis. Furthermore, this approach seamlessly integrates with automated peptide synthesizers, enabling acid-free, on-resin photorelease of structurally complex peptides, which remains challenging for conventional SPPS methodologies.},

However, the ability of solvated cations to tune and activate water for C 2+ production in the CO 2 RR has been overlooked. In this study, we report the incorporation of a covalently grown layer of functionalized phenyl groups on the Cu surface that leads to a 7-fold increase in ethylene production (to −530 mA cm –2 ) and a 6-fold increase in C 2+ products (to −760 mA cm –2 ). Our mechanistic study, notably by in situ infrared, isotope effect, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, reveals that the surface grafting provokes the reduction of the hydration shell around alkali cations at the electrode–electrolyte interface. This reduction weakens the hydrogen bond network and thus enhances water dissociation to provide a proton for the CO 2 RR. Moreover, it increases cation density at the outer Helmholtz plane, resulting in a larger local electric field that further stabilizes intermediates en route to C 2+ production. Our study brings to light the crucial role of cations in modulating the interfacial water structure, which has to be optimal for efficient C 2+ production in CO 2 RR.},

Employing spectroscopic and stoichiometric studies, we identified a solvent dependence on rates of the irreversible dimerization of ( t -Bu bpy)NiBr, measured rates for the activation of aryl halides and alkyl halides by ( t -Bu bpy)Ni I and ( t -Bu bpy)Ni 0 , and found that the reduction of ( t -Bu bpy)NiBr to Ni 0 is inefficient with common heterogeneous metal reductants.

  abstract     = {Molecular engineering of electrolytes for practical high-power and high-energy lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is a significant challenge due to the difficulty of simultaneously achieving high Li + transport efficiency, minimal gas evolution, and stable cathode-electrolyte and anode-electrolyte interphases (CEI and SEI, respectively), with low charge-transfer resistance. Here, we introduce a fluorinated asymmetric lithium salt, lithium (2-(2-(2,2-difluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl) ((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)amide (LiFOA), designed to optimize electrolyte physicochemical/electrochemical properties for stable LMB pouch cells under fast cycling conditions. LiFOA features a Li + -affinitive side chain, which folds up and suppresses anion migration, resulting in a significantly heightened Li + transference number ( t Li + ). Moreover, the folding enables a self-cleaning mechanism for both the SEI and CEI. Thus, robust and ultrathin CEI and SEI with low charge-transfer resistance are self-evolved simultaneously. Importantly, a semifluorinated methyl terminal of the side chain further optimizes molecular folding strength with a tuned donor number, which not only elevates the electrochemical stability of the functional salt but also significantly mitigates the gas-evolution issue of the electrolyte during harsh cycling of the battery. Through this molecular design, industrial pouch cells with LiFOA achieve an outstanding combination of practical demanding performances in terms of high energy density (523 W h kg –1 at 0.1 C), high power density (1782 W kg –1 at 5 C), excellent cycling stability, suppressed gas evolution, modest cell volume expansion, and a significantly lowered defect under rigorous operating conditions, highlighting LiFOA’s potential for next-generation high-energy-density and high-power-density practical LMB applications.},

The concept of making use of dative boron–nitrogen (B ← N) bonds for the construction of macrocycles has been proposed, but very few examples have been prepared with functional structures, much less pillar-like and other prismatic macrocycles, and their various functionalities have not been fully exploited. Here, we introduce a “functional molecular wall” synthetic protocol based on the self-assembly characteristics of B ← N dative bonds to construct highly symmetrical macrocycles, forming a quasi-pentagonal-shaped macrocycle (named [5]pyBN- p ) with a pillar-like structure. Single-crystal analysis confirmed that its structure exhibited a 5-fold symmetric crown-shaped cavity with a diameter of approximately 9.65 Å, forming four sets of three-dimensional channel stacking structures. In solution, thermal cycling between heating and cooling allows for a fast and fully reversible conversion between monomer pyBN- p and pentameric macrocycle [5]pyBN- p . The resultant macrocycle [5]pyBN- p exhibited delayed fluorescence (DF) property and high photoluminescence quantum yield in the solid state. Notably, the supramolecular aggregates of macrocycle [5]pyBN- p possessed permanent porosity and showed an efficient C 2 H 6 /C 2 H 4 inverse separation capacity.

  abstract     = {Understanding and controlling the nucleation and growth processes of gold clusters are crucial for advancing the nucleation theory and targeted cluster synthesis. While in situ mass spectrometry has revealed the intermediate species formed during the growth process, the overall structural evolution remains unclear due to a lack of crystallographic information. In this study, we examined a new synthetic method for thiolate-protected gold clusters in their embryonic stage. In this method, only partial Au(I) precursors are reduced by a minimal amount of mild reductant in the presence of a substoichiometric amount of thiol. Under optimized conditions, we obtained a series of small gold clusters, including Au 15 (SCTMS) 13 , Au 18 (SCTMS) 14 , Au 22 (SCTMS) 18 , Au 23 (SCTMS) 17 , Au 25 (SCTMS) 18 , Au 33 (SCTMS) 25 , and Au 34 (SCTMS) 26 (TMSCS – : trimethylsilylmethanethiolate), and successfully determined their geometric structures via single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Unexpectedly, the synthetic yield of Au 25 (SCTMS) 18 with an icosahedral Au 13 core was very low despite the stability of this composition. The obtained structural information suggests that under our synthetic conditions the dominant process is the assembly of triangular Au 3 and tetrahedral Au 4 units, each with two electrons, in an anisotropic structure followed by passivation with unreduced Au(I)-SCTMS complexes. Notably, Au 33 (SCTMS) 25 and Au 34 (SCTMS) 26 have a pencil-shaped Au 16 core with an Au 3 width and exhibit strong absorption and emission in the near-infrared region. Due to their extremely thin diameter and quantized electronic structures, we propose naming these anisotropic species “gold quantum needles”. This study deepens our understanding of the cluster formation mechanism at the atomic level and provides a novel synthetic route for highly anisotropic gold clusters.},

Owing to their large absorption cross-section, efficient utilization of MX is anticipated for the development of light-harvesting systems. However, MXs typically undergo nonradiative decay via Auger recombination (AR). In this study, we investigated the possibility of energy transfer from the MXs in a single QD to multiple cyanine dyes (Cy3) adsorbed on the QD surface. Based on the linear relationship between the AR lifetime and QD volume, formamidinium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) with three distinct size distributions were synthesized. Simultaneous measurements of emission photon correlations and individual pristine PNC sizes revealed that the probability of multiphoton emission increased in PNCs larger than 12 nm. This was attributed to a slowdown in the AR rate, which was evaluated by transient absorption spectroscopy. Subsequently, multiple Cy3 dyes were adsorbed onto the PNCs as energy acceptors to evaluate the transfer of energy from the MXs to multiple Cy3 dyes. Photon correlation measurements of Cy3 emission via energy transfer─induced by excitation of a single PNC─showed an increased probability of multiphoton emission in PNC-Cy3 systems with PNC sizes exceeding 12 nm. These findings indicate that multiple Cy3 dyes were excited and emitted via the energy transfer from MXs. Thus, we clearly demonstrate that energy transfer from MXs to multiple surface dyes is feasible using large-sized PNCs.},

  abstract     = {We previously reported that molecules containing two cyclic hydrazide units connected by a polymethylene linker could catalyze aldol condensations via a bifunctional mechanism. One hydrazide apparently provides nucleophilic activation, via enamine formation, while the other provides electrophilic activation, via iminium formation. Here, we ask whether catalytic efficacy can be enhanced by using a conformationally preorganized linker to connect the hydrazide units. In the new catalyst series, the linkers are α/β-peptides (oligomers containing α- and β-amino acid residues). The α/β-peptide scaffold features a 1:2 α:β backbone repeat and forms a helix with approximately three residues per turn. When α residues with hydrazide-containing side chains have an i , i +3 sequence relationship, helical folding induces alignment of the hydrazides. Incremental variation of side chain length allowed us to identify an optimal spacing between the hydrazide units, comprising 16 atoms. Catalytic efficacy, as judged by relative initial rates of an aldol condensation, was ∼3.5-fold greater for this α/β-peptide relative to the dihydrazide with a flexible 16-atom spacer from the previous series. Single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analyses of three α/β-peptide catalysts provide insight into modes of conformational flexibility available to these foldamers.},

Despite this, methods to synthesize housanes are lacking due to their highly strained nature. Herein, we report an intramolecular cyclopropanation strategy to obtain functionalized housanes using palladium carbenes (20 substrates, up to 89% yield). Key to the success of this reaction was the insight that the reactivity of Pd(0) carbenes is controlled by the supporting ligand. Strongly donating N -heterocyclic carbene ligands promote cyclopropanation reactivity, while some π-accepting phosphoramidite ligands (e.g., rac -MonoPhos) afford C–H insertion products (8 examples, up to 20:1 selectivity). Deuterium-labeling studies revealed a KIE of 2.1 at 80 °C, suggesting a palladium carbene is involved in the C–H insertion step, and the independent synthesis of alkyldiazenes confirms that they are not relevant intermediates in this reaction. The housane products were amenable to late-stage cross-coupling reactions and ring-opening reactions to provide cyclopentanes.},

The multivalent ligand design proves essential for successful self-assembly, as the smaller incarcerated cage cannot be independently synthesized in an exclusive manner. Notably, the improved solubility and exceptional stability of the nested cage even at low concentrations allow for structural characterization by high-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, solution-based small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Moreover, its well-defined internal cavity permits the in situ reductive formation of gold nanoparticles, demonstrating its potential as a functional nanoreactor.},

Mechanistic investigations, including control and radical inhibition experiments, high-resolution mass spectrometry detection of key intermediates, and density functional theory calculations, reveal a concerted pathway involving nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus radicals that facilitate N–O bond cleavage and the formation of C═C, C–P, and N–P bonds. Biological evaluations demonstrate that these scaffolds possess potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity with low cytotoxicity. Proteomic analysis, molecular docking, and Western blotting further elucidate the mechanism by which IDPA inhibits porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication through its interactions with receptor protein CD163 and host protein HSP70. These findings establish a versatile strategy for developing radical-based antiviral agents and provide promising candidates for therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract     = {The exceptional performance of ceria (CeO 2 ) in catalysis and energy conversion is fundamentally governed by its defect chemistry, particularly oxygen vacancies. The formation of each oxygen vacancy (V O •• ) is assumed to be compensated by two localized electrons on cations (Ce 3+ ). Here, we show by combining theory with experiment that while this 1 V O •• : 2Ce 3+ ratio accounts for the global charge compensation, it does not apply at the local scale, particularly in nanoparticles. Hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) defect calculations, together with synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, show that electrons have a strong preference to localize and segregate on surfaces, which can overcome the trapping force from the V O •• sites in the bulk. At a given Fermi level, the surface V O •• tends to trap more electrons than those in bulk, resulting in a higher Ce 3+ to V O •• ratio on surfaces than that in the bulk, driven by the preferential localization of electrons and enhanced V O •• –Ce 3+ coupling. Large-scale unbiased Monte Carlo simulations on ceria nanoparticles confirmed this trend and further show that the surface segregation of electrons is more pronounced at low reduction levels and in smaller nanoparticles. In highly reduced ceria nanoparticles, however, the enhanced repulsive interactions lead to a less significant extent of defect heterogeneity or even reverse the location preference of defects in some nanoparticles. Our findings underscore the need to consider both the overall nonstoichiometry and local defect behavior in easily reducible oxides, with direct relevance to their performance in catalytic and energy applications.},

As strategic three-dimensional alternatives to ortho - or meta -substituted arenes, C2-substituted BCPs provide access to an underexplored chemical space. The pursuit of efficient and broadly applicable synthetic routes for these scaffolds remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the unique topological features of BCP cores. Here, we report a robust and modular strategy for the direct synthesis of C2-substituted BCPs from readily available bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) and diazo compounds. Leveraging homolytic cleavage of the central bond in BCBs, a triplet energy transfer-initiated carbene insertion process occurs, to form 1,4-biradical species, which are ultimately converted to the target BCPs via rapid radical recombination. This methodology establishes a modular platform for systematic access to the C2-functionalized BCP architectures, enabling expeditious diversification of the three-dimensional skeletons. Its practicability has been further demonstrated through the collective replacement of the phenyl moiety with bioisosteric BCP in 15 bioactive molecules.},

In particular, magnetoelectric materials combining ferroelectric and magnetic properties are increasingly becoming paramount nowadays. Here, we show that FeH 6 (PO 4 ) 3 exhibits proton conductivity and the coexistence of magnetic and polar structural features, suggesting that such frameworks may be of broader interest beyond the field of proton conductors. By a combination of neutron diffraction and second harmonic generation experiments, we have demonstrated that FeH 6 (PO 4 ) 3 crystallizes in the polar R 3 c space group. Inversion symmetry breaking is triggered by a polar proton ordering within the structure. In FeH 6 (PO 4 ) 3 , this particular cation ordering in combination with the polar displacement of the adjacent structural units results in a polar crystal structure with a calculated net polarization of approximately 10 μC cm –2 between 10 and 300 K. Together with an antiferromagnetic state below 28 K, determined from a combination of neutron diffraction and magnetic measurements and associated with the particular Fe 3+ octahedral arrangement, the result is the coexistence of both properties. By a detailed study of this system with a full description of the crystal structure as well as the ionic and magnetic properties, we aim to spark further investigations in magnetoelectric materials existing in the solid ionic conductor phase space.},

In parallel, developing diverse transformations at different sites is an appealing strategy to expand the diversity of appendages on scaffolds. Owing to the availability of C–H bonds at multiple sites of pharmacophores, diversity-oriented C–H activation reactions are an ideal approach to realize this goal. Given the pharmacophoric significance of the naphthalene scaffold in clinical drugs, diversity-oriented C–H functionalization reactions on this scaffold would be useful for drug discovery. Direct C–H activation at the challenging C6 and C7 positions has remained unexplored due to electronic similarity, remote distance from the directing group, and interference from geometrically identical positions (C7 vs C3, C6 vs C4). Herein, we report two types of templates designed to differentiate the C6 and C7 positions on the naphthalene scaffold. The success is attributed to manipulation of the distance parameter in the template and the utilization of an oligopeptide ligand. Notably, the utility of this diversity-oriented C–H activation is showcased through the divergent modification of naphthalene-containing complex molecules.},

  abstract     = {Image-guided surgery plays a critical role in improving the cancer patient prognosis. However, current clinical probes are often single-modal with “always-on” signals, failing to provide complementary and precise guidance across all perioperative phases. To tackle this hurdle, we develop a biomarker-activatable, multimodal nanoprobe – LanCop – based on redox-mediated manganese valence switching for tumor-specific, perioperative image-guided surgery. LanCop comprises a lanthanide nanoparticle (LnNP) core surrounded by high-valence manganese-rich MnO 1.69 satellites, which initially exhibits negligible T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast and second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence. In the glutathione-rich tumor microenvironment, Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ ions are reduced to free Mn 2+ ions, effectively generating strong MRI contrast via increased unpaired electrons and enhanced spin relaxation and simultaneously disrupting energy quenching between the core and satellites to restore NIR-II fluorescence. This dual-signal activation enables precise preoperative MRI tumor localization, real-time intraoperative fluorescence-guided tumor resection, and rapid optical biopsy confirmation (within 5 min) in mouse glioma models. Deep-seated tumors are detected in real-time with a high signal-to-background ratio (12.6 ± 0.7), and microtumors as small as ∼0.5 mm × 0.7 mm are precisely excised under NIR-II fluorescence guidance. Notably, it accurately distinguishes human glioma specimens from adjacent normal tissue, demonstrating its potential for histopathological assessment. To our knowledge, LanCop is the first activatable multimodal probe capable of guiding all perioperative phases, offering a promising strategy to enhance surgical precision and improve clinical outcomes in cancer treatment.},

Using lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as a catalyst, we realized carboxylic acid-initiated cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) of 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline (EtOx). The dynamic exchange between carboxylate and TFSI – anions, driven by Li + –carboxylate interaction, significantly enhances the activity of oxazolinium propagating species and ensures uniform chain growth, as shown by both experiments and calculations. Interestingly, a proper solvent, γ-valerolactone, also plays a vital role, likely by promoting ion-pair separation at elevated temperatures. A wide scope of functional groups is readily introduced by commercialized carboxylic acids, especially benzoic acid derivatives and analogues, with controlled molar mass, low dispersity, and high/quantitative end-group fidelity achieved, and polymerization rate varying with the initiator structure. The end functionalities of polyEtOx are exemplified by surface adsorption–protein resistance and aggregation-induced emission properties. This catalytic paradigm breaks through long-standing limitations in weak-acid-initiated CROP, indispensably upgrading the toolkit for macromolecular engineering.},

  abstract     = {Metallofullerenes with endohedral lanthanides have emerged as a versatile class of single-molecule magnets owing to strong single-ion magnetic anisotropy, which can be realized in the interior of the fullerene cage. Since exohedral chemical modification of fullerenes is often used to adjust their properties and processability for prospective practical applications, it is necessary to understand how it can affect their magnetic properties. In this work, we studied how a popular [2 + 1] cycloaddition reaction, photochemical addition of adamantylidene (Ad), affects single-ion magnetic anisotropy and single-molecule magnetism of MSc 2 N@C 80 (M = Nd, Dy). For each lanthanide, the reaction yielded [5,6]-open and [6,6]-open isomers of the monoadduct MSc 2 N@C 80 (Ad). Paramagnetic 1 H NMR was demonstrated that the Ad-addition site in [5,6] isomers is predominantly coordinated by Sc, whereas both Sc and lanthanide coordination coexist in [6,6] isomers. Ab initio calculations and Nd-based photoluminescence showed that the [5,6] isomer has enhanced ligand-field splitting, whereas coordination of the lanthanide to the Ad-addition site in the [6,6] isomer reduces magnetic axiality and ligand-field splitting. For DySc 2 N@C 80 (Ad), Dy-Ad coordination leads to a noticeable reduction in the blocking temperature of magnetization, whereas Dy coordination to the unfunctionalized fragments of the fullerene cage improves the SMM performance in comparison to the unfunctionalized DySc 2 N@C 80 . Thus, carbene addition can enhance or deteriorate SMM properties depending on the regioisomerism and the lanthanide-cage coordination geometry in MSc 2 N@C 80 (Ad) adducts. These results demonstrate that chemical derivatization of EMFs can become a useful tool for improving their magnetic properties, but will require careful evaluation of different factors for each reaction type.},

However, their stability remains a critical challenge, notably due to reversible photoinduced halide segregation. Under continuous illumination, this process leads to the formation of Br- and I-rich domains, which lower device performance by introducing low-bandgap regions that trap charge carriers. Despite extensive efforts, the mechanism of photosegregation remains debated, partly due to the difficulty in characterizing these compositionally disordered systems, especially under illumination. Here, we report a systematic investigation across a series of MAPb(Br x I 1– x ) 3 compositions using 79/81 Br and 127 I nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, we present the first application of NQR under in situ illumination to directly probe photoinduced halide segregation, focusing on compositions with x = 0.9, 0.8, and 0.6. Our findings highlight the potential of NQR as a powerful, noninvasive technique for studying local environments under illumination. The results reveal composition-dependent light-induced segregation when comparing substantially different stoichiometries. In contrast, the 81 Br NQR spectra of MAPb(Br 0.9 I 0.1 ) 3 and MAPb(Br 0.8 I 0.2 ) 3 show the emergence of comparable local environments, with preferential formation of MAPbBr 3 -like domains.},

  abstract     = {Upgrading methane to value-added chemicals is significant but still challenging. Well-designed catalysts are required to activate methane. Extensive efforts have been dedicated to the catalytic conversion of methane over transition-metal-containing catalysts. A simple aluminosilicate FER-type zeolite has been found to activate methane and nitrous oxide to methanol stably. To further diversify the catalytic properties, zeolites with different topologies were screened in the methane oxidation reaction. Here, we show that small-pore zeolites have unique advantages in the direct upgrading of methane to light olefins. Among them, the CHA-type zeolite (SSZ-13) exhibited an outstanding performance, with a total selectivity of 90.5% to light olefins and a CH 4 conversion of 5.3% at 350 °C, accompanied by excellent regeneration. Penta-coordinated Al species as one of the active centers was figured out for methane activation and further identified as a non-framework tetra-coordinated Al species by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The acidity of the zeolite was confirmed to influence the tandem conversion of methanol to light olefins. Our study revealed a novel possibility that transition-metal-free aluminosilicate small-pore zeolites can serve as bifunctional catalysts directly and continuously upgrade methane to light olefins via methanol as the intermediate. This approach avoided energy consumption and cumbersome operations and achieved high-efficiency and low-energy production of light olefins.},

  abstract     = {Biological cells use cations as signaling messengers to regulate a variety of responses. Linking cations to the functionality of synthetic membranes is thus crucial to engineering advanced biomimetic agents such as synthetic cells. Here, we introduce bioinspired DNA-based receptors that exploit noncanonical G-quadruplexes for cation-actuated structural and functional responses in synthetic lipid membranes. Membrane confinement grants cation-dependent control over receptor assembly and, when supplemented with hemin cofactors, their peroxidase DNAzyme activity. Cation-mediated control extends to receptor lateral distribution to localize DNA-based catalysis within phase-separated membrane domains of model synthetic cells, imitating the localization of multimeric membrane complexes to signaling hubs in living cells. Our modular strategy paves the way for engineering from the bottom-up cation-responsive pathways for sensing, signaling, and communication in synthetic cellular systems.},

  abstract     = {Developing efficient and durable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media is essential for advancing proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). However, catalyst instability caused by lattice oxygen (O L ) depletion and metal dissolution remains a critical barrier. Here, we propose an oxophilic-site-mediated dynamic oxygen replenishment mechanism (DORM), in which O L actively participates in O–O bond formation and is continuously refilled by water-derived species. Oxophilic dopants modulate the local electronic structure, lower the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy healing, and reorganize the interfacial hydrogen-bond network to enhance water mobility, orientation, and proton accessibility, collectively promoting water dissociation and stabilizing O L catalysis. The optimized catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 289 mV and exceptional durability, operating continuously for 650 h at 10 mA cm –2 in acidic electrolyte and maintaining stable performance for 280 h at 1 A cm –2 in a PEMWE. This work establishes a mechanistic framework for dynamic O L redox and provides a rational strategy for designing robust, noble-metal-free acidic OER electrocatalysts.},

  abstract     = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are environmentally persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals that contaminate global drinking water resources. Their ubiquity and potential impact on human health motivate large-scale remediation. Conventional materials used to remove PFASs during drinking water production are functionally inefficient or energetically expensive, motivating the discovery of new materials and technologies. Here, we introduce cyclodextrin-based monoliths, featuring a highly permeable, mechanically robust porous architecture that enables rapid and continuous PFAS removal from water. The monolith was directly polymerized into flow-through columns and showed water permeability similar to packed sand due to its interconnected macroporous structure. Compared to leading benchmarks under equivalent sorbent mass or contact time, the monolith demonstrated superior PFAS sorption with later breakthroughs for most PFASs. We show the hierarchical morphology of a monolith is more efficient use of sorbent mass than particle-based sorbents, as its macropores enable facile diffusion of PFAS to meso- and microporous sorption sites. The significance of hierarchical pore design was demonstrated by instant PFAS breakthrough passing through the pulverized monolith, where the water primarily flows through interparticle pathways with limited access to sorption sites. After treating 150 L of water spiked with 25 PFAS for 37 days, 47 mg of monolith was regenerated through alcohol wash, with near-complete mass balance of adsorbed PFASs. The regenerated monolithic sorbent treated another 170 L of water for 39 days with comparable removal. The monolith offers a novel morphology with simple and direct synthesis in columns for water treatment and provides superior PFAS removal, regeneration and reuse.},

This study investigated the degradation behavior of PFOA at the gas–liquid interface under diverse conditions. The results demonstrate that the coexistence of salts, particularly NaBr, significantly enhances PFOA degradation by promoting electron transfer reactions. Alkaline conditions (pH 9.8) and the presence of oxygen further facilitate its degradation, whereas acidic conditions hinder this process. Mechanistic analysis further confirmed that hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and hydrated electrons (e aq – ) play critical roles in the observed degradation.

  abstract     = {The thermodynamic equilibrium assumption often invoked in modeling ion migration in solid-state materials remains insufficient to capture the true migration behavior of Li ions, particularly in less-crystalline superionic conductors that exhibit anomalously high Li ion conductivity. Such materials challenge classical frameworks and necessitate a lattice dynamics-based perspective that explicitly accounts for nonequilibrium phonon interactions and transient structural responses. Here, we uncover a phonon-governed Li ion migration mechanism in garnet-structured superionic conductors by comparing Ta-doped Li 6.6 La 3 Zr 1.6 Ta 0.4 O 12 (LLZTO4) to its undoped analogue, Li 6.24 La 3 Zr 2 Al 0.24 O 11.98 (LLZO). Through a synergistic combination of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), 7 Li magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR), and Raman spectroscopy, we show that Ta doping softens the host lattice and enhances anharmonic phonons, enabling collective, thereby multi-ion migration beyond the limit of single-ion hopping models. This lattice softening induces a dynamically disordered energy landscape that lowers activation barriers and yields Li ion conductivities approaching those of liquid electrolytes. Our findings demonstrate that anharmonic lattice vibrations can serve as the driving force for ultrafast Li ion migration in solid electrolytes. This paradigm shift establishes a fundamental link between lattice thermodynamics and superionic conduction, providing a conceptual and experimental framework for the design of highly conductive solid-state electrolytes.},

Recent advancements in chemical vapor deposition have enabled the batch production of these hybrid fibers, paving the way for practical implementation. However, their functionality remains constrained by the integration of a single 2D material, restricting their versatile performance. Here, we introduce a boron nitride/graphene (BN/Gr) heterostructure in the antiresonant hollow-core fiber (ARF) to modulate its optical resonance and thus enhance graphene nonlinearity by controlling the BN thickness. Hydroxyl-rich methanol is employed to improve the flatness and crystallinity of graphene, promoting the vertical epitaxy of BN with a controllable thickness ranging from 5 to 50 nm. The engineered optical resonance notably tunes the light–graphene interaction within the BN/Gr-ARF, increasing the depth of nonlinear optical modulation from 4% to 10% and enhancing all-optical modulation performance by 75%. Our methodology opens possibilities for tunable optical waveguides via the direct growth of functional 2D material-based heterostructures, offering a robust platform for the development of highly integrated photonic devices.},

A key step toward this goal has been made with the GEMS approach to biomolecular dynamics [Unke et al., Sci. Adv. 2024 , 10 , eadn4397]. This work introduces the SO3LR method that integrates the fast and stable SO3krates neural network for semilocal interactions with universal pairwise force fields designed for short-range repulsion, long-range electrostatics, and dispersion interactions. SO3LR is trained on a diverse set of 4 million neutral and charged molecular complexes computed at the PBE0+MBD level of quantum mechanics, ensuring broad coverage of covalent and noncovalent interactions. Our approach is characterized by computational and data efficiency, scalability to 200 thousand atoms on a single GPU, and reasonable to high accuracy across the chemical space of organic (bio)molecules. SO3LR is applied to study units of four major biomolecule types, polypeptide folding, and nanosecond dynamics of larger systems such as a protein, a glycoprotein, and a lipid bilayer, all in explicit solvent. Finally, we discuss future challenges toward truly general molecular simulations by combining MLFFs with traditional atomistic models.},

  abstract     = {Although HCN has been explored extensively as a precursor in the prebiotic synthesis of biological molecules, macroscopic system-level phenomena, originating from reactions of HCN, such as autocatalysis, oscillations, pattern formation, and phase separation have attracted less attention. Autocatalysis and phase separation are particularly interesting in the context of the origin of life because they are sources of self-replication and compartmentalization. In this work, we investigate the reaction between HCN and cysteamine in water, which exhibits both sigmoidal reaction kinetics and the formation of a distinct liquid phase. We studied the origin of the sigmoidal kinetics using NMR spectroscopy and other techniques, investigated the chemical composition of the products using single-crystal X-ray diffraction and mass spectrometry, and probed the absorption of inert additives into the second liquid phase. Our studies show that the sigmoidal kinetics arise from an autocatalytic feedback loop driven by both an increase in pH and the catalytic nature of the newly formed phase itself. Product analysis revealed co-oligomers with a backbone derived from HCN and branches from cysteamine. This composition suggests that co-oligomerization with thiols provides a route to tractable oligomers, mitigating the formation of insoluble HCN polymers. Furthermore, this second liquid phase effectively sequesters hydrophobic molecules like benzene, demonstrating its capacity to act as a primitive compartment. The phenomena that we observed may provide some insight into prebiotic chemical networks and early-stage chemical evolution.},

Here, we describe that oxidation of a pyrazolato-based dinickel(II) dihydride complex K[L(Ni–H) 2 ] ( 1 K ), either electrochemically or chemically using H + or ferrocenium, triggers H 2 elimination and binding of N 2 in a constrained and extremely bent bridging mode in [LNi 2 (μ 1,2 -N 2 )] ( 3 N2 ). Spectroscopic and computational evidence indicate that the electronic structure of 3 N2 is best described as Ni II –(N 2 •– )–Ni II , with a rare 1e – reduced and significantly activated N 2 substrate ( ṽ ̃NN = 1894 cm –1 ). 3 N2 is also formed upon 1e – oxidation of K[LNi 2 I ] ( 2 K ) under N 2 . This is an unusual and counterintuitive scenario where the oxidation of a dinickel(II) dihydride, or of a dinickel(I) complex, induces the reductive activation of N 2 . Detailed (spectro)electrochemical studies and DFT calculations confirm that N 2 binding by the {LNi 2 } platform occurs only in the regime of the mixed-valent Ni II Ni I species, while both oxidation and reduction induce the release of N 2 from 3 N2 ; the latter represents a redox-induced electron transfer (RIET) process where metal reduction leads to N 2 •– oxidation due to intramolecular back electron transfer. These findings offer new perspectives for understanding the multi-e –/ H + scenarios of N 2 fixation via hydride intermediates inspired by the FeMoco function, and for the development of synthetic platforms that avoid strongly reducing conditions for N 2 activation.},

In situ spectroscopy and metadynamics simulations reveal that the Co 2+ sites in 0.50Co-Z5(340) dislodge from the framework and move toward the nearby Brønsted acid sites, forming framework-associated low-valence Co δ+ species. Mechanistic studies indicate that the Co δ+ species catalyze ethane C–H bond cleavage via an oxidative addition mechanism, and ethylene is produced simultaneously with H* coupling (direct pathway).

  abstract     = {Electrochromic materials exploit a change in molecular absorbance after an electrochemical redox event for applications, such as smart glass and segmented displays. Current applications use metal oxides; however, these materials are plagued by slow response times to potential changes. Herein, we investigate a metal–organic framework (MOF) film loaded with a molecular ruthenium redox carrier for its electrochromic capabilities. Upon the application of a potential jump, the native MOF was found to transport charge with an apparent diffusion coefficient, D app of 8(±3) × 10 –9 cm 2 /s. That said, only 55% of the redox centers, primarily those at the MOF surface, were converted. Using a multivariate (MTV) approach to incorporate sulfonate groups into the backbone of the MOF in addition to the redox carrier allowed for charge transport throughout the MOF with a D app of around 1(±1) × 10 –7 cm 2 /s and 100% conversion, the fastest reported diffusion coefficient in the redox hopping MOF literature to our knowledge. The sulfonated MOF exhibited a rapid electrochromic response, with coloration and bleaching times of approximately 1.29 and 1.33 s, respectively, at 400 mV overpotential. The sulfonate group is hypothesized to break ion pairs, allowing for higher ionic conductivity, which facilitates fast and complete charge transfer.},

Here, we report a simple and robust DNA-based mechanism for transmembrane signaling in synthetic cells using cholesterol-modified single-stranded DNA (Chol-ssDNA). We discovered that anchored Chol-ssDNA spontaneously flips across the membrane of giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs) in a nucleation-driven, defect-mediated process. This flipping enables internal signal processing through hybridization with encapsulated complementary DNA and activation of downstream processes such as RNA transcription. The phenomenon shows a high transduction efficiency, is generic across DNA sequences and lipid compositions, and can be enhanced by glycerol, which modulates membrane dynamics. Mechanistic insights using fluorescence microscopy, nuclease degradation assays, and membrane permeability assays reveal that flipping is dominated by transient membrane pores. Leveraging this facile translocation process, we demonstrate selective transcriptional activation inside synthetic cells, underscoring the potential of Chol-ssDNA flipping as a programmable tool for synthetic biology and bottom-up synthetic cell design.},

Homopolypeptides of the glutamate type form α-helical secondary structures and are considered rigid-rod polymers. They form lyotropic liquid crystalline phases in helicogenic solvents. Over the past decade, this property has been exploited in the NMR-based structure elucidation of organic compounds, making anisotropic NMR observables, such as residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), accessible. However, many alignment media are limited in their compatibility, especially with polar (nonhelicogenic) solvents like DMSO, and thus also in their analyte compatibility. Herein, we present poly-γ-(4-propargyloxybenzyl)- l -glutamate (PPOBLG) as an exceptionally versatile alignment medium compatible with several organic solvents, including DMSO and acetone. The polymer not only allows extraction of RDCs in all these solvents but also provides linearly independent orientations of a model compound by simple variation of the solvent. Moreover, a remarkably high enantiodifferentiation is observed. We furthermore show that these improved properties make it compatible with various natural products containing a wide variety of functional groups.},

Here, we describe a straightforward approach to constructing a CuMn spinel/Mn 2 O 3 composite oxide catalyst that addresses this limitation and demonstrate that lattice oxygen can spontaneously migrate to form interface-stabilized superoxo species under high-temperature reaction conditions. This catalyst exhibits a 14-fold enhancement in the CH 4 oxidation reaction compared to Mn 2 O 3 , with activity and stability even better than those of many reported noble-metal supported catalysts. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the superoxo species accept electrons from the neighboring Cu and Mn atoms, exhibiting enhanced ability for C–H activation.

The strategy harnesses the Lewis acidity of B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 to rapidly generate reactive silyl ketene acetal intermediates, which are subsequently intercepted by in situ generated iron nitrenoids. Central to this cooperative activation mode is the dual role of the chloride anion in modulating both boron and iron catalytic reactivity. This protocol is operationally simple, requiring no tailored ligands, light, or electrochemical setup, and proceeds efficiently with only 1 mol % of boron and iron catalysts. The system exhibits a broad scope of unsaturated esters, tolerating β-aryl, -alkyl, -silyl, -perfluoroalkyl, and -boryl groups.

Its effective applicability to supramolecular polymers is illustrated by three representative cases that reveal accelerated exploration of diverse multicomponent systems with a universal Bayesian optimization framework. The number of experiments required to arrive at optimal compositions is significantly reduced compared to random or uninformed sampling strategies, enabling the experimental study of high-dimensional design spaces. In this way, we can tune the formulation of intricate mixtures and achieve tailored macroscopic properties with minimal experimental effort.

In this study, we investigated the construction of high-entropy molecular networks on a metal surface using an on-surface chemistry approach. By employing distinct pyridyl-functionalized ligands with differently shaped aromatic backbones, we constructed 2D molecular networks stabilized through coordination with metal atoms. A high-throughput preparation approach leveraging a mask inspired by a Venn diagram was utilized to create multicomponent sample libraries. Scanning tunneling microscopy provided real-space characterization, revealing both ordered and disordered assemblies and highlighting the critical role of the molecular shape and the number of functional centers in promoting or limiting mixed entropy of these networks. Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations were further employed to model the formation mechanisms and examine factors influencing their mixed entropies. Our study provides insights into how molecular species influence disorder and stability in high-entropy molecular networks, paving the way for advancing low-dimensional high-entropy molecular systems.},

A wide range of magnetic behaviors have been observed in nonmagnetic transition-metal dichalcogenides intercalated with magnetic atoms. Beyond the incorporation of magnetic ions, we propose the controlled alkali-ion intercalation of intrinsic vdW magnets as a strategy to probe and manipulate spin populations and exchange interactions within individual magnetic layers. Unlike conventional solid-state methods typically used for atomic intercalation, this approach depends on postsynthetic, solution-based reactions, which remain relatively underdeveloped and present unique synthetic challenges. Hence, in this work, we demonstrate precise potassium intercalation of VOCl, a layered antiferromagnet with square-like motifs, using stoichiometric organic reductants, potassium naphthalene and potassium pyrene. Our synthetic approach addresses thermodynamic and kinetic challenges via redox-matching reductants and electrolyte-assisted homogenization. Magnetic measurements reveal a continuous evolution from antiferromagnetism (x = 0) to a spin-glass state (0 < x < 1) with magnetic memory and ultimately to ferrimagnetism (x = 1) in K x VOCl (0 ≤ x ≤ 1). Ab initio calculations support the existence of a spin-glass state, stabilized by mixed valence and competing magnetic interactions. Taken all together, this work establishes a programmable intercalation methodology to access metastable phases and tailor magnetic properties, offering new insights into magnetism in layered compounds with complex spin interactions.},

  abstract     = {High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have recently emerged as promising electrocatalysts for complex reactions owing to their tunable electronic structures and diverse, unique binding sites. However, their vast compositional space, in terms of both elemental variety and atomic ratios, presents a major challenge to the rational design of high-performance catalysts, as experimental efforts are often hindered by ambiguous element selection and inefficient trial-and-error methods. In this work, a bottom-up research strategy using machine learning-assisted first-principles calculations was applied to accelerate the design of quinary HEAs toward efficient multielectron transfer reactions. Here, we report the design of PtPdRhRuMo, which exhibits key physicochemical properties favoring the methanol oxidation reaction. Notably, the incorporation of Mo as the fifth element significantly activates specific binding sites on HEA surfaces, enhancing methanol adsorption and, in particular, the water dissociation ability. This facilitates hydroxyl species formation, which effectively mitigates CO intermediate adherence while promoting the complete oxidation of CH 3 OH to CO 2 via alternative reaction pathways. Guided by theoretical predictions, experimental samples with different morphologies of mesoporous PtPdRhRuMo catalyst (m-HEANP(Mo) nanoparticles and m-HEAF(Mo) thin film) were then synthesized, demonstrating superior electrocatalysis with a large current density of up to 18.20 mA cm –2 and a mass activity of 9.89 A mg Pt –1 , alongside the long-term durability for efficient methanol electrooxidation applications.},

  abstract     = {Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking remains a fascination in chemistry, biology, materials science, and even astronomy. Chiral symmetry breaking usually requires intrinsic molecular chirality or extrinsic chiral sources but remains rare in nonchiral systems. Here, we reveal a ubiquitous, entropy-driven chiral symmetry breaking mechanism observed in 22 out of 35 conjugated polymers in the absence of any chiral source─a phenomenon overlooked for decades. Chiral assemblies spontaneously occur through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of lyotropic mesophases from isotropic solutions upon a concentration increase. Machine learning identifies the underpinning molecular features validated by further molecular design. The universality of this phenomenon hints at a possible link between LLPS and chiral symmetry breaking in the origin of life, while paving the way for an emerging frontier of chiral electronics.},

Although desolvation and diffusion rates can be improved by the optimization of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), no existing architecture has achieved simultaneous rapid ion transport across the bulk phase, interphase, and solvent phase while maintaining 100% initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Specifically, we report an atomic-level strategy derived from recyclable materials that uniformly coordinates diverse single-atom alloying reactions to enable the assembly of solid–liquid single-atom channels for rapid ion transport across multiphase systems. Single-atom channels interconnect components through intelligent self-regulation, achieving ∼100% ICE in liquid-derived SEI while minimizing the Na + desolvation and diffusion barrier. Ah-level engineering application cells show 200.62 Wh kg –1 at 5 C, as well as 92.9% capacity retention for over 500 cycles at 7 C. The cells show 8 min charging time for 100% capacity at 10 C.

  abstract     = {Emerging evidence underscores the regulatory roles of nonamyloidogenic regions in controlling the aggregation dynamics and cytotoxicity of amyloidal proteins, but the mechanism remains unclear. Herein we investigated how flanking sequences modulate the conformational heterogeneity in the p53 238–262 amyloid segment using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). By comparing the wild-type (wt) and three pathogenic mutations (R248W, R248Q, R249S) in the noncore regions, we reveal that flanking alterations remodel β-sheet aggregates and induce conformational plasticity in β-strand ensembles through the generation of novel conformational substates and selective elimination of existing conformational substates. This conformational diversity establishes a highly heterogeneous intermolecular interaction network that connects different conformational substates. Quantitative mapping shows that flanking mutations drastically diversify the coexisting inter-β-strand interactions while altering the most abundant intermolecular interaction patterns. Our analysis reveals that flanking mutations induce a deterministic conformational remodeling process in the β-sheet aggregates, where specific intermolecular interactions counteract entropy through nonstochastic structural rearrangements. These findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding of the noncore sequence control in protein aggregation and suggest potential therapeutic targets for modulating β-sheet assembly in amyloidopathies.},

Herein, we report a NiFe bimetallic catalyst showing efficient ambient-pressure C–C coupling performance subject to H 2 pretreatment temperature. An optimal performance was achieved after reducing NiFe/TiO 2 at 350 °C (NiFe-350/TiO 2 ), yielding 27.8% CO 2 conversion and 33.9% selectivity to C 2 –C 3 hydrocarbon (primarily ethane) at 350 °C under atmospheric pressure. Combinatorial studies employing in situ characterizations, kinetic, intermediate control experiments and first-principles calculations indicate the formation of partially oxidized Ni δ+ –O–Fe δ+ in NiFe-350/TiO 2 , the dual-site synergy of which enhances CO 2 activation and facilitates H 2 heterolytic activation into H δ− species that selectively hydrogenate *CO 2 into HCOO* and *CH 3 O intermediates, thus suppressing CO byproduct formation and resulting in effective ambient-pressure C–C coupling likely via an asymmetric *CH 2 –CH 3 coupling mechanism. In stark contrast, the fully reduced NiFe bimetallic catalyst favors a direct CO 2 dissociation pathway instead to form *CO that easily desorbs from the surface, as well as homolytic H 2 activation such that the C–C coupling process is unfavored. In brief, this work reports the ambient-pressure synthesis of C 2 –C 3 paraffins from direct CO 2 hydrogenation and provides design rationales for efficient carbon chain propagation.},

This morphological evolution must be due to a different mechanism for mass transport that is sensitive to electrochemical conditions (e.g., electrolyte composition, potential limits, and scan rate). However, there have been no notable studies of electrochemically induced coarsening in nanometer-sized electrocatalysts. Here, we unveil the origins of coarsening in an electrolyte through coupled in situ experiments and atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. Our work demonstrates electrochemical coarsening is driven by two concurrent mechanisms that can be explained at the atomistic level: (i) dissolution/redeposition during the reduction of an oxidized species and (ii) rapid surface diffusion of undercoordinated atoms.},

Here, we report a series of highly crystalline mixed-length multivariate COFs synthesized using azobenzene and bipyridine as linkers, where tuning the ratio of linkers and incorporating palladium effectively modulates the balance between near-infrared (NIR) light absorption and catalytic sites for NIR-generation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ).

In this work, we found that cyclohexene spontaneously oxidized at the gas–liquid interface of the microdroplets under mild conditions. Notably, tetrabutylammonium bromide as an electrolyte added to the reaction system can promote the directional epoxidation of cyclohexene. The control variable experiment proved that oxygen was the main oxygen source of the epoxidation reaction, and the product of cyclohexene oxide was detected by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen spectrum. Additionally, density functional theory calculation results show that the energy barrier of the cyclohexene oxidation reaction at the interface in the presence of an electric field is reduced by 89.37 kJ/mol. The observed 89 kJ/mol reduction in activation energy represents the maximum achievable effect under optimal field-reaction axis alignment. The possible reasons for the increase in interfacial selectivity were analyzed from the electrochemistry. So far, there are a few reports on the effect of microdroplet interface on reaction selectivity; the impact of interfacial electric field may have broader applications in the electrochemistry field.},

Electronic localization function, crystal orbital Hamilton population, electron density topological analysis, and Bader charge analysis demonstrate that helium’s typically inert 1s electrons participate in chemical bonding in He 3 F 2 , thus forming unexpected polar covalent He–F bonds within the HeF 2 chains. Furthermore, molecular orbital calculations reveal that this type of bond stems from the strong interaction between the He-1s orbital and the F-2p orbital under high pressure, challenging conventional notions of helium’s chemical inertness.},

Nevertheless, the molecular-level understanding of the effect of surface-bound acids on atmospheric chemical reactions remains limited. Herein, the reactions between CO 2 and NH 3 /amines at the air–water interface with organic acids are investigated using combined molecular dynamic simulations and quantum chemical calculations. The results show that the reactions of CO 2 -NH 3 /amines predominantly occur at the interface of water droplets since CO 2 /NH 3 /amines show a surface tendency. At the surface with formic acid (HCOOH), the barrier of C–N compound formation from the CO 2 -NH 3 reaction catalyzed by HCOOH is calculated to be 6.8 kcal/mol, which can be easily overcome at ambient temperature and is significantly decreased in comparison to both gas phase and surface without organic acid. Furthermore, the HCOOH-mediated mechanism can also promote CO 2 reactions with alkylamines (methylamine (MA) and dimethylamine (DMA)), as the nucleophilicity of the N-site in these amines is significantly stronger than that in NH 3 . Overall, the results highlight the significance of organic acid on the aerosol surface in efficient capture of gaseous CO 2 and uncover the catalytic role of interfacial organic acid for assessing the potential contribution of gas-particle partitioning of pollutants to aerosol formation.},

Second, the rate performance appears to be dictated by ion mobility, and atomic Ti/Nb disorder in Ti 2 Nb 10 O 29 contributes to improved capacity retention at high rates by suppressing Li-ion ordering.

Focusing on approximant crystals (ACs), a “double heterovalent elemental substitution” is employed in a stoichiometric Ga–Pt–Gd 2/1 AC whereby e/a is lowered from approximately 1.98 to 1.60. Through this approach, a new family of Ga-based Tsai-type 1/1 ACs with an exceptionally wide compositional domain within e/a space is derived. Remarkably, the magnetic ground state is altered from initially spin-glass to ferromagnetic (FM) with second-order phase transition and mean-field-like critical behavior. More importantly, through this strategy, the isothermal magnetic entropy change ( ΔS M ) enhanced significantly and reached a maximum value of −8.7 J/K mol-Gd under a 5 T magnetic field change, even comparable to leading rare-earth magnetocaloric materials including RCo 2 phases. These findings demonstrate the high potential of a double heterovalent elemental substitution for tailoring magnetic properties and magnetocaloric response in stoichiometric compounds, offering a new pathway for designing high-performance magnetic refrigeration materials even beyond the quasicrystals and ACs.},

  abstract     = {Life requires chemical chiral specificity. The emergence of enantioselectivity is unknown but has been linked to diverse scenarios for the origin of life, ranging from an extraterrestrial origin to polarization-induced effects, and magnetic field-induced mineral templating. These scenarios require an originating mechanism and a subsequent enhancement step, leading to widespread chiral specificity. The common denominator in all scenarios is water, which provides an environment for the enantioselective process. Because water is a nonchiral molecule, it has not been considered as an active ingredient in either of these processes. Here, we show that water can form extended chiral ordered structures that are induced by interactions with simple chiral prebiotic molecules, such as lipids and sugars. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, chiral-sensitive and interface-specific vibrational sum frequency scattering, second harmonic scattering, and atomic force microscopy, the interfacial structure of water on nanoscale lipid membranes was investigated. Out-of-plane H-bonding interactions between achiral liposomes and simple chiral cyclic sugars lead to ordered, spectroscopically ice-like, chiral water suprastructures that extend along the self-assembled lipid-sugar complex over distances >10 μm. Such highly ordered self-assemblies could potentially have provided microenvironments that enable the enhancement of chirality.},

  abstract     = {The functional properties of nanocrystals can be finely tuned through controlled morphology and size. However, this can be challenging for metastable nanostructures that require harsh synthesis conditions, such as high temperatures. Here, we present a method for preparing large ε-Fe 2 O 3 nanorods that are not affected by magnetic relaxation. This study presents a novel growth mechanism in which high-aspect-ratio rods evolve from spherical ε-Fe 2 O 3 particles in a silica matrix containing Y 3+ . With the presence of Y 3+ , the glassy matrix undergoes a metastable binodal decomposition yielding the formation of nanodroplets of a Y-rich silicate of composition ∼Y 2 Si 2 O 7 . This Y silicate selectively coats the ε-Fe 2 O 3 planes perpendicular to the rod axis along the [100] direction but is not observed in the rod apexes. Structural optimizations and energy calculations of different crystal faces of ε-Fe 2 O 3 in contact with Y 2 Si 2 O 7 obtained using machine-learning force fields provide an atomistic interpretation of these observations: the affinity of Y with the oxygen atoms exposed at ε-Fe 2 O 3 surfaces explains the preferential capping of ε-Fe 2 O 3 surfaces that present a large density of oxygen atoms and its absence in surfaces such as (100), where this density is significantly lower. The presence or absence of the silicate capping layer results in different surface energies and/or mass transfer coefficients across the interface, originating two independent Ostwald ripening processes, which drive the high aspect ratio growth. By using La 3+ instead of Y 3+ , ε-Fe 2 O 3 rods with even larger aspect ratios are obtained. Notably, this synthetic approach counteracts the progressive diminution of the average nanoparticle size observed in ε-(Fe 1– x Cr x ) 2 O 3 upon Cr 3+ addition, enabling to elucidate the effect of this substitution on the intrinsic magnetic anisotropy and the anisotropy fields that determine the high-frequency ferromagnetic resonances of this phase.},

However, achieving high activity in H 2 production with good selectivity toward CO 2 under mild conditions poses a challenge. A thoughtful understanding of the active sites that accelerate the cleavage of the C–C bond rather than the C–O bond and the activation of the water molecule is still lacking. In this study, we developed a PtNa/γ-Mo 2 N catalyst that efficiently enables hydrogen production from ethylene glycol steam reforming (EGSR) reactions. This catalyst achieved outstanding H 2 productivity, reaching 6000 mol H2 ·mol Pt –1 ·h –1 at 250 °C under 10 bar with high CO 2 selectivity (89%) and low CO selectivity (1%) in carbon-containing products. Comprehensive characterizations revealed the crucial role of the interface between highly dispersed Pt species and Mo 2 N in activating ethylene glycol and water. Additionally, sodium (Na) was found to block acidic sites, preventing the formation of side products from C–O bond cleavage, and to modulate Pt sites, enhancing the reforming process by accelerating the water gas shift reaction.},

  abstract     = {Most eukaryotic membranes comprise phospholipids bearing two hydrophobic tails, but N -acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) stands out as a long-known but poorly understood phospholipid with three hydrophobic groups. What little attention NAPE has received has been devoted to understanding its metabolic functions as a precursor to N -acylethanolamine (NAE), a bioactive lipid that acts as an endocannabinoid. Yet, levels of NAPE increase during myocardial infarction and ischemia, suggesting potential signaling roles for this lipid. Here, we exploit photoaffinity labeling (PAL) to identify NAPE-interacting proteins and elucidate signaling functions of NAPE. By positioning diazirine and alkyne groups in metabolically distinct regions of the NAPE molecule, we ensured that our PAL probe reported on interactions of NAPE and not NAE. Our studies identified several NAPE interactors, including two single-pass transmembrane proteins, CD147/Basigin and CD44, both of which serve as chaperones for monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) from the SLC16A family that mediate lactate flux across the plasma membrane. Functional studies revealed that NAPE stimulates lactate efflux by MCTs dependent upon CD147 and CD44, establishing NAPE as a bona fide signaling lipid and pointing to potential physiological roles in metabolic and energy homeostasis that may be pathologically relevant in ischemia.},

Characterizing this intricate interface experimentally remains a major challenge. In this study, we directly observed the potential distribution at the electrode–polyelectrolyte interface using a delicate in situ electrochemical cell coupled with ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) at various probing depths. The electrode/polyelectrolyte (graphite/Nafion) interface was successfully constructed, and the APXPS measurements were performed under nonpolarizing conditions. The binding energy shift of the F 1s photoelectron with applied bias provided the information on potential distribution. Experimental results, simulated by the typical exponential and linear potential distribution models, indicate the formation of a 1–3 nm EDL at the electrode/polyelectrolyte interface. This work provides methodological guidance for in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies and offers valuable fundamental data for electrochemical research.},

However, recent studies have revealed significant error rates within existing MOF databases, posing a critical data problem that hinders efficient high-throughput computational screening. While rule-based algorithms like MOSAEC, MOFChecker, and the Chen and Manz method (Chen–Manz) have been developed to address this, they often suffer from inherent limitations and misclassification of structures. To overcome this challenge, we developed MOFClassifier, a novel machine learning approach built upon a positive-unlabeled crystal graph convolutional neural network (PU-CGCNN) model. MOFClassifier learns intricate patterns from perfect crystal structures to predict a “crystal-likeness score” (CLscore), effectively classifying MOFs as computation-ready. Our model achieves an ROC value of 0.979 (previous best value 0.912) and, importantly, can identify subtle structural and chemical errors that are undetectable by current rule-based methods. By accurately recovering previously misclassified false-negative structures, the MOFClassifier reduces the risk of overlooking promising material candidates in large-scale computational screening campaigns. This user-friendly tool is freely available and has been integrated into the preparation workflow for the updated CoRE MOF DB 2025 v1.0, contributing to the accelerated computational discovery of MOF materials.},

This optimized material achieved an exceptional CO 2 photoreduction initial efficiency of 17,800 μmol g –1 h –1 with 81% CO selectivity.

  abstract     = {Recently, several groups have reported remarkable observations concerning the acceleration or promotion of nonequilibrium reactions in aqueous microdroplets. Such observations often implicate the reactivity of the microdroplet interface or the energy used for the formation (i.e., by nebulization, sonication, or electrospray) of these systems with high surface-area-to-volume ratios.. While the input of energy is important for reactions, such as hydrogen peroxide formation, the spatial distribution of that energy, particularly at interfaces, may strongly influence reaction pathways and yields. Moreover, nebulized microdroplets are inherently dynamic and are, therefore, challenging to study systematically. Thus, investigating less dynamic and energetic means of increasing SA:V ratios could provide the community with a platform to explore the intricate mechanisms at play in these systems. Here, we investigated two-dimensional soap thin films, formed by using a commercial soap bubble wand, as a low-cost, low-energy model system to enhance the SA:V ratio. In this study, we evaluate the thin film’s ability to promote hydrogen peroxide formation. We demonstrate that the formation of soap films promotes the generation of H 2 O 2 . Quantitative ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy assays show the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in a soap film on a commercial bubble wand reaches 1.67 ± 0.16 mM. We confirmed hydrogen peroxide formation by commercial test-strips and 1 H NMR. This soap film experiment arguably represents the least-energy-intensive method to enhance SA:V ratio and produce hydrogen peroxide at complex phase boundaries to-date.
