  abstract     = {Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy and microscopy are constantly expanding sensing techniques for analyzing biomolecular interactions. In addition to the biological recognition molecules and biological or chemical analytes, the most important components for designing FRET biosensing systems are the materials that constitute the FRET donor–acceptor pair. These FRET materials consist of small molecules, biological or chemical nanoscaffolds, or nanomaterials that function in the ultraviolet, visible, or infrared spectral range. They can absorb light, fluoresce or phosphoresce with lifetimes ranging from picoseconds to milliseconds, and can be applied for sensing in situ , in vitro , and in vivo . Organic dyes and quenchers, fluorescent or light harvesting proteins, or quantum dots are only some examples from the ever growing FRET material toolbox. A particular example are gold nanoparticles, whose strong localized surface plasmon resonance makes them frequently used as nanosurface energy transfer (NSET) acceptors. After a short recapitulation of FRET and NSET theory, we review a wide variety of FRET and NSET materials, provide representative examples of FRET/NSET systems and applications for each material, and critically discuss the benefits and drawbacks of their properties.},

  abstract     = {It has been more than 160 years since chemists first performed fluorination reactions on organic molecules. Scores of fluorination reagents and hundreds of worthwhile methods have been developed over the intervening years. Meanwhile, workers in the field are increasingly aware of the benefits of incorporating fluorine atoms into bioactive molecules. Therefore, the emergence of “late-stage fluorination” in the first decade of the 21st century is both natural and well-justified─an extant compound, off the shelf, can be converted more efficiently to a fluorinated product than through a de novo approach. It is worth noting that chemists’ attempts to fluorinate complex molecules began sporadically decades ago before the concept of “late-stage” was first proposed. In this Perspective, we aim to present a comprehensive series of late-stage fluorination strategies, with the spotlight primarily focused on single-atom modifications of complex molecules (although incidental examples of polyfluorination are addressed), including natural products, analogues, and pharmaceuticals. Both the nucleophilic and electrophilic sources of fluorine are examined.},

Their continuous, defect-free atomic arrangement contributes to improved interfacial stability, mechanical integrity, and charge transfer properties, ultimately leading to superior electrochemical performance compared to those of the polycrystalline counterparts. Despite their growing importance, a comprehensive review of single-crystalline anode materials has been lacking. In this review, we provide an overview of single-crystalline anode materials on their growth, applications, fabrications, and recycling for both metal and ion batteries. Starting from a theoretical understanding of electro-crystallization of metals, we discuss recent strategies for the growth and application of single-crystalline metals and substrates in various chemistries including lithium, zinc, sodium, aluminum, and magnesium, as well as single-crystalline host materials such as silicon, graphite, and transition metal oxides, alongside their failure mechanisms and associated challenges. Lastly, we discuss the fabrication and recycling of single-crystalline anode materials for a closed-loop life cycle of batteries.

These systems offer promising avenues for diagnosing and treating neurological disorders by emulating the brain’s computational strategies. Neural devices, including sensors and stimulators, monitor or modulate neural activity, playing a pivotal role in deciphering brain function and neuropathologies. Yet, clinical translation remains limited due to persistent challenges such as foreign body responses, low signal-to-noise ratios, and constraints in real-time data processing.

This review highlights the emerging class of neurohybrid interfaces, where neuromorphic systems might be integrated to enhance bidirectional neural communication. It emphasizes novel material strategies engineered for seamless neural interfacing and their incorporation into advanced neuromorphic chip architectures capable of real-time signal processing and closed-loop feedback. Furthermore, this review explores cutting-edge neuromorphic biointerfaces and evaluates the technological, biological, and ethical challenges involved in their clinical deployment.

However, conventional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy lacks the sensitivity to probe solvent-exposed regions in large, phase-separated peptide systems, where surface moieties are sparse relative to bulk residues. Here, we introduce hyperpolarized liquid-state surface-specific NMR spectroscopy, a technique that visualizes solvent-accessible residues in large biomolecular condensates. In combination with unconventional sample handling instrumentation and hyperpolarization-specific data processing, we report high-resolution hyperpolarized surface NMR spectra with spectral qualities that do not fall short of cutting-edge high-field methods yet have substantially boosted sensitivity. Targeting the biotechnologically widely used elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) nanoscale complexes, we demonstrate residue-resolved detection of the water interface of mega Dalton-sized peptide condensates with sensitivity enhancements reaching 2 orders of magnitude. Our method reveals glycine residues at the coacervate surface while hydrophobic core residues remain suppressed, providing direct evidence for glycine-rich surface segregation in these biomaterials. These findings resolve long-standing questions about ELP surface architecture and open an avenue for a solution-state analog to surface-enhanced solid-state NMR. The presented advance might thus foster detailed investigations of soft-matter interfaces in protein condensates, synthetic coacervates, and bioengineered materials.},

  abstract     = {Vitamin D 3 (VD 3 ) is an important natural product with functions in the human body related to bone growth and homeostasis. In the body, vitamin D 3 is converted into the hormone calcitriol by successive activation of the C 25 –H and C 1 –H groups by two cytochrome P450 isozymes that each catalyze a regioselective C–H hydroxylation step. By contrast, in bacteria, both reactions happen in the same P450 isozyme, but the product after the first hydroxylation step does not escape into solution. To understand the differences between human and bacterial VD 3 activation, we performed molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics studies of these enzymes. Molecular dynamics simulations on the four P450 structures for human and bacterial isozymes with VD 3 and 25-hydroxy-VD 3 bound show that the human P450 enzyme for the first hydroxylation step has a small and narrow cavity around the heme, which only fits an aliphatic chain, and hence can only perform C 25 -hydroxylation. On the other hand, the bacterial P450 has a more open and spherical substrate binding pocket where the substrate fits in both orientations. Consequently, 25-hydroxy-VD 3 will bind for a long period of time in the bacterial P450 isozyme that can trigger a second reaction cycle with molecular oxygen. Subsequently, QM calculations on cluster models show that all reaction steps happen through a rate-determining hydrogen atom abstraction. However, the human P450 isozyme reacts with faster kinetics than the bacterial isozyme through better and tighter positioning of the substrate, which highlights the role of the second coordination sphere for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.},

  abstract     = {The propensity for photoexcited aryl ketones to undergo 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions is a fundamental process in organic synthesis and polymer degradation. Since its discovery in 1958, Norrish–Yang photocyclization has become a prominent method to access cyclobutanols under mild photoirradiative conditions. Despite its successful extension to larger ring systems, access to medicinally relevant 3-membered rings remains limited due to the strong kinetic preference for 1,5-HAT over 1,4-HAT. In this work, we demonstrate the first photocyclization of β-boryl aryl ketones to cyclopropanols. Our strategy relies on solvent-controlled selective population of the π,π* triplet state over the n,π* triplet state, with the former preferentially undergoing 1,4-boryl group transfer over 1,5-HAT. This protocol proceeds under mild irradiative conditions with excellent functional group tolerance, providing access to a broad range of highly valuable cyclopropanol scaffolds.},

C–H methylation is particularly attractive, yet a broadly applicable method for meta -C–H methylation of pyridines─the most common N -heterocyclic pharmacophore─remains elusive. Herein, we report a method for meta -methylation of pyridines that utilizes dihydropyridines, generated in situ, in conjunction with benzotriazolylmethanol or paraformaldehyde as the methylating agent, enabling the construction of a diverse array of meta -methyl-substituted pyridines with excellent selectivity for monomethylation. Moreover, the method can be readily extended to meta -alkylation using aldehydes as alkyl sources. Density functional theory calculations, control experiments, and kinetic studies were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanisms, in which the cooperation of the borane catalyst with the base was crucial for the deoxygenation step. Given the impact of methyl groups on molecular potency and the prevalence of pyridine pharmacophores, we anticipate that this method may offer a powerful handle for accessing new drug candidates.},

  abstract     = {The low nucleophilicity of phenols represents a major obstacle to the Pd-catalyzed synthesis of diaryl ethers. This inherent challenge is typically exacerbated by the reliance of C–O couplings on an insoluble, inorganic base: the resulting reaction heterogeneity leads to irreproducibility across scales and between laboratories, and incompatibility with common enabling technologies. In this Article , we report the development and mechanistic interrogation of an homogeneous, Pd-catalyzed C–O coupling between phenols and aryl triflates that uses a weak, soluble tertiary amine as base. We show that the choice of ligand, aryl electrophile, and base is crucial if side reactions and catalyst poisoning are to be avoided, and productive catalysis achieved. Investigation of reaction kinetics and linear free energy relationships has revealed the identity of both the catalyst resting state and the turnover-limiting step. The combined mechanistic insight allows qualitative a priori prediction of reaction outcome as a function of substrate electronics, and provides an intuitive guide as to how diaryl ether targets should be disconnected. The resulting methodology exhibits broad substrate scope, with yields reproducible across both preparative ‘singleton’ scales and high throughput formats. The homogeneous nature of the couplings allows their safe execution under microwave heating, with elevated temperatures allowing for short reaction times even in the presence of air, and their facile translation to scale-up in continuous flow.},

A σ-bond metathesis reaction of Me 3 Si(H)CN 2 with a europium(II) hydrido or alkyl complex yields a europium(II) nitrilimine, which reacts with CO to provide a europium(II) ynolate complex. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and DFT calculations confirm the dominance of the ynolate resonance form, showing two orthogonal π orbitals between the C–C unit and a significant negative charge (−0.83) on the oxygen atom. Reactivity studies demonstrate C-centered trapping products with trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, benzophenone, isothiocyanate, and carbodiimide.

Functionalization of readily available bicyclic alkenes provides a potential pathway to synthesizing molecules with complex cyclic structures. However, strained bicyclic alkenes exhibit thermodynamic reactivity driven by strain energy release, which predominantly favors ring-opening pathways. In contrast, ring-retentive hydroalkylation─a direct method for synthesizing complex bridged bicyclic architectures─remains underdeveloped. Here, we present a cobalt-catalyzed enantioselective hydroalkylation strategy for bicyclo[2.2.1]alkenes that enables ring-retentive addition while constructing tertiary carbon stereocenters within oxa- or azabicyclic frameworks. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the hydrometalation of alkenes serves as the selectivity-determining step, where noncovalent interactions between the catalyst and substrate govern stereoisomeric differentiation. The protocol demonstrates broad compatibility with diverse alkyl iodides and bicyclo[2.2.1]alkenes, facilitating late-stage functionalization of bioactive molecules and enabling the efficient synthesis of antifungal agents with potent activity.},

  abstract     = {Developing efficient approaches to synthesize robust large-sized macrocycles with a guest recognition ability represents one of the major focuses in the field of host–guest chemistry. Here, we obtained a series of macrocycles each containing no less than 100 nonhydrogen atoms in high or close to quantitative yield by leveraging catenation as the ligation reaction in the ring closure step. Each of these macrocycles, in the form of pretzelanes, consists of a catenane core whose two interlocked macrocycles are interconnected by a bridging unit. Their pseudoquantitative yields arise from the marriage of dynamic nature of the hydrazone bonds that allows error correction and a hydrophobic effect that drives catenation. Within each pretzelane, the bridging unit breaks planar symmetry, imparting intrinsic planar chirality. When the bridge is sufficiently rigid, it restricts the intramolecular pirouetting of one macrocycle relative to the other, preventing racemization of the enantiomers. Moreover, the rigid bridging and catenane components create a preorganized cavity capable of accommodating various hydrophobic guests. When an anthracene derivative is encapsulated within the pretzelane cavity featuring a viologen bridge, the latter can quench the excited state of the guest, protecting it from UV-stimulated oxidation to 9,10-anthraquinone.},

  abstract     = {The ABC model has been widely used to describe the carrier recombination rate, in which the rate of defect-assisted recombination is assumed to depend linearly on excess carrier density Δ n , leading to a constant recombination coefficient A . However, for multilevel defects that are prevalent in semiconductors, when Δ n varies, we find that the carrier capture and emission of defects can change the defect density distribution in different charge states, which makes the A coefficient depend on Δ n and become a function A ( n ). Therefore, the recombination rate should depend nonlinearly on Δ n . However, in many recent computational studies on multilevel defects, only carrier capture was considered, while carrier emission from defect levels was neglected, causing incorrect charge-state distribution and misleading linear dependence of the rate on Δ n , especially for multilevel defects with shallow levels. Taking V Ga -O N in wurtzite GaN and Pb I in perovskite CsPbI 3 as examples, our calculations showed that neglecting carrier emission can cause the recombination rate to be underestimated by more than 8 orders of magnitude when Δ n is 10 15 cm –3 . Our findings suggest that recent studies on carrier recombination assisted by multilevel defects should be revisited with carrier emission considered, and the widely used ABC model should be reformulated into the A ( n ) BC model.},

Understanding the formation mechanisms of such chiral assemblies is essential for the rational design and precise control of their morphologies and functions. However, the complex noncovalent interactions and multiscale assembly pathways pose significant challenges to unveiling the underlying mechanisms. Herein, we introduce a generic patchy-ellipsoid-chain model that enables efficient coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the assembly kinetics of supramolecular chiral helical microtoroids. Our simulations reveal that the formation of chiral helical microtoroids arises from the synergistic interplay of molecular chirality, directional noncovalent interactions, and solvophobic effects, proceeding through two distinct kinetic pathways: perforation and cyclization. Notably, the perforation pathway predominates due to energetically favorable π–π stacking interactions. This work provides both a robust modeling framework and mechanistic insights into supramolecular chiral self-assembly, offering rational strategies for the design of tailored supramolecular chiral structures.},

This protocol features mild conditions, broad substrate scope (>88 examples), and good functional group tolerance, demonstrating its applicability in diverse cyclopropanation and σ-bond insertion reactions.

This study complements the previous limited exploration of the counterparts of well-established 1,1′-spirobiindane-7,7′-diol (SPINOL) and its modified analogs. The convenient enantioselective synthesis of 2,2′,3,3′-tetrahydro-1,1′-spirobi-[phenalene]-9,9′-diamine (SPHENAM) and 9′-amino-2,2′,3,3′-tetrahydro-1,1′-spirobi[phenalen]-9-ol (NOSPHEN) represents a notable advantage over the limited spirocyclic precedents of this type, which were uniformly derived from their spiro parents. Two synthetic routes, both featuring catalyst-controlled enantioselective induction, have been designed, leading to the convenient construction of a large library of both C 2 -symmetric and non- C 2 -symmetric derivatives of 2,2′,3,3′-tetrahydro-1,1′-spirobi[phenalene]-9,9′-diol (SPHENOL), all with high efficiency and enantiomeric excess. Preliminary studies have demonstrated their superior performance as backbones of diverse effective chiral catalysts and ligands, illustrating their potential in asymmetric synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Undercoordinated metal centers serve as key catalytic sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis. However, their inherent instability under oxidative conditions leads to rapid deactivation, limiting practical applications. Here, we demonstrate that reductive potential pulsing (RPP) is an effective strategy for generating and sustaining highly active undercoordinated Fe species in NiFe (oxy)hydroxide (NiFeOOH) during prolonged OER operation. Implementing this approach in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer enables a remarkable 40% enhancement in current density, achieving stable operation at 0.7 A/cm 2 for 180 h. A key insight from operando X-ray absorption characterization reveals that the OER activity of NiFeOOH is directly correlated with dynamically modulated Fe coordination, while the chemical state of Ni remains largely unchanged during OER and RPP processes. Beyond providing new insights into the long-standing debate over NiFeOOH active sites, this study introduces a practical approach to enhancing both activity and stability, with potential applicability to other electrochemical systems.},

In this study, we present the synthesis of a carbodiphosphoranyl germanium(II) compound and investigate its redox catalytic application. This organogermanium(II) species exhibits excellent catalytic performance in promoting the transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes and imines under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed two distinct catalytic platforms based on Ge II /Ge III /Ge IV and Ge II /Ge IV redox cycles at a single germanium center. These results enable us to achieve the catalytic hydrogenation of azoarenes mediated by frustrated radical pairs (FRPs), as well as the catalytic chemoselective dearomatization of N -heteroarenes undergoing a Ge II /Ge IV redox process.

Recombinant resilin and resilin-derived proteins share resilin’s capacity for liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) and formation of materials with high elasticity and biocompatibility, making it a promising candidate for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering applications. While prior research has focused on domain 1 of resilin, the role of domain 3 (D3) in resilin self-assembly and material properties is not well understood. Here, we used nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance, and small-angle X-ray scattering to study the conformation, dynamics, and intermolecular interactions of D3 as a monomer, in the phase-separated state, and as a cross-linked gel. We show that D3 remains unusually dynamic and is primarily disordered in all three states. In elucidating the mechanism of D3 LLPS, we find a complex set of electrostatic and π-based interactions complemented by the hydrophobic effect that finely tune the solution sensitivity of D3 and its capacity for LLPS. Overall, these results highlight the complex mechanisms governing resilin LLPS with implications for utilizing resilin-derived sequence features in the rational design of self-assembling biomaterials.},

  abstract     = {Ganglio-series glycosphingolipids (ganglio-GSLs) are biologically important glycolipids comprising a glycan of a ganglio-series nature and a lipid called ceramide. The glycan component often contains one or more sialic acid residues. Accesses to structurally defined ganglio-GSLs remain limited due to their structural complexity and synthetic challenges, hindering both functional studies and therapeutic applications. To overcome the challenges, we report herein a scalable chemoenzymatic total synthesis strategy for the construction of the most comprehensive library of ganglio-GSLs to date. A chiral pool approach was developed for synthesizing simple glycosylsphingosines with desired sphingosine lengths (d18:1 or d20:1) from inexpensive d -xylose. Complex glycosylsphingosines were prepared using enzyme assembly synthetic map (EASyMap)-guided streamlined one-pot multienzyme (OPME) and stepwise OPME (StOPMe) glycosylation strategies facilitated by designing mutants with improved catalytic efficiencies for two key glycosyltransferases (CjCgtA and human ST6GALNAC5). Ganglio-GSLs containing a terminal primary amino group were then prepared by chemical acylation, enabling their covalent immobilization on magnetic beads to form a novel comprehensive ganglio-GSL-bead library encompassing 0-, a-, b-, and c-series ganglio-GSLs including structures containing up to five sialic acid residues with different (α2–3/6/8) sialyl linkages. Multiplex binding assays revealed that ganglio-GSLs exhibit distinctive interactions with glycan-binding proteins including plant lectins, antiganglioside antibodies, bacterial toxins, galectins, and human and mouse siglecs. The integration of streamlined chemoenzymatic total synthesis strategies, glycosyltransferase engineering, covalent immobilization of GSL analogs, and a multiplex assay platform enables synthesis and high-throughput studies of previously difficult-to-obtain ganglio-GSLs. It is broadly applicable to help advance glycobiology and develop GSL-based diagnostics and therapeutics.},

LH1-RC has a highly conserved surrounding lipid composition known to favor anionic lipids for an unknown function. In this work, we compared experimentally the rate of LH1-to-RC energy transfer in detergent, membrane nanodiscs with varying lipid compositions, purified membrane fragments, and live cells. The energy transfer rate indicated that RC turnover decreased in neutral lipids, yet was partially restored in anionic lipids, revealing an unexpected lipid dependence. In complementary molecular dynamics simulations, the anionic lipid cardiolipin showed electrostatic interactions with LH1-RC that may mediate quinone exchange, providing a mechanism for the observed lipid dependence. Overall, these results revealed that anionic lipids facilitate LH1-RC redox cycling, identifying a functional role for membrane composition in photosynthetic solar energy conversion.},

Reaction studies reveal the influence of the metal coordinated in the inner pocket of the ligand upon the activity of the metal coordinated in the outer pocket, with different heterobimetallic catalysts being found to be optimal for the depolymerization of PET and PLA respectively.

  abstract     = {Highly crystalline ternary copper–molybdenum sulfide (Cu 2 MoS 4 ) has been demonstrated to promote the electro/photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Theoretical calculations have suggested that Cu 2 MoS 4 outperforms molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) because of its more moderate free energy of hydrogen adsorption, Δ G H* . However, the elucidation of intermediates involved in this process remains challenging, rendering the mechanistic details and specific role of Cu in improving activity uncertain. Herein, we describe the isolation and characterization of [NEt 4 ][Tp*MoS 3 (CuSPh) 2 ] (Tp* = tris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)borate), a molecular model of Cu 2 MoS 4 capable of promoting electrocatalytic HER. Mechanistic investigations by DFT and multireference variational 2-electron reduced density matrix (v2RDM)-CASSCF implicate a sulfur-based hydrogen evolution pathway in which the bridging μ 2 -sulfides are rendered more basic by one-electron reduction, which populates a Mo-4d/S-3p based orbital with significant electron delocalization on the two μ 2 -sulfides. Reduction and protonation of two adjacent Mo(μ 2 -S) moieties leads to H 2 elimination with an accessible energy barrier of +20.2 kcal/mol. This pathway contrasts recent studies of stilbene hydrogenation by [Mo 3 S 4 Cl 3 (ImNH 2 ) 3 ] + , in which formation of the corresponding one-electron reduced μ 2 -SH species via H 2 splitting leads to spin density being shared across the Mo III centers. These results provide an atomistic perspective into the role of Cu in modulating the μ 2 -S p K a and facilitating HER via a formal Mo VI/IV cycle with significant electron delocalization between Mo, Cu, and μ 2 -S.},

Algorithms to relocate short π-systems, often against a thermochemical bias, with simultaneous regio- and stereocontrol, are a feat of precision that remains challenging to translate to a laboratory setting. The divergent biosynthesis of vitamin D and tachysterol from previtamin D, leveraging positional or geometric isomerization, is a powerful exemplar. Inspired by this venerable blueprint, a deconjugative isomerization of borylated dienoates has been developed under the auspices of photochemical activation. Alleviating ground-state thermochemical restrictions through light-induced reactivity enables facile bifurcation of the diene and carbonyl chromophores: this occurs by a geometric isomerization/[1,5]-hydrogen shift sequence that emulates previtamin D photobiology. Broad functional group tolerance is observed, allowing the process to be leveraged in complex settings that would otherwise require multistep approaches. It is envisaged that the operationally simple, enabling nature of this strategy, coupled with the traceless nature of the boron handle, will stimulate interest in poly(ene) relocation strategies and begin to reconcile the paucity of synthetic methods with their ubiquity in biosynthesis.},

  abstract     = {Chemical imaging holds great promise for chemical, materials, and biological applications. However, its contrast often relies on subtle spectral differences arising from molecular-level changes. Here, we introduce label-free chemical imaging based on bond-specific coherent interference, which is highly sensitive to nanoscopic structural variations in collagen fibers. We demonstrated this idea using vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG) microscopy to identify lung tumors by detecting collagen I structural remodeling. Hyperspectral VSFG images reveal dramatic differences in the NH and CH x stretch regions between metastatic and tumor-free lung tissues. Based on these differences, key spectral signatures, such as the intensity ratio of NH S /CH 2,Ss and CH S /CH 2,Ss modes, were established to reliably distinguish metastatic tumor and tumor-free tissues with high fidelity. Theoretical modeling based on structural knowledge from Electron Microscopy indicates that distinctive interferences between VSFG vibrational modes make the intensity ratio directly related to interfibrillar distances at the 20–50 nm level. These findings suggest that collagen fibrils are more densely packed in tumors, corroborating the enhanced stiffness observed in tumor tissues. This result establishes an interference-based imaging mechanism that enhances chemical contrast and enables nanoscale structural readouts without labels. This method not only preserves sample integrity but also provides a powerful platform for fundamental biophysical studies and holds strong potential for future applications in oncology and pathology.},

The SD-ACL achieves anisotropic mass transport through structurally decoupled pathways: promoting rapid through-plane gas transport with a hydrophobic porous network while driving spontaneous in-plane water drainage via capillary action. As a result, the SD-ACL-fabricated membrane electrode assemble (MEA) achieved a high peak power density of 1150.3 mW cm –2 at high humidity with excellent durability, which was 2.3 times higher than that of the traditional one. Moreover, the SD-ACL could enhance nonprecious metal-anode-based AEMFCs by 57.5%, offering a promising strategy to achieve high-performance platinum-group metal-free (PGM-free) AEMFC technology.},

  abstract     = {The ability to induce and modulate chirality in metal halide perovskite semiconductors (MHPs) using chiral additives expands the compositional design space and offers a means of tuning chiroptical properties. Motivated by the ability of phosphonic acids to interact with metal ions, we designed three chiral phosphonic acids (CPAs) to impose chirality in otherwise achiral 2D MHP, phenylammonium tin iodide (PA 2 SnI 4 ). We found that both the position of the phosphonic acid relative to the bond between the two naphthalene rings (i.e., the chiral axis) and the distance between the phosphonic acid and the binaphthyl chiral units significantly impact the transfer of structural chirality into the MHP lattice. The compound with a phosphonic acid directly bound to one of the naphthalene rings at the carbon adjacent to the chiral axis resulted in the largest circular dichroism dissymmetry factor of the three phosphonic acids. Furthermore, optical pump-terahertz probe measurements reveal an increase in the charge carrier mobility in the MHPs following the addition of CPAs. This dual functionality of CPAs in inducing chirality and improving charge transport properties in MHPs is promising for chiral-optoelectronic applications.},

Herein, we design a defective fluorinated covalent organic framework (FCOF) with localized high polarity based on a truncated monomer strategy. Controllable defect design in the FCOF framework produces polar amino groups with enhanced Zn 2+ trapping ability. Meanwhile, an additional transport pathway was formed at the well-designed defect sites, which reduced the migration energy barriers. The Zn 2+ diffusion coefficient of the optimal defective FCOF separators (FCOF-30, with 30% defect content) was calculated to be 9.83 × 10 –10 cm s –1 (2 times higher than FCOF). At 10 mA cm –2 (5 mAh cm –2 ), the symmetric cell using FCOF-30 exhibited excellent Zn 2+ deposition/stripping behavior with 1200 h cycling stability.

This study presents a systematic investigation of the synthesis, properties, and reactivity of diazoboranes. In this work, the diazoborane library is expanded to eight species by varying the carbene ligands coordinated to boron, allowing the identification of key correlations between ligand electronic properties and diazoborane behavior. The results demonstrate that increasing carbene π-acidity weakens the B–N bond while strengthening the N–N bond, significantly decreasing thermal stability. Kinetic studies reveal that less π-acidic carbenes promote a second-order decay mechanism, leading to dibora-azine formation, whereas more π-acidic carbenes favor first-order dinitrogen dissociation, facilitating borylene generation. Electrochemical studies indicate that redox potentials also correlate with carbene π-acidity. Three representative reactivity studies are presented in which the same substrate reacts with different diazoboranes to yield either different products or the same product via different reaction mechanisms. These insights provide a generalizable framework for tuning diazoborane properties, facilitating their use in cycloaddition chemistry and small-molecule activation.},

A new member in the ternary RE 10 MCd 3 series, Gd 10 RuCd 3 , was predicted and synthesized as an experimental validation. The recommendation engine is based on partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) crystallographic site processing to classify the site preference of elements in compounds crystallizing in the Y 10 RuCd 3 -type structure and upon projecting other elements onto Principal Component map, the titled compound emerged as the top candidate. The distinguishing feature of the developed recommendation engine is in the three explainable methods utilized in the predictive framework: unrestricted, conservative, and cluster methods. Predictions are visualized with convenient property projection tools. The prediction was validated by high-temperature synthesis. The structure was confirmed with single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction. The cold-water-quenched samples quenched at 800 °C have a smaller unit cell volume than the samples quenched at 600 °C annealing temperature. Transport property measurements show an unusually low thermal conductivity (5–7 W·m –1 K –1 ) and a trend change indicates a possible structure transition between 600 and 800 °C. The unusual low thermal conductivity was predicted with a machine-learning model that focuses on thermoelectric property prediction. DFT analysis reveals the presence of a 0D electride phenomenon. The neutron cross section and absorption based on the constituent elements put our material within the top 0.4% of neutron absorbers. The negative thermal expansion and high mass absorption suggest Gd 10 RuCd 3 as an attractive neutron absorption material.},

  abstract     = {Quantities that break both mirror symmetry and time-reversal symmetry, such as the orbital angular momentum, are known to connect molecular chirality with an applied magnetic field. This concept has led to observations such as magneto-chiral dichroism and chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). However, being small, these effects often require additional amplification procedures such as flow chemistry to achieve bulk enantioseparation. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnetic field effect on photogenerated radical pairs, which also breaks time-reversal symmetry, can be harnessed for enantiopurification. Fundamental to this process is the collective decay of the singlet and triplet radical-pair states made possible by an applied magnetic field. Because opposite enantiomers exhibit spin–orbit coupling matrix elements of opposite signs, the singlet and triplet decay channels interfere constructively in one enantiomer. Meanwhile, molecules of the other enantiomer are funnelled into the first enantiomer through excited-state chirality inversion, achieving (dynamic kinetic) chiral resolution. Using an axially chiral binaphthyl derivative and a borane photosensitizer as prototype, we predict an appreciable enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of 90% to be possible at steady state, attained within hundreds of milliseconds when irradiated by a laser. Importantly, our analytical results showcase regimes of perfect enantioselectivity (100% e.e.), accessible by further chemical optimization of the photosensitizer for which general strategies are discussed. Overall, this work illustrates a so-far untapped but powerful control knob for photoredox catalysis based on spin chemistry principles.},

Targeting the introduction of a hydride ligand to the bimetallic core, our reactivity studies have revealed a preference for the hydride ligand to be bound to the Rh center, instead of the Sn center.

While most research focuses on close-packed crystal structures, nonclose-packed frameworks─exemplified by UCl 3 -type structures─offer unique advantages in enhancing lithium-ion transport via reduced diffusion barriers. Here, we report a new family of UCl 3 -type crystalline oxychloride electrolytes, Li 0.388+ x La 0.475 Ta 0.238 Cl 3– x O x (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.388, LLTCO), synthesized via rapid high-energy shake milling. The material with an optimized composition ( x = 0.15) exhibits high ionic conductivity above 2 mS cm –1 at 30 °C, oxidative stability exceeding 5 V vs Li/Li + , and excellent mechanical compressibility. Moreover, the LLTCO-based Li–Li symmetric cells show a long cycle life, indicating their strong capacity to suppress lithium dendrite formation. Spectroscopy analyses reveal the successful incorporation of oxygen, which preferentially substitutes Cl – around Ta 5+ sites without compromising crystallinity, even at a high oxygen content. The oxygen incorporation further promotes the formation of Li environments with fast dynamics, accounting for the enhanced conductivity. All-solid-state batteries utilizing the optimized oxychloride electrolyte in conjunction with Ni-rich cathodes demonstrate enhanced reversible capacities compared to their undoped counterparts. This work highlights the benefits of nonclose-packed UCl 3 -type oxychloride electrolytes, offering new design strategies for high-performance all-solid-state batteries.},

The flux synthesis method facilitates the gram-scale production of COFs, enabling their successful assembly into functional pouch cells. As a result, the assembled pouch cell delivers a reversible maximum capacity of 92 mAh g –1 at 0.1 A g –1 , corresponding to a total capacity of 0.92 Ah, approaching the theoretical design capacity.

  abstract     = {Crown ether compounds have garnered significant research interest for decades due to their unique host–guest supramolecular structure and various properties, such as ferroelectricity. However, although many crown ether derivatives have been developed, only the classical crown ether represented by 18-crown-6 was used as the host for crown ether host–guest-type ferroelectrics, and the heterocrown ether-based ferroelectrics have never been reported. Here, for the first time, we propose the strategy of asymmetric coordination through heterocrown ether as a host molecule to unlock ferroelectricity in metal-crown host–guest assemblies. Compared to the symmetrical coordination of the parent M(NO 3 ) 2 (18-crown-6) (M = Pb 2+ or Cd 2+ ), an asymmetric coordination environment for the M 2+ ion was created in M(NO 3 ) 2 (1-aza-18-crown-6), enabling precise symmetry breaking and inducing ferroelectricity. Remarkably, Pb(NO 3 ) 2 (1-aza-18-crown-6) exhibits an ultrahigh T c of 470 K, which represents the maximum value reported to date for crown ether-based ferroelectrics. Such high T c originates from the synergistic effect of disordered rotation commonly observed in the host–guest compounds and the unique out-of-plane flipping motion of the −NH– group in aza-crown ether. To the best of our knowledge, M(NO 3 ) 2 (1-aza-18-crown-6) represents the birth of the first heterocrown ether ferroelectric family. Our findings provide a new way to design crown ether host–guest ferroelectrics with high performance and greatly stimulate the further exploration of heterocrown ether ferroelectrics.},

However, synthetic limitations have hitherto restricted their accessibility to group 8 transition metals. Herein, we present a facile and versatile approach to access such 16e–18e complexes of early transition metals, [CpV(η 5 -E 5 )] 1–/2– , [CpCr(η 5 -E 5 )] − , and [Cp*Mn(η 5 -P 5 )] − (E = P, As; Cp = η 5 -C 5 H 5 ). By utilizing the Zintl phase precursor K 3 E 7 as a reductant, these new complexes can be rapidly synthesized via one-pot reactions at ambient temperature within 1 h. This method enables the preparation of diverse derivatives from [CpV(η 5 -E 5 )] 2– , including the oxidative coupling product [(CpV) 2 (μ,η 4:4:1:1 -P 10 )] 2– as well as its niobium congener [(CpNb) 2 (μ,η 4:4:1:1 -P 10 )] 2– , and the addition rearrangement products [(CpV) 6 P 10 ] 2– and [(CpV)(μ,η 4:5 -As 5 )Mn(η 3 -As 3 )] 2– .

  abstract     = {One-dimensional (1D) carbon nanomaterials have attracted significant attention due to their unique directional confinement effect and electronic structure. Conventional synthesis strategies have struggled to achieve vertically aligned architectures with large aspect ratios, scalable yields, and tunable electronic structures. Herein, we propose a sodium chloride (NaCl) salt-assisted template approach to enable the vertical growth of amorphous carbon ribbons (CRs), which have long-range disordered and short-range ordered skeleton structures, with the attributes of a new type of carbon allotrope. The significance of lattice stability, lattice matching, and molecular structure of precursors is investigated to elucidate the trifunctional roles of NaCl microcrystals as induction, catalysis, and growth templates. Furthermore, an advanced vapor-surface-solid (VSS) growth mechanism, stemming from π–π stacking and polymerization of perylene-based skeletons, is validated to afford the vertical growth of CRs. Strikingly, tunable sp 2 /sp 3 carbon ratios allow for modulating the electronic structure. Correspondingly, the representative CRs are p-type semiconductors with a wide band gap of 3.32 eV, exhibiting rapid responsiveness to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The free-standing CR films deliver an out-of-plane conductive network, a large permittivity in the X-wave frequency range, and outstanding stability. Our contribution opens a novel roadmap in terms of innovative synthesis and fascinating applications of the 1D carbon family.},

Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals that both band-edge and trap-state electrons can transfer to the RAFT agent. The relatively sluggish hole transfer, due to hole localization to copper states, can be accelerated by introducing amines as hole scavengers. The reaction exhibits well-defined characteristics of living polymerization and proceeds efficiently in the presence of a 3 mm biological tissue barrier under 1050 nm irradiation.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical nitrate (NO 3 – ) reduction to ammonia (NH 3 ) offers a sustainable approach for NH 3 synthesis while concurrently addressing NO 3 – pollution. However, achieving efficient NO 3 – -to-NH 3 conversion remains challenging due to sluggish multistep proton-coupled electron transfer processes and poor intermediate converison. Here, we present a nanocatalyst featuring a hollow nanocavity encased within a shell rich in Cu/Ru heterointerfaces, which synergistically leverages both interfacial and structural advantages to effectively lower energy barriers and accelerate intermediate conversion kinetics, thereby enhancing the overall catalytic performance for NH 3 production. Density functional theory (DFT) computations, supported by operando and control experiments, reveal that CuRu heterointerfaces with their optimized electronic structure act as the primary active sites, establishing a favorable NO 3 – -to-NH 3 reaction pathway. Simultaneously, the catalytic synergy between Cu and CuRu sites enables tandem catalysis, which is further amplified by nanocavity-induced spatial confinement of the key intermediate NO 2 – . This nanocatalyst is realized via a Kirkendall effect–driven strategy, with its structural features systematically optimized. The resulting catalyst demonstrates outstanding NH 3 production performance in a 0.1 M KNO 3 + 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, delivering a Faradaic efficiency of 97.4%, a yield of 152.6 mg h –1 mg metal –1 , and an energy efficiency of 40% at a low potential of −0.1 V RHE ─positioning it as a top contender among state-of-the-art NO 3 – -to-NH 3 electrocatalysts. By elucidating mechanistic insights into interfacial effects, tandem catalysis, and nanoconfinement, this work highlights the synergistic impact of compositional and structural engineering and offers a generalizable design strategy for advancing NO 3 – -to-NH 3 electroconversion and broader sustainable catalytic transformations.},

  abstract     = {Distinct from traditional halide perovskites, which are based on main-group elements (e.g., Pb 2+ , Sn 2+ , Ge 2+ ) and are typically semiconducting, transition metals like Cu 2+ ─characterized by partially filled d-orbitals─offer unique advantages in modulating the electronic behavior of perovskite materials. However, the strong Jahn–Teller effect of Cu 2+ makes it a significant challenge for stabilizing a robust three-dimensional perovskite framework. Herein, we report the first synthesis of a metallic cubic perovskite phase of CsCuBr 3 via a tailored structural design under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals that the orthorhombic nonperovskite CsCuBr 3 precursor (space group C 222 1 ) transforms into a cubic perovskite structure (space group Pm -3 m ) featuring an undistorted corner-sharing octahedral framework at ∼22 GPa and ∼603 K. The perovskite structure remains stable at pressure down to 4.3 GPa at room temperature, while at low temperatures below 50 K, it may be recovered to ambient pressure. Notably, the structure lacks both the expected luminescence and a distinct absorption edge, instead exhibiting a metallic behavior, as confirmed by temperature-dependent resistance measurements. Electronic structure calculations at 22.4 GPa and 0 K further reveal pronounced hybridization between the Cu-3d and Br-4p orbitals near the Fermi level, leading to an enhanced orbital degeneracy and electron delocalization. These findings demonstrate that the lattice contraction effectively suppresses the strong Jahn–Teller distortion intrinsic to Cu 2+ , offering a promising strategy for the design of high-performance novel materials.},

  abstract     = {Enzymatic halogenation of C–H bonds is a promising approach to synthesize chlorine-containing compounds. However, few halogenases chlorinate C(sp 3 )–H bonds of molecules lacking a carrier protein, and only a small subset readily accommodate non-native substrates. Competitive oxygenation of non-native substrates makes their halogenation a challenge to achieve. Herein, we report a strategy for the halogenation of unnatural substrates by which an anchoring group leads them to masquerade as the native substrate. By this approach, a series of terpenoids connected to an indole moiety, undergo enzymatic halogenation catalyzed by WelO5*, a non-heme, α-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenase. By in silico substrate evaluation and mutagenesis, we generated WelO5* variants that catalyze the chlorination of C(sp 3 )–H bonds in a series of non-native substrates with high selectivity for chlorination over oxygenation and with excellent stereoselectivity, as well as variants that catalyze bromination and azidation. Studies that vary the anchoring group showed that a series of heteroaromatic and aromatic groups can enhance reactivity and can influence the degree of chlorination of the anchored menthol substrate. Cleavage of the ester tethering the indole anchoring group to the terpenoid gives the free halogenated compound.},

  abstract     = {Alpha-synuclein (αS) is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that can self-assemble into amyloid fibrils, undergoing a transition from disordered monomers to ordered β-sheet-rich fibrils. The amyloid state of αS is implicated in various synucleinopathies, most notably Parkinson’s disease (PD), in which αS fibrils accumulate as insoluble Lewy body deposits. Colocalized with αS in Lewy bodies are elevated levels of metal ions including Zn 2+ . We find in vitro that Zn 2+ accelerates aggregation of N-terminally acetylated αS, decreasing the t 50 ca. 5-fold, as measured by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence. Strikingly, the extent of Zn 2+ binding (native mass spectrometry; MS) and shifts of the monomeric αS conformational ensemble toward compaction, measured using ion mobility MS (IM-MS) at different αS:Zn 2+ ratios, mirror precisely the accelerated aggregation kinetics. Chemical shift perturbations in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were investigated together with molecular dynamics (MD) to map the Zn 2+ binding sites and subsequent effects on conformation under identical solution conditions to those used in IM-MS. Zn 2+ is found to predominantly interact with negative residues in the C-terminal region of αS but also His50 in the N-terminal region. This promiscuity in interactions potentially guides compaction of the protein chain by bridging residues between the N- and C-terminal regions through Zn 2+ ion co-ordination. This study provides insights into the early stages of amyloid assembly, correlating aggregation kinetics with structural compaction in monomeric αS and highlighting the capability of native IM-MS to resolve complex structural ensembles of a disordered protein.},

  abstract     = {We report on a remarkable phenomenon of interfacial electric dipole inversion coupled to changes in atomic spin densities that translates into the enantiomeric inversion of electron spin-dependent conductance in a 2-terminal single-molecule junction, consisting of a 22 amino acid chiral α-helical peptide sequence connecting two metal electrodes. This phenomenon is conventionally associated with the Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect and how it induces spin polarization and spin filtering of the electron transport along the main peptide axis. Here, the inversion of the spin-dependent charge transport behavior is achieved by keeping constant the chiral symmetry of the junction while inverting the direction of the internal electrical dipole moment running along the main helical peptide axis. Using a spinterface model, in which the electrode-molecule injection barriers are dependent both on the electric dipole and magnetic spin moment, we have been able to rationalize the current pattern as arising from a surface dipole inversion and changes in the atomic spin densities in atoms located within the peptide backbone. Both experimental and computational results show that the observed electric dipole-induced spin-dependent transport inversion in the chiral peptide junction links to an inversion in the spin-dependent resistance due to the combined effect of the helical-based CISS effect and the electrode/molecule spinterface.},

  abstract     = {Organic molecular crystals are stereotypically considered brittle, fragile, and prone to disintegration, especially when under anisotropic shear forces. However, robust intermolecular interactions and subtle molecular packing motifs may enable a crystal lattice with extraordinary mechanical properties. Here, we present an organic molecular crystal composed of a chiral dithiolane derivative ( R - TAE ) that can be cropped and cut into arbitrary shapes by external shear forces. Macroscopic R - TAE crystals prepared through a three-solvent diffusion method can be mechanically torn apart by tweezers or precisely cut into desirable shapes, such as semicircles, triangles, triangular waves, pentagons, and stars, by using ordinary scissors, while retaining high crystallinity and structural integrity. Compared with the racemic crystals ( RS - TAE ), an R - TAE crystal possesses a more flexible and adaptive lattice, enabling the crystal to bend and curl under mechanical stress reversibly. The unconventional yet simple crystal shape programming peculiarity emanates from a specific molecular design and organization that inherently incorporate chiral symmetry-breaking effects in the R - TAE crystal lattice. Moreover, it is revealed that the high asymmetry facilitates effective energy dissipation during the shear force-driven reconstruction of the adaptable hydrogen-bonding network and crystal lattice slippage when the crystal is subjected to shear forces. Instead of cracking or shattering, R - TAE crystals retain their overall morphology intact and exhibit a significant elastic modulus enhancement after ultraviolet-induced disulfide bond reorganization, suggesting robust resistance to photoinduced internal stress. Our research highlights the strategic integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches, resulting in dynamic crystals with desirable anisotropic properties and enabling their precise and straightforward processability.},

However, the currently reported CHOIPs predominantly rely on the molecular chirality arising from the interaction between chiral organic cations and inorganic backbones, leading to suboptimal chiral expression. Herein, we report the synthesis of a CHOIP superstructure film ( R -MBA) x ( S -MBA) (1– x ) BiI 4 , which exhibited significantly enhanced chirality through a subtle enantiomeric excess ( ee ) approach. The implementation of a 20% ee in a mixture of two CHOIP enantiomers resulted in a substantial enhancement of the genuine circular dichroism (CD) asymmetry factor ( g CD > 0.03), exhibiting an increase of more than 50-fold compared to that of the enantiopure film. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that the superstructure adopted an identical crystalline phase to that of the pure enantiomeric ones, suggesting that the observed enhancement does not originate from intracrystalline chirality. Integrating theoretical simulations, we posit that the observed chiral enhancement is predominantly attributed to crystal transfer from the nanoscale, defined as the superstructure chirality formed by mixed enantiomers. These findings establish a novel framework for exploring superstructure chirality in CHOIPs, offering new perspectives for future research in this field.},

  abstract     = {Earth-abundant, visible light absorbing zirconium photosensitizers are of great interest for their long-lived excited states. These photosensitizers consist of two electron rich tridentate ligands ligated to an electron deficient d 0 Zr(IV) metal center, coordination chemistry that gives rise to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excited states. The vectoral nature of an LMCT transition was expected to give rise to an excited state dipole moment that electroabsorption data reported herein show is in fact absent for these photosensitizers. Electroabsorption spectra of three Zr(IV) photosensitizers bearing two tridentate pyridinedipyrrolide ligands, abbreviated Zr(PDP) 2 , were measured in a 2-MeTHF glass. Analysis of both traditional and higher-order electroabsorption spectra revealed significant changes in the polarizability between the ground and excited state without a dipole moment change. The spectral data indicates that upon the absorption of a single photon a quadrupolar excited state is formed via a simultaneous and equal charge transfer from both tridentate ligands to the Zr metal center. The data presented herein provides the first direct experimental evidence for such behavior in transition metal complexes with charge transfer excited states. The implications for the design of LMCT photosensitizers and our fundamental understanding of symmetry breaking in transition metal complexes are discussed.},

Recently, molecular qubits came forward as precisely tunable entities that present a compelling alternative to well-established yet hard-to-tune point defects in solid-state systems. In this work, we disclose ground-state triplet carbenes as purely organic qubits comprising two unpaired electrons in close proximity that can be generated in a crystalline matrix with high spatial accuracy via in situ photoactivation. We further demonstrate how state-of-the-art multireference quantum chemical calculations provide insight into their fundamental spin characteristics. As a result, several key assets were realized in a single solid-state qubit material under cryogenic conditions: The exclusive use of light elements (C, H, N, O), photolithographic patterning, optical spin-selective transitions, and a large zero-field splitting in the GHz regime, which, taken together, lays the ground for optically detected magnetic resonance with remarkable fluorescence contrast of >40% and record-high spin coherence times of T 2 = 157(4) μs at 5 K.},

Here, we demonstrate that persistent MPs in the environment profoundly enhance ice nucleation and alter precipitation patterns, which may disrupt air quality, atmospheric chemistry, and climate. Degradation of MPs leads to micronization, nanoporosification, and surface functionalization, significantly boosting their ice-nucleating activity. By integrating global airborne MP data with ice-nucleation assessments, we find that micronization alone can increase cloud-ice-crystal concentrations by up to an order of magnitude. This effect is further amplified when coupled with nanoporosification or surface functionalization with the potential to trigger extreme precipitation events and contribute to climate anomalies. Our research highlights the far more severe consequences of MPs for the future climate than previously imagined, with profound implications for atmospheric science, environmental chemistry, and climate dynamics.},

However, degradation of a full protein in a physiological setting might lead to dose-limiting toxicities, giving rise to the need for PROTACs that are activated in a context-dependent nature. Here, we report the development of hypoxia-activated PROTACs (HAP-TACs) which are selectively activated in conditions of low oxygen (hypoxia) such as those found in solid tumors. To develop HAP-TACs, we have attached an indolequinone bioreductive group to an essential functional group of either the VHL- or cereblon-recruiting component of the PROTAC, reducing affinity for its cognate E3 ligase and preventing degradation of the protein of interest. Using BRD4, we have conducted proof-of-concept studies which demonstrate that the indolequinone group is bioreduced under hypoxic conditions, releasing the active PROTAC, resulting in selective degradation of BRD4 in hypoxia. As the bioreductive group is attached to the VHL or cereblon ligand, this approach is potentially applicable to all PROTACs that recruit these commonly employed E3 ligases.},

Through lipid screening, we identified a promising lipid scaffold capable of disrupting the membrane system of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

  abstract     = {Nanofluidics-based reverse electrodialysis offers a promising approach for harnessing the osmotic energy that exists between saline and fresh water, thereby providing a sustainable source of power. Nevertheless, the key obstacle to realizing a commercially viable power output stems from inadequate ion permselectivity in nanofluidics. Here, we engineer dual asymmetric MXene-based composite nanofluidics (DA-MXCNs) composed of a negatively charged, porous MXene layer and a positively charged, confined MXene layer, which strategically incorporates asymmetric channel dimensions and opposing charge distributions. This design simultaneously reduces ion diffusion paths and amplifies ion potential differences, thereby optimizing the ion permeability and selectivity. The DA-MXCNs exhibit a 3.4-fold increase in ion flux (7.71 mmol m –2 h –1 ) over the unmodified nanofluidics, and thus a high Na + selectivity coefficient of 0.985 and a Na + /Cl – selectivity ratio of approximately 65.7, indicative of superior preferential cation transport. Experimental and theoretical evidence supports that the dual asymmetric manipulations not only enable unidirectional and rapid cation transport but also create a high energy barrier for anions and a low one for cations, thereby achieving ultrahigh ion selectivity. Utilizing the DA-MXCNs, the osmotic energy conversion system achieves an impressive power density of up to 126.0 W m –2 , which surpasses the performance of existing MXene-based nanofluidics and shows the capacity for powering a variety of electrical devices. This strategy, grounded in optimized permselective nanofluidics, lays the foundation for advancements in ion batteries and ion separation technologies.},

The orientation of the imine linker controls the donor–acceptor interactions in these π-conjugated COFs, resulting in a large modulation of the valence band maximum (−4.2 to −5.4 eV) and the band gap ( E g ≈ 1.2–1.6 eV). p -Doping of COFs in iodine vapor results in the formation of highly delocalized polarons with an absorption band extending into the far-infrared (THz band) region. Reducing the TANG–TANG internodal distance increases the 2D bandwidth dispersion and leads to the highest (in the series) electrical conductivity (10 –1 S/cm), the lowest conductance activation energy (50 meV near room temperature), and the most red-shifted polaron absorption (λ edge ∼ 160 μm, 8 meV) in the series.},

The oversolubility effect occurs regardless of the activated carbon’s functional groups and level of disorder and is enhanced for smaller pore sizes. Oversolubility is quantified using solid-state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), enabling differentiation between in-pore and ex-pore CO 2 and HCO 3 – . Atomistic modeling of the system, based on a machine-learning model delivering first-principles accuracy, suggests that the effect is driven by an adsorption-like mechanism underpinned by favorable interactions between CO 2 and the pore walls. Our findings demonstrate the unexpected importance of oversolubility for gas uptake in microporous, solvent-saturated carbon electrodes, an effect with direct relevance for improving electrochemical CO 2 capture and conversion technologies.},

We show that SelecTAC B can effectively degrade indicated proteins such as CD40 and ICOSL on B cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) without affecting protein expression in other immune cell types. The degradation of key proteins involved in T cell stimulation pathways led to sustained inhibition of B cell functions.

Herein, we exploit facile H 2 activation and reversible hydride transfer from a metal surface to a molecular reagent, the net hydrogen reduction reaction (HRR), to develop a potentiometric method for quantifying Δ G H– of main group reagents recalcitrant to conventional methods. HRR potentiometry is first validated with a benzimidazole-based hydride donor and then applied to uncover the impact of the reaction environment on hydricity. For a benzimidazole-based hydride donor, HRR equilibrium potentials are roughly invariant across solvents, indicating that the solvent dependence of its hydricity largely reflects the differential solvation of H – across media. For formate, HRR potentials and corresponding hydricities depend strongly on water content. For borohydrides, HRR potentiometry reveals that effective hydricity values are strongly influenced by Lewis acid–base adduct formation with the hydride acceptor but are minimally influenced by the countercation. Together with these studies, the advantages, limitations, and practical considerations of the HRR potentiometry method are discussed, highlighting the power of this methodology as a complementary tool to measure molecular hydricity.},

  abstract     = {Atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) embedded within carbon substrates are gaining considerable attention for their high metal atom utilization and exceptional catalytic activity. The coordination structure of the active catalytic center is crucial to catalytic performance; however, accurately characterizing these structures remains challenging due to the inherent structural diversity in real-world ADCs and the difficulty of identifying the light elements (e.g., C and N) surrounding central metal atoms. Herein, we propose a protocol to interpret the X-ray absorption spectroscopy, thereby identifying the most probable representative structures of ADCs. Our method integrates average coordination numbers, oxidation states of central metal atoms, and the specific light elements bonded to these metal atoms. This protocol is applicable to single-, dual-, and trimetal atom catalysts, offering a more rational method for structural assignment. By addressing key methodological limitations in current structural assignments for ADCs, our approach improves the reliability of active site identification and provides a foundation for more accurate structure–activity relationship studies in catalytic systems.},

Here, we report on-demand nonalternating copolymerization of ethylene with carbon monoxide (CO) via a facile tandem gas compensation strategy, which achieves a precision control over carbonyl incorporation with uniform distribution across a broad range (0–50%). Such a synthetic advance offers a unique multiblock structure having short polar segments ((CH 2 –CH 2 ) n –CO−) ( n < 4) and extended nonpolar methylene sequences ( n > 4). Remarkably, the resulting quasi-multiblock copolymer (q-MBCP) delivers a robust compatibilization for polyethylene and nylon blends, thus transforming brittle materials into mechanically tough composites. This work elucidates the mechanistic evolution between nonpolar polyethylene and polar alternating polyketone phases, while offering a practical and sustainable solution to advance closed-loop recycling of mixed plastic waste.},

  abstract     = {High-nickel LiNi 0.83 Co 0.12 Mn 0.05 O 2 (NCM83) cathodes suffer from interfacial instability resulting from cathode–electrolyte reactions and anisotropic mechanical strain within secondary particles. Herein, we present a mechanically adaptive cathode–electrolyte interphase (CEI) engineered via a dynamic covalent network that features a supramolecular ion-conducting polyurethane ureido-pyrimidinone (SPU-UPy) elastomer. The dynamic network integrates cooperative hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds and imparts exceptional mechanical resilience and autonomous self-healing capabilities that allow it to accommodate volume fluctuations without compromising structural integrity. The SPU-UPy layer is also designed with strong transition metal ion–O/N coordination bonds that greatly enhance adhesion to the NCM83 surface and mitigate transition metal dissolution in the electrolyte. The polyether backbone facilitates efficient Li-ion transport across the interface and ensures a homogeneous interfacial Li concentration during intercalation/deintercalation. Consequently, the dynamic CEI-coated NCM83 cathodes achieve exceptional long-term cycling stability with a high-capacity retention of 82.2% after 400 cycles at 1 C. This work elucidates the critical role of dynamic covalent chemistry in stabilizing Ni-rich cathode interfaces and establishes a new paradigm for the design of high-energy-density batteries through mechano-adaptive interfacial engineering.},

  abstract     = {The development of efficient and air-stable n-type organic semiconductors suitable for molecular n-doping is critical for advancing high-performance, durable organic electronic devices, including transistors, thermoelectrics, and photovoltaics. Machine learning offers a powerful approach to uncovering hidden relationships between molecular structures and their electronic properties, thereby accelerating the discovery and design of promising materials. To support this effort, we constructed a curated database comprising 84 n-type conductive polymers, each characterized by experimental measurements under n-doping conditions with 4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1 H -benzoimidazol-2-yl)phenyl dimethylamine (N-DMBI-H), and augmented with density functional theory calculations to provide complementary molecular descriptors. After constructing the database, we developed a fusion deep learning model that integrates convolutional neural networks with fully connected artificial neural networks to capture both structural and property-based features of the polymers. The model was trained on the data set and evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. The model was further applied to a test set of n-type polymers bearing oligoethylene glycol (OEG) side chains, enabling the identification of key physical factors that influence their conductivity when doped with N-DMBI-H. Finally, a double-blind experiment was conducted to validate the model’s practical utility by predicting the conductivity of four BDPPV-type polymers and one N2200-type polymer doped with N-DMBI-H. For the N2200-type polymer and two of the BDPPV-type polymers, the predicted conductivities agreed with experimental values within the same order of magnitude. These results demonstrate the fusion model’s reliability and establish a strong foundation for data-driven property prediction and the design of high-conductivity n-type polymers.},

  abstract     = {Nucleic acid mutation profiling is crucial for early screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer patients. However, detecting rare mutations at low variant allele frequencies (VAFs) in clinical samples is often hindered by interference of abundant wild-type (WT) backgrounds as well as incorrect signal readout. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Hybrid Ultrasensitive Nucleic acid Targeted Enrichment and Readout (HUNTER) platform for highly sensitive, accurate and multiplexed detection of low-frequence single nucleotide variants (SNVs). HUNTER leverages pyrophosphorolysis-activated polymerization (PAP) based selective variant amplification to enhance the abundance of rare mutations for improved detection sensitivity. The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) readout with single-nucleotide resolution further enables precise genotyping across multiple loci. Consequently, HUNTER can accurately detect SNVs as low as 3 copies, with a detection limit of 0.01% in a high-WT background. Additionally, HUNTER enables simultaneous detection of up to 10 target SNVs in a single pot. In clinical lung cancer samples, the HUNTER assay demonstrates 1.6- to 5-fold higher sensitivity compared to the conventional amplification refractory mutation system quantitative PCR (ARMS-qPCR), and maintains 100% specificity across diverse SNV types. With its high sensitivity, accuracy and multiplex capability, HUNTER is well-positioned to emerge as a groundbreaking tool for the detection of rare mutations in precision medicine.},

To address this limitation, we developed the ligand-induced self-complementing tag (LiSC-tag) as a novel epitope tag for live-cell super-resolution imaging and the functional manipulation of cellular proteins. The LiSC-tag utilizes a split FKBP mutant that self-complements upon the addition of small-molecule fluorescent probes. It integrates the compact size of epitope tags with the high brightness and photostability of small-molecule dyes, enabling multicolor nanoscopy imaging using STED, STORM, and SIM. The LiSC-tag exhibits improved brightness and photostability relative to split fluorescent proteins. It is compatible with endogenous protein imaging and can be engineered in tandem arrays to enhance fluorescence signals. Beyond imaging, the LiSC-tag also enables the manipulation of protein localization and targeted protein degradation.},

  abstract     = {Poor water stability of many metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is a persistent bottleneck toward their practical applications. Hemilabile STAMs (St. Andrews Materials) demonstrate greater water stability, as well as improved adsorption performance under humid conditions, compared to compositionally similar HKUST-1. Yet, the fundamental properties of STAMs remain largely unexplored. Herein, we leverage machine-learned potentials (MLPs) to simulate physical and hydrolytic properties, water stability and adsorption in STAMs functionalized with various hydrophobic/hydrophilic groups. Encouragingly, STAMs are predicted to exhibit high mechanical strength and low heat capacity, which are desirable attributes in adsorption processes. Moreover, defective STAMs are shown to possess greater mechanical robustness than defective HKUST-1. From MLP-based molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that Cu-paddlewheels of STAMs are relatively stable even at high water loadings. The hydrolysis mechanism of Cu-paddlewheels is examined meticulously, and for the first time, we quantitatively reveal a higher energy barrier is required to hydrolyze Cu–O bonds in STAMs than in HKUST-1, unambiguously elucidating the crucial role of Cu···OH 2 interactions in water stability of hemilabile STAMs. From MLP-based Monte Carlo simulations, water adsorption isotherms predicted in STAMs match well with experimental data. Importantly, it is concretely demonstrated that water adsorption in the hexagonal pore can be tailored by modifying the hydrophobicity of functional groups, while adsorption in the triangular pore is affected marginally. Beyond showing that STAMs are promising adsorbents, we provide new microscopic insights into physical and hydrolytic properties in Cu paddlewheel-based MOFs. More generally, our findings suggest that incorporating hemilability is a promising but underexplored strategy for the development of new water-stable MOFs.},

A substantial fraction of GSTP1 tethered interactions represent neo-PPIs that were enriched for splicing factors and nuclear proteins as determined by immunopurification mass spectrometry. LIPT colocalized GSTP1 with serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 1 (SRRM1), resulting in its redistribution from nuclear speckles to cytoplasmic foci. Cancer cells with enhanced sensitivity to LIPT showed downregulation of metabolic proteins that led to altered lipid metabolism and reduced cell proliferation from GSTP1 molecular glue treatment. Collectively, we show covalent molecular glues of GSTP1 can alter localization of disulfide tethered binding partners and disrupt metabolism in cancer cells.},

In this study, we successfully constructed chiral water superstructures templated by a chiral biomolecular assembly under ambient conditions and performed the first investigation of its ultrafast vibrational dynamics by utilizing femtosecond time-resolved chiral sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG-VS). Chiral biomolecular templates were prepared by assembling achiral amphiphilic molecules into chiral superstructures with C 1 point group symmetry at the lipid membrane surface. The formation of chiral water superstructure is dictated by the amide moieties of the chiral biomolecular assembly, particularly by the N−H group with the C 1 point group. The vibrational relaxation time of chiral water (0.8 ± 0.1 ps) is identical to that of the N−H group but significantly longer than that of both bulk water and typical interfacial achiral water (≤ 0.3 ps). This indicates that chiral water strongly couples with the N−H vibrational mode but decouples from nearby achiral interfacial water and bulk water. Chiral water exhibits distinctly different behavior from achiral water. Our findings highlight the significant role of chiral water in vibrational energy redistribution and propagation within biomolecules and contribute to understanding the mechanism of chirality generation and transfer.},

Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are used to elucidate RNA dynamics within RNP condensates. At high salt, where peptide-RNA association is weak, RNA structural changes are discerned at subsaturated conditions. At lower salt concentrations, where association is enhanced, positional order of only poly-A RNA is detected within phase separated RNP mixtures. This method is also applied to study trinucleotide CAG and CUG repeats, alone and in complex with peptides.

Though H 2 O 2 production via photocatalytic two-electron oxygen reduction (2e – -ORR) offers a sustainable alternative to the energy-intensive anthraquinone process, competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) severely limits both efficiency and selectivity. Here, we reveal that the strong electric fields on water microdroplet surfaces serve as powerful selectivity switches, directing photogenerated electrons exclusively toward H 2 O 2 synthesis while completely suppressing hydrogen evolution. This interfacial electric field control mechanism transforms ZnIn 2 S 4 -based photocatalysts─commonly dominated by HER─into H 2 O 2 producers with near-unity selectivity and production rates 2 orders of magnitude higher than bulk reactions. Through spatially resolved spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical calculations, we elucidate that the high electric fields on water microdroplets simultaneously enhance charge carrier separation, lower energy barriers for 2e – -ORR, and erect kinetic barriers against HER. Beyond providing an energy-efficient route to selective H 2 O 2 photosynthesis, this study offers valuable insights into selectivity control in other solar-to-chemical transformations without the need for catalyst modification or system engineering.},

  abstract     = {We report a novel electrocatalytic approach that couples water oxidation with toluene oxidation in wet DMF or DMSO electrolyte. Electrocatalytic oxidation of water, a sustainable oxygen atom source, favored hydroxyl ( ·̇ OH) radical formation over hydrogen peroxide and oxygen evolution because the organic solvent molecules suppressed O–O bond formation via hydrogen bonding. Water oxidation was catalyzed by laser-synthesized [NiFe]-(OH) 2 nanosheets supported on hydrophilic carbon fiber paper anodes, enhancing water oxidation activity and toluene oxygenation efficiency. Under optimized conditions in wet DMF electrolyte, toluene oxidation achieved 100% selectivity for benzyl alcohol at an unprecedented conversion yield of 87%. In wet DMSO electrolyte, 100% selectivity for benzyl alcohol was obtained, albeit with significantly lower conversion yield. Combined experimental and computational results reveal a new mechanistic pathway, based on electrocatalytic water oxidation to · OH radicals and protons. Protonation of DMF enabled the formation of H + -DMF– · OH radical complexes stabilized by hydrogen bonding among the radical, protonated and unprotonated DMF molecules, and water. This radical stabilization played a crucial role in promoting benzyl alcohol production. In contrast, DMSO consumed · OH radicals to form methanesulfinic acid, limiting benzyl alcohol generation. The wet organic solvent environment additionally prevented overoxidation beyond the alcohol by stabilizing radical intermediates through hydrogen bonding networks, effectively arresting the reaction after the first oxygenation. Likewise, benzyl alcohol oxidation yielded benzaldehyde, with no overoxidation to benzoic acid. Our findings establish fundamental design principles for selective hydrocarbon oxidations by leveraging solvent-mediated interactions, with broad implications for sustainable chemical synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Membrane proteins (MPs) challenge biophysical and structural biology methods. Native mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a powerful tool to study MP structures and their modulation by lipids. We examine the pathways by which three MPs, tetrameric Aquaporin Z (AqpZ), trimeric ammonium transporter (AmtB), and pentameric mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) decompose following collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) or electron capture dissociation (ECD) in native top-down MS. MPs subjected to CAD typically decompose along well-characterized pathways releasing highly charged monomers and low-charge state complementary subunits, but a lesser pathway accessed by low pressure collisions cleaves the backbone into fragments covering much of the sequence. Collisions also rearrange structures, e.g., AmtB subunits rearrange to form novel interactions and/or salt bridges that surprisingly retain a formerly surface-exposed segment despite ejecting the binding interface. MscL dissociation pathways depend on precursor charge-state, a behavior observed in a few soluble complexes, yet unaddressed mechanistically. Salt bridges in low charge state complexes stabilize subunits from ejection while facilitating only smaller, local rearrangements that release covalently cleaved products from transmembrane regions. With fewer opposite charges, on average, higher charge state molecules can rearrange intersubunit salt bridges on the experimental time scale to partition charge asymmetrically and free a subunit. ECD with supplemental activation can retain higher order structures of proteins and inform about the strongly interacting regions that preclude product ion release. With extensive regions lacking ionizable residues, MPs enable key interactions that guide the structure and dynamics of gas phase protein assemblies to be probed.},

  abstract     = {A major challenge in the field of mechanobiology relates to the lack of methods that enable the identification of mechanically active receptors, associated proteins, and the individual cells that display enhanced force generation. For example, potent T cell activation requires the transmission of biophysical forces between the T cell receptor (TCR) and its peptide-loaded major histocompatibility (pMHC) complex antigens. Interestingly, TCR-antigen interactions are highly dynamic, displaying a broad range of force magnitudes between different cells and even within the same cell. Therefore, methods that can chemically tag mechanically active T cells, TCRs, and their associated proteomes, or mechanomes are highly desirable. Such techniques may enable a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing immune responses and may also have broad applications in immunotherapy. Herein, we report a technique dubbed mechano-ID, which allows for mechanically selective proximity tagging by leveraging DNA-based molecular force probes that recruit proximity tagging enzymes. We demonstrate mechano-ID tagging of T cells using microscopy and flow cytometry, with further confirmation by proteomics and Western blotting of mechanically active T cell receptors.},

We report a nanocapsule with an inner cavity height (14.1 Å) capable of selectively encapsulating fullertubes with a diameter of 7 Å. Results show an increased affinity for encapsulation in proportion to increasing tubular length following a trend of [5,5]C 90 < [5,5]C 100 < [5,5]C 120 < [5,5]C 130 , as deduced from K a values, inferred from competition experiments and corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations.

  abstract     = {The development of efficient covalent organic framework (COF)-based photocatalysts has been hindered by topological constraints on photosensitizer incorporation and inefficient charge transfer resulting from electron localization across the linkages. To overcome these limitations, we report a hyperporphyrinization strategy in a novel COF (HP-COF), constructed by linking porphyrinic photosensitizers to bipyridine N-oxide moieties via imine bonds. The unprecedented hyperporphyrin effect in HP-COF originates from linker-to-linker charge transfer (LLCT) across the imine linkage, as demonstrated by comparison with an amide-linked analogue (NP-COF), where the nonconjugated linkage disrupts this delocalization pathway. Upon photoexcitation, the porphyrinic unit oxidizes the bipyridine N-oxide to generate a pyridine N-oxyl radical, which acts as a hydrogen atom transfer catalyst for C–H bond activation. In HP-COF, the LLCT process enhances photooxidative potential, electron delocalization, and charge transport, resulting in superior photocatalytic performance in metal-free C–H functionalization compared to both NP-COF and homogeneous analogues. HP-COF is readily recyclable and retains its photocatalytic activity over five consecutive cycles.},

  abstract     = {Histidine is among the most versatile amino acids by virtue of its imidazole ring, which is capable of shuttling protons and binding metals at each of its two nitrogen atoms, N π (N δ ) and N τ (N ε ). Despite having a tautomeric relationship and similar basicities, the nitrogen atoms used in copper enzymes are differentiated functionally, with near exclusive N τ -ligation associated with substrate activation sites and exclusive N π -ligation with electron-transfer sites. The results herein show that the innate thermodynamic preference is N τ -ligation to Cu(II) centers, a conclusion drawn from ligand competition experiments at −145 °C between histidine imidazoles within synthetic μ-η 2 :η 2 -peroxodicopper(II) cores. The findings from these faithful models of oxygenated binuclear copper sites in tyrosinase enzymes are informed by spectroscopic data from a series of related complexes with monodentate methylated imidazoles. This preference of histidine N τ -ligation is ascribed enthalpically to greater basicity and entropically to the greater molecular volume of the resulting metal complex compared to its N π -ligated isomer. These results support that the N τ -ligation observed in copper enzymatic sites is the innate thermodynamic form, independent of the protein matrix, while the N π -ligation observed in electron transfer sites is presumably entatic in origin─requiring evolved protein structural influences. This structural distinction provides a powerful indicator of function among the biological copper sites.},

This protocol is validated against experimental data for a range of molecules in acetonitrile, including protonated nitrogen bases, nitrophenols, anilines, and diamines, as well as cobalt electrocatalysts. For simple acids, the NEO approach offers only a slight improvement over conventional density functional theory with the standard harmonic vibrational treatment, whereas for hydrogen-bonded acids, the NEO approach offers more significantly improved performance at a comparable computational cost.
