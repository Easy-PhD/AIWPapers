Although it offers great potential for accessing functional polyolefins with novel properties, progress toward this goal has been limited. Here we report a catalytic alternating copolymerization protocol between ethylene and bicyclic cyclobutenes, affording cyclic olefin copolymers densely functionalized with bicyclic cyclobutane mechanophores. The spatial distribution of these bicyclic mechanophores along the polymer backbone plays a critical role in determining the copolymer’s properties, including strength, toughness, and crystallinity. Notably, transitioning from a random to an alternating copolymer structure leads to marked changes in both stress and strain responses. Meanwhile, near-alternating ethylene/bicyclic cyclobutene copolymers exhibit both high optical performance and desirable toughness. Furthermore, the alternating copolymer can be transformed into an unsaturated polymer via force-induced mechanophore cycloreversion upon bulk ball-milling, enabling upcycling into chemically recyclable polymers.},

To this end, Pt single-atom-decorated ZnO (Pt 1 /ZnO) is assembled as the proof-of-concept photocatalyst, in which Pt single atoms serve as both hole trapping and methane activation sites; the yielded • CH 3 with an enriched surface coverage then drives the radical chain process by first incorporating the environmentally benign molecular oxygen (or its derivative O 2 •– ), achieving a remarkable liquid product selectivity and formaldehyde yield of 95% and 2.98 mmol g –1 h –1 , respectively, with a record quantum efficiency of 14.14% at 350 nm.},

  abstract     = {To overcome iron starvation, microorganisms often produce siderophores─chelators with high affinity and selectivity for Fe(III). The recent discovery of the siderophore gramibactin garnered significant interest, as it added the C -diazeniumdiolate as a new Fe(III)-binding group in siderophores. Gramibactin is a mixed ligand siderophore, comprised of two graminine residues harboring the diazeniumdiolate donors and a β-hydroxy-aspartate donor. Diazeniumdiolate siderophores have so far evaded crystallographic characterization and few structures of synthetic diazeniumdiolate complexes are reported. To address the gap in structural information, the complexes K[M(III)-gramibactin] (M = Fe and Ga) were prepared, crystallized and their structures solved by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The four Fe–O bond lengths in the two diazeniumdiolates are quite similar, ranging from 1.978 Å to 2.059 Å, indicating an equal contribution in bonding. In contrast, the differing Fe–O bond lengths in β-hydroxy-aspartate reflect the relative donor strengths of the carboxylate (1.997 Å) and alkoxide (1.902 Å) groups. Gramibactin coordinates Fe(III) in a Δ-configured distorted octahedral geometry. The diamagnetic nature of Ga(III) is often leveraged in NMR studies to infer the solution structure of the corresponding Fe(III)-siderophores, which are assumed to be identical. The structural similarity of Ga(III)- and Fe(III)-gramibactin is striking and represents the first crystallographic verification of the assumed isostructural relationship between a Ga(III)- and an Fe(III)-siderophore. By providing concrete evidence, this study promotes Ga(III) as a reliable proxy for Fe(III) in siderophore complexes, with implications for solution structure determination of siderophores and design of Ga(III)-siderophore-based theranostics.},

This method overcomes limitations of previous N -substitution approaches by accommodating diverse alkyl sources, including alcohols, alkyl bromides, and carboxylic acids, under visible-light irradiation. The strategy features high functional group tolerance and offers efficient access to both primary and secondary N -alkyl sulfoximines. Its utility is showcased through the late-stage functionalization of pharmacologically active compounds, natural product derivatives, and short peptides, enabling rapid access to novel analogues with enhanced structural diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the strategic coupling of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl moieties with sulfoximines to achieve a synergistic bioisosteric design. A preliminary drug optimization campaign, exemplified by an atuveciclib analogue, highlights the platform’s potential for improving key ADME properties such as lipophilicity and cellular permeability, underscoring its value for lead diversification and refinement in medicinal chemistry.},

  abstract     = {For electrochemical CO 2 reduction (ECR), high-precision manipulation of the single-atomic catalytic centers is significant and remains an issue. Here, we report a support crystal phase engineering (SCPE) strategy by regulating the crystal phase of the ZrO 2 support to modulate its interaction with Cu atomic centers, synergizing the coordination environment of Cu atoms and the local microenvironment for ECR. Specifically, tetragonal ZrO 2 (tZrO 2 ) supports a Cu 1 O 3 structure, and the rich bridging O atoms at the tZrO 2 surface could serve as basic sites. In contrast, the monoclinic ZrO 2 (mZrO 2 ) forming a Cu 1 O 4 structure has weak basicity. The Cu 1 O 3 –tZrO 2 site displays a high activity for ECR to methane, with 3.16 (FE CH 4 ) and 2.54 ( j CH 4 ) times higher than those of the Cu 1 O 4 –mZrO 2 counterpart. Density functional theory (DFT) and attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR–SEIRAS) reveal that the dynamic *OH on Cu 1 O 3 –tZrO 2 helps to significantly lower the Gibbs free-energy change (Δ G ) for the rate-determining step (RDS). The rich basic sites on tZrO 2 could also facilitate the adsorption and activation of CO 2 and create an H 2 O-expelling local microenvironment to suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Our work demonstrates a facile strategy to simultaneously manipulate the coordination environment of the active centers and the local microenvironment for the catalytic reaction.},

In this work, we demonstrated zeolites as photoactive scaffolds for perovskite nanocrystals that triggered a hydroxyl radical ( • OH)-mediated reaction pathway for selective C(sp 3 )-H bond activation. The as-prepared Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 @ZSM-5 (CABB@ZSM-5) photocatalyst afforded efficient toluene oxidation to benzaldehyde at ambient conditions under visible light irradiation, with >98% selectivity and an exceptional reaction rate of 40.9 mmol g –1 h –1 , surpassing those of previously reported photocatalytic systems under comparable conditions. The host–guest design of CABB@ZSM-5 favored the adsorption of toluene and oxygen molecules and preactivated the adsorbed toluene molecules by Lewis acidic sites within ZSM-5 to reinforce the oxidation process. Significantly, we discovered that the adsorbed water in zeolite channels promoted the • OH-mediated oxidation reaction pathway, offering thermodynamic advantages over the conventional superoxide radical ( • O 2 – )-dominated reaction pathway. The incorporation of Zn 2+ into CABB@ZSM-5 further boosted benzaldehyde production by 2-fold. This work redefines the role of zeolites, transforming them from passive supports into multifunctional scaffolds with significant potential in advanced photochemical applications.},

  abstract     = {In reactive carbon capture (RCC) approaches, sorbents capture CO 2 from a dilute source as opposed to pure CO 2 and electrochemical conversion proceeds through the bound-CO 2 form, bypassing the energy losses and expense of sequential CO 2 capture, purification, and compression. N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have shown promise as capture agents, with reports of RCC conversion of CO 2 to CO or CH 4 via homogeneous electrocatalysis. However, RCC using NHCs is underexplored with heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Herein, the electroreduction of 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolium-2-carboxylate (IPrCO 2 ) was investigated as the CO 2 -adduct form of the corresponding imidazole carbene on Ag and other cathodes. In acetonitrile with dilute water, IPrCO 2 reduction led to formate product at up to 88% faradaic efficiency (FE). Carboxylation of the NHC with 13 CO 2 and subsequent electroreduction led to 13 C-labeled formate, supporting the interpretation of RCC conversion of the carboxylate. Compared to reduction of IPrCO 2 , reduction of the smaller -R group 1,3-dimethylimidazolium-2-carboxylate (IMeCO 2 ) led to much lower formate selectivity (∼8% FE), in part due to rapid degradation of the IMeCO 2 molecule. Ab initio calculations further supported favorable energetics of IPrCO 2 conversion compared to IMeCO 2 , while indicating that a mechanism through carboxylate adsorption is unfavorable and more likely to proceed through a surface hydride. In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) supported a weak surface adsorption of IPrCO 2 during the reaction. Despite relatively high selectivity conversion of IPrCO 2 to formate, CO 2 sorption and reduction cycling studies showed limited durability of the system due to decomposition of the IPrCO 2 , indicating a need for more reductively stable NHCs.},

This stability is often attributed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) or reduced water activity. However, by studying the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on platinum in NaClO 4 electrolytes (1–17 molal) using electrochemical measurements, MD simulations, and DFT calculations, we show that alternative mechanisms strongly influence the stability window. Specifically, we disentangle the effects from water activity, the local pH increase, and kinetic and transport limitations arising from disrupted hydrogen bonding and sluggish water transport. We observe a nearly linear relationship between the decrease in the surface water coverage and HER exchange current density. As a result, the HER kinetics is slower: with a 7 times decrease in the exchange current density and a 1.5 times increase in the Tafel slope in 17 m solution compared to 1 m. Our MD simulations further reveal that sluggish water transport within the double layer significantly limits the HER, extending the experimental stability window. Ultimately, in this non-SEI-forming electrolyte, reduced bulk water activity plays only a relatively minor role in enhancing the stability of water-in-salt systems.},

Here we address this problem by reporting an in vitro tau aggregation assay in which AD brain homogenates are used to seed the generation of first-generation tau fibrils in a polymorph-specific manner under quiescent conditions. These fibrils are then used to create amyloid seed libraries from which second-generation kinetic assays can be readily performed. Using this strategy, we illustrate an iterative machine learning method for the identification of small molecules for the polymorph-specific inhibition of the in vitro formation of tau fibrils. We further show that the small molecules selected by this procedure are potent inhibitors in a Drosophila tauopathy model.},

Herein, we demonstrate an engineered vacancy-rich nickel hydroxide catalyst (Ni(OH) 2 –V) that achieves exceptional performance in both C α –C β bond cleavage of β- O -4 lignin linkages and suppression of phenol overoxidation. Through integrated experimental and computational analyses, this study elucidates how the synergistic introduction of cations and oxygen dual-vacancy in Ni(OH) 2 –V contributes to its enhanced catalytic activity. Specifically, these dual-vacancies (1) significantly enhance the interfacial adsorption of hydroxide ions on the 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanol (2-PPE) substrate, (2) effectively lower the energy barrier of the rate-determining step (C α –OH → C α ═O), and (3) promote the timely desorption of phenol, thereby preventing overoxidation. The optimized catalyst achieved complete conversion of 2-PPE, yielding exceptional yields of 85.7% for phenol and 96.5% for benzoic acid at 1.40 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (V RHE ). These results represent 2.4-fold and 2.3-fold improvements over pristine Ni(OH) 2 . Furthermore, the practical utility of Ni(OH) 2 –V was validated through the depolymerization of poplar lignin and corn stover lignin, successfully yielding 14.24 and 19.54 wt % aromatic monomers. This research establishes a dual-vacancy engineering framework for precise lignin bond cleavage and offers crucial insights into the structure–activity relationship of vacancy-rich electrocatalysts for biomass valorization.},

  abstract     = {Photoinduced hot carriers generated from the decay of surface plasmons in noble metals play a decisive role in producing green hydrogen gas through the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting reaction, a process driven by visible light absorption. To optimize the utilization of these hot carriers, we employed a plasmonic antenna-reactor model based on core–shell structured Au@Pd nanoparticles (NPs) with an ultrathin Pd shell. In this study, we demonstrate that TiO 2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) decorated with Au@Pd NPs exhibit superior performance with the Pd shell serving as a catalytic reactor that efficiently extracts hot carriers from the plasmonic Au antenna. The photocatalytic performance in PEC measurements increased with higher Pd coverage, and Au 70 @Pd 30 /TNAs exhibited a 2.2-fold higher photocurrent compared with bare Au/TNAs. The enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity observed for Au 70 @Pd 30 /TNAs is attributed to the higher population of hot holes on the surface of Au@Pd NPs, which enhances the oxidation capability for interactions with electrolytes. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectra of Au@Pd NPs revealed a shorter lifetime of hot electrons through electron–phonon (e–p) scattering in Au 70 @Pd 30 NPs compared to Au NPs, indicating suppressed charge recombination and increased hot hole population on the surface. Therefore, this study suggests that the plasmonic antenna-reactor model, critically influenced by hot carrier dynamics, provides a promising framework for efficient photoelectrocatalytic systems.},

  abstract     = {Photoclick chemistry has emerged as a powerful methodology for achieving precise spatial and temporal control in photochemical transformations, enabling various applications ranging from surface functionalization, polymer conjugation, and photo-cross-linking to bioimaging and protein labeling. Despite significant advances, the absence of an unambiguous structure–property–mechanism relationship limits the design and application of photoclick systems in biological and material contexts. Herein, we report a novel strategy for tuning the reactivity and reaction mechanism of photoclick reactions of 9,10-phenanthrenequinone ( PQ ) with electron-rich alkenes ( ERA s) through the design of 2,2’-substituted PQ derivatives incorporating electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs). Our experimental studies reveal that the reaction rate via a direct pathway involving the direct coupling between PQ and ERA gradually declines, while that of the triplet–triplet energy transfer-mediated pathway increases with the stepwise change of substitutions from EWGs to EDGs. Theoretical calculations and transient absorption spectroscopy measurements show that these observations can be traced back to the excited-state energy-level inversion between 1 n π* and 1 ππ* states, which directly affects intersystem crossing yields. Furthermore, the reaction pathways can be modulated by changing the polarity of the solvent. These remarkable findings provide valuable mechanistic insights and establish a robust platform for the rational tuning of the reactivity and selectivity of PQ–ERA photoclick reactions using visible light while offering a unique strategy for the control of photochemical applications in complex environments.},

We monitored the relaxation dynamics of [ 1 M ], following their ultrafast excitation at 266 nm, with femtosecond-to-microsecond mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy in the antisymmetric N 3 -stretching region. Regardless of M, the metallonitrene, [M II (dppe)(N 3 )(N)] ([ 2 M ]), could be identified as the predominant photoproduct through the N 3 -stretching absorption of its remaining intact azido ligand. Accompanying quantum-chemical calculations demonstrate that the N α –N β bond cleavage required for metallonitrene formation is facilitated by an intriguing triplet azide-ππ* state, which is electronically preconfigured for the adiabatic release of a neutral N 2 fragment. This state extrapolates smoothly via a small barrier to the electronic ground state of [ 2 M ], which is the N-centered triplet diradical. No evidence was found for a closed-shell singlet nitrene intermediate, which was previously invoked in the photoinduced formation of organic nitrenes. The photochemical conversion yield was found to increase systematically in the order Ni > Pd > Pt, which was found to reflect an energetic reversal of the lowest metal-centered triplet d-d states and the productive, purely ligand-centered, azide-ππ* state. Our findings thus advocate a simple design guideline for efficient CH-amination catalysts: use strong-field ancillary ligands in combination with 4d- and 5d-transition metals to shift the lowest metal-centered state above the azide-ππ* state, thus eliminating detrimental deactivation pathways.},

These MIPs, characterized by their mechanical bonds and movable component parts, have been extensively utilized across various contemporary fields of chemistry, presenting opportunities for the design of functional materials with enhanced mechanical properties. However, the precision synthesis of MIPs, specifically PRs, with controlled molecular weights and narrow dispersity remains a significant challenge, hindering the progression of well-defined mechanically interlocked materials that exhibit a clear structure–property relationship. Herein, we disclose the controlled chain-growth synthesis of main-chain PRs through cascade metathesis polymerization by employing a catenane-based monomer. A series of PRs with targeted molecular weights, narrow dispersities, and tunable mechanical properties was successfully prepared by adjusting the monomer-to-catalyst feed ratio. The “livingness” of this polymerization was validated through kinetic studies, and the detailed structural characteristics of the synthesized PRs were supported by 1 H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Both block and statistical copolymers were produced in a controlled manner through the copolymerization of the catenane-based monomer with other monomers that can undergo ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), allowing for easy access to PRs featuring different architectures and, most importantly, tunable ring densities. This work significantly advances beyond the majority of previously reported studies concerning the controlled synthesis of PRs, paving the way for the rational design and synthesis of mechanically interlocked materials with desired functionalities.},

  abstract     = {Mass transfer limitations pose considerable challenges in electrochemical synthesis, particularly in high-viscosity environments that are inherent to electrochemically mediated polymerizations. In such scenarios, inadequate transport of redox-active species to and from the electrode surface results in electrode fouling and premature termination of the polymerization. Herein, we have thoroughly investigated electrochemically mediated atom transfer radical polymerization ( e ATRP) as a model platform to address the challenges arising from mass transfer limitations associated with electrochemical polymerizations by employing rapid alternating polarity (rAP). In detail, we propose a straightforward strategy for e ATRP employing readily available graphite electrodes within an undivided cell, and we implement a single constant alternating current on a millisecond time scale throughout the entire polymerization process. This method effectively prevents over-reduction of copper catalysts and electrode fouling, thereby facilitating the polymerizations of methyl acrylate with near-quantitative monomer conversions and exceptionally narrow dispersities ( Đ < 1.1). Polymerization kinetics can be further regulated by tuning the applied current ( I app ) and pulse duration. Most importantly, our approach allows e ATRP to be performed with significantly reduced copper catalyst loading (2.5 ppm), while maintaining excellent control over polymerization, resulting in an ultrahigh molecular weight PMA ( M n = 1,598,000, Đ = 1.26). The monomer scope is extended to include methyl methacrylate and styrene. The high “livingness” and chain-end fidelity, as confirmed by the mass spectrometric analysis, enable the one-pot synthesis of a block copolymer PMMA- b -PMA and star-shaped polymer 4- star -PMA. This work could underpin future research on rAP in various controlled electrochemical polymerizations.},

  abstract     = {Type I photosensitizers (PSs), due to reduced dependence on O 2 , have outstanding prospects for cancer treatment. However, it is difficult to manipulate electron transfer of molecules during excited state transitions (T 1 –S 0 ), which makes it a challenging task to systematically create type I PSs, especially with a deficiency of an instructive molecular construction strategy. Herein, for the first time, we proposed the “electron reservoir-pump-integrated” molecular design strategy, that is, “electron reservoir” and “electron pump” were dexterously fused in one appropriate dye, which greatly facilitated the creation of type I PS molecules through the manipulation of spatial electron flow (verified by the density functional theory and spectral experiments). On this basis, we constructed a series of organic small-molecule type I PSs; especially, the prominent type I PS Cy5-NF could specifically produce a large amount of O 2 •– under 660 nm laser irradiation. Notably, without the sulfonic acid groups (electron reservoir) or the electron-withdrawing group (electron pump), both derivatives of Cy5-NF are unable to generate O 2 •– , which fully validated the above strategy. More encouragingly, Cy5-NF could effectively destroy cytomembranes under irradiation and further lead to pyroptosis of tumor cells, which not only ablated the primary/distant tumors but also halted tumor metastasis to the different organs via enhancing CD4 + and CD8 + T cell infiltration-mediated long-term immunological memory. Notably, the “electron reservoir-pump-integrated” strategy represents a kind of modular approach for constructing organic small-molecule type I PSs, potentially offering valuable guidance for future type I PS development.},

Here, we describe a three-step synthesis and MO characterization of a fused octapyrrolyl cyclooctatetraene ( FOPCOT ) which exhibits a record high Verdet constant of a small molecule in the NIR-II region. Notably, the cyclooctatetraene core is constructed in a three-step one-pot reaction whereby a N , N ′-dipyrrolyl acetylene is generated and immediately reacted with Rosenthal’s complex to produce the corresponding zirconacycle intermediate in situ. The cascade is completed with a copper-mediated transmetalation that reductively eliminates to yield the octapyrrolyl cyclooctatetraene. This transformation offers a distinct alternative to conventional methods for pyrrole incorporation into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

  abstract     = {The crystal structures of intermetallic phases encompass a fundamental mystery about the chemistry of metals: what drives atoms that prefer simple sphere packings as pure elements to adopt complex structures, sometimes with unit cells containing thousands of atoms? We recently developed the interface nucleus concept to interpret their most complicated arrangements in terms of chemical pressure (CP)-driven assemblies of modules of simple parent structures. The predictions of this approach earlier led us to the Pr–Mg–Zn system and the discovery of the modular structure of PrMg 4 Zn 10 built from MgZn 2 - and EuMg 5 -type units. Herein, we present the structure of a second intergrowth compound in this system that exhibits far greater complexity: PrMg 1.6 Zn 5.4 , whose 34.50 Å cubic unit cell contains 2,240 atoms. Its structure can be simply decoded in terms of a 5 × 5 × 5 supercell of the Heusler structure (or alternatively a 10 × 10 × 10 supercell of the body-centered cubic (BCC), structure) embedded with Laves phase fragments. The nearly seamless transition between the Heusler and Laves domains observed here reflects a simple relationship between these structures, in which they can be interconverted by the exchange of a tetrahedron of atoms for a single larger atom (MgCu 2 type to BCC), or vice versa (BCC to MgCu 2 type). Driving forces underlying PrMg 1.6 Zn 5.4 ’s structure are inferred from the CP analysis of the parent structures, which highlight the overcompression of the Pr atoms in a model Heusler phase and the opportunities for relief by expanded environments available at the boundaries between the Laves and Heusler domains in PrMg 1.6 Zn 5.4 .},

  abstract     = {Understanding superconductivity requires a deep comprehension of the chemical structure. The discovery of a new unconventional superconductor UTe 2 a few years ago prompted many detailed investigations of its physical properties. Despite its unconventional ground state being rather well-studied, a strong sample-to-sample variation of superconducting behavior as a result of different preparation conditions has remained largely unexplained until now. In this work, an in-depth analysis of the UTe 2 crystal structure and resultant physical properties by implementing several types of synthetic routes was carried out. The difference between superconducting and non-superconducting UTe 2 lies in the presence of uranium vacancies, on the order of 4%. As a result, the b and c lattice parameters vary, yielding a volume difference of about 0.51%. A subtler difference between samples exhibiting one and two superconducting transitions is driven by local deviations from the translational symmetry in the main atomic arrangement. Several well-pronounced maxima have been observed in the difference density map, predominantly located in the bc plane due to a local appearance of the similar atomic arrangements in different orientations. The extreme sensitivity of UTe 2 to such a small number of defects re-emphasizes the unconventional nature of superconductivity in this compound. Furthermore, this work underscores the importance of a thorough, combined chemical and physical analysis of intriguing strongly correlated materials─in particular for compounds that are known to exhibit nontrivial ground states and exotic accompanying phenomena.},

Layered van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors offer a unique platform, providing new degrees of freedom at the two-dimensional (2D) limit through exfoliation and external controls. Here, we demonstrate tunability of symmetry and electronic structure via halogen substitution in a family of layered vdW tungsten oxyhalides. Substituting the halogens in WO 2 X 2 (X = I, Br, Cl) tunes the bandgap across a broad energy range and modifies the structural symmetry from centrosymmetric to noncentrosymmetric. By alloying WO 2 I 2– y Br y , we continuously tune the polar distortion and optical gap across the visible range. These insights into halogen substitution effects on symmetry and electronic structure lay the foundation for new tunable vdW semiconductors for optoelectronics and nonlinear optics.},

Understanding how this property emerges is crucial to the design of efficient catalysts. Here, for a two-electron reaction, we compare the voltammetric responses of the catalysts for two distinct general mechanisms: the unimolecular pathway includes two successive electron transfers with the electrode and pseudo-first-order chemical steps and was described before (Fourmond et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 141, 11269 (2019)); the bimolecular mechanism includes a single interfacial electron transfer and one intermolecular electron transfer in solution. The general theory of the latter is derived here. The predictions of the kinetic models are compared to data available in the literature, and diagnosis criteria are discussed with emphasis on the shapes of the sigmoidal steady-state catalytic voltammograms. We describe the kinetic and thermodynamic requirements for redox molecular catalysts to work reversibly.},

  abstract     = {Photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) employs light to precisely control the activity of prodrugs, enabling spatial and temporal regulation of therapeutic effects while minimizing systemic toxicity. Transition-metal complexes, particularly Ru(II) polypyridyl compounds, have emerged as promising PACT agents due to their ability to undergo photodissociation via triplet excited states. However, rationalizing and predicting photosubstitution quantum yields remain challenging due to complex excited-state dynamics, solvent effects, and limitations of traditional modeling approaches. In this study, we synthesized nine Ru(II) complexes incorporating a monodentate thioether ligand, a terpyridine ligand, and various bidentate polypyridyl ligands. Upon red-light irradiation in aqueous solution, these complexes showed selective photosubstitution of the thioether by an aqua ligand. Despite similar absorption properties, these compounds exhibited markedly different photosubstitution quantum yields that static DFT calculations failed to explain. These modeling difficulties prompted us to develop a novel triplet-state molecular dynamics protocol using the GFN-xTB method, explicit solvation, and enhanced sampling techniques. Our approach enabled full simulations of the ligand exchange process on the triplet hypersurface and comparison to experimental data. It revealed that both cis and trans substitution of the thioether by a water molecule is possible; it was also able to distinguish between photoactive and photoinactive compounds. Unexpectedly, we found that the deviation from planarity of the bidentate ligand, rather than the energy levels of the different triplet excited states ( 3 MLCT, 3 MC) involved in the photosubstitution reaction, was the primary determinant of photosubstitution efficiency, as it promoted access to the trans photosubstitution pathway. Furthermore, our simulations uniquely identified whether dissociative, interchange, or associative mechanisms governed the reactivity of each complex. These results provide for the first time mechanistic insights into Ru(II)-based photosubstitution reactions in a solvent and offer a practical, scalable computational tool for designing next-generation PACT agents with optimized light-responsive properties.},

Nevertheless, the catalytic asymmetric version of such transformations with quinolines remains a challenging task because of regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselective control. Especially the presence of substituents with divergent electronic effects on the aromatic ring presents a regioselectivity control dilemma. Herein, we report highly regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselective dearomative [2 + 2] photocycloadditions of quinolines with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) by utilizing a chiral Lewis acid-mediated strain-release approach. The regioselectivity and stereocontrol challenges were addressed by strategically designing catalysts with tailored steric bulk that modulated the chiral pocket in response to the electronic and steric characteristics of diverse substrate substituents. This strategy was compatible with isoquinoline, indole derivatives, naphthalene, and benzo[ b ]thiophene, providing highly decorated chiral heterocycle-fused bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) in moderate to good yields with high regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivities (52 examples, up to 99% yield, >19:1 rr, >19:1 dr, 99% ee).

  abstract     = {Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed from appropriate building units can exhibit both porosity and long-range magnetic order, enabling the modulation of magnetic states via mass transport. In most guest-responsive MOF magnets, the guest inclusions perturb the framework electronically or structurally and trigger abrupt phase transitions. In contrast, spin-active guests can directly mediate exchange pathways, enabling the continuous and controllable evolution of the magnetic order; however, the kinetic pathways of guest adsorption and spin mediation remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that the entrapment of O 2 dimers in bottlenecked isolated pores between ferrimagnetic layers triggered a gradual evolution from ferromagnetism to antiferromagnetism in an isostructurally layered MOF. Systematic O 2 sorption studies revealed a time-resolved shift in the Néel temperature ( T N ) from 17 to 28 K, correlating with the extent of O 2 loading and indicating a cooperative growth of antiferromagnetic (AFM) domains. In contrast, the insertion of diamagnetic CO 2 dimers preserved the original ferromagnetic (FM) ground state. Density functional theory calculations showed that the antiferromagnetically coupled O 2 dimer acted as an efficient superexchange bridge between adjacent ferrimagnetic layers, stabilizing the AFM ground state. These findings provide direct evidence of the guest-induced, spin-mediated evolution of the magnetic phase in porous magnets and establish the entrapment of molecular oxygen as a versatile strategy for finely tuning the magnetic order in MOF magnets.},

However, their operational stability remains a critical challenge. In this study, we unravel the distinct degradation mechanisms and active-site behaviors of FeNC catalysts under acidic and alkaline ORR conditions. Intriguingly, catalysts subjected to electrochemical cycling in acidic media but tested in alkaline conditions exhibit nearly preserved ORR activity, revealing that degradation pathways differ fundamentally between the two environments. With the help of density functional theory calculations, we identify Fe-centered sites as the primary active centers in acidic media, whereas under alkaline conditions─where hydroxyl adsorption passivates Fe sites─neighboring carbon atoms adjacent to nitrogen become the dominant active sites. The Mössbauer spectroscopy results show that under acidic cycling, pyrrolic nitrogen-coordinated Fe (S1) sites suffer a significant loss while the pyridinic nitrogen-coordinated Fe (S2) sites retain high stability. In contrast, during alkaline cycling, Fe site losses are minimal, while the carbon support undergoes more severe corrosion. By selectively engineering the Fe sites and carbon support, we experimentally validated the conclusions on the active sites. This work provides critical insights into the site-dependent durability of FeNC catalysts and underscores the necessity of tailored catalyst design for stable and efficient ORR across diverse operating conditions.},

The Lpt system generates membrane asymmetry by transporting LPS from the inner to the outer membrane. Transport begins with the LptB 2 FGC complex, where the ABC transporter LptB 2 FG associates with LptC to extract LPS. LPS is then passed via LptA to the LptDE translocon. While LptB 2 FGC structures suggest an extrusion mechanism, the role of LptC remains unclear. Here, we reconstituted the complex in vitro from purified LptB 2 FG and LptC, and demonstrate that LptC stabilizes the complex and modulates ATPase activity. Using differential isotope labeling and solid-state NMR including dynamic nuclear polarization, we observed that the LptC transmembrane helix LptC TMH is tightly associated with the transporter in the apo state. Upon LPS or ATP binding, LptC TMH becomes more flexible and samples a distinct conformational space which favors cavity collapse and substrate-coupled ATPase activity. Our data support a model in which LptC acts as a mechanical transducer linking transport and energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Achieving selective electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) in strong acid holds potential to resolve the “carbonate formation” problem yet is hindered by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The interplay between different hydrogen sources (i.e., H + vs H 2 O) and its impact on CO 2 RR selectivity in acidic electrolytes remains poorly understood. Herein, we introduce an immobilized N-containing azole layer (phTA) onto Bi catalysts to dynamically regulate the interfacial hydrogen source in strong acid (pH 0.4). Combining experimental and modeling approaches, we reveal a dual mechanism dependent on local interfacial conditions. At lower potentials with high local [H + ], the protonated phTA layer (NH + sites) serves as a proton relay while electrostatically shielding bulk H + diffusion. Conversely, at higher potentials with low local [H + ], less protonated phTA disrupts the interfacial hydrogen-bond network, impeding Grotthuss-type proton transport, thus suppressing HER through hydrogen source shifts toward H 2 O. As a result, the faradaic efficiency for formic acid (FE HCOOH ) on Bi-phTA significantly increases to 36% at −300 mA cm –2 (pH 0.4) compared to <10% for bare Bi. This work demonstrates the controlled manipulation of the hydrogen source via a dynamically responsive organic layer, highlighting the importance of managing interfacial hydrogen species for enhancing the CO 2 RR in acid.},

  abstract     = {We previously reported that peptides can drive diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into complex, fractal assemblies, but the mechanism behind this behavior remained unclear. In this study, we dissect how surface ligand chemistry governs this process: not merely by mediating interparticle interactions but by enabling structural transformation of the nanoparticle cores themselves. Using a panel of nine ligands spanning phosphine, thiolate, and polyphenol classes, we systematically examine how ligand identity dictates aggregation dynamics, redox behavior, and structural outcomes. Our findings reveal that aromatic phosphine ligands, especially bis( p -sulfonatophenyl)phenylphosphine (BSPP), uniquely promote DLA by facilitating partial ligand desorption and silver surface oxidation, which together enable nanoparticle coalescence and recrystallization into micron-scale fractal architectures. In contrast, thiol- and polyphenol-based ligands either bind too strongly to permit coalescence or lack the electronic features necessary to support oxidation-driven restructuring. We support this mechanism with multiple lines of evidence: zeta potential data demonstrate charge neutralization, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the presence of oxidized silver species in BSPP-AgNP fractals, and enhanced light scattering suggests increased surface heterogeneity. Electron microscopy and elemental analyses validate the resulting architecture and ligand distribution. These findings establish a mechanistic framework for chemically directed DLA and introduce a tunable strategy for building structurally fused, hierarchical nanomaterials for biosensing, catalysis, and soft matter engineering.},

This method features highly efficient, atom-economical construction of chiral allylic amines with excellent regio- and enantioselectivities under mild conditions, and exhibits broad functional group tolerance.},

  abstract     = {Macrocyclic hosts are pivotal in supramolecular chemistry, yet the discovery of synthetically scalable platforms that combine rich host–guest behavior, facile crystallizability, and solid-state functionality remains a challenge. Here, we present the synthesis of a new cyclic BODIPY array, trimer 1 , composed of three BODIPY units linked by m -phenylene spacers. Two dynamic conformers of 1 , namely, cone-shaped c - 1 and partial-cone-shaped pc - 1 , exist in solution and have been characterized by their X-ray crystal structures. These two conformers undergo interconversion in response to changes in external environments, including solvents and guests. Conformer c - 1 is capable of hosting neutral guests bearing electron-deficient methyl groups in solution, driven by collective C–H···F interactions, while cationic guests with ammonium groups are preferentially hosted by conformer pc - 1 . Crystallization conditions were optimized, enabling the preparation of gram-scale crystals of c - 1 with different packing arrangements, designated as c - 1a and c - 1b . Activation of these two samples led to transformations from single-crystal to single-crystal or to amorphous, yielding crystalline c - 1a′ and amorphous c - 1b′ , respectively. Importantly, crystalline c - 1a′ exhibits excellent adsorption capacity and separation selectivity for hydrogen isotopes, benefiting from its permanent ultramicroporosity. In contrast, amorphous c - 1b′ is an effective adsorbent for molecular iodine, with binding interactions fully elucidated through X-ray crystallographic analysis. This work establishes cyclic BODIPY arrays as a highly tunable platform for creating adaptive molecular solids with applications in separation science, moving beyond their inherent optical properties.},

  abstract     = {Reprocessing thermoset polyurethane (PU) using carbamate exchange reactions is a novel approach to recycling PU foam waste. Previous works on PU reprocessing have required carbamate exchange catalysts to be added during the recycling process. However, adding new exchange catalysts increases processing costs, raises concerns about health or environmental damage from catalyst leaching, and would require the reformulation of established commercial products. However, PU foams contain residual synthesis catalysts that might also catalyze carbamate exchange such that existing commercial products might be reprocessable without further modification. We selected 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), the most widely used PU gelling catalyst, as a representative tertiary amine catalyst and evaluated its catalytic activity using model compound studies. Crossover experiments showed that the dominant mechanism of carbamate exchange varies, depending on the concentration of the free alcohols in the system: DABCO catalyzes both dissociative and associative carbamate exchange, but excess alcohol groups inhibit catalysis of DABCO. The catalytic activity of DABCO in the reprocessing environment was examined through crossover between linear polymers in a twin-screw extruder. Microcompounding accelerated bond exchange compared to the small molecule study due to the high shear force. Model thermoset PU films synthesized with DABCO displayed faster stress relaxation compared to a catalyst-free film. Three commercial thermosetting PU foams were successfully reprocessed into PU films at elevated temperatures using the remaining DABCO or other tertiary amine catalysts incorporated in the PU foams during synthesis. The resulting films maintained the glass transition temperature of the original foam, and the tensile properties of PU films resemble those of the feedstock PU foams (rigid or soft). Appliance PU foams were reprocessed while adding glass fibers to produce composites with a tunable elastic modulus. This study shows the promise of recycling thermosetting PU waste using residual catalysts in PU products without altering their commercial formulations.},

  abstract     = {Radiotheranostics holds transformative potential for precision oncology by integrating diagnostic imaging with targeted radionuclide therapy. However, advancements in this field are significantly hindered by the limited availability of high-affinity ligands that are capable of engaging challenging cell-surface antigens, particularly flat, low-druggability targets such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Here, we overcome this barrier through de novo discovery and rational engineering of a disulfide-directed multicyclic peptide (DDMP), dmp10, which achieves a picomolar affinity for PD-L1 by leveraging conformationally constrained structural scaffolds. By combining disulfide-directed library design with iterative directed evolution, we successfully generated dmp10, a ∼3 kDa multicyclic peptide that establishes unprecedented shape complementarity to the expansive binding interface of PD-L1. Preclinical evaluations demonstrated that 68 Ga-labeled dmp10 enables high-contrast PET imaging of PD-L1 + tumors in murine models, achieving a tumor uptake of 13.27 %ID/g at 4 h post-injection. The therapeutic counterpart, 177 Lu-labeled dmp10, effectively eradicated 92.47% of established tumors in tumor models while sparing healthy tissues, thereby validating its dual radiotheranostic utility. The translational relevance of our findings was further confirmed in a first-in-human pilot study, where 68 Ga-labeled dmp10 was well tolerated and allowed visualization of PD-L1 + lesions in patients with solid tumors. This work not only establishes DDMPs as a versatile platform for targeting geometrically complex antigens but also delivers a promising radiotheranostic agent that bridges molecular imaging and precision radionuclide therapy for PD-L1-driven malignancies. Our findings advance current strategies for designing ultrahigh-affinity peptide binders and underscore the untapped potential of multicyclic architectures in overcoming longstanding challenges in cancer theranostics.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid glasses made from hybrid metal halides (HMHs) have shown intriguing properties such as environmental durability, optical transparency, and excellent processability, which have fueled an ever-expanding set of applications. However, due to the melt instability, HMH glasses, particularly with one-dimensional or two-dimensional structures, are still rare. Herein, we report the uncommon one-dimensional chain structure comprising corner-sharing lead-bromide trimers in (4-EAMP) 2 Pb 3 Br 10 (4-EAMP = 4-(ethylaminomethyl)pyridine), whose polymer-like flexible chains enable soft, elastic, and meltable characteristics. By systematically scrutinizing HMHs constructed from face-, edge-, and corner-sharing chains, we find that the chain configurations substantially define the mechanical and thermal properties when organic ligands possess relatively analogous structures. The corner-sharing structure of (4-EAMP) 2 Pb 3 Br 10 crystals offers conformational freedom for melting, which allows stable melt over a wide temperature range of 70 K. The amorphization of (4-EAMP) 2 Pb 3 Br 10 does not significantly reduce the coordination degree of the inorganic framework and has realized high-performance X-ray detection and imaging functions with an elevated sensitivity of 8581.7 μC Gy air –1 cm –2 . Our results present a material platform toward understanding the origin and structural manifestation of melting and vitrification in hybrid organic–inorganic solids.},

  abstract     = {Transthyretin (TTR) is a 56 kDa tetrameric protein complex that plays a key role in transporting thyroxine and retinol. Despite its important biological role, TTR exhibits adverse effects, including disassembly into monomers, dimers, and trimers that then aggregate into disease-causing oligomers and fibrils. Hydration (referring to H 2 O or D 2 O) has been shown to have strong effects on TTR tetramer stabilities; however, probing how perturbation of hydration alters tetramer dynamics and stabilities is challenging. Here, we use variable-temperature (5–50 °C) electrospray ionization and ion mobility-mass spectrometry to better understand the influence of D 2 O and H 2 O hydration on the structures, stabilities, and dynamics of both wild-type TTR and several mutants (TTR L55P , TTR V30M , TTR T119M , and TTR V122I ). Our findings include the following: (i) TTR tetramers in D 2 O have lower average charge states compared to those in H 2 O at temperatures between 5 and 50 °C; (ii) there are fewer disassembly products (monomers and dimers) in D 2 O compared to H 2 O at different temperatures; and (iii) the relative abundances of compact versus extended tetrameric forms are shifted in D 2 O compared to H 2 O. Results from hydrogen–deuterium exchange (HDX) combined with bottom-up proteomics of different TTR mutants are consistent with hydration in β-sheet and interface-forming regions providing tetramer stability. Additionally, HDX combined with bottom-up proteomics indicates that shifts in hydration at the interface are responsible for the observed differences between mutants. Overall, our results show that D 2 O significantly alters the TTR stabilities and conformational entropy, highlighting the important role that hydration plays in protein dynamics.},

Guided by this principle, we designed a flexible porous crystal, NTU-99-NO 2 , incorporating electronegative nitro group receptors into a dynamic framework. This material exhibits unprecedented inverse selectivity: a 2-fold higher uptake of C 3 H 8 over C 3 H 6 at 298 K, 1 bar.

For example, carbene insertion chemistry forms versatile products but relies on two-step protocols that first introduce a photoreactive group and then generate a reactive intermediate via UV light irradiation. Alternatively, direct cross-linking with bifunctional electrophilic reagents enables modification of natural amino acids in a single transformation but proceeds via intermediates with a sufficiently long half-life in solution to capture unfavorable protein conformations. Herein, we report the use of commercially available vinyl thianthrenium tetrafluoroborate ( VTT ) for a single-step cross-linking strategy based on the umpolung of native cysteinyl thiols to electrophilic episulfonium ions in cells. We demonstrate that the umpolung reaction proceeds within minutes in various cell types. Even when competing with cysteine-reactive maleimide or iodoacetamide reagents, the fast cellular uptake of VTT enables efficient intracellular labeling and ensures the formation of products with a short and stable ethylene linker between cysteine and nucleophilic natural amino acids. We anticipate that the fast generation of episulfonium ions, which enable cross-linking without exogenous activation, will assist researchers in predicting protein structures based on quantitative proteome-wide information generated in cellulo .},

We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) calculations to comprehend the origins of the counterintuitive kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), which are exhibited by these two enzyme families. Thus, P450s exhibit low KIE values, which indicate the absence of quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) contributions, whereas TauD exhibits high KIEs, which apparently include QMT. Furthermore, the calculations show that the P450 protein-folds compensate for the lack of QMT, by reactivity enhancement due to the favorable interactions of the substrate(s) with the corresponding local electric field (LEF) of these enzymes. By contrast, TauD exhibits higher hydrogen abstraction barriers as well as a significant QMT. Thus, the relative reactivities of the two enzyme-types, toward a given substrate, are determined by the larger LEF in P450s vis-à-vis the higher QMT in TauD. The present manuscript provides a comprehensive understanding of the root-causes of the LEF effects of the protein-folds vs the QMT factors, in modulating hydrogen-atom abstraction reactivity, in two distinct mechanistic strategies, for the functionally analogous P450 and TauD enzymes.},

Dysprosium bis(amide) cations, [Dy(NR 2 )] + (R = bulky silyl, aryl), can potentially show superior SMM properties as more charge-dense N-donor atoms can enforce stronger axial CFs to increase U eff , but these more flexible ligands can also promote under-barrier magnetic relaxation processes that diminish T H . Here, we combine the favorable SMM properties of each ligand in a single complex, [Dy{N(Si i Pr 3 ) 2 }(Cp*)][Al{OC(CF 3 ) 3 } 4 ] ( 1-Dy ; Cp* = C 5 Me 5 ). We find that 1-Dy has large magnetic anisotropy, with U eff = 2191(33) K; this is comparable with the best-performing dysprosium Cp R -based SMMs, but lower than the dysprosium bis(amide)-alkene complex [Dy{N(Si i Pr 3 )[Si( i Pr) 2 C(CH 3 )=CHCH 3 ]}{N(Si i Pr 3 )(Si i Pr 2 Et)}][Al{OC(CF 3 ) 3 } 4 ] ( U eff = 2652(16) K). A combination of the bent N–Dy–Cp* cent angle ( ca . 152.5(2)°) and flexible amide substituents of 1-Dy limits T H to 73 K, which is below the record T H value of 100 K for the bis(amide)-alkene. Together, this work shows that dysprosium SMMs containing one π-aromatic and one monodentate ligand can have comparable U eff values to bis-π-aromatic complexes, but in common with dysprosium bis(amide) complexes, they show a greater sensitivity of interligand angle toward under-barrier relaxation processes. This new class of dysprosium complexes are promising candidates for high-temperature SMMs, and it is likely that large improvements on this first example can be made with exquisite control of molecular geometry.},

  abstract     = {Rechargeable zinc-based batteries are promising candidates for electrochemical energy storage, but their deliverable capacity, rate capability, and cycle performance are limited by conventional aqueous electrolytes at low temperatures. Here, we report an aqueous electrolyte formulation by increasing the chloride salt diversity to maximize both mixing and excess entropies. In a ternary-chloride-salt electrolyte, we reveal that the increased mixing entropy can tune the coordination environments, which disrupts the hydrogen-bonding network and reduces the aggregation of [ ZnCl m ] n 2 n ‐ m n clusters to increase tetrahedral entropies and total pair-correlation excess entropies. The high-entropy electrolyte exhibits a lower freezing temperature, higher ionic conductivity, and diverse and small solvated clusters at low temperatures. Furthermore, the entropy-mediated solvation structures desolvate and access the Zn anode in a parallel process with a high Zn 2+ flux for uniform plating and stripping, which breaks through the traditional sequential isolated desolvation/deposition pathway of large aggregated clusters that induce dendritic anode morphology. The formulated electrolyte endows Zn||Zn cells with stable cycling over 13320 h at 1 mA cm –2 with 99.97% average Coulombic efficiency for Zn plating/stripping and matches cathodes of tetrachlorobenzoquinone, VOPO 4 · x H 2 O or Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 to enable full cells working at −60 °C.},

  abstract     = {Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a promising and selective strategy for treating aggressive and refractory tumors, but its clinical success depends on the development of effective boron delivery agents. These agents must offer high tumor selectivity, structural stability, and sufficient boron content─criteria that current clinical options fail to fully satisfy. Herein, we report a visible-light-driven decarboxylative B–C cross-coupling between boron-functionalized carborane carboxylic acids and dehydroalanine (Dha)-containing peptides, enabling the first synthesis of boron-vertex-substituted carboranyl peptides under mild conditions. This photocatalyzed site-selective Giese involves the reaction of photogenerated boron vertex-centered carboranyl radicals to Dha residues, affording carborane-peptide conjugates in good to high yields and with excellent functional group tolerance. Enantiopure boron-vertex-substituted carboranylalanines were successfully synthesized using chiral Karady–Beckwith Dha derivatives, enabling their incorporation into well-defined complex peptides (comprising 5 and 15 residues) via solid-phase peptide synthesis. The synthetic utility of this platform was further demonstrated through a DNA-compatible click reaction, which enabled the attachment of carborane-bearing motifs to DNA tags. Moreover, B–C coupled carboranylalanines were conjugated to biologically relevant molecules such as nucleic acid aptamers to enhance tumor-targeting properties. Preliminary cellular studies confirmed that aptamer–carborane–amino acid conjugates exhibit efficient tumor cell recognition and uptake. Collectively, this work establishes a versatile and late-stage strategy for the site-selective installation of carborane units onto biomolecules via B–C bond formation, significantly expanding the chemical space of boron-rich peptide architectures and advancing the development of next-generation BNCT agents.},

Copper-based systems dominate C(sp 3 )–N cross-coupling, likely owing to their strong propensity for reductive elimination, whereas other first-row transition metal catalysts have been reported only in rare cases. However, the intrinsically lower reducing capability of copper catalysts greatly limits their application to unactivated alkyl halides─particularly alkyl chlorides─in C(sp 3 )–N cross-coupling reactions. Here, we demonstrate a general copper-catalyzed C(sp 3 )–C/N cross-coupling of unactivated alkyl halides with diverse nucleophiles under mild thermal conditions. The success of this reaction relies on the use of anionic N,N,N -ligands to enhance the reducing capability of Cu(I) catalysts for the reduction of alkyl halides. This protocol accommodates a wide range of coupling partners, including primary to tertiary alkyl bromides and bench-stable chlorides, as well as primary and secondary alkyl iodides, and an array of nucleophiles (such as (hetero)aromatic amines, indoles, carbazoles, amides, azoles, and alkynes) with good functional-group compatibility. Furthermore, the present system provides a highly versatile platform for the late-stage functionalization of complex molecules.},

  abstract     = {A precise understanding of heterogeneous catalyst structure and activity is required to design more efficient, greener, industrial chemical processes. While it is possible to resolve both the structure and activity of a catalyst, their innate complexity means it is nontrivial to unambiguously assign one to the other. Herein, we demonstrate how transient measurements, coupled with kinetic modeling, can be used to resolve kinetics with sufficient precision such that it is possible to resolve the identity of an “active site” over technical catalysts. We find that under CO rich conditions the transient activity and coverage dependencies measured over a Pd/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst during pulsed flow and transient spectroscopy CO oxidation experiments can be quantitatively predicted using a kinetic model derived from ultrahigh vacuum surface science experiments over Pd(111) single crystals. Thus, we conclude that the state (i.e., structure and composition of the active site) of the Pd/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst under reaction conditions is equivalent to that of a Pd(111) surface. Instead of determining a catalyst’s structure and assigning it to activity, we instead propose a new approach: using precise kinetic measurements to infer the catalyst’s state. This approach enables the identification of active sites that have been challenging to resolve using traditional spectroscopic or microscopic methods, offering a powerful and complementary tool for designing new catalysts.},

Depending mostly on the coreactant oxidation, the ‘remote’ pathway is hindered by the slow coreactant oxidation rate and the short half-lives of electrogenerated radicals. In this work, we synthesized a [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ derivative featuring a stimuli-responsive disulfide bond in its linker to the bead. Electrogenerated tri- n -propylamine (TPrA) neutral radicals reduce disulfide moieties, electrochemically inducing the release of Ru(II) labels in solution and thereby leading to an unprecedented mechanism shift toward the more efficient “homogeneous” ECL pathway. Leveraging ICP-MS, ECL microscopy, and finite element simulations, we demonstrate rapid bond cleavage and an impressive signal enhancement of up to 613%. Using an experimental configuration designed to emulate commercial clinical analysis, we developed an ECL-based immunoassay for the rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein in whole virus samples from swab formulations. The immunosensor incorporating the cleavable luminophore demonstrated a 40% lower detection limit and a 2-fold increase in sensitivity, while reducing TPrA consumption by 72%. These findings establish stimuli-responsive luminophores as a groundbreaking class of ECL labels, promising substantial improvements in the sensitivity of commercial biosensors.},

  abstract     = {Photoswitching molecules like the azoarenes have myriad potential applications, ranging from energy storage to targeted drug delivery. Upon irradiation, azoarenes convert from an E -form to a Z -form. The Z -form can thermally revert to the E -form through a classical-adiabatic or a triplet-assisted rotational mechanism. We show that strategic placements of heteroatoms and substituents can modulate spin delocalization in the triplet state, thereby tuning the S 0 –T 1 –S 0 crossing points. Increased spin delocalization lowers the crossing point and shortens the thermal half-life of the Z -form. Computed spin densities at the diazo N atoms, along with computed S 0 –T 1 –S 0 crossing points, activation entropies, and rate constants for 15 azoarenes are compared with available experimental data. There is evidence that some of the studied Z – E isomerizations proceed simultaneously via a classical-adiabatic and a triplet-assisted mechanism. The ratio of the two reaction pathways is temperature-dependent. Triplet spin density at the diazo N atoms is recognized as a useful indicator for predicting the thermal half-lives of these species.},

MGDs offer a promising therapeutic approach by selectively eliminating disease-associated proteins; however, their rational design and discovery have historically remained a significant challenge. The field remains constrained by a lack of strategies to effectively utilize ubiquitin ligases (E3s) for TPD, thus missing the therapeutic potential offered by tissue-specific E3 expression. In this study, we developed ZZ7, a molecular glue degrader that selectively degrades BRD9, a critical component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, specifically in synovial sarcoma cells, while sparing cardiomyocytes. The discovery of ZZ7 was driven by a “chemocentric” approach, incorporating a cysteine-reactive, reversible covalent warhead into a BRD9 inhibitor to transform its function from inhibition to degradation. ZZ7 covalently engages DCAF16 at Cys178, an E3 ligase that is highly expressed in synovial sarcoma cells but relatively underexpressed in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, leveraging a cysteine residue that has not been previously exploited. These findings pave the way for new strategies in tissue- and disease-specific precision therapies, particularly for malignancies characterized by an elevated level of DCAF16 expression.},

However, electrocatalysts capable of achieving both high Faradaic efficiency for CO reduction to n -propanol and long-term durability remain scarce. While monometallic and bimetallic dilute Cu-based alloys have been studied extensively for electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO 2 RR) and CORR, multimetallic (≥5 elements) electrocatalysts are less explored. Here we screen and investigate the electrocatalytic CORR performance of multimetallic electrocatalysts. Notably, the ZnSnAuBiCuO catalyst achieves Faradaic efficiencies (FE) of 47 ± 1% for n -propanol production, while demonstrating stable performance for 60 h at 100 mA cm –2 . The enhanced CORR performance is attributed to the higher grain boundary density and the higher Cu valence state compared to CuO. Calculation is consistent with the possibility that grain boundaries are, in the context of n -propanol production, energetically favorable, compared to within-grain sites. The stable electrosynthesis of n -propanol with high FE by ZnSnAuBiCuO may motivate the exploration of other multimetallic systems, which have vast compositional space.},

Under humid air and dissolved CO 2 , aluminum current collectors undergo sustained oxidative dissolution, releasing electrons that selectively reduce transition metals (TM) in the layered oxide to TM(II). This redox reaction triggers H + insertion, Li + /H + exchange, and lattice destabilization, forming Li x H y TMO 2 intermediates that spontaneously coordinate with CO 3 2– to yield TMCO 3 or Ni 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 , while Li + precipitates as Li 2 CO 3 .

Their appeal is countered by the stability challenges arising from inherent lattice softness and labile surface ligand bonding. Recent ligand design efforts have drastically improved the structural integrity of LHP NCs by pursuing strongly and statically bound ligands, as found with zwitterionic headgroups. Here, we venture into a new class of cationic ligands featuring guanidinium headgroups, which combine the compactness of primary ammoniums with the deprotonation resistance of quaternary ammoniums. We reasoned that strong yet dynamic ligand binding offers distinct benefits. A library of aliphatic guanidinium molecules was synthesized and surveyed as capping ligands for CsPbBr 3 , FAPbBr 3 , and CsPbI 3 NCs, enabling up to 95% photoluminescence quantum yields for bromide compositions. We then compare binding behavior of guanidinium ligands with those of other widely used ligands. Zwitterionic ligands phosphocholines and phosphoethanolamines bind more strongly than sulfobetaines and quaternary ammonium ligands, yet all these headgroups impart relatively static binding with exchange rates below 5 s –1 . Primary ammonium ligands are champions in dynamicity but lag behind in ligand-coverage retention and, hence, long-term stability. Guanidinium ligands strike a favorable balance: they match the binding dynamics of primary ammonium ligands while significantly enhancing binding strength, enabling rigorous purification and compatibility with relatively polar solvents such as tetrahydrofuran. We then showcase the benefits of dynamically bound ligands in photocatalytic C–C coupling reactions.},

  abstract     = {The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) to ammonia (NH 3 ) is a promising route for sustainable NH 3 synthesis. Cu-based materials are the most used and promising catalysts for this reaction. However, Cu undergoes uncontrollable compositional and structural changes under NO 3 RR conditions, necessitating a deeper understanding of the relationship between precatalyst features, structural evolution, and catalytic performance for the advancement of current catalyst design rules. Here, we exploit well-defined Cu and Cu oxide nanocrystals (NCs) as precatalysts to elucidate these correlations. We find that the size, shape, and oxide content of the Cu precatalysts all play a role in driving structural evolution and, thus, the catalytic behavior during NO 3 RR. In particular, a higher oxide content, an optimized {111}/{100} facet ratio, and the spatial proximity of these facets forming grain boundaries within the active catalysts emerge as key factors to enhance NH 3 selectivity. Among the studied Cu precatalysts, 10 nm Cu spheres integrate these key features, achieving a competitive NH 3 production rate compared to the state of the art. This work links pre- and in situ-formed catalyst features to catalytic performance, offering insights into the morphological dynamics of Cu catalysts under NO 3 RR conditions.},

However, light scattering limits the applications of photo-uncaging in opaque specimens or tissues. Here, we introduce sono-uncaging , a process in which a chemical functional group becomes exposed upon the application of ultrasound, which can be applied and focused in optically opaque materials. We engineered gas vesicles (GVs), air-filled protein nanostructures sensitive to ultrasound, to contain cysteines on their concealed inner surface, hypothesizing that the application of ultrasound would collapse the GV shell and reveal the cysteines. The resulting SonoCage construct reacted with monobromobimane (mBBr), a fluorogenic, thiol-reactive molecule, only after treatment with ultrasound, establishing the sono-uncaging proof of concept. We then demonstrated the spatial patterning capability of sono-uncaging by embedding the SonoCages in an mBBr-containing hydrogel and creating fluorescent patterns with phased array ultrasound. This patterning could be accomplished using a diagnostic imaging transducer with mild ultrasound conditions. This work establishes sono-uncaging as a method for spatiotemporal control over chemical reactivity using widely available ultrasound technology.},

Here, we report a high-valent chromium(V)-mediated strategy for synthesizing multisubstituted hydrazine derivatives via ligand migration, representing ligand migration to N α in a Cr-hydrazido complex. Our approach begins with the oxidation of chromium(IV) hydrazido precursor 1 by benzyl bromide, which replaces the 1,2-bis(diethylphosphino)ethane (depe) ligand with two bromide ions to generate the high-valent chromium(V) dibromide hydrazido complex 2 . Sequential ligand metathesis of 2 with aryl Grignard reagents (ArMgBr, Ar = biphenyl, p -methylphenyl, o -methoxyphenyl), alkenyl or alkyl Grignard reagents (1-phenylvinylmagnesium bromide and isopropylmagnesium bromide), followed by ligand migration from the Cr center to the N α atom and electrophilic trapping (MeOH, PhCH 2 Br), affords structurally diverse hydrazines ( 4a–c , 5a–c , and 6 ). Single-crystal X-ray crystallography, in situ UV–vis spectroscopy, and DFT calculations collectively reveal a ligand migration mechanism in chromium chemistry, directly forging N–C bonds from N 2 without ammonia intermediates. This migration not only constructs new N–C bonds but also enables the direct construction of complex hydrazine structures directly from N 2 .},

  abstract     = {The role of the equatorial ligands and their influence on the electronic structures and bonding properties of uranyl and other actinyls are not well understood and are thus at the forefront of actinide research. In the study presented here, we found that the good energy match of uranyl(VI) with F – valence orbitals leads to substantial changes in the uranyl electronic structure, compared to uranyl–Cl – and uranyl–Br – . The good energy match between uranyl(VI) and F – likely enhances the stability of the uranyl–F – bond, contributing to the higher U–F – affinity in aqueous solution compared to uranyl–Cl – /Br – , which is also demonstrated for plutonyl(VI). These findings are based on studies of equatorial and axial ligand covalency in three uranyl halides: NaRb 8 (UO 2 ) 5 F 19 ·2H 2 O, Rb 2 UO 2 Cl 4 ·2H 2 O, and Rb 2 UO 2 Br 4 ·2H 2 O. We describe covalent uranium–halide interactions, following the trend Br – ≈ Cl – > F – . Ligand K-edge XANES and DFT (including TDDFT and LFDFT) reveal significant electronic structure differences, with the F-based compound having a uranyl-based HOMO, while Cl- and Br-based compounds show predominant ligand p character in the HOMO. A newly introduced theoretical index evaluates bond covalency.

  abstract     = {Despite mounting evidence that the air–water interface or microdroplet geometry has no bearing on the spontaneous formation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) down to a 50 nM limit of detection, the debate persists. Recent studies have demonstrated connections between the spontaneous formation of hydroxyl (HO • ) radicals and H 2 O 2 in sprayed microdroplets and the solution pH, dissolved salts, nebulizing gas, and gaseous environment. Among the halides, chloride (Cl – ), bromide (Br – ), and iodide (I – ), the studies found that Br – dominated H 2 O 2 formation because of its enhanced fractionation at the air–water interface and ability to donate electrons. The studies also suggested that H 2 O 2 production at the air–water interface scales with the alkalinity of water. In response, this report employs a comprehensive set of techniques, encompassing nuclear magnetic resonance, potentiodynamic polarization, electron microscopy, and H 2 O 2 assay kit fluorometry, to examine these claims. The experiments reveal that the air–water interface or microdroplet geometry does not drive H 2 O 2 formation, regardless of the presence of halide in water. The reduction of oxygen gas (O 2 ) at the solid–water interface produces H 2 O 2 (i.e., in the absence of O 2 , no H 2 O 2 is formed regardless of the halide). This work explains the relative dependence of H 2 O 2 concentrations on halides based on their propensity to drive pitting corrosion (Cl – > Br – > I – ). As pits appear in the passivating layer, exposing the metal, H 2 O 2 is consumed during further oxidation. This work also disproves the claim that alkalinity drives H 2 O 2 formation, as it demonstrates that aluminum and titanium surfaces generate higher H 2 O 2 concentrations in acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. Taken together, this report provides alternate explanations for the observations that should help draw the debate toward its closure.},

  abstract     = {Overcoming the challenges of precise localization, prolonged retention, and targeted release remains a fundamental barrier in the development of effective oral drug delivery systems. These limitations are particularly critical in diseases requiring site-specific action within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Inspired by the trotline fishing technique, where multiple hooks are suspended along a main line to increase capture efficiency, we present a smart oral drug delivery platform featuring trotline-inspired mesoporous carriers with dynamic anchoring capability. This delivery system integrates three key components: (1) a trotline-inspired bioadhesive carrier, consisting of carbon nanotube (CNT) decorated with multiple submicrometer-scale periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) “hooks” (denoted as CNT@PMOs or CNTP); (2) therapeutic drugs loaded within the PMO mesopores (such as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) for IBD); (3) a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive camouflage polymer coating, designed to modulate site-specific adhesion and on-demand drug release. Following oral administration, the outer polymer coating effectively shields the PMO hooks, facilitating safe passage through the stomach and healthy intestinal regions. Upon reaching inflamed sites in the intestine, the elevated ROS levels trigger the degradation of the polymer coating, exposing the PMO hooks. This controlled unmasking enables selective adhesion to inflamed tissues and prolongs local drug retention. Simultaneously, degradation of the polymer also triggers controlled release of 5-ASA at the lesion site. The one-dimensional, multihooked design further enhances mechanical interlocking with the intestinal mucosa, anchoring the carrier at the desired site. Importantly, the system shows minimal systemic exposure, with nearly 100% fecal excretion of unabsorbed carriers within 72 h. By integrating stimuli-responsive activation, dynamic anchoring, and spatiotemporal drug release, this platform addresses long-standing barriers in oral drug delivery. It offers a broadly applicable strategy for enhancing therapeutic precision and efficacy in GI-targeted treatments and beyond.},

However, their practical application is still hindered by inhomogeneous aluminum deposition, hydrogen evolution reaction, and corrosion during cycling, especially under extreme temperatures and high load conditions. In this study, a hydrated eutectic electrolyte composed of Al(ClO 4 ) 3 ·9H 2 O and methyl carbamate in a 1:4 molar ratio was designed to improve the stability of aqueous aluminum ion batteries across a wide temperature range. The optimized electrolyte forms a water-deficient, weakly solvated structure, [Al 3+ (MC) 2 (H 2 O) 2 (ClO 4 – ) 2 ] + , which kinetically promotes a homogeneous aluminum deposition/stripping behavior. In addition, this electrolyte facilitates the formation of a dense, anion-rich solid electrolyte interface layer on the aluminum anode surface, maintaining long-term anode stability. The Al//Al symmetric cell demonstrated stable cycling for 600 h at a current density of 0.2 mA cm –2 , while the Al//polyaniline (PANI) full battery maintained a specific capacity of 117.7 mAh g –1 (based on the mass of PANI) after 1100 cycles at 1 A g –1 .

  abstract     = {Ni-rich layered oxides (LiNi x Co y Mn z O 2 , x > 0.6) have garnered significant attention in electric transportation due to the high energy density (>700 Wh/kg). Traditional synthesis of Ni-rich cathodes typically involves high-temperature (>700 °C) long-duration (∼10 h) sintering procedures, which not only increase energy consumption but also present challenges in precisely controlling the synthesis conditions. Here we designed a two-step tandem topotactic phase-transition route that allows low-temperature synthesis of Ni-rich cathodes. Temperature-resolved X-ray scattering techniques combined with ex situ spectroscopy experiments substantiated that the layered hydroxide precursor first transformed to a layered oxyhydroxide intermediate through a topotactic deprotonation reaction, which was then converted to Ni-rich layered oxide cathode by a rapid topotactic lithiation. Radically distinguished from the destruction-reconstruction process of layered structures in the conventional synthesis route, the layered framework was maintained throughout the whole topotactic route, lowering the energy barrier of synthetic kinetics and thus enabling the successful preparation of Ni-rich cathodes at low temperature (150 °C), which brings an unprecedented reduction of energy consumption (by 57%) and considerable cost-savings. Furthermore, Ni-rich cathodes synthesized through the topotactic route exhibited comparable electrochemical activity and even better cycling stability (∼80% after 500 cycles) than those synthesized through conventional routes. This work presents an enlightening methodology of Ni-rich layered cathode synthesis, laying a substantial foundation for cost-effective and eco-friendly production of high-performance cathode materials on an industrial scale.},

  abstract     = {The interaction and steric stability of colloidal nanocrystals are determined by the interplay of various contributions, including van der Waals, dipole–dipole, and solvation forces. Recent simulations have unveiled that the solvation force dictates the colloidal stability of two-dimensional nanomaterials with no experimental validation. Here, we introduce optical-pump THz-probe spectroscopy (OPTP) as a novel approach to track the colloidal aggregation of two-dimensional nanoplatelets. We show that far below the saturation concentration previously determined by scattering methods, OPTP can already report nanoscale aggregations by sensitively probing the short-range free carrier photoconductivity arising from internanoplatelet electronic coupling. Combining the OPTP and molecular dynamics simulations allows us to (1) confirm that increasing the nanoplatelet base facet area results in enhanced solvation force and thus aggregation tendency, and (2) demonstrate that the attraction between the nanoplatelets increases with their chain length for n -alkane solvents. Finally, we extend our simulations to study the shape of the interaction that can be tuned via the isomer of the solvent molecules. Our results provide not only a new sensitive tool to probe the aggregation effects of semiconducting colloidal particles but also fundamental insights into the critical parameters to engineer colloidal stability.},

  abstract     = {Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) represent an intriguing class of quantum materials that bridge the gap between half-metallic ferromagnets and conventional semiconductors, offering promising avenues for spintronic applications. The discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in ultrathin two-dimensional van der Waals crystals has further fueled interest in exploring magnetism at the ultimate two-dimensional limit. Here, we demonstrate the growth of environmentally stable, atomically thin Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 nanosheets via a simple hydrothermal method. These nanosheets exhibit robust ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature of ∼100 K and remarkably, host a spin-gapless semiconducting (SGS) state, distinct from the well-known half-metallic Weyl ferromagnetism observed in the bulk counterpart. Structural analysis reveals that enhanced lattice distortion and strain effects in the nanosheets, induced by reduced dimensionality and surface defects, play a critical role in stabilizing this phase. Williamson-Hall analysis confirms the presence of strain, while DFT calculations reveal that strain-induced lattice distortions annihilate the Weyl points and the emergence of SGS semiconductivity. Charge transport measurements indicate a Mott variable-range hopping mechanism, while temperature-dependent conductivity suggests a coexistence of semiconducting and weakly gapless features. These findings not only establish atomically thin Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 nanosheets as a novel platform for SGS physics but also open up exciting possibilities for strain-engineered topological phases and next-generation spintronic and quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Natural oligosaccharides and aminoglycosides are important sources of new drug candidates, especially in the development of antibiotics. In the past, discovering novel saccharides has been time-consuming and costly. However, the rapid expansion of high-throughput data, including genomic and mass spectrometry data sets, has greatly increased opportunities for natural saccharide discovery. Yet, due to the complex biosynthesis pathways of saccharides, no existing method can predict their structures with high precision. To address this, we introduce Seq2Saccharide, a tool designed to automate saccharide natural product discovery by integrating both genomic and mass spectrometry data. To enhance accuracy, Seq2Saccharide predicts hundreds or thousands of putative structures for each gene cluster. The correct structure is then identified from these predictions using a mass spectral search. Benchmarks against saccharides in the MiBIG database show that Seq2Saccharide outperforms existing methods in predicting the structure of saccharides. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis indicates that the variable search module can correct mispredictions from genome mining. By searching genomic and mass spectrometry data of microbial strains, Seq2Saccharide correctly identified the biosynthetic gene cluster for the polysaccharide oligosaccharide trestatin B.},

  abstract     = {Chromophore radicals (CR) are emerging as important components for molecular quantum information science (QIS), especially in the context of quantum sensing. Here, we demonstrate that the optically hyperpolarized electrons in a 1,6,7,12-tetrakis(4- tert -butylphenoxy)-perylene-3,4,9,10-bis(dicarboximide) (tpPDI) covalently linked to a partially deuterated 1,3-bis(diphenylene)- d 16 -2-phenylallyl radical (BDPA- d 16 ) can be coherently manipulated via pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) methods to transfer polarization to nuclear spins and back. Under light illumination at 85 K, electron hyperpolarization in BDPA is enhanced 2.1- to 2.4-fold over thermal polarization and lasts for more than 100 ms. By applying nuclear orientation via electron spin-locking (NOVEL) DNP, this optically amplified electron hyperpolarization was successfully transferred to a 1 H nuclear spin within the CR system and efficiently returned to the electron spin for readout via reverse-NOVEL. The NOVEL transfer efficiency of 65% amounts to a 688-fold nuclear spin hyperpolarization of the target nuclear spin, considering the 2.1-fold electron spin hyperpolarization. This reversible coherent manipulation of hyperpolarization transfer highlights the utility of CR systems to initialize and read out nuclear spin states in a disordered matrix at moderate cryogenic temperatures. Coupled with CRs’ environmental compatibility, tunability, and precise state initialization, these results highlight the promising role of nuclear spins in CRs for QIS applications, including quantum sensing and memory.},

However, conventional synthetic methods have faced substantial challenges in achieving regulatable crystal phases and lack precise control over catalyst composition at the atomic level, which is detrimental, especially for reactions involving multiple intermediates. Here, we report a facile strategy for simultaneously regulating the crystal phase and composition (Pt single-atom alloying) of ultrathin Ru nanocages (<2 nm in thickness), enabling efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolytes. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that both the metastable face-centered cubic (fcc) Ru phase and isolated Pt atoms contribute to stabilizing metallic Ru, facilitating Pt–Ru synergy for optimized adsorption of H* and *OH intermediates and accelerated HER kinetics. Consequently, the Pt–Ru fcc single-atom alloy nanocages exhibit impressive alkaline HER performance, with an overpotential as low as 8.5 mV at 10 mA cm –2 , an 18.0-fold enhancement in mass activity relative to commercial Pt/C and commendable stability over 400 h of operation at ampere-level current densities.

However, 3.5 V oxide-type cathodes (e.g., NaNi 1/3 Fe 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2 ) may suffer from interfacial contact loss with solid electrolytes due to their intrinsic rigidity, resulting in irreversible capacity degradation during cycling. Herein, we report a highly deformable chloride cathode, NaFeCl 4 , displaying Young’s modulus of only 1.33 GPa and excellent structural reversibility. Benefiting from the soft lattice, the NaFeCl 4 cathode maintains a crack-free morphology despite significant changes in structural units between tetrahedra [Fe 3+ Cl 4 ] and octahedra [Fe 2+ Cl 6 ] upon repeated Na + insertion/extraction, achieving a high capacity retention of 84.4% over 500 cycles. Moreover, with only 5.2% of the cost of the NaNi 1/3 Fe 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2 and 3.7% of the cost of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 cathode, NaFeCl 4 can deliver a working voltage of ∼3.45 V vs Na + /Na and energy density of ∼405 Wh kg –1 .

While parent methylene possesses a triplet ground state (σ 1 π 1 ), substituents are capable of stabilizing the singlet as the ground state (σ 2 π 0 or σ 0 π 2 ) by altering the frontier orbital energies. Here, we reveal that the 1,2[I]-shift isomer of 2-iodopyridine, the N -iodo Hammick intermediate, features a resonance between its carbene σ and N–I bond σ* orbitals, rendering them frontier orbitals. This singlet carbene is efficiently generated via UV photolysis of 2-iodopyridine in solid neon at 4.4 K and reacts with molecular hydrogen – but not deuterium – via N–I bond cleavage enabled by quantum tunneling. Instanton theory computations demonstrate the preference for a concerted hydrogen addition mechanism at elevated temperatures, while hydrogen atom abstraction dominates below 100 K despite a higher kinetic barrier for this process. Our findings introduce an unprecedented carbene class, unlocking new opportunities for reactivity and electronic structure explorations.},

Herein we report a unique light-responsive proton/water transport system using self-assembled acylhydrazone-imidazole channels with tunable activity via E – Z isomerization. Three channel-forming molecules with varying alkyl chains were synthesized, namely, 1a (C4), 1b (C8), and 1c (C12). The photoswitching behavior of the molecule was confirmed by UV–vis spectroscopy within the liposome. The crystallographic analysis revealed that the E -isomer forms an H-bonded proton transport pathway mediated by water molecules. Patch clamp assays confirmed proton channel formation for 1a with a transport rate of 2.18 × 10 7 H + /s/channel and high proton selectivity over other ions. Ion transport assays with EYPC-LUVs entrapped with HPTS and NaCl revealed the complete rejection of external cations and anions. The compounds demonstrated significant proton transport when combined with valinomycin, indicating transmembrane proton transport for 1a – c . Upon irradiation at 310 nm, all derivatives showed increased proton transport rates, which subsequently decreased after exposure to 365 nm, confirming the photoresponsive behavior of the system. A similar trend was observed in water transport, where the single-channel permeability of 1a increased from 6.5 × 10 6 to 3.5 × 10 7 water molecules/s/channel upon switching from the E to Z isomers, then decreased to 1.8 × 10 7 after reverting to the E conformer. Molecular simulation confirmed that stable supramolecular porous water crystal patches may form, featuring multivalent water H-bonding to acylhydrazone and imidazole units that serve as water-cluster relays within the channel.},

Powering molecular motors with visible light, especially in the low-energy green, yellow, and red regions, has been a significant challenge, limiting their further application. Herein, we report a general and versatile strategy to overcome this challenge and drive molecular motors using low-energy, low-intensity, noncoherent light across the visible spectrum. Our approach is achieved by simply mixing molecular motors with semiconductor colloidal quantum dots (QDs) and a triplet mediator (9-anthracenecarboxylic acid). The size-tunable absorption of QDs can precisely match the desired color for activating the motor. The mechanism of our design relies on the unique property of QDs, which can efficiently sensitize molecular triplets. Through two-step triplet energy transfers, the rotation of the motor can be efficiently activated using low-energy photons. For the first time, we accomplished driving molecular motors at wavelengths beyond 530 nm under low-intensity and noncoherent light. This breakthrough not only expands the capabilities of visible-light-activated molecular systems to operate in a broad wavelength range but also opens numerous opportunities toward controlling dynamic functions while circumventing competing photochemical processes (i.e., photodegradation).},

Herein, we discover that electrolyte degradation is strongly associated with bulk decomposition, unlike conventional insight into only the interface-catalyzed decomposition. The highly acidic HTFSI produced by the triggering event can induce subsequent Ni dissolution and bulk decomposition of solid electrolytes through cascade reaction of bulk decomposition behavior, leading to a continuous decline in the electrochemical performance of solid-state batteries. By introducing a dissolution-retardant active structure onto the Ni-rich electrode, it mitigates the bulk cascade reaction and maintains the energy density.

Despite its importance, nano- and surface science communities still lack an efficient, robust, precise, and automated detection approach for on-surface isomers and highly similar molecules. Here, we present ReSTOLO, a convolution neural network (CNN)-based framework for precise detection and identification of multiple types of sparsely distributed molecules on surfaces, particularly designed for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images containing numerous molecules with analogous features. To address challenges arising from molecular shape and size similarities, we implemented a two-stage framework comprising two CNN models: YOLO v5.m was used for molecular localization, and ResNet-101 for classification. The framework optimally harnesses the advantages of both models by applying a box normalization connection. We demonstrated the framework’s effectiveness by applying it to analyze a surface reaction process involving six molecules with nearly identical STM signatures. The training process employed an STM image database of single molecules augmented with physical and experimental tools constructed using standardized image boxes. This two-stage approach achieved approximately ∼20% improvements in performance metrics, including precision, recall, and accuracy, compared to conventional frameworks. The framework exhibits robust capabilities in automatically and efficiently pinpointing and discriminating between molecular species with similar configurations in complex surface reactions. This automated molecular discriminator represents a significant advance in facilitating STM tip-manipulated chemical reactions on surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Aiming to interrogate the possibility of heteronuclear B–C one-electron σ-bonding, we have prepared a naphthalene-based platform ([ 5 ] + ) decorated at its peri-positions by a carbenium and a boryl unit separated by a B–C distance of 2.994(4) Å. Reduction of this cationic platform by one electron affords a radical ( 5 • ) with a shortened B–C distance of 2.874(3) Å, suggesting the onset of B–C one-electron bonding. This radical, which was also characterized by EPR spectroscopy, undergoes a second reduction, affording a borate ([ 5 ] − ) with a long, polar covalent B–C bond of 1.793(8) Å. These compounds have been structurally, spectroscopically, and computationally investigated, shedding light on the polarization and weakness of the B–C bond of 5 • , which is best described as a noncovalent one-electron B···C triel bond rather than a covalent one-electron σ-bond.},

  abstract     = {Light alkenes are central building blocks in the chemical industry, yet their production from alkanes requires energy-intensive processes that generate substantial CO 2 emissions and suffer from catalyst deactivation and overoxidation. In this work, we demonstrate that alkane dehydrogenation can be accomplished at ambient temperature and pressure by modulating the voltage applied to an electrocatalyst surface. Voltage manipulation provides real-time control over the adsorption and dehydrogenation of alkanes, as well as the potential-driven desorption of dehydrogenated adsorbates. By using a newly developed sensitive gas chromatographic (GC) analysis method, we were able to quantify the formation of 1-butene from n -butane, as well as the formation of a distribution of shorter chain alkanes and alkenes. We show that the product distribution depends on the potential applied during adsorption and is sensitive to both catalyst identity and electrolyte composition. Palladium suppresses C–C bond cleavage relative to platinum, and replacing protons with sodium cations increases 1-butene selectivity by promoting desorption over hydrogenation. To rationalize the observed product distribution, we propose a reaction mechanism supported by grand canonical density functional theory calculations. Together, these results reveal a new pathway for alkane dehydrogenation under ambient conditions and establish time-programmed electrochemical control as a promising tool for manipulating surface-catalyzed transformations of n -alkanes.},

The concept of skeletal editing emerging recently is attractive for developing a new generation of late-stage peptide modification methods. In this work, we developed a facile tryptophan-specific late-stage peptide modification based on photocatalytic indole-to-quinazoline editing. The method showed a broad scope regarding both linear and cyclic peptide substrates and was applied to the modification of commercially available peptide drugs. A mechanism based on singlet oxygen oxidation of tryptophan and the interruption of oxidative indole cleavage by ammonia addition was proposed.},

  abstract     = {We report the first example of using photoinduced ligand release from a Ru(II) complex for light-triggered cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction. CYPs are pivotal enzymes in biosynthesis and drug metabolism, and their induction can be leveraged for therapeutics and biochemical research. We show the activation of a CYP1A1 with visible light through the efficient photorelease of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR; 1 ) agonist with a quantum yield, Φ 500 , of 0.16(1) with λ irr = 500 nm in [Ru(tpy)(Me 2 bpy)( 1 )] 2+ (tpy = 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine, Me 2 bpy = 6,6′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine). This value is consistent with that previously reported for pyridine (py) exchange in the analogous [Ru(tpy)(Me 2 bpy)(py)] 2+ complex, Φ 500 = 0.16(1), which is driven by steric effects. In contrast to [Ru(tpy)(bpy)(py)] 2+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine), with Φ 500 < 10 –4 , the ligand photodissociation in [Ru(tpy)(bpy)( 1 )] 2+ proceeds with Φ 500 = 0.015(1), at least 2 orders of magnitude more efficiently. Similarly, [Ru(tpy)(biq)( 1 )] 2+ ( 4 ; biq = 2,2′-biquinoline) undergoes photoinduced exchange of 1 with CH 3 CN solvent with Φ 500 = 0.064(3), more efficiently than [Ru(tpy)(biq)(py)] 2+ with Φ 500 = 0.03. Through experiments and calculations, we show the involvement of intraligand charge transfer (ILCT) within the leaving ligand in an unprecedented mechanism for ligand photodissociation from Ru(II). Chemical tools based on these findings hold the promise of advancing research on tissue-specific CYP activity by enabling precise spatiotemporal control. Moreover, these compounds may pave the way for the development of highly specific and light-activated pharmaceuticals that enhance the synergy with existing drugs.},

  abstract     = {Incorporating stable isotopes into bioactive molecules is crucial in pharmaceutical development, particularly for metabolic studies where higher mass isotopologs of candidate compounds are required. Here we present an isotope exchange method for synthesizing isotopically enriched pyrimidines. By deconstructing pyrimidines into vinamidinium salts and reconstructing them with deuterium, 13 C, and 15 N-enriched amidines, we achieve high isotopic enrichment across various substitution patterns, including complex drug-like pyrimidine derivatives. The process involves a Tf 2 O-mediated ring-opening and ring-closing sequence to form a pyrimidinium ion, followed by cleavage to the vinamidinium salt with pyrrolidine. Cyclization with labeled amidines under basic conditions then forms the labeled pyrimidine. Additionally, we deuterated the 5-position of pyrimidines using this approach to offer further versatility in generating higher mass isotopologs.},
