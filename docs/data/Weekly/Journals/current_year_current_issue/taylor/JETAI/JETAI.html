  abstract     = {Intuitionistic multiplicative preference relations (IMPRs) and intuitionistic multiplicative sets (IMSs) play a significant role in real-life problems that contain unsymmetrical and nonuniform information. Correlation coefficients are critical tools for evaluating such information, especially in medical areas and clustering analysis, where the relationship between objects in the given data is required. Despite the importance of this subject, there is only one approach in the literature regarding the correlation coefficients of IMSs and existing coefficients have certain disadvantages. In this paper, we propose a parametric generalisation of these correlation coefficients on IMSs and apply them to medical diagnosis, taxonomy, and clustering. To that end, some disadvantages of existing correlation coefficients are listed first. Then, with some theoretical work, we derive a parametric generalisation of these coefficients and their weighted forms. To better illustrate how the parametric generalisation of correlation coefficients improves the results, numerical parametric solutions of existing examples are presented with detailed comparisons. Moreover, a novel algorithm is introduced for clustering using proposed correlation coefficients in IMSs. Finally, three real-life examples are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed generalised correlation coefficients and the clustering algorithm in specific applications.},

Reinforcement learning has the advantage of not requiring a model. Consequently, it can improve control performance, mainly when a model is generally unavailable, such as when an error occurs. The proposed method efficiently and expeditiously investigates the action space. First, it quantifies the resemblance between agents’ and traditional controllers’ actions. Then, the principal reward function is modified to reflect this similarity. This reward-shaping mechanism guides the agent to maximize its return via an attractive force during the gradient ascent. To validate our concept, we establish a satellite attitude control environment with a similarity subsystem. The outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.},

  abstract     = {Anaemia is a common disease that affects billions of people worldwide and is caused due to low blood haemoglobin level. According to WHO statistics, anaemia is the most prevalent in developing and underdeveloped countries. Conventional invasive methods are prohibitively expensive and difficult to administer globally, necessitating a non-invasive, low-cost, and user-friendly solution. This study aims to develop a non-invasive anaemia detection system by combining cutting-edge computational approaches with the age-old practice of estimating blood haemoglobin levels by observing pallor in the palm. The proposed system operates on the basis of inducing changes in palm pallor with appropriate pressure application and release, measuring the rate of colour changes, and performing time-domain analysis to correlate with blood haemoglobin concentration. The video of colour changes in the palm caused by a customised device is captured using a smartphone camera and processed and analysed using deep learning models based on tree-structured 3-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) for accurate estimation of haemoglobin levels. The proposed system ensures a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and RMSE of 96.87%, 90.90%, 94.44% and 0.495, respectively, while run on a dataset consisting of palm pallor video samples of 531 individuals.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a comparative effectiveness analysis of fuzzy and non-fuzzy association rule mining (ARM). The corresponding motivation is the lack of relevant papers devoted to the effectiveness comparison between fuzzy and non-fuzzy ARM. The current research applies the results of fuzzy/non-fuzzy ARM to associative classification and uses the classification accuracy of the corresponding classifiers as the effectiveness measure. The research demonstrates that basic effectiveness comparison between fuzzy and non-fuzzy ARM does not necessarily speak in favour of fuzzy ARM. However, then the research demonstrates that fuzzy ARM has a distinctive ability to handle data inconsistencies, which results in the ability of corresponding fuzzy classifiers to not only provide class predictions but also indicate their certainty in the provided output. The research reveals some distinct correlation between classification accuracy and the degree of certainty in fuzzy associative classification: the greater certainty nearly always results in the better classification accuracy. This ability of fuzzy associative classifiers to indicate their certainty in the performed classification and the corresponding ability of fuzzy ARM to handle data inconsistencies are not applicable in non-fuzzy associative classifiers and ARM. Therefore, these abilities are used in the paper to substantiate the relevance of applying fuzzy logic in ARM.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, skin cancer has been the most dangerous disease noticed among people worldwide. Skin cancer should be identified earlier to reduce the rate of mortality. Employing dermoscopic images can identify and categorise skin cancer effectively. But, the visual evaluation is a complex procedure to be done in the dermoscopic image. However, Deep learning (DL) is an efficient method for skin cancer detection; however, segmenting the skin lesion and automatic localisation in an earlier stage is complicated. In this paper, a novel Ladybug Beetle Optimization-Double Attention Based Multilevel 1-D CNN (LBO-DAM 1-D CNN) technique is proposed to detect and classify skin cancer. To improve skin lesion type discriminability, the two types of attention modules are introduced. The Ultra-Lightweight Subspace Attention Module (ULSAM) is utilised for classifying the feature maps into different stages to validate the frequency from different image samples. However, the multilayer perceptron attention module (MLPAM) is determined to provide information regarding skin cancer classification and diminish the noise and unwanted data. To minimise data loss, it is then combined with hierarchical complementarity during classification. Second, a modified MLPAM is used to extract significant feature spaces for network learning, select the most important information, and reduce feature space redundancy. The Ladybug Beetle Optimization (LBO) algorithm provides the optimal classification solution by minimising the loss rate of DAM 1-D CNN architecture. The experimentation is conducted on three different datasets such as ISIC2020, HAM10000, and the melanoma detection dataset. The experimental results revealed that the proposed method is compared with different existing methods such as IMFO-KELM, Mask RCNN, M-SVM, DCNN-9, and TL-CNN with different datasets. These methods attained 94.56, 92.65, 90.56, 88.65, and 95.5 for the ISIC2020 dataset but the proposed method enhanced the classification performance by attaining 97.02. Also, the validation is based on metrics, namely, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1-score of 97.03%, 97.05%, 97.58%, and 97.27% for a total of 500 epochs.},

  abstract     = {An innovative approach is needed for the early identification of GC (Gastric cancer) to improve the prediction of GC patients. This work presents a GC prediction system to identify GC depending on saliva data samples. The diagnosis of GC at an early stage will improve the survival rate. At first, Raman data of saliva samples are collected and pre-processed. Afterwards, efficient Raman spectral features are extracted from the pre-processed data. Then, the feature selection process is performed with a Levy search updated rainfall (LURF) optimisation approach. This optimisation scheme decreases the dimensionality of the features by integrating Levy’s flight and rainfall optimisation. Finally, the hybrid deep dual-stage bidirectional long short-term memory (Hybrid LURF) framework effectively classifies the data as normal or abnormal. This model efficiently addresses the issues of insufficient long-term dependency in GC prediction and also enhances the classification performance. The validation of the proposed approach is examined with various existing schemes and achieved better accuracy (98.5%), specificity (97%), sensitivity (96.5%), F1-score (93%), detection rate (98.4%) and ROC curve. Further, the accuracy is 0.06% better than multi-layer ANN and 10% better than SVM-polynomial and KNN models.},

  abstract     = {In recent times, EEG-based emotion recognition has gained significant attention in affective computing. One of the major challenges in designing an efficient EEG-based emotion-recognition framework lies in handling the high dimensionality of the data recorded from a large number of EEG electrodes. This paper develops a hybrid sequential forward channel selection (HSFCSER) based emotion-recognition method, which aims to identify the most relevant subset of EEG channels and thus reduces the dimensionality of data. In HSFCSER, the Fisher score is used as the filter method, and the wrapper method includes Support Vector Machine (SVM). Wavelet-based features are extracted from the selected optimal EEG channels, followed by the feature selection using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated on the DEAP database. The methodology identifies 1) two classes of emotions viz. Low/High Valence with an average accuracy of 91.25 ± 5.48% for subject-dependent and 89.38 ± 4.76% for subject-independent, and Low/High Arousal with an average accuracy of 89.92 ± 5.81% for subject-dependent and 86.32 ± 5.34% for subject-independent, and 2) four classes of emotions viz. High Valence-Low Arousal (HVLA), High Valence-High Arousal, Low Valence-Low Arousal, and Low Valence-High Arousal with 75.94 ± 11.07% for subject-dependent and 73.13 ± 8.17% for subject-independent. The efficient electrode positions for emotion recognition are also depicted. The reported results are better compared to the existing results in the literature.
