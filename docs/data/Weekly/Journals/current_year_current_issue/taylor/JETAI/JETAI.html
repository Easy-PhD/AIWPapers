  abstract     = {The intricacy of the underwater setting makes it difficult for optical lenses to capture clear underwater photos without haze and colour distortion. Some studies use domain adaptation and transfer learning to address this issue, they aim to reduce the latent mismatch between composition and real-world data, making the space of latent data difficult to read and impractical to control. The background light is a crucial component of the decaying paradigm that directly impacts how well images are enhanced. Thus, to improve the quality of the images over the underwater, new deep-learning techniques are being designed in this paper. Here, the Adaptive Trans-ResUnet++ with Attention Mechanism-based model performs the real-time underwater image enhancement process. In addition, a novel Random Enhanced Artificial Gorilla Troops Optimizer algorithm model is used for optimising the parameters over the given model to further enhance the given model’s performance. A diverse quantitative and qualitative validation is also carried out to learn the enhancement of underwater image quality. The enhanced underwater image may be also useful in the underwater object detection process. Thus, the enhanced images obtained from the developed model are compared with the existing techniques to confirm the efficacy of the suggested underwater image enhancement process.},

  abstract     = {Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) plays a significant role in identifying the similarity of images with large datasets. It is identified based on the size, colour, and texture features of the image. But in such conditions, it is complex to determine the features of query images in large datasets and does not show accurate similarity when compared with every image in the retrieval process. In order to perform an efficient similarity of images, a novel Machine Learning (ML) approach Kernelized Radial Basis Auto-Encoder Function Neural Network (Ker_RadBAEFNN) technique is proposed that performs the individual image classification in the retrieval process. Moreover, the neural networks are optimised based on the reinforcement process and perform the extraction process regarding individual images. Further,reinforcement-based optimisation estimates the images in neural networks for undertaking an automatic feature extraction of query images. The performance of the classification process is validated based on MNIST, METU, and COCO datasets that determined the efficiency of the recognition and classification process of image retrieval. The experimental analysis is carried out based on various measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, and MAPE for the proposed and existing GLCM-ABC, PSO-ANN, IRB-CNN, FAGWO, and OCAM methods. The analysis shows that the performance of the proposed attained better effectiveness with attained accuracy by 98% and diminished for state-of-the-art techniques as 92%, 95%, 94%, 96.8%, as well as 96%, respectively. Compared to existing methods, the accuracy rate of the proposed method is maximised by 1.3%.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection plays an essential role in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly in the context of large-scale datasets where the dimensionality of features presents significant challenges. This research presents a novel approach to feature selection, a critical aspect of enhancing machine learning model efficiency, particularly in the context of large-scale datasets. By integrating the Flamingo Search Algorithm (FSA), Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III), and Regularised Extreme Learning Machine (RELM), the proposed method addresses limitations in existing feature selection and multi-objective optimisation algorithms. Leveraging FSA’s emulation of flamingo behaviours, the approach achieves a balance between global exploration and local exploitation, mitigating issues like premature convergence and local optima. Integration with NSGA-III enhances multi-objective optimisation capabilities, maintaining a delicate equilibrium between convergence and diversity. FSA-RELM is employed for accurate feature assessment, given its rapid learning and suitability for large datasets with multiple labels. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the proposed method’s superiority in feature selection accuracy, classification performance, and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches. This research contributes to advancing feature selection methodologies, offering a comprehensive solution for high-dimensional datasets in machine learning and data mining applications.},

  abstract     = {The performance in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scenarios has usually been analysed in homogeneous teams with a few choices for the sociality regime (selfish, egalitarian, or altruistic). In this paper we analyse both homogeneous and heterogeneous teams in a variation of sociality regimes in the predator-prey game, using a novel normalisation of the weights so that the sum of all rewards is independent of the sociality regime. We find that the selfish regime is advantageous for both predator and prey teams, and for both homogeneous and heterogeneous teams. In particular, rewards are about 100% higher for the predator team when switching from the egalitarian to selfish regime and more than 400% higher from the altruistic regime. For the prey, the increase is around 40% and 100% respectively. The results are similar for homogeneous and heterogeneous situations. The takeaway message is that any study of homogeneous and heterogeneous cooperative-competitive multi-agent reinforcement learning teams should also take into account the sociality regimes before making conclusions on the preference of any algorithm.},

It suggests only the short way and doesn’t include any safety information, such as crime awareness, road availability. This paper describes an inventive ideology to discover the safest route with minimal risk score for security of the road travellers. Hence, a new safety route navigation mechanism is developed to solve the challenges in the traditional route discovery approaches using deep learning. In the developed route discovery mechanism, the examination of the safest roads is done by the developed deep learning network, where the network is trained with the inputs obtained from the roads, such as road surface conditions, Road users, weather conditions, traffic conditions, accidental cases, and crime areas. The availability of the safest route will be determined by the ‘Long Short-Term Memory with Attention Mechanism’ (LSTM-AM). The route discovery is done with the help of a developed ‘Fitness-based Golden Tortoise Beetle Optimizer’ (FGTBO) with multi-objective constraints like distance, time, and road availability. The implementation outcome of the developed route discovery scheme will be validated with the traditional route discovery approaches concerning various measures.},

The proposed architecture addresses this challenge by incorporating auto-metric graph neural network with Archimedes optimisation algorithm is proposed in this paper for Health Care Monitoring in IoT-based Context-Aware Architecture (ANGNN-AOA-IoT-CA). The proposed work contains four phases: IoT phase, data preprocessing phase, context-aware phase and decision-making phase. In internet of things (IoT) phase, the sensor nodes are used for identifying the health status. Then, the amassed data are stored in storage layer. Hence, in the data preprocessing phase, the data redundancy, recurrence/repetition data are deleted. In context-aware phase, the preprocessed information is presented in the cloud and fog layer. As a result, the context-aware phase minimises the search space activities. In decision-making phase, the data are extracted and given to the ANGNN for classifying as normal and critical condition. Then Archimedes optimisation algorithm is utilised to acquire the better solution. The acquired outcomes of the proposed technique are analysed with existing models. Finally, the proposed method attains 2.37%, 2.95% and 1.17% higher accuracy, 1.09%, 1.47% and 1.53% higher sensitivity, 1.17%, 0.73% and 1.22% higher specificity compared with existing methods.},

Efficient performance prediction can significantly improve instructional effectiveness, facilitate personalised learning, and identify at-risk students. While researchers have analysed the complex relationships between students’ daily behaviours and their academic performance, most studies focus solely on individual student models and disregard potential relationships among students. To address these issues, we propose an improved multi-view hypergraph neural network (IMHNN). IMHNN employs hypergraphs to establish high-order relationships between student behaviours and introduces an attentional convolutional network to adaptively obtain weights for different behaviours. Additionally, a residual network is introduced to mitigate transition smoothing and improve the generalisation performance of the model. Using a genuine education dataset, we compare the performance of various approaches, demonstrating that our method outperforms other existing methods.},

Classification and segregation of solid waste prior to reuse, recycle or recover is an important step towards sustainable waste management. Traditional manual sorting of solid waste is a labour-intensive process that may pose health risks to the workers. Currently, automated classification of solid waste using machine learning techniques is widely applied. This study aims to develop an automated waste classification model by testing traditional and deep machine learning models. To achieve that, both open and generated datasets were used in the model training and testing. The study results showed relatively low prediction capability of the traditional machine learning models like Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as compared to the deep machine learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The testing of the three models on a combined data set of Trashnet with local garbage data set resulted in accuracy of 62.5% for SVM, 72.0% for RF and 92.7% for CNN. JONET deep learning model has been developed using a combination of pre-trained base model (DenseNet 201) with a new architicture that contains a fully connected layer in the classification stage with 1024 neurons. The model is capable to identify six classes of solid waste items with various accuracies. When tested on the Trashnet dataset, the accuracy was 96.06%, while testing on the local garbage dataset gave an accuracy of 94.40%. JONET has been tested also on multi object images which gave an acceptable prediction accuracy.},

The early rule-based systems using handcrafted expertise gave way to statistical learning techniques and neural networks trained on large datasets. Milestones like AlexNet and AlphaGo established deep learning as a dominant AI approach. Transfer learning enabled models pre-trained on diverse corpora to excel at specialised downstream tasks. The scope of AI expanded from niche applications like playing chess to multifaceted capabilities in computer vision, natural language processing and dialogue agents. However, current AI still needs to catch up to human intelligence in aspects like reasoning, creativity, and empathy. Addressing limitations around real-world knowledge, biases, and transparency remains vital for further progress and aligning AI with human values.
