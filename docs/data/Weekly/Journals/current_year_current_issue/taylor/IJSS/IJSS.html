  abstract     = {This paper investigates the difference flatness of discrete-time linear time-delay systems (TDSs). Initially, by employing matrix augmentation techniques and model reduction methods, the discrete-time linear TDSs can be transformed into the discrete-time linear delay-free systems while preserving controllability equivalence. Subsequently, a coprime factorisation approach for the transfer function matrix of discrete-time linear delay-free systems is utilised to construct the flat output of the discrete-time linear TDSs. Based on this, the discrete-time linear TDSs can be equivalently transformed into the discrete-time fully actuated system (FAS) with the constructed flat output as the generalised state, and the pole assignment problem of discrete-time TDSs can be directly addressed. Numerical examples demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Due to the strong coupling and nonlinearity in dynamics, launchers often employ separate designs for guidance loop trajectory planning and attitude loop tracking control. While this simplified approach reduces problem complexity, it neglects the interaction between guidance and attitude control. In this paper, an integrated control design for orbit injection of launchers is proposed using a fully-actuated system approach, which offers interpretability and high flexibility for nonlinear systems. First, a refined time-varying model of the launcher is established, accounting for mass property variations caused by propellant consumption. Next, both guidance and attitude closed-loop error dynamics are parameterised through the fully-actuated system approach. Furthermore, the Lyapunov stability of the integrated closed-loop system is demonstrated by explicitly considering the influence of attitude tracking error on control force generation. Additionally, a constraint-compatible online optimisation scheme for feedback controller gains is proposed to adaptively meet multiple desired performance indicators as the system state evolves. Finally, a numerical simulation of orbit injection of a launcher is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

Advanced control strategies are required to overcome these challenges and effectively execute desired maneuvers. This paper investigates the position and yaw tracking control of a 6-DOF quadrotor under practical disturbances. A high-order fully actuated (HOFA) approach is applied to reformulate the quadrotor model into three HOFA subsystems, which introduce high-order derivative terms of inputs, system states, and disturbances. To observe high-order terms and reject disturbances for control design, extended state observers (ESOs) are designed for the HOFA systems. The convergence of these ESOs is rigorously established using the Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation and experimental results are demonstrated to validate the effectiveness of the HOFA control design based on ESOs for quadrotors with practical disturbances, such as wind disturbances, aerodynamic drag, and ground effects.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the collision-free formation control issue is investigated for a group of omnidirectional mobile robots with uncertain dynamics and external disturbances. To address this, a fully actuated behavioural control scheme is proposed by integrating the fully actuated system theory into the null-space-based behavioural control method. First, three distributed formation behaviours are developed by transforming the behavioural functions into a fully actuated configuration. Then, the asymptotic stability of these three behaviours and their null-space-based projection fusion are established using Lyapunov theory. Furthermore, a fully actuated sliding mode controller is designed for the over-actuated omnidirectional mobile robots to ensure asymptotic convergence at the dynamic level, thereby enabling the precise tracking of desired kinematic commands in the task space under model uncertainty. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable, revealing the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

  abstract     = {With the development of technology, finite impulse response(FIR) is widely used in signal processing, communication and other fields, so it is of great significance to study its parameter identification problem. In the communication process of FIR systems, denial-of-service(DoS) attacks cause data packet loss, and the introduction of event-driven communication mechanism can reduce the sensitivity of the system to DoS attacks, however, the coupling of the two increases the difficulty of parameter identification. In this paper, we explore the problem of FIR parameter identification in the presence of DoS attacks and event-driven communication from the perspective of the defense side. Initially, the inadequacy of the original identification algorithm in estimating parameters during attacks is acknowledged. Compared to the original algorithm, the improved algorithm incorporates parameters of a model based on DoS attacks and analyzes its convergence performance. Subsequently, the trace of the asymptotic normal variance matrix of the improved identification algorithm is utilised as a metric to gauge the attack's effectiveness, leading to the design of an optimal attack strategy. Building upon the enhanced identification algorithm, adjustments are made to the event-driven mechanism, and an adaptive identification algorithm is formulated. The convergence performance of this algorithm is analysed, followed by the calculation of a communication rate aimed at optimisation based on selected indicators. Lastly, the paper concludes with an examination of the correctness and validity of the findings through numerical simulation.},

The proposed strategy is crafted to tackle the control difficulties of robotic manipulators under the limitations of joint angles and angular velocities. By leveraging a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) to offset the inaccuracies in the manipulator’s dynamic modelling, a FAS model with RBFNN is constructed. Based on this, the FAS approach is utilised to formulate the nominal controller, which can efficiently manage the nonlinear and coupled dynamics of the system. To deal with the disparities between the learning model and the actual system dynamics, the robust MPC is incorporated. This also ensures compliance with operating limits and improves the accuracy of the tracking control. Moreover, the iterative feasibility and stability analysis are completed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations with the Franka robotic numerical model.},

The H ∞ consensus problem is tackled for both undirected and directed communication graphs using the Kronecker product, inequality techniques, and the bounded real lemma. Linear matrix inequalities are employed to derive the design parameters for the control protocols. Additionally, a multi-spacecraft attitude model based on high-order fully actuated systems is proposed.
