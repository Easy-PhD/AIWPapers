  abstract     = {A distributed data-driven algorithm is proposed for market clearing within a community-based energy market. The objective is to maximise social welfare in energy trading. Each participant in the market, known as a prosumer, employs an extremum-seeking control (ESC) algorithm within a consensus-based architecture based on simple third-order dynamics. The proposed method circumvents the need for a central coordinator in the market clearing process. Furthermore, prosumers do not require analytical and exact formulations of cost or utility functions. They are required to transmit only a single local decision variable to the neighbours through an undirected connected graph. Under the assumption that prosumers have strongly convex local objective functions, the proposed algorithm demonstrates semi-global practical asymptotic (SPA) convergence to the optimal solution. This convergence is established using averaging theory. Simulation results validate the effectiveness, scalability, and robustness of the proposed distributed strategy.},

Firstly, to lower the complexity of the algorithm, we transform the studied strict-feedback nonlinear system into the fully actuated system form via state transformation. Then, radial basis function neural networks and adaptive estimation strategies are introduced to deal with unknown nonlinear functions and actuator fault parameters, which improves the fault tolerance of the system. Then, with the purpose of reducing the control cost, this paper adds the control method of handling event-triggered inputs to the control strategy.

The performance constraint is solved by means of the barrier Lyapunov function transformation of merging errors, and the initial transformation limitation is thoroughly removed due to the use of tuning function. Then by employing a neural network to approximate the unknown vehicle dynamics, we derive both distance and angle merging controllers satisfying prescribed performance, and a set of bound estimation schemes is involved to deal with the effect of actuator faults. On the basis of Lyapunov stability analysis, it is proved that our controller is capable of guaranteeing the boundedness of all vehicles states.

The characteristic function of output process is represented from the terms of its residual characteristic function. An explicit formula to compute the Rényi entropy for the output process of the MCARMA system is derived. In addition, we investigate the covariance matrix to find the upper bound of Rényi entropy. We present three simulations that serve to illustrate the behaviour of information in the MCARMA system, where the control and noise follow the Gaussian, Cauchy and Laplace distributions. Finally, the behaviour of Rényi entropy is illustrated in two real-world applications: a paper-making process and an electric circuit system.},

To effectively counteract the external disturbances and guide the states of all agents toward an optimal consensus point, the controller is designed based on gradient descent and the internal model principle. Furthermore, with Lyapunov stability theory, the designed controller can be proved to achieve asymptotic stability without time-varying parameters and the Zeno-behaviour is effectively excluded.

  abstract     = {The study of conformable fractional-order systems has gained significant importance due to their ability to model complex dynamic behaviors across various applications. However, these systems encounter several challenges, such as the unique properties of conformable derivatives, the presence of nonlinear perturbations, and time-varying delays, all of which complicate stability and control design. Additionally, traditional control approaches often struggle to balance stability, performance, and efficient resource utilization, particularly when addressing event-triggered mechanism that are prone to Zeno behavior. This paper tackles these challenges by proposing a novel event-triggered control framework to solve the guaranteed cost control problem for delayed conformable fractional-order systems with nonlinear perturbations. By utilizing the Razumikhin stability theorem and conformable fractional calculus, we derive sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for the existence of guaranteed cost state-feedback control. A key contribution of this work is the development of a criterion to eliminate Zeno behavior, ensuring the practical implementation of the event-triggered control strategy. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through two simulation examples: a conformable fractional-order neural network and an electrical circuit model.},

Second, stochastic sampling control is employed for singular systems with time-varying delay using the Bernoulli distribution technique, rather than the deterministic sampling used by existing works.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a switching anti-windup design for linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems with asymmetric input constraint. Firstly, the input space of the LTI plant is divided into several regions based on the sign of each control input. In each of these regions, the original asymmetric saturation function can be equivalently written as a symmetric one. Then, we design a separate anti-windup gain for each region and implement it when the value of the input signal falls into this region. The online switching between different anti-windup gains enables the full utilisation of the available range of control action on both sides of the saturation limits, which is something that the classical single gain anti-windup design cannot achieve. By incorporating the special properties of asymmetric saturation constraints, a multiple Lyapunov function is constructed for closed-loop stability and performance analysis. This can significantly reduce the conservatism of the resulting stability and performance synthesis conditions. Finally, numerical simulation and aero-engine hardware-in-loop testing demonstrate that, the proposed design has the ability to obtain a significantly larger domain of attraction and an improved control performance than the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {This research focuses on designing a resilient active disturbance rejection hybrid-triggered control scheme for mode-dependent parabolic-type nonlinear PDE systems when subjected to gain fluctuations and multiple disturbances. Specifically, matched disturbances are precisely estimated by using a disturbance observer, while the H ∞ control strategy mitigates the effects of mismatched disturbances. Further, to alleviate network communication transmission and conserve network resources, the hybrid-triggered technique has been implemented, which encompasses both time-triggered and event-triggered approaches. Here, the switching behaviour within the hybrid mechanism is governed by Bernoulli distributions. From thereon, the resilient hybrid-triggered active disturbance rejection controller is developed to achieve the intended disturbance rejection and stabilisation of the considered system. Therein, the gain fluctuations in both controller and disturbance observer gain matrices are factored, thereby improving resiliency. Afterward, through picking mode-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional candidates, sufficient requirements are obtained in the setting of linear matrix inequalities to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the assayed system. Ultimately, the proposed control method effectiveness is exemplified through the presentation of two numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a continuous predefined-time sliding mode control (CPTSMC) strategy for second-order nonlinear systems subject to full-channel disturbances. A predefined-time extended state observer (PTESO) is derived to estimate both the unknown system states and disturbances, with the upper bound for the settling time (UBST) precisely defined by one design parameter in a less conservative manner than those of finite-time or fixed-time ESOs. Furthermore, the peak observation errors are small during the transient process. Then, using the estimates, a CPTSMC law is designed for the chattering-alleviated predefined-time convergence of system states. The internal mechanism of parameter tuning for improving transient performance is theoretically explored. In addition to proving that the UBST of the whole system is precisely defined by one design parameter, we show the continuity of CPTSMC and the boundedness of all system signals that are vital for practical applications. Ultimately, the proposed approach is applied to a DC servo motor to demonstrate its efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The modeling of complex systems poses a great challenge due to the multitude of unknowns and complexity involved. Meanwhile, the piecewise linear (PWL) model has been proven to have the ability to approximate complex nonlinear systems. The construction of a PWL model entail to partitioning the state space into finite regions, and estimating the parameters of each subsystem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to accomplish these two tasks via an intelligent Voronoi partition approach and solving a series of optimization problems. Firstly, we estimate the certain range of the subsystem parameters of one region directly from noisy data. This estimation is fulfilled by set operation between noise zonotope and the input-state data set, the optimal subsystem parameters are obtained by minimizing the noise zonotope. Secondly, this procedure is applied to all regions, a cost function is designed based on these noise zonotopes, by changing the partition, the cost function varies. Finally, an annealing simulation (SA) algorithm is utilized to search for the most adequate partition to ensure the fitting accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical example and on experimental data from an actual water supply system.},
