  abstract     = {This study presents a machine learning approach to predict Container-on-Barge (COB) volume in Inland Waterway Transportation (IWT) systems, focusing exclusively on using economic features as predictors. Five machine learning models were trained using European economic features to forecast COB volume, while historical COB volume was used solely for validation and hyperparameter tuning. Among these models, the convolutional neural network combined with long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) exhibited superior performance, achieving a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.08% when forecasting eight consecutive quarters of COB volume in Europe. The results demonstrate the feasibility of accurately forecasting COB volume using economic features. This research develops an alternative method to forecast COB volume and provides a foundation for developing transfer learning models to predict COB volume in other emerging markets where historical COB volume data is limited. The findings are expected to assist in strategic planning and infrastructure investment for efficient and sustainable COB IWT systems.},

  abstract     = {The digitization of electrical diagrams plays a crucial role in modern construction industries, enabling efficient reuse, seamless distribution, and accurate archiving. Despite technological advances, many of these diagrams remain in undigitized formats, leading to labor-intensive manual analysis for tasks such as cost estimation and wiring design. These challenges are aggravated by the diversity of symbols, high inter-class similarities, and the inherent complexities of wiring layouts, which require advanced recognition and efficient wiring design. This paper presents a deep learning framework that integrates an attention mechanism for symbol recognition, followed by a graph-based algorithm for fully automated wiring design. Through comparative evaluation, Efficient Channel Attention emerged as the most effective attention module, improving the mean average precision by 3.2%. The wiring algorithm leverages an improved pathfinding approach that reduces bends and total wiring length by 43% while adhering to boundary constraints and electrical rules. Extensive experiments on proprietary and public datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the recognition of complex electrical symbols, outperforming the baseline model. This research sets a new benchmark for automating electrical diagram analysis, offering substantial cost savings while reducing the manual effort associated with large-scale construction projects.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of data demands robust security mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access, making ML-based intrusion detection systems essential. However, high-dimensional data necessitates the need for effective feature selection. This study proposes the Two-Phase Feature Selection framework for Intrusion Detection (2P-FSID) to enhance model performance and interpretability. In Phase 1, a filter-based approach is employed to select a relevant subset of features, yielding an initial subset S1. These features are further assessed using Mutual Information (MI), Correlation (Corr), and Feature Importance (FI) as part of the Feature Relevance Estimation (FRE) process. A hybrid pruning strategy, comprising dynamic pruning and static pruning, is employed to refine the subset into S3. In Phase 2, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values are computed to quantify each feature’s influence on classification performance. Features are categorized into either positively or negatively influential. The model is initially trained using positively influential features, and then negatively influential features are iteratively added and evaluated for potential performance improvement, resulting in the final optimized subset S4. Experimental results on the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets demonstrate a reduction in feature space from 41 to 19 and 44 to 17 features, respectively, while achieving high detection accuracies of 95.18% and 92.79%.},

Although graph neural networks have been shown to be effective in capturing variable-variable relationships (i.e. relationships between two variables), they are hard to capture variable-group relationships (i.e. relationships between variables and groups of variables). To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method called DHG-AD for multivariate time series anomaly detection. DHG-AD employs directed hypergraphs to model variable-group relationships within multivariate time series. For each time window, DHG-AD constructs two different directed hypergraphs to represent relationships between variables and groups of positively and negatively correlated variables, enabling the model to capture both types of relationships effectively. The directed hypergraph neural networks learn node representations from these hypergraphs, allowing comprehensive multivariate interaction modeling for anomaly detection. We show through experiments using various evaluation metrics that our proposed method achieves the best scores among the compared methods on two real-world datasets.},

Undetected software issues can degrade performance, jeopardize safety, and result in expensive downtimes. Incorporating collaborative robots into daily life and industrial settings requires strong and dependable systems, especially concerning software. While most anomaly detection research has focused on hardware anomalies, this study addresses the underexplored challenge of software anomaly detection in component-based robotic systems. Leveraging a publicly available dataset with labeled software-induced anomalies, six one-class classification techniques were evaluated: Approximate Convex Hull, Autoencoder Neural Networks, K-Means, K-Nearest Neighbors, Principal Component Analysis, and Support Vector Data Description. Each classifier was assessed across preprocessing methods and hyperparameter configurations, using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as the primary performance metric. The results show that Principal Component Analysis outperforms other methods in most scenarios, although the optimal performance varies depending on the anomaly type. The results confirm that the suggested one-class classification method is an efficient means of early identification of software anomalies in robotic systems, potentially improving operational reliability and reducing downtime.},

Traditional attack models inadequately represent VCN dynamics, weakening threat detection, while existing datasets lack real-world mobility and spatiotemporal details. This study addresses these gaps by developing a comprehensive attack simulation framework, enhancing critical network attacks i.e. position spoofing, Sybil, and wormhole through realistic mobility patterns, positional dynamics, and temporal interactions. The resulting dataset contains legitimate and malicious instances: Spoofing (45,975 legitimate, 589 malicious), Wormhole (52,237 legitimate, 5,219 malicious), and Sybil (14,829 legitimate, 1,753 malicious). It includes essential vehicular-specific features such as mobility dynamics, inter-vehicle distances, and end-to-end communication patterns. For validation, machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression were employed. Detection performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and two F1-score variants (standard and macro). Results indicate high detection efficacy, with Random Forest achieving accuracy between 93.6% and 99.8% and F1-macro scores from 88.5% to 97.7%. Compared to previous studies lacking spatiotemporal considerations, our dataset’s enhanced realism demonstrates significant potential in advancing data-driven anomaly detection and real-world threat mitigation in dynamic vehicular environments.},

Objectives – We examine how model architecture (BERT versus RoBERTa) and advanced strategies influence accuracy, precision, and recall on the multi – source MCFEND corpus. Building on large language models (LLMs) like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) provides a promising avenue for addressing this challenge. This study presents a novel approach to specifically detecting Chinese misinformation using fine-tuned BERT models, incorporating techniques such as Contextual Unit Obscuration, Multi-span Concealment, and Adaptive Concealment. These methods enhance the models’ ability to capture linguistic nuances and contextual cues specific to Chinese text. Our BERT-based and RoBERTa-based fine-tuned models demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional fine-tuning methods and other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an accuracy of 83.1% —surpassing state-of-the-art approaches – and achieve notable precision and recall scores over 0.73, marks a significant improvement over many existing detection frameworks. This research supports global efforts to combat misinformation by providing a robust framework across linguistic and cultural contexts. Integrating these models with media literacy and policy initiatives is vital to enhancing digital platform integrity, building a resilient information ecosystem, and promoting informed public discourse.},

This study addresses these challenges by developing and evaluating an automated pipeline for emergency medical documentation in German. The research objectives include (1) generating synthetic dialogues with known ground truth data to create controlled datasets for evaluating NLP performance and (2) designing an innovative pipeline to retrieve essential clinical information from these dialogues. A subset of 100 anonymized patient records from the MIMIC-IV-ED dataset was selected, ensuring diversity in demographics, chief complaints, and conditions. A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system extracted key nominal and numerical features using chunking, embedding, and dynamic prompts. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, F1-score, and sentiment analysis. Initial results demonstrated high extraction accuracy, particularly in medication data (F1-scores: 86.21%–100%), though performance declined in nuanced clinical language, requiring further refinement for real-world emergency settings.},

  abstract     = {Dense objects detection in remote sensing is challenging due to similar neighboring features, causing redundant boxes and positioning errors. To address this, we propose MSFE-Net, a multi-scale feature enhancement network designed to effectively suppress background interference and detect adjacent similar targets. Our Cascading Feature Fusion Module (CFFM) and Weighted Dilated Convolutional Pyramid (WDCP) enhance shallow texture and deep semantic features, respectively. To further reduce redundant target boxes, the Weighted Feature Fusion Enhancement Module (WFFEM) learns differential and fused features across multiple branches, thereby enriching target contextual features and suppressing background noise. Ultimately, the Multi-scale Feature Stairstep-upsampling Fusion Module (MFSFM) refines high-resolution texture and semantic features for targets across scales, using a stairstep-upsampling fusion strategy with outputs from the CFFM, WDCP, and WFFEM. Experimental results on the NWPU VHR-10 dataset show that MSFE-Net achieves 92.8% in mAP50 and 62.6% in mAP75, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as YOLOv6 and YOLOv7. Compared to other models, MSFE-Net balances between parameter counts and computational demand, with Params slightly higher than YOLOv5s and YOLOv7-tiny and GFLOPs in a moderately high range. These results underscore MSFE-Net’s efficacy in balancing accuracy with computational demands, rendering it a highly practical option for dense object detection in remote sensing.},

  abstract     = {The popularity of Deep Learning (DL) methods used in business process management research and practice is constantly increasing. One important factor that hinders the adoption of DL in certain areas is the availability of sufficiently large training datasets, particularly affecting domains where process models are mainly defined manually with a high knowledge-acquisition effort. In this paper, we examine process model augmentation in combination with semi-supervised transfer learning to enlarge existing datasets and train DL models effectively. The use case of similarity learning between manufacturing process models is discussed. Based on a literature study of existing augmentation techniques, a concept is presented with different categories of augmentation from knowledge-light approaches to knowledge-intensive ones, e. g. based on automated planning. Specifically, the impacts of augmentation approaches on the syntactic and semantic correctness of the augmented process models are considered. The concept also proposes a semi-supervised transfer learning approach to integrate augmented and non-augmented process model datasets in a two-phased training procedure. The experimental evaluation investigates augmented process model datasets regarding their quality for model training in the context of similarity learning between manufacturing process models. The results indicate a large potential with a reduction of the prediction error of up to 53%.},

  abstract     = {Bike-sharing systems (BSSs) have recently become important in urban transportation due to several factors, such as their cost-effectiveness and environmental considerations. The BSS provides an enormous amount of data that is recorded regarding trips. This huge volume of bike sharing data raises various challenges and opportunities. Many research studies have used bike sharing datasets to understand the geographical, social, financial, and behavioral aspects of bike user behaviors. While existing literature primarily focuses on predicting the number of rentals and returns per station, this study addresses the complementary aspect of predicting the trip duration and distance of the trip. Accurate prediction of ride duration allows a better estimate of bike availability at stations, while distance predictions assist in maintenance planning based on bike usage patterns. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, the proposed work clusters the BSS dataset into k sub-datasets based on similarity of dataset instances. Then, the predictive model is trained to predict the data of each sub-dataset separately. Thus, there will be k models for the k sub-dataset. Next, the performance of the proposed method, the average score of the k models, will be compared to the performance of a model trained on the complete dataset on predicting BSSs ride duration and distance of the trip. The rationale for splitting the dataset into k sub-datasets is to separate similar patterns in one sub-dataset. Second, the utilization of the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm on the BSSs data was proposed for the clustering purpose, as the DTW usage is very limited in the current literature of BSSs. The dataset clustering is based on the similarity of the curves representing the number of trips between each pair of bike stations throughout the day hours. Then, the DTW algorithm is used to measure the curve similarity between these bike station pairs’ curves. These two contributions of the proposed approach complement existing prediction models for rentals and returns, providing a comprehensive solution for BSS optimization. The proposed method was thoroughly evaluated on two real datasets of different sizes. For the two datasets, the obtained results show that the best improvements of the predictive model’s accuracy are 30% and 42% on average for predicting trip duration and distance of the trip, respectively.},

A key feature of the proposed framework is the preprocessing of the trajectory data into triplets , a convenient data unit that captures the relevant context necessary for effective energ y prediction. The second contribution of the paper addresses the effective management of drastic change in context through robust energy prediction models. In particular, using few-shot learning techniques, we tackle the problem of the need to create different energy prediction models for different EV types, from small EVs to electric buses. Experimental results on three different data sets demonstrate how energy prediction models adapt to different EV types.},

  abstract     = {Downstream applications for point cloud registration, like LiDAR Odometry, often conduct Iterative Closest Points (ICP) in the initial frame-to-frame matching and/or subsequent map refinement. However, due to its distance-based processing nature, ICP relies on an accurate pose initialization while implicating increased computational complexity with a growing number of points. To meet specific runtime requirements, methods often apply the extensive mapping step at low frequencies, e.g. every 10 frames, which in turn leads to increased noise on the calculated trajectory. To tackle the discrepancy between runtime and accuracy, we present MagneticPillars++, an extension of our previous point cloud registration approach optimized for LiDAR Odometry, introducing novel intermediate cell correspondence filtering and accelerated match normalization. Furthermore, we propose a frame-to-keyframe matching technique replacing the simple frame-to-frame matching within a LiDAR Odometry pipeline. This can tremendously reduce noise without the need for expensive ICP corrections. We conduct extensive experiments for various tasks like point cloud registration, LiDAR Odometry, and loop closure estimation, demonstrating the versatility of our approach, where we are able to outperform state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and runtime, resulting in residual translation and rotation errors of up to 4.7 cm and 0.231 with an average runtime of.},

This study targets critical challenges, such as comprehensive aerial imagery coverage, tiny seedlings easily mistaken for weeds, and the absence of adaptive learning in traditional row classification. We propose a novel methodology for missing seedling detection, which comprises three essential stages: seedling localization, row classification, and missing region prediction. We present SeedNet, a detector that leverages row direction information to enhance small seedling detection performance. By incorporating this information, SeedNet improves recall by 25.3 % and AP by 15.4 % compared to the baseline. Additionally, we introduce PeakNet, a deep learning-based classifier for row segmentation that efficiently adapts to row spacing without any prior assumptions, achieving an accuracy of 99.69 % . Finally, missing areas are predicted by analyzing the relative distances between adjacent seedlings within the same row. Under challenging outdoor conditions, this method achieves a missing detection accuracy of 98 % , meeting practical requirements for field testing. SeedNet and PeakNet demonstrate exceptional performance in real-time processing, achieving inference speeds of 105 FPS and 2295 FPS, respectively. These results indicate strong potential for practical applications in real-time agricultural systems.

  abstract     = {The rise of social media has amplified online sharing, necessitating businesses to comprehend public sentiment. Traditional sentiment analysis struggles with sarcasm detection and class imbalance. To address this, we introduce Synthetic Ensemble Oversampling methods (SEO) that effectively leverage the strengths of various oversampling algorithms. By incorporating ensemble learning principles into oversampling techniques, our proposed methods offer distinct strategies for selecting newly generated sarcastic data. In this study, we employ five oversampling algorithms: Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE), Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN), polynom-fit-SMOTE, Proximity Weighted Synthetic Sampling (ProWSyn), and SMOTE with Instance Prioritization and Filtering (SMOTE_IPF). We work with two imbalanced sarcasm detection datasets, iSarcasmEval and SARC-reduced, collected from Twitter and Reddit. After extracting features from using Word2Vec, Global Vectors (GloVe), and FastText, we apply oversampling and ensemble techniques. Evaluated across six classifiers – Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and BERT – the results demonstrate that the SEO2 framework consistently enhances classifier performance compared to single oversampling techniques. Notably, the Cluster Uncentered method frequently provides the best improvements across datasets, achieving significant gains in both AUC and F1 scores. These findings highlight the potential of ensemble-based oversampling in addressing class imbalance for sarcasm detection.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of autonomous vehicles and mobile robotics, lidar has been one of the most popular researches in the world. But the poor ranging accuracy and detection range in the foggy situation have limited the application of lidar. In this paper, the detection of pulsed lidar in fog is investigated. The transmission model in the fog of the laser signal is established by considering laser backscattering in the fog. A Prior Waveform Guided Network (PWGN) based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed. The results of simulation and experiments show that the PWGN can effectively remove the interference of fog in the detection of pulsed laser signal. The mean of absolute errors(MAE) of the detection achieves 3.13 cm at the range of 10 m at the scattering rate of 30%. The MAE may be half or 1/3 of the MAEs of other approaches at the detection range of 42 m.},

  abstract     = {The increasing fragmentation of the consumer journey complicates understanding consumer behavior and tracking digital footprints. Product feature tags should dynamically adapt to consumer preferences, marketing campaigns, and trending internet topics, leveraging crawler technology to address this. However, many e-commerce platforms still rely on manual tagging or static product attribute classification, with limited adoption of machine learning approaches. This study proposes a dynamic tagging and recommendation system using deep learning for product image recognition and similarity comparison. By integrating crawler technology, internet trends can serve as dynamic product tags. These tags, combined with consumer behavior data, enable the creation of a recommendation system capable of automatically generating relevant tags. Sales data from 3,132 cartoon products on a Taiwanese e-commerce platform were analyzed. A convolutional neural network was employed to establish a tagging and image recognition model, and it was trialed over 24 weeks. Results showed significant improvements in consumer engagement: average clicks per product increased by 36.1%, views by 22.9%, products added to carts by 32.3%, orders by 28.3%, and payment transactions by 30.4%. Aligning recommendation systems with consumer expectations enhances their ability to identify preferences and drive purchasing behavior.},

Addressing these issues is essential for the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. This research establishes a comprehensive ethical framework that mitigates biases and promotes accountability in AI technologies. A comparative analysis of international AI policy frameworks from regions including the European Union, United States, and China is conducted using analytical tools such as Venn diagrams and Cartesian graphs. These tools allow for a visual and systematic evaluation of the ethical principles guiding AI development across different jurisdictions. The results reveal significant variations in how global regions prioritize transparency, fairness, and privacy, with challenges in creating a unified ethical standard. To address these challenges, we propose technical strategies, including fairness-aware algorithms, routine audits, and the establishment of diverse development teams to ensure ethical AI practices. This paper provides actionable recommendations for integrating ethical oversight into the AI lifecycle, advocating for the creation of AI systems that are both technically sophisticated and aligned with societal values.

  abstract     = {Utilizing self-supervised learning to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data can be a cost-effective strategy, particularly in medical domains where expert labeling incurs high costs. Contrastive learning typically employs a single contrastive relationship based on individual instances. However, depending on the task-related characteristics, such as facial skin images, this approach may be unsuitable for learning useful representations. In this work, we propose an advanced contrastive learning method to learn high-quality facial skin representations that are useful for various downstream applications related to skin disorders, such as wrinkles and pigmentation. Our method leverages metadata to establish effective multi-instance contrastive relationships specifically for facial skin images. To this end, we employ mini-batches, constructed through the integration of multiple contrastive relationships, to enable a model to learn the multifaceted features of facial skin. Using a facial skin image dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in classifying facial wrinkles and pigmentation severity compared to conventional contrastive learning. The features learned by the proposed method adapt well to other skin lesion datasets from different sources, demonstrating the transferability of the learned skin representations. Our study highlights the potential of application-specific batch configurations leveraging metadata to enhance the effectiveness of self-supervised learning.},

While sports like soccer, cricket have been the main focus of the video summarization research, little attention has been centered over racket sports. Our proposed dynamically hashed multimodal deep learning (DHMDL) sports video summarization framework fuses excitement scores by utilizing deep learning architectures to extract cues from multi modalities namely commentator voice, spectators’ cheers and player’s expression and then leverages to generate video segment as highlight by using hash codes mapped to weighted sum of excitement score. Also, the proposed synchronized parallel processing ranking based hash map framed using the merge sorting technique for categorizing the excitement scores is applied in video summarization. The framework is tested on U.S. Open and Wimbledon match videos and the results show superior results against state-of-art techniques with normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) score improved by 2%, positive matching highlight segment identification increased by 20% on YouTube Videos.},

To overcome the limitations of existing energy consumption forecasting methods, which inadequately consider the specific energy usage characteristics and user behaviors in parks and often perform poorly at predicting extreme values, this study proposes a hybrid energy consumption forecasting model combines Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Initially, SSA is used to extract the autocorrelation of the electricity consumption series and eliminate the mutual interference caused by component mixing. Then, fuzzy entropy values are utilized to differentiate the complexity of various components, reconstructing them into high-frequency and low-frequency components. These components are then predicted using a multi-factor LSTM model optimized by improved particle swarm optimization, with the results aggregated for the final forecast. The results indicate that the model’s root mean square error is only 12.116 kWh, which is lower compared to the LSTM multi-factor model, the EMD-LSTM model, and the SSA-LSTM model. The model shows a closer fit to the original series trend and more accurate predictions at extreme points, aligning more closely with actual values.},

Therefore, detecting and explaining anomalies in RTOs have become important. To accurately detect anomalies in RTOs, it is required to apply reconstruction-based anomaly detection (AD) models, which is currently proposed as a main AD research area. However, traditional explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) cannot explain reconstruction-based AD models to identify main facilities in RTOs. To address this problem, we developed a method to improve the accuracy of XAI in explaining reconstruction-based AD models. Specifically, we first grouped the variables based on correlation and the clustering analysis. We then calculated the impact of each group on normal/abnormal events in terms of the maximum mean discrepancy and cosine similarity. Using the most influencing variables based on our method, XAI correctly identified the main variables without considering unnecessary variables. Experimental results on a real-world RTO dataset showed that our method improve the accuracy of XAI that determine the main variables compared to the traditional XAI.},

This network combines the use of laser, infrared and millimeter wave modalities to leverage the advantages of each mode in different environments, increasing the network’s resilience to interference. The study begins with the construction of pixel-level fusion networks, feature-weighted fusion networks and the multimode mutual attention fusion network. A comprehensive introduction to the multimode mutual attention fusion network is given, as well as a comparison with the other two networks. The model is then trained and evaluated using data from glide rocket and drone experiments. Finally, an analysis of the anti-outlier interference capability of the multimode fusion network with mutual attention is carried out. The test results show that the multimode mutual attention fusion network containing a feature fusion attention mechanism has the highest detection performance and anti-interference ability. Without interference, the network achieves a remarkable accuracy of 0.98 for multi-target recognition. In addition, with an accuracy of 0.96, it ensures a high level of stability in various interference environments. In addition, the introduction of multi-scale fusion has improved the rocket’s speed adaptability by about 75%.},

These reviews not only reflect customer sentiments but also crucially influence other users’ purchasing decisions due to their public accessibility. The sheer volume and complexity of product reviews make manual sorting challenging, necessitating businesses to autonomously process and discern customer sentiments. Chinese, a predominant language on e-commerce platforms, presents unique challenges in sentiment analysis due to its character-based nature. This paper introduces an innovative Dual-Channel BiLSTM-CNN (DC-BiLSTM-CNN) algorithm. Based on the language characteristics of Chinese product reviews, a sentiment analysis algorithm, dual channel BiLSTM-CNN (DC-BiLSTM-CNN), is proposed. The algorithm constructs two channels, transforming text into both character and word vectors and inputting them into Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. The combination of these channels facilitates a more comprehensive feature extraction from reviews. Comparative analysis revealed that DC-BiLSTM-CNN significantly outperforms baseline models, substantially enhancing the classification of product reviews. We conclude that the proposed DC-BiLSTM-CNN algorithm offers an effective solution for handling Chinese product reviews, carrying positive implications for businesses seeking to enhance product and service quality, ultimately resulting in heightened user satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {One of the main challenges when drilling small and deep holes is the difficulty of chip evacuation. As the hole depth increases, chips tend to become tightly compressed, causing chip jamming. It leads to a rapid increase in cutting forces and strong random fluctuations. The discontinuous chip evacuation process makes the cutting force signal strongly nonlinear and random, making it difficult to predict accurately. In this paper, we have developed a two-layer artificial neural network (ANN) model for training using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to predict torque during deep drilling. Unlike many previous studies, this model uses hole depth as an input vector element instead of hole diameter. The model has been validated through experiments drilling AISI-304 stainless steel with hole depth-to-diameter ratios of 8 under continuous drilling conditions with ultrasonic-assisted vibration. The performance of the ANN model was compared with the exponential model and evaluated by the MAPE index. Results show that the ANN model has better predictive capability, the average MAPE value approximately four times smaller and higher reliability with a standard deviation approximately 3.5 times smaller than the exponential function model. This model can be further refined to predict torque for drilling deep holes for future studies.},

This study investigates ASI based on features derived from spectrogram images through a convolution neural network (CNN) with rectangular-shaped kernels. Traditionally, CNN employs square-shaped kernel and max-pooling operations at different layers, a design optimized to handle 2D data. Nevertheless, encoding of information differs slightly to deal with spectrograms. The frequency is displayed along the y-axis, and the x-axis presents the time of the audio. Amplitude is denoted by intensity within the spectrogram image at certain point. The main contributions of this study are 1: To analyze audio signals effectively using spectrograms, this study proposed the utilization of spectrogram features with different sizes and shapes of rectangular kernels to derive distinctive features by improving the recognition accuracy of the speaker identification system. 2. The extracted spectrogram-based features and models are evaluated on the ELSDSR, TSP, and LibriSpeech datasets and achieved the weighted accuracy of 96.0%, 99.2%, and 97.6%, respectively. 3.

The q -ROF-CRITIC assigns the priority weights of the attributes (i.e. comprehension and ergonomic principles), whereas the q -ROF-TOPSIS-Sort evaluates and classifies the compliance levels of road signs in view of a set of pre-defined categories, consequently bridging the limitations of the TOPSIS-Sort in handling imprecise evaluations. Demonstrated in an actual case study of evaluating 83 road signs in the Philippines, results show that prohibitive signs have the highest comprehension levels, while parking and stop signs, together with road obstacle signs, belong to the medium compliance level. Low-level compliance is observed for supplementary and intersection road signs due to unfamiliarity, while horizontal signs are ergonomically low on spatial and physical attributes. The proposed approach is supported by sensitivity analysis of q values and comparative assessments with other methods. The findings encourage further investigation into comprehensibility evaluations and open avenues for exploring the factors that influence road sign comprehension.},

Currently, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model is considered the state-of-the-art for STP. However, this model can be time-consuming and can only represent a single vessel track. To solve these challenges, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models have been applied to STP to allow scalability for large data sets and to capture larger regions or anomalous vessels behavior. This research proposes a new RNN architecture that decreases the prediction error up to 50% for cargo vessels when compared to the OU model. Results also confirm that the proposed Decimal Preservation layer can benefit other RNN architectures developed in the literature by reducing their prediction errors for complex data sets.},

  abstract     = {The rapid increase in Internet of Things (IoT) applications has exposed critical security vulnerabilities, particularly concerning user privacy and identity forgery. To address these concerns, Blockchain technology offers a promising solution by providing strong security and ensuring data integrity through its transparent ledger system. By leveraging blockchain, IoT systems can enhance their security protocols, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities and access sensitive data. We proposed Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) integrated with trust-based delegated consensus blockchain (TDCB) technology. The ABAC scheme employs Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) processes to encrypt attributes and access regulations, enabling analytical operations directly on encrypted data. Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks with Prioritized Experience Replay (D3P) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) collaborate with Multiple blockchain nodes to decode the ABAC system’s data and optimize the performances of the blockchain. Our proposed scheme ABAC-TDBC-D3P enhances throughput and security and reduces total computing costs. The simulation results demonstrate that the suggested ABAC-TDCB-D3P scheme has a percentage of 86% for Collusive Rumour Attack (CRA) and 91% for Naive Malicious Attack (NMA). Significant improvements in blockchain security, particularly in mitigating the impact of malicious nodes, were compared to previous schemes.},

Traditional machine learning approaches have limitations in handling the ever-increasing volume and complexity of data. This research explores quantum machine learning for fake news classification by proposing Pegasos Quantum Support Vector Machines, a novel algorithm combining Pegasos Support Vector Machines with quantum kernels, and advanced data encoding. Through experimentation on the IBM Qasm Simulator, Pegasos Quantum Support Vector Machines scored 90.67% in accuracy. This study is primarily focused on local simulation, where the proposed algorithm scored as high as 95.63%, with 95.44% precision, 99.52% recall, and 96.76% f1-score. The achieved results outperform other machine learning methods on the BUZZFEED dataset, including Quantum Neural Networks and Quantum K-Nearest Neighbors. Its successful implementation paves the way for further refinement of quantum machine learning techniques in fake news classification. The PegasosQSVM algorithm encounters, however, some implementation issues on real world Quantum Processing Units(QPU). Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era QPU are prone to noise effects that affect the computations negatively, and by extension, the results of quantum machine learning algorithms. Further implementation on real QPU and use of error mitigation techniques, are needed for optimal results on quantum hardware.},

However, there is a lack of comprehensive research on AI’s role and applications throughout the entire design process, and current papers often employ qualitative methods such as interviews and case studies. Therefore, this paper aims to quantitatively analyze experts’ views on AI’s utilization in the whole design process through text mining of literature. The researchers selected 126 papers through scientific databases such as ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and utilized the keyword matching method to extract the frequency of keywords for each stage of the design process – Research, Ideation, Mock-up, Production, and Evaluation. Through text mining, research findings indicate that AI is predominantly discussed in the later stages of design, particularly in the production process, while its use in the mock-up stage is perceived to be low. Additionally, distinct differences in AI use across design disciplines were identified: graphics focusing on ideation; UX on evaluation; and fashion on production.},

To this end, we thoroughly analyzed traffic crashes in Rome between 2016 and 2019, gathering data on vehicle attributes and environmental factors. Fourth predictive systems are employed to investigate the intricate problem of predicting the severity of injuries sustained in traffic crashes using different regression algorithms, such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks. Compared to comparable systems without feature selection, feature resampling, and optimization methods, the results demonstrate that employing optimized XGBoost along with grid search in conjunction with SelectKBest and SMOTE strategy has resulted in greater performance, with an 89% R2 score. Our findings provide insight into the requirement for accurate forecasting models in optimization and balanced approaches to enhancing traffic safety. These findings offer a viable way to improve traffic safety tactics.

Among them, MKSE uses an improved TF-IDF weight calculation method to extract keywords and applies virtual keywords to construct inverted indexes, making it difficult for malicious attackers to infer the index content easily. SEMSS uses the Apriori algorithm to mine the co-occurrence relationship between words and find the keyword set that meets the minimum support threshold to improve the recall rate of search results. Finally, the security of the scheme is verified from the aspects of semantic security, effici this paper designsency, data integrity, etc. The results showed that the data encryption time of MKSE and TRSE methods increased gradually with the increase in document collection storage. The index build time was increased as the document set grew. The accuracy of the improved TF-IDF method was 63.8%. The running time of Apriori decreased with the increase of minimum support. When the minimum support was 12.0%, the Apriori algorithm ran for 211 seconds. The MKSE method was more efficient than the TRSE method in searching documents by query keywords. When the document set size was 3000, the SEMSS method had a full search rate of 81.09%.

We evaluate our model on a super-resolution dataset and compare its performance against other networks, highlighting the importance of minimizing trainable parameters for real-time deployment on resource-constrained drone platforms. The effWicacy of our proposed network is further validated through image recognition tasks and real-world scenario testing.

By modeling multi-source devices through federated learning, the model parameters and reputation values of participating devices are stored on the blockchain. This method incorporates factors such as experience, familiarity, and timeliness to more quickly gather reliable information about nodes to assess their behavior. Simulation results on the MNIST dataset show that when the proportion of selfish nodes is below 50%, the convergence time increases with the proportion of selfish nodes. Compared to advanced algorithms, the proposed model saves approximately 6% of interaction time. As the number of transactions significantly increases, the system’s TPS (Transactions Per Second) decreases, with an average TPS of only 3079.35 when the maximum number of transactions is 4000.

Large-scale industrial systems generate an immense volume of logs, which are difficult to handle with human capabilities. Therefore, an automated method is essential for filtering vast amounts of data. System log anomaly detection is crucial in the security field for identifying system failures, sophisticated internal attacks, and other deviations from the norm. This research area requires further development, as most Deep Learning solutions in the literature are semi-supervised. This poses a significant limitation since these solutions are impractical for large-scale ecosystems due to the high cost of labeling data. This paper introduces a method that replaces the supervised phase of semi-supervised methods with fully unsupervised heuristics, utilizing the elbow method, interquartile range, and Simulated Annealing. The unsupervised results are comparable to the semi-supervised State of the Art while demonstrating greater applicability in real-world applications. This work proposes a more suitable benchmark for the log anomaly outlier detection problem, where the training data include both normal and abnormal sequences and precede the test sessions in time.

  abstract     = {This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating code for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) applications. We present the first direct comparison of ChatGPT 3.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the specific context of generating code for Human-Robot Interaction applications. Through a series of 20 carefully designed prompts, ranging from simple movement commands to complex object manipulation scenarios, we evaluate the models’ ability to generate accurate and context-aware code. Our findings reveal significant variations in performance, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieving a 95% success rate, Gemini 1.5 Pro at 60%, and ChatGPT 3.5 at 20%. The study highlights the rapid advancement in LLM capabilities for specialized programming tasks while also identifying persistent challenges in spatial reasoning and adherence to specific constraints. These results suggest promising applications for LLMs in robotics development and education while emphasizing the continued need for human oversight and specialized training in AI-assisted programming for HRI.},

(2025). Friend link prediction method based on heterogeneous multigraph and hierarchical attention. <em>AAI</em>, <em>39</em>(1), Article: 2427545. (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1080/08839514.2024.2427545'>www</a>)

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of location-based social network (LBSN), rich data comprising social behaviors and location information among users has emerged. Predicting potential friendships accurately from abundant information has become a pivotal research area. While graph neural network (GNN) have shown significant promise in prediction, existing approaches often fail to fully exploit the heterogeneous data characteristics in LBSN. Key challenges include inadequate modeling of the intricate relationships between users and points of interest (POI), overlooking the significance of spatial-temporal information in user trajectories, and underutilizing rich edge features. To address these challenges, we design a novel GRU-enhanced Heterogeneous Multigraph Attention Network (GEHMAN), which is a GNN model enhanced by GRU. We construct a heterogeneous multigraph to comprehensively capture user-POI relationships. We then employ a skip-gram model to embed POI nodes from user sub-trajectories and use RNN with GRU units to embed user nodes. GEHMAN utilize hierarchical attention mechanism to consolidate node information by aggregating diverse types of neighboring nodes and connecting edges. Experiments on six real city datasets show that compared with the best performance of six benchmark methods including LBSN2vec++, Metapath2vec and HAN, the average improvement percentages of GEHMAN in AUC, AP, and Top@K are 2.225%, 1.948%, and 6.353%, respectively.},
