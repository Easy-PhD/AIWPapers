  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel R-adaptive sigma point filter entitled variational Bayesian Gaussian sum cubature Kalman filter (VB-GSCKF) for joint estimation of harmonic amplitude, phase, and frequencies along with the noise parameters. Since Gaussian filters may not guarantee good estimates in real-time applications involving non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise, alternative techniques are required. The proposed algorithm contributes to this gap as it automatically tunes the noise covariance matrix using the variational Bayesian approach and its Gaussian sum framework effectively models the non-Gaussian noise. The proposed VB-GSCKF algorithm demonstrates its superiority over other competing adaptive Gaussian filters and new hybrid based estimation approach where the signal is first denoised using Deep Learning (DL) algorithms and then the estimation is done using GSCKF in the presence of non-Gaussian and non-stationary measurement noise. Finally, real harmonic data produced by a grid-connected inverter hardware configuration is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VB-GSCKF.},

  abstract     = {The benchmark consensus protocol is used by the most notable distributed algorithms for controlling multiagent systems through local interaction rules, where it yields to the well-known Laplacian matrix whose null space is fixed and is spanned by the vector of ones provided that the underlying graph is connected. Since this protocol is the key building block for a wide range of other existing distributed algorithms, its extensions are likewise based on this Laplacian matrix. However, the fixed nature of the null space of this Laplacian matrix limits the composition of complex (i.e. reconfigurable) cooperative behaviours for multiagent systems. Motivated by this standpoint, the contribution of this paper is threefold: (i) For undirected and connected graphs, we introduce a new Laplacian matrix, whose null space is spanned by a user-assigned vector composed of nonzero elements. We give its mathematical definition and show that it inherits key properties of the aforementioned well-known Laplacian matrix. (ii) We next present distributed control architectures for convergence to the desired null space as well as for convergence to a specific vector within that null space. (iii) We finally multiplex information networks to distributively control the null space of this new Laplacian matrix, where this is the most important contribution of this paper. We specifically show that the resulting null space can vary through local interaction rules as desired between the spans of two or more user-assigned vectors to pave the way for composing complex cooperative behaviours for multiagent systems.},

Furthermore, the use of continuous communication in traditional control systems can result in technical and financial challenges. This paper introduces a fixed-time dynamic event-triggered secondary control for islanded microgrids, designed to achieve frequency restoration, voltage regulation and active power sharing within a specified timeframe. This distributed control approach relies solely on information from each distributed generator(DG) and its neighbours. Each DG receives communication from its neighbours and concurrently broadcasts its own information only when certain deviation were reached, thereby minimising communication costs. Several simulated instances illustrate the usefulness and robustness of this control method, including scenarios involving load changes, time delay and topology switching.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the input-to-state stability (ISS) of switched systems with unstabilizable modes using an enhanced event-triggered control (ETC) scheme. Unlike the traditional results, the switched system with unstabilisable modes is explored and the fixed constraints on the trade-off are relaxed to be greater than the reciprocal of the average time of any given varying period. The interleaving of system switching and event-triggered behaviour causes asynchronous phenomena and additional triggers. To address the two disadvantages, an improved mode-dependent event-triggered with periodic sampling is put forward by the aid of a relative threshold function combined with an asynchronous associated jumping function. A global gain norm term is introduced to relax the existing relative threshold function, which increases the degree of freedom in designing event-triggered mechanism (ETM). By adding a compensation term to the controller design, asynchronous behaviour is addressed without strict assumptions. Based on the proposed ETM and the admissible edge-dependent average dwell time (AED-ADT) switching signal, an improved and less restrictive sufficient criterion has been formulated to ensure the ISS of the system. Finally, a booster converter example is used to show the applicability and another numerical example is used to testify the availability and the advantages of the derived conclusions.},

In the backstepping, multi-dimensional Taylor networks are employed to estimate the unknown nonlinearities and the command filter is used to overcome the problem of explosion of complexity. Subsequently, a novel adaptive updated law is created for co-designing the controller and the switching threshold-based ET mechanism by introducing the Nussbaum-type functions, which effectively handles the effects of the measurement errors due to the ET mechanism, and the challenges of controller design because of the presence of unknown control directions. The proposed control strategy can achieve that the closed-loop system is semi-global finite-time stable in probability, the system states are maintained in the predefined compact sets in a finite time and the system output tracking expectation signal is commendable while easing the communications burden.

Meanwhile, the command filters with a fractional-order error compensation system are introduced to solve the issue of differential explosion. Further, an adaptive mutation-sparrow search algorithm (AM-SSA) is constructed to optimise the controller parameters to improve the system's convergence speed and steady-state accuracy. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the system tracking error can converge to the zero region within a fixed time.

By utilising an extended digraph approach, the trajectories of a signed delayed network are recovered from its corresponding extended unsigned digraph. For higher-order integrator systems with fixed input or communication delay under continuous-time topology, the stability properties are investigated and the upper bounds are determined so that the systems achieve cluster consensus without any change in cluster members. Furthermore, we show that the discrete-time higher-order integrator systems with nonuniform delay reach cluster consensus and are stable under bounded delay provided that the undelayed system is stable. At the end, numerical examples are provided to illustrate theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we develop a spatial SEIAR-type epidemic model considering a quarantined population (denoted as Q), which we call the SQEIAR model. The dynamics of the SQEIAR model are described by six Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) that represent the changes in the susceptible, quarantined, exposed, asymptomatic, infected, and recovered populations. Our goal is to reduce the number of susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, and infected individuals while accounting for the environment, which plays a critical role in the spread of epidemics. We then propose a novel strategy for epidemic control, incorporating two key control measures: regional quarantine for the susceptible population and treatment for the infected. This approach serves as an alternative to widespread quarantine, minimising the economic, social, and other potential impacts. Additionally, we consider the possibility of reinfection among recovered individuals, a common occurrence in many diseases. To demonstrate the practical utility of our results, a numerical example centred on COVID-19 is presented.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies two-player nonzero-sum and zero-sum games within the context of stochastic noncausal systems (SNSs). These SNSs are transformed into subsystems consisting of forward and backward stochastic difference equations through an equivalent conversion. Subsequently, recurrence equations are introduced to convert stochastic two-player nonzero-sum games into deterministic difference equation solving problems. These recurrence equations are then utilised to derive the relevant equations needed to deduce the saddle-point equilibrium solutions for two-player zero-sum games embedded within linear and nonlinear SNSs. The resolution of these equations yields analytical expressions that encapsulate the saddle-point equilibrium solutions for such types of two-player zero-sum games. To illustrate these findings, an illustrative example is provided.},

  abstract     = {To realise the accurate and stable longitudinal control of the vehicle manipulated by the driving robot (DRV) under different test conditions, a longitudinal robust dynamic programming (RDP) control method for the DRV based on performance self-learning is proposed. Firstly, the dynamics of the driving robot and the vehicle are analysed. Then, the adjoint sensitivity method is used for the DRV to train the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE). The performance of the vehicle under different pedal openings is learned. A RDP controller is designed to solve the nominal target acceleration. Moreover, the unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) method is used to estimate the uncertain external disturbance of the DRV. Furthermore, dynamic compensation is used for the driving robot to track the vehicle's speed. Finally, the stability of the controller is proved. Compared with MPC, LQR, and PID methods, test results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {A new quantised control method via output feedback is proposed by establishing two pairs of time-varying coupled matrix inequalities. Compared to relevant quantised control results, our control method has the novelty: (i) the sensor gain perturbation is allowed to be large and nondifferentiable; (ii) the growth constraint of system nonlinearities is relaxed to depend on unmeasured states and x 1 -polynomial function; (iii) a dynamic scaling technique, instead of backstepping design, is introduced to reduce the computational complexity of controller design. In particular, by using a symbolic function (or hyperbolic tangent function), global asymptotic stability is achieved under any hysteresis quantiser.},
