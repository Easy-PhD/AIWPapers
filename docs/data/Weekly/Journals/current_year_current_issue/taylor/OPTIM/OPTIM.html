  abstract     = {Inverse and bilevel optimization problems play a central role in both theory and applications. These two classes are known to be closely related due to the pioneering work of Dempe and Lohse (2006), and thus have often been discussed together ever since. In this paper, we consider inverse problems for multi-unit assignment valuations. Multi-unit assignment valuations form a subclass of strong-substitutes valuations that can be represented by edge-weighted complete bipartite graphs. These valuations play a key role in auction theory as the strong substitutes condition implies the existence of a Walrasian equilibrium. A recent line of research concentrated on the problem of deciding whether a bivariate valuation function is an assignment valuation or not. In this paper, we consider an inverse variant of the problem: we are given a bivariate function g , and our goal is to find a bivariate multi-unit assignment valuation function f that is as close to g as possible. The difference between f and g can be measured either in ℓ 1 - or ℓ ∞ -norm. Using tools from discrete convex analysis, we show that the problem is strongly NP -hard. On the other hand, we derive linear programming formulations that solve relaxed versions of the problem.},

  abstract     = {The paper addresses robust bilevel optimization with polyhedral uncertainty in the followers' objective function coefficients. It is assumed that both the leader's and the followers' models are linear, yet, bilinear terms in the followers' objective function are allowed. An efficient algorithm is introduced that finds a bounded-error solution in a finite number of steps. This model captures typical price setting applications, such as network toll setting or electricity tariff optimization for demand response management. The efficiency of the general method is illustrated on demand response management in smart grids. Our computational experiments show that the method solves instances with hundreds of decision variables. The significance of these results is underlined by a proof that the above demand response management problem, and hence, the generic robust bilevel problem as well, are Σ 2 p -complete. Finally, the infinitely robust variant of the problem is discussed, and it is shown to be tractable in polynomial time.},

We present a new achievement consisting on the introduction of inertial methods for solving these types of problems. Indeed, two several inertial type methods are suggested: a proximal algorithm and a forward–backward one. Under suitable conditions and without any restrictive assumption on the trajectories, the weak and strong convergence of the sequence generated by the both iterative methods are established. Two particular cases illustrating the proposed methods are thereafter discussed with respect to hierarchical minimization problems and equilibrium problems under a saddle point constraint. Furthermore, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the implementability of our algorithms. The algorithms and their convergence results improve and develop previous results in the field.},

In this paper, we investigate the notion of lower Stackelberg equilibrium, an equilibrium concept arising as a limit point of pessimistic equilibria and of optimistic equilibria of perturbed bilevel problems. First, connections with pessimistic equilibria and optimistic equilibria are obtained in a general setting, together with existence and closure results. Secondly, the problem of finding a lower Stackelberg equilibrium is shown to be stable under general perturbation, differently from what happens for pessimistic and optimistic bilevel problems. Then, moving to the game theory viewpoint, the set of lower Stackelberg equilibria is proved to coincide with the set of subgame perfect Nash equilibrium outcomes of the associated Stackelberg game. These results allow to achieve a comprehensive look on various equilibrium concepts in bilevel optimization and in Stackelberg games as well as to add a new interpretation in terms of game theory to the previous limit results on pessimistic equilibria and optimistic equilibria under perturbation.},

  abstract     = {Support vector classification (SVC) with logistic loss has excellent theoretical properties in classification problems where the label values are not continuous. In this paper, we reformulate the hyperparameter selection for SVC with logistic loss as a bilevel optimization problem in which the upper-level problem and the lower-level problem are both based on logistic loss. The resulting bilevel optimization model is converted to a single-level nonlinear programming (NLP) based on the KKT conditions of the lower-level problem. Such NLP contains a set of nonlinear equality constraints and a simple lower-bound constraint. The second-order sufficient condition is characterized, which guarantees that the strict local optimizers are obtained. To solve such NLP, we apply the smoothing Newton method proposed in [Liang L, Sun D., Toh KC. A squared smoothing Newton method for semidefinite programming, 2023] to solve the KKT conditions, which contain one pair of complementarity constraints. We show that the smoothing Newton method has a superlinear convergence rate. Extensive numerical results verify the efficiency of the proposed approach and strict local minimizers can be achieved both numerically and theoretically. In particular, compared with other methods, our algorithm can achieve competitive results while consuming less time than other methods.},

We suggest a nonsmooth Levenberg–Marquardt method for its solution which, in contrast to the existing literature, does not require local Lipschitzness of the data functions. This is possible when using Newton-differentiability instead of semismoothness as the underlying tool of generalized differentiation. Conditions for local fast convergence of the method are given. Afterwards, in the context of over-determined mixed nonlinear complementarity systems, our findings are applied, and globalized solution methods, based on a residual induced by the maximum and the Fischer–Burmeister function, respectively, are constructed. The assumptions for local fast convergence are worked out and compared. Finally, these methods are applied for the numerical solution of bilevel optimization problems. We recall the derivation of a stationarity condition taking the shape of an over-determined mixed nonlinear complementarity system involving a penalty parameter, formulate assumptions for local fast convergence of our solution methods explicitly, and present results of numerical experiments. Particularly, we investigate whether the treatment of the appearing penalty parameter as an additional variable is beneficial or not.},

  abstract     = {A popular way for developing optimality conditions of bilevel programs is to express them as (single-level) constrained optimization problems involving optimal value functions of lower programs, in which the computation of first/second-order directional derivatives for the value functions or solution mappings of the lower level problems is a challenging task. This type of directional derivatives based optimality conditions are not suitable for analysing theoretical properties of numerical algorithms for bilevel programs, especially when lower programs are non-convex optimization problems. This paper focuses on bilevel programs whose lower level optimization problems are non-convex. We introduce the concept of bi-local solutions and prove that, under the Jacobian uniqueness conditions on the lower level problem, the bi-local solutions are just the local solutions of the optimization problem constrained by Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions of the lower level problem. Importantly, under suitable conditions, we prove that the KKT constrained optimization problem satisfies the Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification (MFCQ). Based on the equivalence of bi-local solutions and local solutions of the KKT constrained optimization problem, we establish the second-order necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the bi-local optimal solutions. Different from second-order optimality conditions in terms of second-order directional derivatives of value functions, the second-order optimality conditions in this paper rely only on the second-order derivatives of the problem functions of the bilevel program. Moreover, the second-order sufficient optimality conditions can be applied for analysing convergence properties of numerical algorithms for the bilevel program.},
