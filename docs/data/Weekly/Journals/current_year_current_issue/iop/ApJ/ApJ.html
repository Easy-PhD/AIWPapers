  abstract     = {Planet formation impacts exoplanet atmospheres by accreting metals in solid form, leading to atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) and sulfur-to-nitrogen ratios (S/N) that deviate from those of their host stars. Recent observations indicate differing metal abundances in planetary atmospheres compared to their stellar companions. However, these observations are biased toward mature planets, raising questions about whether these abundances result from formation or evolved over time. Another way to alter an atmosphere is through the escape of particles due to thermal heating. This study examines how billions of years of particle escape affect metal abundances. Using an adjusted stellar evolution code incorporating hydrodynamic escape, we model a warm ( T eq ≈ 1000 K) super-Neptune-type planet ( M ini = 26 M ⊕ ) orbiting a solar-type star. Our results show increased metal-to-hydrogen abundances of ∼50–70 × initial enrichment after 10 Gyr. We also see a 0.88 × decrease in C/O abundance and a 1.27 × increase in S/N abundance, which can affect the interpretation of planet formation parameters. We also simulate the evolving atmosphere using chemical kinetics and radiative transfer codes, finding substantial increases in SO 2 , CO 2 , and H 2 O abundances and a decrease in CH 4 abundance. These changes are easily observable in the IR wave band transmission spectrum. Our findings demonstrate that extreme escape of lighter particles significantly influences the evolution of warm Neptunes and complicates the interpretation of their observational data. This highlights the need to consider long-term atmospheric evolution in understanding exoplanet compositions.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of large-scale cosmological simulations has opened new avenues for cosmological and astrophysical research. However, the increasing diversity among cosmological simulation models presents a challenge to the robustness . In this work, we develop the Model-Insensitive ESTimator (M iest ), a machine that can robustly estimate the cosmological parameters, Ω m and σ 8 , from neural hydrogen maps of simulation models in the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations project—I llustris TNG, SIMBA , A strid , and S WIFT - E agle . An estimator is considered robust if it possesses a consistent predictive power across all simulations, including those used during the training phase. We train our machine using multiple simulation models and ensure that it only extracts common features between the models while disregarding the model-specific features. This allows us to develop a novel model that is capable of accurately estimating parameters across a range of simulation models, without being biased toward any particular model. Upon the investigation of the latent space—a set of summary statistics, we find that the implementation of robustness leads to the blending of latent variables across different models, demonstrating the removal of model-specific features. In comparison to a standard machine lacking robustness , the average performance of M iest on the unseen simulations during the training phase has been improved by ∼17% for Ω m and 38% for σ 8 . By using a machine learning approach that can extract robust , yet physical features, we hope to improve our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in a (subgrid) model-insensitive manner, and ultimately, gain insight into the underlying physical processes responsible for robustness .},

We use a zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way mass dark matter halo and apply UMAP to the six-dimensional phase space in the dark matter field at z = 0. We find that particles in the field are mapped to distinct clusters in the lower dimensional space in a way that is closely related to their accretion history. The largest cluster in UMAP space does not contain the entire mass of the Milky Way virial region and neatly separates the older halo from the recently accreted matter. Particles within this cluster, which only comprise ∼70% of the Milky Way particles, have had several pericenter passages and are, therefore, likely to be phase mixed, becoming dynamically uniform. The infall region and recently accreted particles and substructure, even up to splashback, form distinct components in the lower dimensional space; additionally, higher angular momentum particles also take longer times to mix. Our work shows that the current state of the Milky Way halo retains historical information, particularly about the recent accretion history, and even a relatively old structure is not dynamically uniform. We also explore UMAP as a preprocessing step to find coherent subhalos in dark matter simulations.},

  abstract     = {Main-sequence dipper stars, characterized by irregular and often aperiodic luminosity dimming events, offer a unique opportunity to explore the variability of circumstellar material and its potential links to planet formation, debris disks, and broadly star–planet interactions. The advent of all-sky time-domain surveys has enabled the rapid discovery of these unique systems. We present the results of a large systematic search for main-sequence dipper stars, conducted across a sample of 63 million FGK main-sequence stars using data from Gaia eDR3 and the Zwicky Transient Facility survey. Using a novel light-curve scoring algorithm and a scalable workflow tailored for analyzing millions of light curves, we have identified 81 new dipper star candidates. Our sample reveals a diverse phenomenology of light-curve dimming shapes, such as skewed and symmetric dimmings with timescales spanning days to years, some of which closely resemble exaggerated versions of KIC 8462852. Our sample reveals no clear periodicity patterns in many of these dippers and no IR excess or variability. Using archival data collated for this study, we thoroughly investigate several classification scenarios and hypothesize that the mechanisms of such dimming events are either driven by circumstellar clumps or occultations by stellar/substellar companions with disks. Our study marks a significant step forward in understanding main-sequence dipper stars.},

  abstract     = {We analytically model stationary and axisymmetric active galactic nucleus jets, assuming energy conservation along each magnetic flux tube. Using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations and published general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we constrain the evolution of the bulk Lorentz factor, the magnetization parameter, and the magnetic field strength along the jet. We then infer the electron density, emission coefficient, and absorption coefficient at each point, and integrate the radiative transfer equation to compute the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the core shift of the synchrotron emission from the relativistic jet. Applying the method to the M87 jet, we find that the hot plasmas are injected at the altitude of seven Schwarzschild radii from the black hole (BH), that the M87 jet is likely composed of a pair plasma, and that the jet flowline geometry is quasi-parabolic as reported at much greater distances. Fitting the nonthermal fraction of the leptonic jet as a function of the position, we also find that most of the radio photons are emitted within 1000 Schwarzschild radii from the BH. Although hadronic jets do not reproduce all the VLBI observations consistently in our model, we also discuss that their heavy mass allows for a stronger magnetic field within the observational constraints, leading to an inverted SED in submillimeter wavelengths by the thermal emission from the jet base. It is therefore implied that contemporaneous observations of the M87 jet with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and VLBI could discriminate the jet composition and its collimation within the central 100 Schwarzschild radii.},

Using optical spectroscopy of a flux-limited sample of AGN selected via ultrahard X-rays from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), we systematically identify 71 double-peaked emitters (DPEs) among 343 broad-line AGN with redshifts 0.004 < z < 0.297 and X-ray luminosities of 40\lt \,{\mathrm{log}}\,{L}_{2-10\,{\rm{KeV}}\,} (erg s −1 ) < 45.7, and provide their best-fit accretion disk parameters. We find that ∼21% of X-ray-selected broad-line AGN are DPEs, consistent with rates previously reported for z < 0.2 broad-line AGN selected for strong optical variability in the Zwicky Transient Facility. 11 of 71 DPEs (15%) exhibited a single-peaked Gaussian component to the broad line profile in addition to the double-peaked disk profile. In this sample, DPEs have intrinsically higher masses by ∼0.4 dex and lower Eddington ratios by ∼0.3 dex than other broad-line AGN, and have a preference for elliptical host galaxies, higher X-ray luminosities, and higher [O i ] λ 6302 to narrow H α flux ratios than other broad-line AGN. We find that DPEs are not segregated from non-DPE broad-line AGN in the L bol versus M BH relation or their X-ray to radio luminosity ratios, and do not show a preference for intermediate Seyfert types over Seyfert 1s. We do not find differences in a wide range of multiwavelength properties when comparing DPEs to non-DPE broad-line AGN, including optical and mid-IR variability levels, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer colors, α ox , the column density of neutral obscuring material N H , and the rate of changing-look events. We discuss the two populations in the context of multicomponent disk-wind models of the AGN broad-line region and consider how unrecognized contributions of disk emission to the broad lines may introduce biases in “virial” supermassive black hole mass estimates, with consequences for the inferred M BH – M * relation.},

  abstract     = {Observations of fast X-ray transients (FXRTs) with the Einstein Probe have successfully led to the discovery of some unusual extragalactic optical transients. EP241021a is a newly discovered FXRT that was featured by a significant bump at around 10 days in both optical and X-ray bands. This timescale and the exceptionally high peak bolometric luminosity up to ∼10 44 erg s −1 of the optical bump make it somewhat similar to fast blue optical transients but still distinctive from them by its relatively red color. We then suggest that the multiwavelength bump of EP241021a could represent an explosion-type transient, while the underlying power-law decaying component of the optical and X-ray emission as well as the total radio emission are produced by a moderately relativistic jet. By fitting the observed multiwavelength light curves, it is found that the explosion ejecta that produce the thermal optical emission can have a mass of ∼0.03 M ⊙ , an expanding velocity of ∼0.25 c , and an optical opacity of ∼12 cm 2 g −1 , which was continuously powered by a rapidly rotating and highly magnetized neutron star (NS; i.e., a magnetar). In addition to heating the explosion ejecta, the magnetar also provided the dominant contribution to the observed X-ray rebrightening through the nonthermal emission of its wind. These properties suggest that the explosion may result from a catastrophic collapse/merger of a compact star system, which led to the formation of a millisecond magnetar, and the possible progenitor could be an accreting white dwarf (WD) or a binary consisting of a double WD, a double NS, or a WD and an NS.},

The main results are as follows: (1) The area and horizontal velocity of MMFs mainly range from 0.4 to 2 MSH and 0.2 to 1.7 km s −1 , with typical values of 0.65 MSH and 0.6 km s −1 , respectively. The dominant ranges for B , B t , B z , and γ are 200–400 G, 75–350 G, 153–297 G, and 20°–60°, respectively. (2) Comparing the pre-pore (the stage before the sunspot transforms into the pore) and pore (after the transformation) stages, the area, horizontal velocity, and B z show similar distribution ranges, while the mean values and ranges of B , B t , and γ decrease significantly. (3) In the pre-pore stage, MMFs predominantly manifest as horizontal MMFs (MMFs that have a horizontal magnetic field (45° < γ < 90°)), whereas in the pore stage, most of them are observed as vertical MMFs (MMFs that have a vertical magnetic field (0° < γ ≤ 45°)). These findings provide observational evidence for the turbulent erosion model of the sunspot decay; the mean vertical magnetic field may be an important parameter for the detachment of MMFs from the sunspots.},

  abstract     = {T Corona Borealis (T CrB) is a recurrent nova and a symbiotic star that is commonly highlighted as the best case for being a progenitor of a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) within the framework of single-degenerate models. This exemplar can be tested by measuring whether the white dwarf (WD) mass ( M WD ) is increasing over each eruption cycle. This is a balance between the mass ejected during each nova event ( M ejecta ) and the mass accreted onto the WD between the nova events ( M accreted ). I have used all 206 radial velocities from 1946 to 2024 to measure the orbital period just after the 1946 eruption, which is P post = 227.6043 days, while the steady orbital period change ( \dot{P} ) is (−3.1 ± 1.6) × 10 −6 . I have used my full 213,730 magnitude B and V light curve from 1842 to 2025 to measure the times of maximum brightness in the ellipsoidal modulations to construct the O − C from 1866 to 1946. I fit the broken parabola shape to find the orbital period immediately before the 1946 eruption, which is {P}_{{\rm{pre}}} = 227.4586 days. The orbital period changed by Δ P = +0.146 ± 0.019 days. With Kepler’s Law, conservation of angular momentum, and the well-measured binary properties, the ejecta mass in 1946 is 0.00074 ± 0.00009 M ⊙ . M accreted is reliably measured to be 1.38 × 10 −6 M ⊙ from the accretion luminosity. M ejecta is larger than M accreted by 540×, so M WD is decreasing every eruption cycle. T CrB can never become an SN Ia.},

  abstract     = {Recurrent nova U Scorpii (U Sco) is one of the prototypes for a Type Ia supernova progenitor. The logic is that the white dwarf is near the Chandrasekhar mass and gas is accumulating onto its surface at a near-maximal accretion rate, so it will soon increase its mass to the supernova trigger. But the white dwarf loses mass every nova eruption, so the issue is balancing the mass ejected ( M ejecta ) against the mass accreted between eruptions ( M accreted ). Measuring M accreted can be done in several ways to usable accuracy. But the old methods for measuring M ejecta (involving the flux in hydrogen emission lines) all have real error bars of 2–3 orders of magnitude. The only solution is to measure the change of the orbital period across the nova eruption (Δ P ). But this solution requires a vast photometric program of eclipse timings stretching decades. For U Sco, a program started in 1989, now reaches its culmination with measures of Δ P for the eruptions of 1999, 2010, 2016, and 2022. This paper reports on 52 new eclipse times (for a total of 218 eclipses from 1945 to 2025), plus a new theory result allowing for the confident calculation of M ejecta from Δ P . The four eruptions ejected a total of (103 ± 14) × 10 −6 M ⊙ , while the white dwarf accreted 4 × 10 −6 M ⊙ over the four previous eruption cycles. With M ejecta = 26 × M accreted , the U Sco white dwarf is losing large masses each eruption cycle, so U Sco can never produce a Type Ia supernova.},

  abstract     = {Observations over the past decade have shown that galaxy clusters undergo the most transformative changes during the z = 1.5–2 epoch. However, challenges such as low lensing efficiency, high shape measurement uncertainty, and a scarcity of background galaxies have prevented us from characterizing their masses with weak gravitational lensing (WL) beyond redshift z ∼ 1.75. In this paper, we report the successful WL detection of JKCS 041 and XLSSC 122 at z = 1.80 and z = 1.98, respectively, utilizing deep infrared imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope with careful removal of instrumental effects. These are the most distant clusters ever measured through WL. The mass peaks of JKCS 041 and XLSSC 122, which coincide with the X-ray peak positions of the respective clusters, are detected at the ∼3.7 σ and ∼3.2 σ levels, respectively. Assuming a single spherical Navarro–Frenk–White profile, we estimate that JKCS 041 has a virial mass of M 200 c = (5.4 ± 1.6) × 10 14 M ⊙ , while the mass of XLSSC 122 is determined to be M 200 c = (3.3 ± 1.8) × 10 14 M ⊙ . These WL masses are consistent with the estimates inferred from their X-ray observations. We conclude that although the probability of finding such massive clusters at their redshifts is certainly low, their masses can still be accommodated within the current ΛCDM paradigm.},

While effective algorithms are being developed, there still lacks an integrated understanding of the statistical properties for the population of overlapping compact binary coalescence signals. For the first time, in order to aid rapid and robust estimation, we rigorously derive and establish analytical expressions for the expectation and variance for the number of overlapping events. This framework is highly extensible, allowing analytical calculation for more complicated scenarios, such as multi-signal overlaps, overlaps between different types of sources, and source-dependent thresholds. We also mathematically prove that the time difference between events in a single observation run is described by the beta distribution, offering an analytical prior reference for Bayesian analysis.},

  abstract     = {The formation of planetesimals from centimeter-sized pebbles in protoplanetary disks faces significant barriers, including fragmentation and radial drift. We identify a previously unaccounted screening force, arising from mutual shielding of thermal gas particles between pebbles when their separation falls below the gas mean free path. This force facilitates pebble binding, overcoming key growth barriers under turbulent disk conditions. Unlike conventional mechanisms, screening forces operate independently of surface adhesion and complement streaming instability and pressure traps by enhancing aggregation in high-density regions. Our analysis predicts that screening interactions are most effective in the middle disk regions (∼0.3 to a few astronomical units), consistent with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations (e.g., TW Hya) of enhanced dust concentrations. Furthermore, we find that screening-induced pebble growth from centimeter to kilometer scales can occur on timescales significantly shorter than the disk lifetime (∼10 5 yr). Importantly, this growth naturally terminates when particles smaller than the local gas mean free path are depleted, thereby avoiding runaway accretion. Beyond planetary science, the screening forces have potential implications for high-energy astrophysics, dusty plasmas, confined particle suspensions, and other relevant areas, suggesting a broader fundamental significance.},

ALINet has previously been shown to be able to interpolate black hole images and their associated physical parameters after training on a computationally tractable set of library images. We utilize this model to estimate the uncertainty introduced by a number of anticipated unmodeled physical effects, including interstellar scattering and intrinsic source variability. We then use this to calibrate physical parameter estimates and their associated uncertainties from RIAF model fits to mock EHT data via a library of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics models.},

  abstract     = {Understanding solar energetic particle transport in wide-longitude events remains a significant question in heliophysics. By utilizing the increasing number of available observers at various heliographic distances and longitudes, such as Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter, we are able to further our understanding of these widespread events. This study presents 3D test particle modeling of three widespread events during the Parker era, each detected by at least four observers. The role of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) in transporting particles to the wide longitudes observed in these events is evaluated. A newly updated and more sophisticated HCS model is used, incorporating three different configurations derived from the Wilcox Solar Observatory, Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport, and Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data (via Predictive Science, PSI) for each event. The modeled proton flux profiles at each observer location are compared against energetic proton measurements for each HCS configuration. We find that inclusion of the HCS is essential to reproduce both the wide longitudinal spread of particles and the observed flux profiles in all three events. For events with longitudinal separations exceeding 100°, the most intense fluxes, both observed and modeled, are associated with observers located nearest to the HCS. This is observed for the 2023 March 13 event, where two observers were located closer in longitude and radial distance than other observers to the source region, yet observed no solar energetic particle signatures due to their lack of proximity to the HCS. Among the three configurations, the HMI-PSI-derived HCS consistently yields the best agreement between observed and modeled flux profiles.},

The availability of both NUV and FUV spectra allows us to define the quasar continuum and correct for strong Lyman-limit systems (LLSs) that fall in the gap between the FUV and optical. Each active galactic nucleus (AGN) has a prominent LLS, but the flux recovery shortward of their Lyman edges allows us to fit and restore the true AGN continuum.

The magnetoionic media responsible for the significant coherence observed in radio relics remain poorly understood. Low-frequency measurements of radio relics are essential for constraining depolarization models, which provide crucial insights into the magnetic field distribution. However, these measurements are challenging due to the emission properties and interferometer systematics. We have detected polarization signals from the northwest radio relic in A746 at 650 MHz with the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, marking the first-ever detection of polarization from radio relics below 1 GHz. At this frequency, the average rotation-measure-corrected magnetic fields align well with shock radio emission, typical of radio relics. The fractional polarization at 650 MHz is ∼18% ± 4%. Our results indicate that a single internal depolarization model cannot explain the observed depolarization spectra, suggesting a nonuniform magnetic field distribution or complex contribution of different polarized regions in the radio relic. Our detection of polarization signals at 650 MHz reveals critical insights into radio relic magnetic field structures, offering a low-frequency approach to understanding intracluster medium magnetic fields in merging galaxy clusters.},

The spectroscopic data confirm the accuracy of the photometric metallicities and allow for the determination of chemical abundances for 16 elements, from carbon to barium. The program stars have chemical abundances consistent with the [Fe/H] < –3 range. A kinematic/dynamical analysis suggests that all program stars belong to the distant Milky Way halo population (heliocentric distances 35 < d helio /kpc ≲ 55), including three with high-energy orbits that might have been associated with the Magellanic system and one, J0026−5445, having parameters consistent with being a member of the Sagittarius stream. The remaining two stars show kinematics consistent with the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus dwarf galaxy merger. J0433−5548, with [Fe/H] = –4.12, is a carbon-enhanced ultra metal-poor star, with [C/Fe] = +1.73. This star is believed to be a bona fide second-generation star, and its chemical abundance pattern was compared with yields from metal-free supernova models. Results suggest that J0433−5548 could have been formed from a gas cloud enriched by a single supernova explosion from an ∼11 M ⊙ star in the early Universe. The successful identification of such objects demonstrates the reliability of photometric metallicity estimates, which can be used for target selection and statistical studies of faint targets in the Milky Way and its satellite population. These discoveries illustrate the power of measuring chemical abundances of metal-poor Milky Way halo stars to learn more about early galaxy formation and evolution.},

The simulations reveal the growth of quasiparallel-propagating waves, quasi-antiparallel-propagating waves, and the oblique mirror mode. The excited waves scatter the PUIs and can reverse their parallel velocities with respect to the background magnetic field. The scattering time, defined as the time when the squared standard deviation of the pitch angles of the PUIs approaches thresholds of 0.2 or 0.4, increases as the PUI injection rate decreases, approximately following a power law. The scattering time estimated for a realistic injection rate in the outer heliosheath is about 0.5 yr at a 45° pickup angle. This scattering time is shorter than the average charge exchange time of about 2 yr for the PUIs to be converted into energetic neutral atoms (ENAs). This result conflicts with the spatial retention scenario of the secondary ENA mechanism, which assumes weak (or incomplete) scattering of PUIs in the off-ribbon directions to explain the ENA ribbon discovered by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer.},

This yields an upper limit on the dark matter cross section if the dark matter column density is known. We investigate a bias in such constraints: the measured column density (along the line of sight, using gravitational lensing) is lower than that experienced by a dark matter particle, as follows. Dark matter halos are triaxial and generally collide along their major axes, yielding a high scattering column density—but the merger is obvious only to observers whose line of sight is nearly perpendicular to that axis, yielding a low observed column density. We trace lines of sight through merging halos from the BigMDPL n -body simulation, both with and without mock observational effects. We find that a hypothetical skewer through the center of the halo along the merger axis (more precisely, along the current separation vector of the two halos) has nearly twice the column density of a typical line of sight. With weak lensing measurements, which involve some spatial averaging, this ratio is reduced to 1.25, suggesting that existing constraints on the scattering cross section are biased high by about 25%.},

  abstract     = {In spider pulsar systems, a relativistic intrabinary shock (IBS) forms when the pulsar wind collides with the massive outflow driven off the pulsar’s low-mass stellar companion. The shock is a site of nonthermal particle acceleration, likely via shock-driven magnetic reconnection, and produces synchrotron emission. These shocks are among the few systems in which global scales can be reasonably captured with kinetic simulations, enabling first-principles particle acceleration and emission studies. We perform the first global 3D kinetic simulations of spider pulsar IBSs and predict their polarized emission properties. We report emission spectra, light curves, and polarization patterns as a function of the stripe-averaged magnetic field, cooling strength, and viewing inclination. At 90° inclination and for a low stripe-averaged magnetic field, we reproduce the double peaked light curve observed in spider systems. We predict a significant polarization degree ≳15%, which monotonically increases with the stripe-averaged field strength. Our results can be applied to and tested by forthcoming X-ray polarization observations of spider pulsars.},

  abstract     = {The detection of a ≃220 PeV muon neutrino event by the KM3NeT telescope offers an unprecedented opportunity to probe the Universe at extreme energies. A photopion interaction origin of the neutrino requires a parent cosmic-ray energy of ≳4 EeV per nucleon. We analyze the origin of this event under three scenarios, i.e., a transient point source, diffuse astrophysical emission, and a line-of-sight interaction of an ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray (UHECR; E ≳ 0.1 EeV). Our analysis includes the flux from both a KM3NeT-only fit and a joint fit, incorporating data from KM3NeT, IceCube, and the Pierre Auger Observatory. If the neutrino event originates from transients, it requires a new population of transients that is energetic, γ -ray-dark, and more abundant than the known ones. In the framework of diffuse astrophysical emission, we compare the required local UHECR energy injection rate at ≳4 EeV with the rate derived from the flux measurements by Auger, across various models of source redshift evolution. This disfavors the KM3NeT-only fit, considering the source evolution up to high values of redshift, while the joint fit remains viable for sources contributing up to a maximum redshift {z}_{{\rm{\max }}}\gtrsim 1 for the limiting case of photopion interaction efficiency, f pγ = 0.1. For a cosmogenic origin from point sources, the luminosity obtained at redshifts z ≲ 1 from the joint fit is compatible with the Eddington luminosity of ∼10 9 M ⊙ black holes in active galactic nuclei, assuming a proton composition and optimistic values of extragalactic magnetic field strength.},

Significant variability was detected in the HCO + (1–0)/N 2 H + (1–0) flux ratio. Radiative transfer analysis indicates this ratio variability likely results from temperature fluctuations driven by an accretion burst, as chemical processes operate on timescales exceeding our observational window. Correlation with a 6.7 GHz methanol maser light curve suggests the HCO + /N 2 H + ratio serves as a novel tracer of accretion bursts in MYSOs. This method complements infrared and maser techniques, providing a valuable tool for assessing the impact of accretion bursts on MYSO evolution.},

  abstract     = {The vast majority of young stars hosting planet-forming disks exist within clustered environments, like the Orion Nebula, implying that seemingly “extreme” UV environments (10 4 G 0 and above) are not so atypical in the context of planet formation. Using thermochemical modeling, we explore how the temperature and chemistry within a protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star are impacted by the surrounding UV environment. The disk becomes hotter due to heating by photodissociation of molecules, photoelectric heating, H 2 , and atomic processes, and as a result, the area in which molecules exist in the ice phase shrinks, being pushed both downward and inward. Beyond 1 au, the chemistry changes most significantly in a UV-rich background; the atmosphere becomes more H 2 O, OH, and atomic-rich. Hydrocarbons, however, reside primarily well within 1 au of the disk; thus, their abundance and distribution are not impacted by the UV field up to 10 6 G 0 . The products of photodissociation and photochemistry are formed deeper into the disk with increasing UV background field strength beyond 1 au, impacting the chemistry near the midplane. Effectively, a “reset” chemistry takes place, with an enhancement of atoms, simple molecules, and molecules in the gas phase. Planets that form in highly irradiated regions will be exposed to a different chemical reservoir in the gas and ice phases than that in an isolated disk, and the impact from the UV background should only be detectable in highly irradiated disks (∼10 6 G 0 ).},

We find that the source traverses through the hard, intermediate, and soft spectral states during the outburst. The spectrum in all states can be described using soft emissions from the thermal disk and hard emissions from the coronal regions. The variation in the inner-disk temperature and normalization of the disk indicate the motion of the truncated disk across these different spectral states. We confirm the presence of broad features, type C, and type B quasiperiodic oscillations in the power spectra of the different spectral states. We investigate the fractional rms and lags of all the variability features and discover that the lags swing between positive and negative during the outburst evolution. While modeling the features with a simple model that considers variations in accretion parameters, such as the accretion rate, heating rate, and inner-disk radius, along with the delays between them, we find a dynamic reversal in the origin of the variability between the corona and the disk. Furthermore, our results are consistent with previous works and a radio study conducted on this source during its outburst.},

In the first detailed study of the Perseus arm’s disk–halo interface, we combine Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and Cosmic Origins Spectrograph absorption spectra toward six stars and 23 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) projected behind a narrow section (95° < l < 145°, −46° < b < 0°). This provides a unique data set that bridges the disk and its extended vertical structure in these directions. We measure S ii , Si iv , and C iv absorption, along with H i 21 cm emission, at heights −70 pc to −3.3 kpc from the midplane. The arm’s southern vertical structure shows distinct height-dependent behaviors: H i and S ii column densities sharply decline with height up to 1.5 kpc, then continue declining at a much shallower rate at greater heights. In contrast, high ion (Si IV and C IV ) column densities remain relatively constant throughout the entire height range. In the disk–halo interface, where warm neutral medium dominates, S ii and the high ions show similar kinematics, and we find a remarkably uniform C iv /Si iv ratio (〈 N C IV / N Si IV 〉  = 2.5 ± 0.5) within −0.9 to −3.25 kpc. Both the kinematic correspondence and high-ion ratio are consistent with the high ions probing turbulent mixing layers at the interfaces between warm/cool and hot gas phases. The AGN sight lines reveal minimal circumgalactic medium contribution in the low-velocity gas at ∣ v LSR ∣ < 100 km s −1 . The extraplanar absorbing gas may trace material ejected from previous Galactic fountain activity.},

A total of 55 sources are clearly detected in at least one X-ray band, and we set stringent upper limits on the X-ray fluxes of the remaining eight sources. In combination with rest-frame ultraviolet–optical spectroscopic data for these sources, we assess whether X-rays can provide a robust accretion rate indicator for quasars, particularly at the highest accessible redshifts. We utilize a recently modified H β -based Eddington luminosity ratio estimator, as well as the C iv λ 1549 emission-line parameter space, to investigate trends and correlations with the optical–X-ray spectral slope ( α ox ) and the effective hard X-ray power-law photon index (Γ). We find that α ox does not improve current accretion rate estimates based on H β or C iv . Instead, within the limitations of our sample, we confirm previous findings that the C iv parameter space may be a better indicator of the accretion rate up to z ∼ 3.5. We also find that the average Γ values for a small subset of our sources, as well as the average Γ value in different groupings of our sources, are consistent with their respective relatively high Eddington luminosity ratios. Deeper X-ray observations of our X-ray-detected sources are needed for measuring Γ accurately and testing whether this parameter can serve as a robust, unbiased accretion rate diagnostic.},

Using a theoretical model for the electric current density in a force-free pulsar magnetosphere, we compute from first principles the distribution of electric current over the polar cap associated with an off-center magnetic dipole. We then use a simple prescription to compute the resulting temperature distribution, which allows us to derive the observed X-ray light curve. We investigate the role of the volumetric return current region in the polar cap and find that although it does not make a big difference in the case of an aligned dipole, the difference can be bigger in the case of an off-center dipole. Finally, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting to the X-ray light curves of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437–4715 with and without the volumetric return current, and find that our model can reasonably recover the observed X-ray light curves.},

  abstract     = {Most general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black hole (BH) hot accretion flows are initialized with small rotating tori and produce stable jets with only small fluctuations. However, recent studies using larger-scale Bondi-like initial conditions have reported intermittent jet activity and loss of coherent rotation. To investigate these differences, we modify the standard torus setup across four BH spins: a * = 0, 0.5, 0.9, −0.9. First, we increase the torus size significantly (pressure maximum at 500 gravitational radii), allowing long simulations (2.8 × 10 5 gravitational times) without gas depletion. These runs reproduce the weak variability seen in smaller tori, indicating that a larger dynamic range alone does not cause strong fluctuations. We observe moderate suppression of the accretion rate by factors of ∼1.6 and 2.5 for BH spins a * = 0.5 and 0.9, respectively, compared to a * = 0. Also, the density profile scales as ρ ( r ) ∝ r −1.1 for prograde BHs. Next, we considerably strengthen the initial magnetic field in the large torus by setting the plasma- β ≈ 1. This induces strong variability in the evolution. The jet efficiency in the a * = 0.9 model, for instance, now varies by over 3 orders of magnitude, and the gas rotation reverses directions. Combining these results with prior studies, we propose that a key parameter is the ratio { \mathcal R } between the rotational and magnetic energies in the initial state. Strong variability appears later in models with larger values of { \mathcal R } . The implication is that all simulations, and by extension all hot accretion flows in nature, will ultimately develop intermittent jets if evolved long enough.},

The twist and tilt of the BMR magnetic field are modeled as a result of an effective electromotive force along the rising part of the toroidal magnetic field. This force generates the poloidal field that tilts the whole magnetic configuration. We find that variations of BMR’s twist and tilt determine the magnitude and the sign of the magnetic helicity flux on the solar surface. The model shows that the helicity flux associated with the BMR’s tilt/twist is the dominant contribution to the BMR helicity at the beginning of the BMR’s evolution, while the effect of differential rotation is the main source of the helicity flux at the final stage of the BMR’s evolution.

In order to bypass the use of field differences, which mitigate flat field errors but reduce sensitivity, we characterize and correct for the flat field on pseudopower spectra, which includes both additive and multiplicative biases. To more effectively mask point sources at 1.1 and 1.8 μ m, we develop a technique for predicting masking catalogs that utilizes optical and near-infrared photometry through random forest regression. This allows us to mask over 2 Vega mag deeper than the completeness limits of Two Micron All Sky Survey alone, with errors in the shot noise power remaining below <10% at all masking depths considered. Through detailed simulations of CIBER observations, we validate our formalism and demonstrate unbiased recovery of the sky fluctuations on realistic mocks.

We present kinematic maps of young stars from rest-ultraviolet photospheric absorption in the star-forming galaxy CASSOWARY 13 (a.k.a. SDSS J1237+5533) at z = 1.87 using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, alongside nebular emission measurements from the same observations. Gravitational lensing magnification of the galaxy enables good spatial sampling of multiple independent lensed images. We find close agreement between the stellar and nebular velocity fields. We measure a mean local velocity dispersion of σ = 64 ± 12 km s −1 for the young stars, consistent with that of the H ii regions traced by nebular C iii ] emission (52  ±  9 km s −1 ). The ∼20 km s −1 average difference in line-of-sight velocity is much smaller than the local velocity width and the velocity gradient (≳100 km s −1 ). We find no evidence of asymmetric drift nor evidence that outflows bias the nebular kinematics, and thus we conclude that nebular emission appears to be a reasonable dynamical tracer of young stars in the galaxy. These results support the picture of star formation in thick disks with high velocity dispersion at z ∼ 2, and they represent an important step toward establishing robust kinematics of early galaxies using collisionless tracers.},

  abstract     = {Diverse formation channels have been proposed to explain the emergence of fast radio bursts (FRBs), yet their origin remains elusive. With improved localization precision, roughly 90 FRBs are now associated with host galaxies. Spectral energy distribution fitting to the host galaxy photometry reveals their stellar masses ( M ⋆ ) and star formation rates (SFRs), enabling discrimination between various formation channels. We conduct an extensive comparison of the stellar mass, SFR, and redshift distributions of 51 FRB hosts and mock generated galaxy samples to test whether FRBs trace SFR or M ⋆ . We incorporate a mass-to-light ratio ( {({{M}}_{\star }/{{L}}_{{r}})}_{{\rm{obs}}} ) prescription to address optical selection biases. In line with K. Sharma et al., we provide evidence in favor of FRB progenitors tracking SFR rather than stellar mass. We show that the shape of the assumed {({M}_{\star }/{L}_{r})}_{{\rm{o}}{\rm{b}}{\rm{s}}} distribution affects the predictions, bringing the low-mass end of the stellar mass distribution closer to the data when accounting for the {\mathrm{SFR}}\mbox{--}{({M}_{\star }/{L}_{r})}_{{\mathrm{obs}}} correlation. The K -correction effect in the r band is minimal for galaxies at z ≲ 0.7. In the model in which FRBs trace SFR, up to ∼6% of a flux-limited FRB host sample can reside below the star-forming main sequence. Finally, we examine a hybrid model in which a fraction of FRBs tracks stellar mass rather than SFR. This fraction can be as large as ∼40%−50%, suggesting that multiple formation channels are still consistent with observations. The toolkit developed in this work, GALFRB ( https://github.com/loudasnick/GALFRB ; N. Loudas et al.), is publicly available, offering a straightforward way to generate mock galaxy samples suitable for direct comparisons with future FRB host galaxy data.},

  abstract     = {The Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer on board the Euclid space mission has obtained near-infrared (NIR) slitless spectra of millions of objects, including hundreds of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs). Euclid observations retrieve images and spectra simultaneously. This observing mode marks a new era in the discovery of new objects, such as L- and T-type dwarfs, which can be found from direct identification through the H 2 O and CH 4 absorption bands. NISP spectral resolution ( R ∼  450) is enough to classify the objects by the spectral type using known standard templates. Q1 provided more than 4 million NIR spectra in one visit to the Euclid Deep Fields. The large amount of spectra released in these fields allowed us to (a) confirm the UCD nature of almost half of the photometric candidates compiled by J. Y. Zhang et al.; (b) discover at least 11 new late L- and T-type dwarfs by a specific spectral index search in Q1 data; and (c) spectroscopically confirm 100 more candidates from a new photometric selection conducted by M. Žerjal et al. We present a preliminary list of Euclid UCD templates built by the combination of the best spectra from all these searches. We include the first spectral analysis of confirmed UCDs from Q1 data; spectral classifications; determination of effective temperatures; H 2 O, CH 4 , and NH 3 spectral indices; and measurements of the K I absorption doublet. This paper is a first step in the study of Euclid UCDs and will be improved with each subsequent data release.},

The used Ketju code combines the gadget-4 fast multiple gravity solver with accurate regularized integration and post-Newtonian corrections (up to PN3.5) around SMBHs. The ejected SMBHs carry clusters of bound stellar material (black hole recoil clusters, BRCs) with masses in the range of 10 6 ≲ M BRC ≲ 10 7 M ⊙ and sizes of several 10 pc. For recoil velocities up to 60% of the galaxy escape velocity, the BRCs are detectable in mock photometric images at a Euclid-like resolution up to redshift z ∼ 1.0. By Monte Carlo sampling the observability for different recoil directions and magnitudes, we predict that in ∼20% of instances the BRCs are photometrically detectable, most likely for kicks with SMBH apocentres less than the galaxy effective radius. BRCs occupy distinct regions in the stellar mass/velocity dispersion versus size relations of known star clusters and galaxies. An enhanced velocity dispersion in excess of σ ∼ 600 km s −1 coinciding with the SMBH position provides the best evidence for an SMBH-hosting stellar system, effectively distinguishing BRCs from other faint stellar systems. BRCs are promising candidates to observe the aftermath of the yet-undetected mergers of the most massive SMBHs and we estimate that up to 8000 BRCs might be observable below z ≲ 0.6 with large-scale photometric surveys such as Euclid and upcoming high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy with the Extremely Large Telescope.},

We constrain the model parameters and their temporal evolution by applying our theoretical model to the high-energy emission in the X-ray and GeV–TeV energy bands observed at intermediate and late times. Our results reveal interesting differences among the TeV-detected GRBs, potentially reflecting a variety of underlying physical processes that lead to different maximum energies {E}_{{\rm{\max }}}=\,{\gamma }_{{\rm{\max }}}\,{m}_{e}\,{c}^{2} of the accelerated particles responsible for the GRB high-energy emission. We indeed obtain different behaviors of the late TeV afterglows that ultimately depend on {\gamma }_{{\rm{\max }}} . We discuss how late afterglow observations—on timescales of hours and days—of X-ray and GeV–TeV emissions are crucial for providing diagnostics of the physical processes behind GRBs, and we emphasize the theoretical expectations for future TeV observations.},

  abstract     = {We analyze the dynamics of low-mass black hole (BH) seeds in the high-redshift ( z ≳ 5) Universe using a suite of [4.5 Mpc] 3 and [9 Mpc] 3 BRAHMA cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The simulations form seeds with mass M seed = 2.2 × 10 3 M ⊙ in halos that exceed critical thresholds of dense and metal-poor gas mass (5–150 M seed ) and the halo mass (1000–10,000 M seed ). While the initial BRAHMA boxes pinned the BHs to the halo centers, here we implement a subgrid dynamical friction (DF) model. We also compare simulations where the BH is allowed to wander without the added DF. We investigate the spatial and velocity offsets of BHs in their host subhalos, as well as BH merger rates. We find that subgrid DF is crucial to ensure that a significant fraction of BHs effectively sink to halo centers by z ∼ 5, thereby enabling them to get gravitationally bound and merge with other BHs at separations close to the spatial resolution (∼0.2–0.4 kpc) of the simulation. For the BHs that merge, the associated merger timescales lag between ∼100 and 1000 Myr after their host halos merge. Compared to predictions using BH repositioning, the overall z ≳ 5 BH merger rates under subgrid DF decrease by a factor of ∼4–10. Under subgrid DF, the different seed models predict merger rates between ∼100 and 1000 events per year at z ≳ 5. These mergers dominate early BH growth, assembling BHs up to ∼10 4 –10 5 M ⊙ by z ∼ 5, wherein ≲2% of their mass is assembled via gas accretion. Our results highlight the promise for constraining seeding mechanisms using gravitational waves from future facilities such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.},

We use the ray-traced results from our simulations to evaluate the feasibility of measuring these effects, particularly in the context of current and future X-ray polarization observatories.

We report the detection of a weak surface magnetic field in the O-type giant 63 Oph ( T eff = 35.0 ± 0.3 kK, {\mathrm{log}}\,g=3.51\pm 0.03 ) from new ESPaDOnS circularly polarized spectra.

We report Balmer line-core equivalent widths (EWs) and radial velocity measurements from the analysis of spectra primarily obtained by the IACOB project with the FEROS, FIES, and HERMES spectrographs. We identify a dominant period of ∼19.8 days in the EWs, which we attribute to the effects of a rotating magnetosphere under the oblique rotator model. We do not identify any coherent signals in a time series analysis of archival Hipparcos, ASAS-SN, and K2 photometry. Our findings show that 63 Oph may be a rare link between strongly magnetic massive stars detected on or near the zero-age main sequence and weakly magnetic O-type supergiants. Additional observations are needed to fully constrain 63 Oph’s magnetic field geometry and magnetospheric properties.},

In this work, for the first time, we used the archival data and employed the physics-determined SED processing method to form approximately average-state SEDs for 513 Fermi bright BL Lacs. In general, we found that the magnetic field ( B ) is weaker than those obtained for the flaring/outburst state by nearly 1 order of magnitude, and the dissipation region size ( R ) is larger than those obtained for the flaring/outburst state, suggesting that the dissipation region could be more extended and less magnetized. A correlation between the synchrotron self-Compton peak frequency ( {\mathrm{log}}\,{\nu }_{{{\rm{ssc}}}} ) and the synchrotron peak frequency ( {\mathrm{log}}\,{\nu }_{{{\rm{sy}}}} ) suggests that the inverse Compton scattering of higher-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs suffers a significant Klein–Nishina (KN) suppression; we quantified the condition of KN suppression by determining the critical synchrotron peak frequency ( {\nu }_{{{\rm{sy}}}^{{\rm{c}}}} ) and found 359 out of 513 sources in our sample suffer KN suppression. Furthermore, our analysis of the relationship between synchrotron curvature (1/ b sy ) and {\mathrm{log}}\,{\nu }_{{{\rm{sy}}}} indicates that the energy-dependent probability acceleration mechanism may dominate the particle acceleration in BL Lac jets.},

This study continues our previous simulation work that successfully reproduced the X7.1-class solar flare. In this study, we performed a data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic simulation using the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) as the initial condition to investigate the X9.0-class solar flare. The NLFFF showed the sheared field lines, resulting in the tether-cutting reconnection, the magnetic flux ropes, and eventually led to eruption. The magnetic reconnection during the pre-eruption phase plays a critical role in accelerating the subsequent eruption, which is driven by torus instability and magnetic reconnection. Furthermore, our simulation results are consistent with several observational features associated with the X9.0 flare. This simulation could reproduce diverse phenomena associated with the X9.0 flare, including the tether-cutting reconnection, the flare ribbons and the postflare loops, the transverse field enhancement, and the remote brightening away from the flare ribbons. However, the initial trigger, magnetic flux emergence, was inferred from observations rather than explicitly modeled, and future comprehensive simulations should incorporate this mechanism directly.},

We find that HST/H α and JWST/NIRCam 2–3.6 μ m photometry significantly improves our ability to disentangle the age–reddening degeneracy between young, gas- and dust-rich clusters and older, dustless clusters. The near-infrared data provide strong constraints on hot continuum dust and small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission for populations where gas and dust are present. These hot dust constraints demonstrate that Bruzual & Charlot stellar population models do not align with the observed near-ultraviolet-optical-near-infrared spectral energy distributions of star clusters in the first 10 Myr. We note that for old and low-metallicity globular clusters, the inclusion of narrowband H α and/or broadband near-infrared data does not improve the determination of age and reddening parameters, due to the lack of stars capable of heating dust in the near-infrared regime.},

  abstract     = {We report the first robust evidence for a cospatial subparsec acceleration and collimation zone (ACZ) in the twin jets of the nearby low-luminosity active galactic nucleus NGC 4261. This result is derived from multifrequency Very Long Baseline Array imaging, combined with the frequency-dependent properties of the radio core (core shift and core size) and jet kinematics determined from the jet-to-counterjet brightness ratio. By applying multiple analysis methods and incorporating results from the literature, we identify a parabolic-to-conical structural transition in both the jet and counterjet, with the transition occurring at (1.23 ± 0.24) pc or (8.1 ± 1.6) × 10 3 R s (Schwarzschild radii) for the jet and (0.97 ± 0.29) pc or (6.4 ± 1.9) × 10 3 R s for the counterjet. We also derive the jet velocity field at distances of ∼(10 3 –2 × 10 4 ) R s . While local kinematic variations are present, the jet shows an overall acceleration to relativistic speeds from ∼10 3 to ∼8 × 10 3 R s , with a maximum Lorentz factor of {{\rm{\Gamma }}}_{{\rm{\max }}}\approx 2.6 . Beyond this region, the jet gradually decelerates to subrelativistic speeds. These findings support the existence of a subparsec-scale (≲1.5 pc) ACZ in NGC 4261, where the jet is accelerated via magnetic-to-kinetic energy conversion while being confined by external pressure. A brief comparison with M87 suggests that the ACZ in NGC 4261 may represent a scaled-down analog of that in M87. These results point toward a potential diversity in jet ACZ properties, emphasizing the importance of extending such studies to a broader AGN population to elucidate the physical mechanisms at play.},

  abstract     = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled us to uncover faint galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early Universe. Leveraging the filter combination used in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey program, we perform an extensive photometric search of galaxies emitting strong H β + [O iii ] and H α lines. The redshift range of the galaxies is limited to 5.03 ≤ z ≤ 5.26 by requiring photometric excess in NIRCam’s F277W and F410M images. A total of 259 H β + [O iii ] and H α dual-line emitters are found over the absolute UV magnitude −22 ≲ M UV ≲ −17, with a mean rest-frame equivalent width of 990 Å for H β + [O iii ] and 1050 Å for H α . This population accounts for ∼40% of the Lyman-break galaxies at this redshift range. Intriguingly, there are 58 objects (22% of the whole sample) that exhibit compact morphology at the rest-UV or optical wavelength. Assuming that these compact dual-line emitters are dominated by AGNs, their bolometric luminosities are in the range of 2 × 10 43 ≲ L bol /(erg s −1 ) ≲ 3 × 10 44 . Their number density is 2 dex higher than the extrapolation from UV-selected luminous quasars, which is in good agreement with previous JWST studies of broad-line AGNs, requiring a ∼10% AGN duty cycle. Moreover, our dual-line emitter sample reaches the faint end of the H α and [O iii ] luminosity functions down to ≲10 42 erg s −1 . Spectroscopic follow-up observations are planned in a JWST Cycle 3 program, in which we aim to confirm their nature, characterize their black hole activity, and construct their mass distribution at 10 6 ≲ M BH / M ⊙ ≲ 10 8 .},

  abstract     = {Surface lithium is depleted when a star goes through the first dredge-up phase, yet 1% of red giants are found to be Li rich. The formation mechanism for these remains uncertain. We combine observational constraints from Galactic Archaeology with HERMES ( GALAH ) Li-rich giants, with the binary population synthesis software Compact Object Synthesis and Monte Carlo Investigation Code ( COSMIC) to investigate the system properties of these objects assuming binary mass transfer. By evolving nine million binary systems, we find that binary histories most consistent with the observational constraints are mass transfer from an intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) donor to a main-sequence (MS) star now observed as a Li-rich red giant. In GALAH , 9% of MS stars have A (Li) = 2.5–3.2 dex making it plausible to create red giants with A (Li) = 1.5–2.2 dex via MS mass transfer, but they cannot explain the more enriched giants with A (Li) ≳ 2.2 dex. Nucleosynthetic yields from stellar models show that AGB stars with initial masses of 4.25–5 M ⊙ and 8 M ⊙ contain the most lithium in their ejecta. Intermediate-mass AGB stars comprise 29% of the COSMIC results, with present-day separations s = 3.3 ± 0.5 au and mass ratios q = 0.5–1.6. We achieve 95% agreement in mean enhancements in Ba and Y between the GALAH observations and stellar models of 6 and 8 M ⊙ AGB stars, assuming a 1% mass transfer efficiency. We find a low mass transfer efficiency best reproduces the GALAH observations suggesting that the preferred mass transfer mechanism for Li enrichment is via wind Roche-lobe overflow. While we constrain the most plausible binary parameters assuming AGB mass transfer creates Li-rich giants, discrepancies in the nucleosynthesis comparisons and the small fraction of Li-enhanced MS stars suggests additional enrichment mechanisms are likely.},

  abstract     = {Strong gravitational lenses with two background sources at widely separated redshifts are a promising independent probe of cosmological parameters. We can use these systems, known as double-source-plane lenses (DSPLs), to measure the ratio ( β ) of angular-diameter distances of the sources, which is sensitive to the matter density (Ω m ) and the equation-of-state parameter for dark-energy ( w ). However, DSPLs are rare and require high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy for detection, lens modeling, and measuring β . Here, we report only the second DSPL ever used to measure cosmological parameters. We model the DSPL AGEL 150745+052256 from the ASTRO 3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses ( AGEL ) survey using Hubble Space Telescope/Wide-Field Camera 3 imaging and Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectroscopy. The spectroscopic redshifts for the deflector and two sources in AGEL 1507 are z defl = 0.594, z S1 =  2.163, and z S2 = 2.591. We measure a stellar velocity dispersion of σ obs = 109 ± 27 km s −1 for the nearer source (S1). Using σ obs for the main deflector (from literature) and S1, we test the robustness of our DSPL model. We measure \beta =0.95{3}_{-0.010}^{+0.008} for AGEL 1507 and infer Ω m =\,0.3{3}_{-0.23}^{+0.38} for ΛCDM cosmology. Combining AGEL 1507 with the published model of the Jackpot lens improves the precision on Ω m (ΛCDM) and w ( w CDM) by ∼10%. The inclusion of DSPLs significantly improves the constraints when combined with Planck’s cosmic microwave background observations, enhancing the precision on w by 30%. This paper demonstrates the potential constraining power of DSPLs and their complementarity to other standard cosmological probes. Tighter future constraints from larger DSPL samples discovered from ongoing and forthcoming large-area sky surveys would provide insights into the nature of dark energy.},

  abstract     = {We are on the cusp of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) from individual massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and pulsar timing arrays. These MBHBs may be surrounded by circumbinary disks and minidisks, the electromagnetic emission from which is essential for localizing the MBHBs on the sky. Here we present the first radiative magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) minidisk simulation that directly solves the radiative transfer equation on discretized grid rays. The simulation examines one of the minidisks in an equal-mass 2 × 10 7 M ⊙ MBHB separated by 100 gravitational radii. Minidisks simulated with and without radiative effects resemble each other qualitatively but differ in several key aspects. The RMHD minidisk is denser and geometrically thinner than the magnetohydrodynamics minidisk. Furthermore, the RMHD minidisk, with a nonaxisymmetric photosphere and temperature distribution, produces an anisotropic illumination pattern. As a result, the observed radiative flux of two RMHD minidisks orbiting each other varies at half the binary orbital period, a feature independent of relativistic boosting and lensing effects. Such periodic light curves, if identified in upcoming optical transient surveys, could reveal the existence of MBHBs on the way to merger, particularly if they are in a constant phase relation with detected GWs.},

  abstract     = {The study of pulsar glitches provides a unique window into the internal structure and dynamic processes of neutron stars. PSR J0007+7303, a very bright gamma-ray pulsar, is the first pulsar discovered by the Fermi–Large Area Telescope (LAT) telescope. In this paper, we present the 15 yr of timing results of this pulsar using the Fermi-LAT data. We identified nine glitches, five of which are newly discovered. Among these new glitches, two are small glitches, occurring between the three previously reported ones, while the other three are large glitches. The glitches exhibit fractional frequency changes ranging from 21.5 × 10 −9 to 1239 × 10 −9 , with intervals of approximately 1–2 yr between events. Uniquely, this pulsar shows no exponential recovery behavior following any glitch, setting it apart from most glitching pulsars. Furthermore, no significant changes were observed in the gamma-ray pulse profile, flux, or phase-averaged spectra before and after glitches, indicating the stability of the pulsar’s emission properties despite internal changes. A parametric analysis of the glitches yielded a fractional moment of inertia of the crustal superfluid involved in glitches as 1.06%, which matches extremely well with previous statistical work if the nondissipative entrainment effect is not considered and strongly supports the internal origin of these glitches. These results highlight the distinct glitch behavior of PSR J0007+7303 and offer valuable insights into the crust–superfluid interaction in neutron stars. The physical origin of no exponential recovery is also discussed.},

SIDM Concerto includes one Large Magellanic Cloud– (LMC-) mass system (host mass ∼10 11 M ⊙ ), two Milky Way (MW) analogs (∼10 12 M ⊙ ), two group-mass hosts (∼10 13 M ⊙ ), and one low-mass cluster (∼10 14 M ⊙ ). Each host contains ≈2 × 10 7 particles and is run in CDM and one or more strong, velocity-dependent SIDM models. Our analysis of SIDM (sub)halo populations over seven subhalo mass decades reveals that (1) the fraction of core-collapsed isolated halos and subhalos peaks at a maximum circular velocity corresponding to the transition of the SIDM cross section from a v −4 to v 0 scaling; (2) SIDM subhalo mass functions are suppressed by ≈50% relative to CDM in LMC, MW, and group-mass hosts but are consistent with CDM in the low-mass cluster host; (3) subhalos’ inner density profile slopes, which are more diverse in SIDM than in CDM, are sensitive to both the amplitude and shape of the SIDM cross section. Our simulations provide a benchmark for testing SIDM predictions with astrophysical observations of field and satellite galaxies, strong lensing systems, and stellar streams.

  abstract     = {We present a new spectropolarimetric method for the estimation of the inclination of X-ray binaries using the linear polarization (LP) value in black hole (BH) sources, based on the early paper by R. A. Sunyaev & L. G. Titarchuk. The X-ray LP arises from multiple scattering of initially soft photons in a hot, optically thick Compton cloud (CC) using a flat geometry. R. A. Sunyaev & L. G. Titarchuk showed that the LP degree P depends on the binary inclination i and remains independent of the photon energy. Moreover, P follows a characteristic angular distribution based on the CC optical depth τ 0 ; in particular, for τ 0 > 10, the LP follows the S. Chandrasekhar distribution. In light of the vast number of recent IXPE spectropolarimetric observations of BHs, testing this approach in combination with spectral analysis of these sources by other missions is desirable. In particular, the BH source, 4U 1957+115, was observed with IXPE in the high/soft state for which a P of ∼ 2% was found. To apply the new method, in addition to knowing P for a given source, it is necessary to estimate the CC optical depth τ 0 and then to calculate the best-fit photon index Γ and the plasma temperature kT e . We present the X-ray spectral analysis of 4U 1957+115 using data from IXPE , NuSTAR, NICER, RXTE, Swift, Suzaku, and ASCA. We show that the X-ray source spectra are well described by the Comptonization model with Γ varying from 1.5 to 3. We find a monotonic increase in Γ with the mass accretion rate, \dot{M} , and a final saturation of the index at Γ ∼ 3 for high \dot{M} . We determine a BH mass by the scaling method: M 1957 = 4.8 ± 1.8 M ⊙ , assuming a source distance of 22 kpc, using H 1743–322, 4U 1630–47, and GRS 1915+105 as reference sources.},

Using different analysis methods, such as a space-integrated study of the entire region of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and a space-resolved polarization map, we detect significant polarization from the PWN at the center of the SNR, with an average polarization degree of ∼10% oriented at ∼33° (north through east). No significant energy-dependent variation in polarization is observed across the IXPE band (2–8 keV). The polarization map, corrected for the effect of polarization leakage, reveals a consistent pattern in both degree and angle, with little change across the nebula. Our findings indicate the presence of a highly polarized central torus, suggesting low levels of turbulence at particle acceleration sites. Unlike Vela, but similar to the Crab Nebula, we observe substantial differences between radio and X-ray polarization maps. This suggests a clear separation in energy of the emitting particle populations and hints at an important, yet poorly understood, role of instabilities in the turbulence dynamics of PWNe.},

We model, within the context of Λ cold dark matter, the likelihood of dark matter subhalos to produce a significant feature in a GD-1-like stream and analyze the properties of such subhalos. We generate many realizations of the subhalo population within a Milky Way mass host halo using the semianalytic code SatGen , accounting for effects such as tidal stripping and dynamical friction. The subhalo distributions are combined with a GD-1-like stream model, and the impact of subhalos that pass close to the stream are modeled with Gala . We find that subhalos with masses in the range 2 × 10 6 M ⊙ –10 8 M ⊙ at the time of the stream–subhalo encounter, corresponding to masses of about 2 × 10 7 M ⊙ –10 9 M ⊙ at the time of infall, are the likeliest to produce gaps in a GD-1-like stream. We find that gaps occur on average ∼3 times per realization of the host system. These gaps have typical widths of ∼(5–27)° and fractional underdensities of ∼(10–30)%, with larger gaps being caused by heavier subhalos. The stream–subhalo encounters responsible for these have impact parameters (0.1–1.5) kpc and relative velocities ∼(200–410) km s −1 . We also investigate the effects of increasing the host-halo mass on the gap properties and formation rate.},

These systems will serve as verification sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). To significantly improve the electromagnetic (EM) constraints on these two systems and the LISA detectability predictions, we conducted spectroscopic follow-up observations using Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, Keck I/LRIS, and Keck II/Echellette Spectrograph and Imager. Our analysis significantly improves the temperature, surface gravity, and mass constraints for both primary and secondary components in J2322+0509, as well as dynamical properties such as radial velocities and orbital periods in both systems. For J2322+0509, we derive an updated inclination of i = 25 {}_{-3.0}^{+4.5} deg, while for J0634+3803, we obtain i = 43 {}_{-5.6}^{+7.0} deg. We assess the detectability of these sources using LDASOFT. Incorporating EM priors on inclination significantly enhances the gravitational-wave signal recovery, reducing uncertainties in amplitude by a factor of 2–4 and shortening the detection time by up to a few months. Our results underscore the importance of multimessenger observations in characterizing DWD binaries and maximizing LISA’s early scientific capabilities.},

Current stellar evolution codes, such as MESA, only account for 16 O/ 20 Ne separation and do not include other minor species. To improve this, we implement ternary phase diagrams into MESA. We construct UMWD models with O/Ne/sodium (Na) and O/Ne/magnesium (Mg) cores to test our implementation. We also assess the effect of including 22 Ne in the current two-species framework. Our results show that incorporating additional components into the phase separation significantly alters the chemical evolution of UMWDs. Heavier elements preferentially enrich the solid core, enhancing mixing in the overlying liquid. We compute the buoyancy flux driven by compositional instabilities during crystallization. As in previous studies, we find two convective regimes: an early, fast overturning convection, lasting less than a million years, followed by inefficient (thermohaline) convection. The fast convective regime lasts up to 100 times longer with three-species separation compared to the standard 16 O/ 20 Ne case. We find that neutron-rich species can have a significant contribution to the buoyancy flux despite their small mass fraction (<10%). We compute the amount of cooling delay induced by phase separation in UMWDs, and find that the three-species phase separation produces a delay of up to ∼10 times larger than the simplest case of fractionation, although still less than 1 Gyr. We predict that the change in the composition profile in the liquid region when three components are included should change the frequency of gravity modes that can propagate in the interior of pulsating UMWDs.},

  abstract     = {About two-thirds of disk galaxies host spiral arms, ranging from well-delineated grand-design spirals to fragmented flocculent spiral galaxies. We introduce fractal dimension D B as a nonparametric measure to distinguish between grand-designs and flocculents. We calculate the D B of 197 grand-designs and 322 flocculents from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR18, using the samples of R. J. Buta et al. ( 2015 ) and S. Sarkar et al. ( 2023 ). Our calculated median values of D B are 1.2{9}_{-0.04}^{+0.06} and 1.3{8}_{-0.06}^{+0.05} for the grand-designs and flocculents, respectively. In addition, a Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K-S) test rejects the null hypothesis that these distributions are drawn from the same population. Finally, using a random forest model, we compare the effectiveness of D B in classifying spiral arm morphology with that of five other parameters: the total atomic hydrogen H I mass, M HI; the ratio of atomic hydrogen mass to blue luminosity, M HI / L B ; concentration index, C i ; clumpiness, S ; and arm contrast, C . Our results indicate that D B has the highest feature index (30.8%), followed by C i (26.0%) and M HI (21.0%). In fact, C—the metric routinely used to distinguish between the spiral morphologies—has a feature importance of 8.3%. Further, D B for grand-designs is found to anticorrelate with the central velocity dispersion with a correlation coefficient of −0.3 and p ≪ 0.05. The high value of central velocity dispersion indicates a central Q -barrier, which favors the formation of grand-designs according to the density wave theory. Thus, the fractal dimension serves as a robust metric to distinguish between spiral morphologies and also links to the formation mechanism of the spiral features.},

This work considers the generation of a Biermann battery magnetic flux in the deep solar interior and the potential transport of that magnetic flux outward by diffusion. At low latitudes, we expect this additional flux to interact with the flux generated at the base of the convective zone to result in the solar magnetic field observed near the ecliptic. At high latitudes, the diffused flux may manifest as scattered regions of intense polar fields that could be measured by appropriate instruments on spacecraft far off the ecliptic.},

  abstract     = {Using a time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we demonstrated the lunar limb compression caused by the core-induced magnetic field. When a sudden change occurs in the upstream interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), an induced response is generated within the Moon’s conductive core. When the direction of the IMF jump is the same as the IMF direction after the jump, a diamagnetic current is driven inside the core, strengthening the magnetic field beneath the lunar surface but outside the core. In most dayside regions, this induced subsurface magnetic pressure is suppressed by the strong solar wind dynamic pressure. However, in regions near the terminator, where the solar wind dynamic pressure is lower, this induced subsurface magnetic pressure can compress the solar wind above the lunar surface, forming limb compression structures around the Moon. This work not only clarifies a new physical mechanism for the source of the lunar limb compression (driven by the core-induced magnetic field rather than the crustal magnetic field) but also ascertains the starting position of the limb compression, as well as its temporal variation during the IMF jump. These results can greatly improve our understanding of the Moon’s electromagnetic environment and have potential applications to constrain the conductive state of lunar core.},

Here, we report 1.2 mm continuum and molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in the star-forming region N 160, which we named N 160A–mm. We identify six 1.2 mm continuum sources, four of which are associated with methanol (CH 3 OH) emission. Another COM, methyl cyanide (CH 3 CN) is associated with the brightest source, N 160A–mm A, the most chemically rich source in the field. Using the XCLASS software, we perform spectral modeling to estimate rotational temperatures and total column densities of detected molecular species for four sources. Based on the temperature exceeding 100 K, its small size, and high H 2 number density, we identify N 160A–mm A as a hot core. We compare the molecular abundances of this newly detected hot core with those previously detected in the LMC and SMC, as well as with a sample of Galactic hot cores, and discuss the complex nature of N 160A–mm A.},

Over the ∼60 day duration reported here, the integrated pulse profile remained consistently stable, exhibiting a single, narrow peak with a small precursor component and no evidence of a postcursor one. This pulse profile is in sharp contrast to the double-peaked morphology observed during an observing campaign ∼120 days preceding ours. Along with this change in the integrated pulse profile shape, we also measured a slower spin-down rate ( \dot{\nu } ) compared to the end of that preceding campaign. Together, these differences suggest that a mode-switching event likely occurred between the end of that campaign and the start of ours. Finally, we derived a phase-connected timing solution from our data, from which we inferred a characteristic age of τ c ∼ 2500 yr—about 2.5 times older than the most recent published estimate—and a surface dipole magnetic field strength of B field ∼ 1 × 10 14 G, nearly 3 times weaker. These updated estimates reflect the short-term variations in the magnetar’s spin-down rate, from which both its age and magnetic field strength are inferred, rather than intrinsic changes in the magnetar itself.},

However, uncertainties in scaling relations that connect cluster mass to observables like X-ray luminosity and temperature remain a significant challenge. In this paper, we present the results of an extensive investigation of 329 simulated clusters from IllustrisTNG300 cosmological simulations. Our analysis involves cross-correlating dark matter and the hot X-ray-emitting gas, considering both the 3D and 2D projected distributions to account for projection effects. We demonstrate that this approach is highly effective in evaluating the dynamical state of these systems and validating the often-utilized assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, which is key for inferring cluster masses and constructing scaling relations. Our study revisits both the X-ray luminosity–mass and X-ray temperature–mass scaling relations, and demonstrates how the scatter in these relations correlates with the clusters’ dynamical state. We demonstrate that matter–gas coherence enables the identification of an optimal set of relaxed clusters, reducing scatter in scaling relations by up to 40%. This innovative approach, which integrates higher-dimensional insights into scaling relations, might offer a new path to further reduce uncertainties in determining cosmological parameters from galaxy clusters.},

We demonstrate that the coronal cells, previously documented in the magnetically closed regions, and coronal plumes, inside CHs, are a particular manifestation of ubiquitous cells. The cell properties depend on the magnetic field intensity at their footpoint and connectivity in the corona, either closing in opposite-polarity regions (CF-cells) or extending to form open field (OF-cells). The OF-cells reach size scales on the order of supergranules and are characterized by dark lanes delimiting ray-like features both showing, at different levels, persistent jetlike ejections. The cells’ lifetime mirrors that of magnetic flux concentrations revealed by magnetograms, slowly emerging and then disappearing in a matter of a few hours to a few days in a one-to-one correspondence. When a cell forms along the CH boundary, it can alter the CH boundary by shrinking or expanding the CH by an approximately supergranular cell unit. Therefore, coronal cells can contribute to the dynamics of the CH boundary. We contextualize these observations in a “coronal cell” theory potentially able to provide an explanation for fine-scale coronal structures and jetting activity in polar CHs.},

  abstract     = {Stellar flares are frequently accompanied by prominence eruptions, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and other forms of plasma motion. Based on the long-term high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring data set of the RS CVn-type star II Pegasi (II Peg), we search for stellar prominence eruptions and potential CMEs by investigating asymmetric signatures in the H α and H β line profiles during the flare events. We observed seven optical flares with asymmetric spectral profiles, releasing low limit energies of 10 33 –10 34 erg in the H α line. Five of these flares were associated with six potential CMEs, identified through the Doppler-shifted emission signatures in the chromospheric line profiles, particularly the H α line. The mass estimates for the CME candidates range from 10 19 to 10 20 g, while the kinetic energies are calculated to be around 10 33 –10 34 erg. The most massive CME candidate was simultaneously recorded in the H α , H β , and He i D 3 lines. For II Peg, the possible flare–CME association rate is about 30%. There were also some redshifted excess absorption signatures in the H α line profiles. These signatures could not only be observed in the flaring spectra but also in the spectra without flare, which could be interpreted as features resulting from flare-driven coronal rain and quiescent rain, respectively.},

  abstract     = {We present a study of HerS-3, a dusty star-forming galaxy at z spec = 3.0607, which is gravitationally amplified into an Einstein cross with a fifth image of the background galaxy seen at the center of the cross. Detailed 1 mm spectroscopy and imaging with NOEMA and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array resolve the individual images and show that each of the five images display a series of molecular lines that have similar central velocities, unambiguously confirming that they have identical redshifts. The Hubble Space Telescope F110W image reveals a foreground lensing group of four galaxies with a photometric redshift z phot ∼ 1.0. Lens models that only include the four visible galaxies are unable to reproduce the properties of HerS-3. By adding a fifth massive component, lying southeast of the brightest galaxy of the group, the source reconstruction is able to match the peak emission, shape, and orientation for each of the five images. The fact that no galaxy is detected near that position indicates the presence of a massive dark matter halo in the lensing galaxy group. In the source plane, HerS-3 appears as an infrared luminous starburst galaxy seen nearly edge on. The serendipitous discovery of this exceptional Einstein cross offers a potential laboratory for exploring at small spatial scales a nuclear starburst at the peak of cosmic evolution and studying the properties of a massive dark matter halo associated with the lensing galaxy group.},

  abstract     = {Observations and theoretical simulations suggest that the large-scale environment plays a significant role in how galaxies form and evolve and, in particular, whether and when galaxies host an actively accreting supermassive black hole in their center (i.e., an active galactic nucleus; AGN). One signature of AGN activity is luminosity variability, which appears in the mid-IR when circumnuclear dust reprocesses UV and optical photons from the AGN accretion disk. We present here a suite of constraints on the fraction of AGN activity in the most underdense regions of the Universe (cosmic voids) relative to the rest of the Universe (cosmic walls) by using ∼12 yr of combined multiepoch data from AllWISE and NEOWISE to quantify mid-IR variability. We find clear evidence for a larger mid-IR variability−AGN fraction among high- and moderate-luminosity void galaxies compared to their wall counterparts. We also show that mid-IR variability identifies a rather large and unique population of AGNs, the majority of which have eluded detection using more traditional AGN selection methods such as single-epoch mid-IR color selection. The fraction of these newly recovered AGNs is larger among galaxies in voids, suggesting once again more prolific AGN activity in the most underdense large-scale structures of the Universe.},

  abstract     = {We present a comprehensive analysis of planetary radius ordering within multiplanet systems, namely their ordinal position with respect to their size in a given system, utilizing data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. In addition, we consider not only the ordinal positions but also the specific period ratios and radius ratios of planetary pairs in multiplanet systems. We explore various dependencies on stellar host type and metallicity, as well as planetary type, and explore the differences between planetary systems with different planet multiplicities and different planetary pairs in the same system. Focusing on Kepler systems with two to four planets, we account for observational biases and uncover a robust trend of smaller inner planets. This trend is particularly pronounced in inner pairs of three-planet systems and exhibits variations in stellar metallicity and planet multiplicity. Notably, we find that the distribution of inner-to-outer planet radius ratios depends on the systems’ metallicities, suggesting a link between the initial conditions and the resulting system architecture. Interestingly, planet pairs in resonance do not exhibit significantly different size ratios compared to nonresonant pairs, challenging current theoretical expectations, again, possibly suggesting that initially resonant systems could have been later destabilized. Our findings align with planet formation and migration models where larger planets form farther out and migrate inward. Importantly, we emphasize the significance of planet ordering as a novel and crucial observable for constraining planet formation and evolution models. The observed patterns offer unique insights into the complex interplay of formation, migration, and dynamical interactions shaping planetary systems.},

On 2024 May 10, after the arrival of the ICME shock at 17:04 UT, a Forbush Decrease (FD) was seen in various Neutron Monitor (NM) stations located worldwide. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of neutron data from 28 NM stations and gamma-ray data obtained from the NaI(Tl) detector at Maitri, Antarctica. The present paper reports for the first time about an ICME shock-sheath related enhancement of ∼3%–5% magnitude in the neutron flux at stations with geomagnetic rigidity between 4 and 7 GV, located at higher altitudes (≥1000 m). For these stations, the high-rigidity ends of the asymptotic trajectories are confined to the midnight to the postmidnight region. It appears that the increase may be associated with magnetospheric particle precipitation triggered by the passage of the ICME shock-sheath. The variation of FD amplitude with rigidity shows a decreasing trend in general, with a minimum amplitude at 5–7 GV, which we attribute to the location of field-aligned currents (FACs). The FD amplitude is found to have the effects of storm-time westward ring current, FACs, and magnetospheric dynamics, in addition to the ICME parameters. During the recovery phase of FD, enhancement is observed between 01:50 and 03:00 UT on 2024 May 11, which coincided with Ground Level Enhancement (GLE#74). The GLE # 74 was coeval with the strong SYM-H index and the sudden recovery of the FD due to reduced interplanetary magnetic field, which might be responsible for the observed enhancement at high rigidity stations.},

Our RT models successfully reproduced the Mg ii emission line profiles for all galaxies, revealing a necessary condition for strong LyC leakage: high maximum clump outflow velocity ( {v}_{{\rm{MgII}},{\rm{\max }}}\gtrsim 390\,{\rm{km}}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1} ) and low total Mg ii column density ( N MgII, tot ≲ 10 14.3 cm −2 ). These two parameters have the strongest influence on the emergent Mg ii profile. For the six galaxies with archival HST data, our Ly α modeling shows that their spectral properties do not consistently match conventional LyC leakage criteria. A direct comparison of the best-fit Mg ii and Ly α model parameters reveals no clear correlations in clump outflow velocities, column densities, or volume filling factors, suggesting that H i and Mg ii may not be kinematically or spatially coherent. The inferred LyC escape fraction from Ly α modeling is primarily governed by the number of optically thick H i clumps per sightline ( f cl ). Intriguingly, two galaxies with low observed LyC leakage exhibited the highest RT-inferred LyC escape fractions, due to having the lowest f cl values, driven by strong Ly α blue peaks. Future spatially resolved observations will be crucial for resolving this puzzle. Our results support a “picket fence” CGM geometry over a “density-bounded” scenario, where high Mg ii outflow velocities and low Mg ii column densities trace low-density H i channels that facilitate LyC escape.},

  abstract     = {Modern slitless spectroscopic surveys such as Euclid and Roman collect vast numbers of galaxy spectra, but their low signal-to-noise ratios often lead to incorrect redshift assignments when relying on a single emission line. This misidentification, commonly caused by noise spikes or nontarget emission-line contamination, results in redshift interlopers . We present a machine learning method to mitigate interloper effects at the level of cosmological summary statistics, focusing on the power spectrum monopole as a test case. Using halo catalogs from the Quijote simulations as galaxy proxies, we simulate interlopers by displacing a fraction of halos by redshift offsets between target and interloper populations. This yields contaminated catalogs spanning a wide cosmological parameter space. We train a neural network on the power spectrum monopole, alone or combined with the bispectrum monopole, from contaminated mocks to estimate the interloper fraction and reconstruct the cleaned power spectrum. We assess performance in two scenarios: one with fixed cosmology and one where cosmological parameters vary. In the fixed case, the method recovers the interloper fraction and corrects the power spectrum to 1% accuracy. When cosmology varies, performance degrades, but including bispectrum information improves results, reducing interloper fraction errors and correcting with 2% accuracy. We also analyze how the size of the training set and the correlation between target and interloper populations affect performance. When these samples are uncorrelated, bispectrum information is more beneficial; when strongly correlated, tighter cosmological priors offer greater improvements. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning to enhance cosmological inference in contaminated spectroscopic data sets.},

Utilizing a force-free jet model that considers exclusively the relativistic plasma dynamics along large-scale magnetic fields attached onto the central black hole, we examine the effects of asymmetric plasmoid injections within the subparsec jet. At subparsec scales, the jet velocity is predominantly influenced by poloidal velocity, leading to distinctive characteristics in both the morphology and trajectories of the plasmoids injected within the jet. We explore the potential modifications to the limb-brightened subparsec jet images resulting from the injection of asymmetric, shearing plasma, which is traditionally considered solely under conditions of stationary and symmetric mass loading. By comparing the model jet properties with the 43 GHz observations of the M87 jet, it is suggested that the asymmetric injection of plasmoids within the jet offers a satisfactory explanation for the observed velocity variations and morphological dynamics of the M87 jet.},

  abstract     = {The Earth–Moon libration points no longer exhibit the dynamical characteristics of “equilibrium points” due to perturbation effects when applying the ephemeris model. By decoupling the forced motions within the ephemeris model and computing the dynamical substitute trajectories, we can reconstruct a dynamical system that recovers the “equilibrium points” feature. Diverging from the conventional analytical approach rooted in the framework of Newtonian mechanics, this paper presents a novel method for calculating dynamical substitute based on the Hamiltonian mechanics framework. First, the Hamiltonian equations for the ephemeris model are formulated. Subsequently, the problem of decoupling forced motions is reformulated as solving a nonautonomous differential equation through canonical transformations. Then, an iterative method based on frequency analysis is employed for the computation. Eventually, approximate analytical solutions for five libration points over a 360 yr period are provided. Simulation results demonstrate that the computed approximate analytical solutions are in excellent agreement with the numerical integration results derived from the ephemeris model, thereby validating the efficacy of the proposed method. The Hamiltonian dynamical system derived herein enables the analysis of nonlinear central manifold motions via canonical transformations, facilitating the construction of higher-order analytical solutions for libration point orbits. This framework also provides a robust foundation for exploring characterization parameters of libration point orbits within the real Earth–Moon system.},

ALMA CO and SiO trace both lobes of the bipolar jet, revealing high-velocity collimated jets and wider outflow components. JWST/MIRI detects mainly the blueshifted lobe; the redshifted side is likely obscured by strong mid-infrared extinction. Shorter-wavelength MIRI H 2 rotational lines (S(7)–S(4)) trace compact jet structures resembling SiO emission, while longer-wavelength lines (S(3)–S(1)) reveal more extended emission akin to low-velocity CO. From H 2 rotational emission, we identify two molecular gas temperature components: warm (∼773 ± 44 K) and hot (∼2499 ± 721 K). Using the ortho-to-para ratio, we estimate visual extinction A V ≈ 23.3 ± 2.5 mag.

In this paper, we present a multiepoch search and detailed timing analysis of millisecond pulsars in the GC M2, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. We have discovered two new binary millisecond pulsars in M2, designated M2F and M2G. We provide measurements of the emission properties of all known pulsars in M2, including their polarization profiles, rotation measures (RMs), flux densities, scintillation characteristics, and so forth. In particular, we report the first RM at the distance and direction of this cluster. Additionally, we report the first phase-coherent timing solutions for the M2 pulsars. From our Bayesian timing analysis, we have measured their spin and orbital parameters with high precision, including the advance of periastron for M2A and M2E indicating total system masses of 1.75(13) and 1.80(5) solar masses, respectively. Using archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope, we have identified an optical counterpart of M2C, which is likely the white dwarf companion of the pulsar. By combining results from optical and radio observations, we have reconstructed the binary evolution track of this system and estimated the cooling age of the companion to be approximately 10 Myr, making it the youngest white dwarf in any known GC binary pulsars. Furthermore, using the spin period derivatives of M2 pulsars, we have investigated the gravitational potential of the cluster and found that our results strongly support the latest central stellar velocity dispersion measurement in M2.},

We constructed semi-phase-coherent timing solutions for pre- and postglitch epochs, allowing for phase alignment of multi-instrument data and a subsequent measurement of the pulsed spectrum of the pulsar. This analysis confirmed previously reported spectral curvature and revealed a peak energy of 7{3}_{-26}^{+85} keV in the pulsar’s spectral energy distribution (SED), based on a logpar model fit of the pulsed spectrum. We discuss these findings within the framework of pulsar magnetospheric emission scenarios. The PWN’s X-ray spectrum is well described by a power law with a photon index of 2.1 ± 0.3, softer than previously reported measurements. We also characterized the X-ray emission from another extended X-ray source AX J1837.3−0652 within the extent of HESS J1837−069. Based on the spatial and spectral properties of these X-ray sources, we propose a leptonic emission scenario for HESS J1837−069 and demonstrate its feasibility through SED modeling. Finally, we discuss the implications of our model results and alternative scenarios for the gamma-ray emission.},

  abstract     = {Most X-ray pulsars in high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) systems exhibit both global and local trends of spin acceleration (spin-up) and deceleration (spin-down). Moreover, decades-long monitored objects display even more general spin-up trends in their spin evolution and simultaneously demonstrate a decrease in the orbital period, so-called orbital decay. Although obvious, this general behavior leaves open the question of the energy source and the mechanism of angular momentum transfer that ensures the neutron star’s (NS's) spin acceleration. We hypothesize that the observed spin acceleration of X-ray pulsars in HMXB (Roche lobe overflow and sgXRB) systems results from orbital angular momentum transfer via tidal interactions with their massive companions. To study these phenomena, we sample five well-studied objects with the longest observational history of their spin periods from the population of known Galactic persistent X-ray pulsars in HMXB systems. We obtain the spin frequency change from the observational data and estimate energy loses for orbital decay and pulsars’ spin acceleration. We propose a new term of super-global spin-up trends, and show that their observable values do not exceed theoretical upper limits predicted within the scenario of orbital decay due to the tidal interaction between the NS and its massive companion.},

  abstract     = {Switchbacks are structures in the solar wind marked by large rotations in the magnetic field direction without significant changes in its magnitude, typically accompanied by enhanced bulk speed. Parker Solar Probe (PSP) measurements have established the switchback as a prominent feature of the near-Sun solar wind. Detailed observations have shed light on switchback properties, leading to various proposed mechanisms for their generation. However, one key aspect that remains unexplored is the distribution of the tangential bulk velocity within switchbacks. A particular challenge has been accurately determining the tangential component of the plasma flow in the near-Sun plasma. With the most recent Solar Probe Cup measurements, it has been possible to gather sufficient statistics of proton tangential speed data in near-Sun solar wind switchbacks. This is important because some switchback models, particularly those involving solar wind interactions, predict that the tangential velocity should exhibit a strong one-sided polarity inside switchbacks. In this study, we examine the tangential component of the bulk velocity inside switchbacks during PSP encounters. Our findings reveal that switchbacks preferentially exhibit a positive tangential bulk velocity, strongly supporting the hypothesis that the majority of switchbacks are generated by the interaction of slow and fast wind across a superspiral outside the Alfvén critical point.},

Among solar wind parameters, dynamic pressure, as the dominant external pressure, plays a key role in shaping the pressure level and structures in the downstream induced magnetosphere. In this study, a multispecies global magnetohydrodynamic model is used to investigate Mars’s response to a series of idealized solar wind dynamic pressure enhancements with varying durations and magnitudes, aiming to capture responses in different plasma regions and isolate the effects of dynamic pressure. For the subsolar region, the simulations reveal a sequence of response phases, each exhibiting distinct temporal characteristics. Beyond the subsolar region, the terminator ionosphere and global ion escape show prolonged disturbances. These results highlight the importance of short-term upstream variability in shaping both local and global features of the Martian plasma environment and provide context for interpreting spacecraft observations that sample only limited regions of the system.},

Here we study the detailed evolution of flare ribbons down to the arcsecond scale for 10 flares characterized by the classic double ribbons. Identifying the flaring pixels by combining the intensity variances of the UV filter ratio and an intensity threshold, we found that the waiting time distributions of the flaring pixels are well described by power laws, distinct from those in the preflare or quiet-Sun regions, and that the power-law slopes are generally consistent with those predicted by nonstationary Poisson processes in the nonlinear regime or by the 2D/3D self-organized criticality (SOC) model. The size distributions for flaring duration also follow power laws but the slopes are more scattered. In contrast, the size distributions for other parameters, including peak intensity, energy, and radial magnetic field strength of the flaring pixels, deviate from power laws, and the estimated slopes significantly differ from the SOC predictions. These results suggest that a nonstationary Poisson process or an avalanche-like process might be ongoing temporally in the reconnecting current sheet, but in other aspects, e.g., space- and energy-wise, the avalanche is likely modulated by other physical processes or the fine structures of the reconnecting current sheet.},

Additionally, we have discovered a new binary millisecond pulsar, namely M13I (or PSR J1641+3627I) in GC M13 (or NGC 6205), and obtained its phase-coherent timing solution using observations spanning 6 yr. M13I has a spin period of 6.37 ms and an orbital period of 18.23 days. The eccentricity of the binary orbit is 0.064, with a companion mass range of approximately 0.45 to 1.37 M ⊙ .

  abstract     = {JWST has revealed a population of compact and extremely red galaxies at z ≳ 4, which likely host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We present a sample of 434 “little red dots” (LRDs), selected from the 0.54 deg 2 COSMOS-Web survey. We fit galaxy and AGN spectral energy distribution models to derive redshifts and physical properties; the sample spans z ∼ 5–9 after removing brown dwarf contaminants. As a thought experiment, we consider two extreme physical scenarios: either LRDs are all AGNs, and their continuum emission is dominated by the accretion disk, or they are all compact star-forming galaxies, and their continuum is dominated by stars. If LRDs are AGN-dominated, our sample exhibits bolometric luminosities ∼10 45−47 erg s −1 , spanning the gap between JWST AGNs in the literature and bright, rare quasars. We derive a bolometric luminosity function (LF) ∼ 100 times the (UV-selected) quasar LF, implying a nonevolving black hole accretion density of ∼10 −4 M ⊙ yr −1 Mpc −3 from z ∼ 2–9. By contrast, if LRDs are dominated by star formation, we derive stellar masses ∼10 8.5−10 M ⊙ . MIRI/F770W is key to deriving accurate stellar masses; without it, we derive a mass function inconsistent with Λ cold dark matter. The median stellar mass profile is broadly consistent with the maximal surface densities seen in the nearby Universe, though the most massive objects exceed this limit, requiring substantial AGN contribution to the continuum. Nevertheless, stacking all available X-ray, mid-IR, far-IR/submillimeter, and radio data yields nondetections. Whether dominated by dusty AGNs or compact star-formation, the high masses/luminosities and remarkable abundance of LRDs implies a dominant mode of early galaxy/SMBH growth.},

We present a new approach to determining the Milky Way’s integrated mass and colors, using recent measurements of the intrinsic density profiles of stellar populations spanning nearly 13 Gyr in time and 1.5 dex in metallicity (representing nearly all of the Galaxy’s stars). We trace the evolution of the Milky Way in various diagnostic spaces, explore the impact of specific events on the present-day Milky Way’s integrated properties, and use TNG50 simulations to identify “young” Galactic analogs and their eventual fates, compared to the real Milky Way’s path. From the simulation comparisons, we find strong evidence for an earlier-than-average stellar mass assembly of the Milky Way, and that present-day Milky Way analogs follow a similar growth history, albeit at slightly later times; we also find that analogs of the early Milky Way are in no way guaranteed to follow the Milky Way's subsequent path. This empirical study offers new constraints on our “Galaxy as a galaxy”—today and across cosmic time—and on its place in the general galactic population.},

Our approach selects line emitters as NB excess objects and we use the COSMOS2020 photometric redshift catalog to eliminate potential low-redshift interlopers whose line emission (e.g., [O III ] at z ∼ 0.3) might be responsible for the observed excess in the narrow band. In comparison with the LAE density in the field, our results point to a mean LAE number overdensity of \bar{\delta }=3 spanning a region of 27 × 20 × 36 cMpc 3 , probably evolving into a moderate-mass cluster ((3–10) × 10 14 M ⊙ ) at z ∼ 0.

  abstract     = {We explore whether Local Group dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies might have hosted Earth-like planets dwelling unexposed for several billions of years to major galactic threats to life, such as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. To this aim, we developed a novel semiempirical model that exploits the observed chemical abundances and star formation histories of a selected sample of local dSphs, to explore whether their stars may have (i) reached the minimum metallicity to trigger planet formation and (ii) avoided exposure to destructive events long enough to provide time for possible biological development. From our work two scenarios emerge. If planet formation is possible for [Fe/H] ≲ −1, then in all dSphs with 5 × 10 3 L ⊙ ≤ L V ≤ 2 × 10 7 L ⊙ a fraction ≈0.1%–10% of stars might have safely hosted terrestrial planets for more than 1 Gyr. In this scenario, ancient ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDs, L V ≤ 10 5 L ⊙ ) would have been the first to reach this condition in the history of the Local Group. Conversely, if planets form for [Fe/H] ≥ −0.6 then they should not exist in UFDs, while only ≈0.001%–0.1% of stars in dSphs with L V ≥ 3 × 10 5 L ⊙ would host planets dwelling in safe conditions for long times. Interestingly, we find a “luminosity sweet spot” at L V ∼ 10 6 L ⊙ , where dSphs in our sample safely host terrestrial planets up to 4 Gyr and in any planet formation scenario explored. In conclusion, planet formation at low metallicity is key to understanding which types of galaxies might have formed Earth-like planets that dwelt unexposed to galactic threats over several billions of years, first in the history of the Local Group.},

A particularly strong observational connection is present between neutrinos and blazars with bright, Doppler-boosted, parsec-scale radio emission. In this work, we further explore the nature of this connection by examining the jet geometry and kinematics of neutrino-associated blazars. We find that these blazars demonstrate remarkably strong jet beaming, even compared to other radio-bright sources. Their Doppler and Lorentz factors are larger, and viewing angles are smaller than for other blazars in the complete uniformly selected MOJAVE sample. Observationally, this serves as yet another piece of evidence for blazars forming a major population of neutrino sources. The strong neutrino–beaming correlation indicates that high-energy neutrino velocity is predominantly oriented along the jet, and the original PeV-scale protons exhibit a relativistic bulk motion along the jet. It suggests that neutrino production happens not too close to the black hole, but rather at subparsec distances, where the jet is already accelerated.},

This results in a photometric redshift z phot = 10.2 ± 0.2 (95% confidence) with no significant likelihood below z < 9.8. Based on spectral energy distribution fitting to the total photometry, we estimate an intrinsic stellar mass of M * ∼ 2.4–5.6 × 10 7 M ⊙ , young mass-weighted age of ∼21–79 Myr, low dust content ( A V < 0.15), and a low metallicity of ≲1% Z ⊙ . We identify a fainter third counterimage candidate within 2 \mathop{.}\limits{^{\prime\prime} } 2 of the predicted position, lensed to AB mag 28.4 and magnified by μ ∼ 2, suggesting the fold arc may only show ∼60% of the galaxy. SPT0615-JD is a unique laboratory to study star clusters observed within a galaxy just 460 Myr after the Big Bang.},

In this work, we combined archival and novel Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy from a southern extension of the Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda’s Stellar Halo (SPLASH) survey with optical HST imaging from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Southern Treasury (PHAST) survey.

Given the structurally complex region near M32 on the sky, we modeled M32’s line-of-sight kinematics simultaneously alongside M31’s rotating stellar disk and potential outliers corresponding to M31’s kinematically hot stellar halo and/or tidal substructure. Inside the radius corresponding to the observed twisting of isophotal contours in M32’s surface brightness profile ( R iso ∼ 5 r eff ∼ 150” or 0.56 kpc), M32 exhibits a line-of-sight velocity distribution characteristic of ordered rotation, transitioning to a distribution with heavier outliers beyond this radius. Within R iso , the rotational direction is aligned with M32’s major-axis rotation, but shifts to become roughly aligned with M32’s minor axis beyond R iso . We interpret these kinematical signatures in the stellar outskirts of M32 as evidence of tidal distortion from interactions with M31 and discuss their implications for M32 formation pathways.},

  abstract     = {The globular cluster Palomar 5 (Pal 5) is in the process of being tidally shredded as it orbits the Milky Way. Its core is currently at a heliocentric distance of ∼21 kpc, near apogalacticon (∼18 kpc), and it reaches ∼5–7 kpc at perigalacticon. Pal 5’s leading and trailing arms stretch over 20° on the sky, making them sensitive probes of the Milky Way’s mass distribution. In this work, we search for red giant members of Pal 5 using spectroscopic data from APOGEE DR17 and photometric and astrometric data from Gaia data release 3. Based on position and proper motion, we identify eight members of Pal 5: six in the core and two in the stream. The clustering algorithm HDBSCAN finds these same eight. We then use chemical tagging with APOGEE abundances to search for additional members across five APOGEE fields overlapping Pal 5. While several dozen candidates are identified, most deviate (some significantly) from known kinematic and color–magnitude trends, suggesting that they are less likely to be true members. We estimate the expected number of giants in the APOGEE pointings based on the area and stellar mass of the streams. Given APOGEE’s limiting magnitude, we find that few, if any, new giants are expected, especially if the stream is more diffuse at these locations. Our results support the presence of density variations in Pal 5’s tidal streams, consistent with earlier studies attributing such features to baryonic perturbers in the Milky Way, dark matter subhalos, or interactions with passing globular clusters.},

  abstract     = {A weakly magnetized neutron star (NS) undergoing disk accretion should release about half of its power in a compact region known as the accretion boundary layer. Latitudinal spread of the accreted matter and efficient radiative cooling justify the approach to this flow as a two-dimensional spreading layer (SL) on the surface of the star. Numerical simulations of SLs are challenging because of the curved geometry and supersonic nature of the problem. We develop and test a new two-dimensional hydrodynamics code, SPLASH , which uses the multislope second-order Monotonic Upstream-centered Scheme for Conservation Law scheme in combination with an HLLC+ Riemann solver on an arbitrary irregular mesh on a spherical surface. The code is suitable and accurate for Mach numbers up to 5–10. Adding sinks and sources to the conserved variables, we simulate early stages of constant-rate accretion onto a spherical NS. During these stages of accretion, heating in the equatorial region triggers convective instability that causes rapid mixing in the latitudinal direction. One of the outcomes of the instability is the development of a “tennis ball” pattern rotating at a frequency considerably different from the rotation frequency of the matter. In the simulated variability curves, there are signatures of both the pattern rotation and the rotation of the SL, as well as their harmonics. The pattern and cyclonal vortices associated with it are probably a manifestation of an inertial oscillation mode excited within the layer ( https://github.com/TURBOLOSE/SPLASH ).},

By combining these new data with archival observations, we confirm previous suggestions of orbital variability in the source’s X-ray spectrum, including increased X-ray absorption at the orbital phase interval of ϕ ≈ 0.3–0.4. The source’s X-ray flux within this phase interval seems to have exhibited a significant change on an orbital timescale. Additionally, occasional short-term variations in the X-ray band on a timescale of less than 3 days have been observed. The measured duration of the increased absorbing column density and the flux variability timescales can provide clues about the interaction between the putative pulsar and the Be companion’s disk if, as previously suggested, the pulsar crosses the disk at this phase interval. Moreover, the new contemporaneous X-ray and TeV observations around the pulsar-crossing phases revealed independent variability in the X-ray and TeV fluxes, contrary to a previous observation of concurrent flux increases. While these observations alone cannot provide definitive conclusions, we discuss our results in the context of pulsar–disk interaction and intrabinary shock emission scenarios.},

We identify 23 likely XRBs within the Two Micron All Sky Survey K S isophotal radius and find the distributions of their dynamic ranges and duty cycles are consistent with a young, high-mass XRB (HMXB) population dominated by supergiant-fed systems, consistent with previous work. In general, we find that brighter HMXBs (those with L X ≳ several ×10 36 erg s −1 ) have higher duty cycles (i.e., are more persistent X-ray sources) than fainter objects, and the dynamic ranges of the sgHMXBs in the lower-metallicity environment of IC 10 are higher than what is observed for comparable systems in the Milky Way. After filtering out foreground stars on the basis of Gaia parallaxes, we construct, for the first time, the XLF of IC 10. We then use the XLF to model the star formation history of the galaxy, finding that a very recent (3–8 Myr) burst of star formation with a rate of ∼0.5 M ⊙ yr −1 is needed to adequately explain the observed bright end ( L X ∼ 10 37 erg s −1 ) of the HMXB XLF.},

  abstract     = {Collisionless electron–ion shocks are fundamental to astrophysical plasmas, yet their behavior in strong magnetic fields remains poorly understood. Using particle-in-cell simulations with the SHARP-1D3V code, we investigate the role of the ion magnetization parameter σ i in parallel shock transitions. Strongly magnetized converging flows ( σ i > 1) exhibit lower-density compression ratios ( R ∼ 2), smaller entropy jumps, and suppressed particle acceleration while maintaining pressure anisotropy stability due to conserved perpendicular temperatures across the transition region, alongside increased parallel temperatures. In contrast, weakly magnetized shocks drive downstream mirror and firehose instabilities due to ion temperature anisotropy, which are suppressed in strongly magnetized cases. Additionally, weakly magnetized shocks exhibit the onset of a suprathermal population induced by shock-drift acceleration, with most of the upstream kinetic energy thermalized for both electrons and ions in the downstream region. Our results demonstrate that perpendicular temperatures for both species are conserved in weakly and strongly magnetized cases and highlight deviations from standard ideal magnetohydrodynamic behavior in strongly magnetized cases. These findings provide critical insights into the role of magnetic fields in parallel collisionless astrophysical shocks.},

Jansky Very Large Array data in the 120–168 MHz and 1–2 GHz ranges, we study the diffuse emission around the nearby dwarf galaxy KUG 1138+327. Our analysis reveals a diffuse X-ray feature on the southern side, disconnected from the galactic disk. This feature exhibits a hard X-ray spectrum, which is highly unusual for an outflow from a dwarf galaxy. We interpret the irregularly shaped feature as hot plasma in a young galaxy cluster at redshift 0.5, supported by X-ray spectral fitting and consistent with the optical redshift of the central elliptical galaxy of a known cluster identified by a red sequence. Additionally, we detect a radio lobe east of the X-ray feature, likely produced by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) offset from the cluster center and confined primarily by ram pressure from the ambient medium. The lobe shows a steep nonthermal radio spectrum, suggesting a cosmic-ray age of ≳5 × 10 7 yr. Assuming energy equipartition between cosmic rays and magnetic fields, we estimate the lobe’s total energy to be ∼9 × 10 56 erg, comparable to the thermal energy in the same volume. This study thus identifies a background young cluster projected next to KUG 1138+327 and highlights the potentially significant role of off-center AGN feedback in shaping the intracluster medium.},

While metal-poor carbon-rich AGB stars are known to produce copious amounts of amorphous carbon dust owing to the dredge up of newly synthesized carbon, this is the first time that Si- and Fe-bearing dust has been detected at this extreme metallicity. Of the six AGB stars observed, one is an intermediate-mass (∼1.2–4 M ⊙ ) carbon star showing SiC dust, and another is an oxygen-rich M-type star with mass ∼4–5 M ⊙ that is likely undergoing hot bottom burning. The infrared excess of the M-type star is strong, but featureless. We tested multiple dust species, and found that it is best fit with metallic iron dust. Assuming its dust-production rate stays constant over the final 2–3 × 10 4 yr of its evolution, this star will produce ∼0.9–3.7 times the iron dust mass predicted by models, with the range depending on the adopted stellar mass. The implications for dust production in high-redshift galaxies are potentially significant, especially regarding the assumed dust species used in dust evolution models and the timescale of AGB dust formation. Stars on the upper end of the AGB mass range can begin producing dust as early as 30–50 Myr after they form, and they may therefore rival dust production by supernovae at high redshift.},

We develop new models of polarized Galactic dust and synchrotron emission at CMB frequencies that draw on the latest observational constraints; that employ the “polarization fraction tensor” framework to couple intensity and polarization in a physically motivated way; and that allow for stochastic realizations of small-scale structure at subarcminute angular scales currently unconstrained by full-sky data. We implement these models into the publicly available Python Sky Model ( PySM ) software and additionally provide PySM interfaces to select models of dust and CO emission from the literature. We characterize the behavior of each model by quantitatively comparing it to observational constraints in both maps and power spectra, demonstrating an overall improvement over previous PySM models. Finally, we synthesize models of the various Galactic foreground components into a coherent suite of three plausible microwave skies that span a range of astrophysical complexity allowed by current data.

Radiation interacts with matter, driving hydrodynamic feedback that further alters the radiation characteristics (energy and angular distribution). This paper reviews the current state of the art in the modeling of inhomogeneous radiation transport, subgrid models developed to capture this often-unresolved physics, and the experiments designed to improve our understanding of these models. This paper focuses on simulations based on upcoming experiments designed to test this physics. We present a series of detailed simulations (both single-clump and multi-clump conditions) probing the dependence on the physical properties of the radiation front (e.g., radiation energy) and material characteristics (specific heat, opacity, clump densities). We find that, unless the radiation pressure is high, the clumps will heat and then expand, effectively cutting off the radiation flow. The expanding winds can also produce shocks that generates high-energy emission. We compare our detailed simulations with some of the current subgrid prescriptions, identifying some of the limitations of these current models.},

Two flares with a separation time of ∼7.2 yr between the two optical peaks are observed. Related mid-infrared (MIR) flares, with delay times of ∼200 days are also seen. We analyze two optical spectra of the TDE source, one near the optical peak of the second flare from the Transient Name Server and one at the quiescent flux level after the second flare. The latter was taken by us with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias. Comparing the features of the two spectra, we identify that the host is likely a composite galaxy at redshift 0.23, and the TDE event, probably an H+He type, mainly powered broad components in the emission lines of H α , H β , and He I λ 5876. More interestingly, we find that two Bronze-type neutrino events, detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory, match the TDE in position and the second flare, especially the delayed MIR flare, in time. We discuss the MIR luminosity properties of the currently reported (candidate) neutrino-emitting TDEs and suggest that luminous MIR emission is a prerequisite for neutrino production in TDEs.},

  abstract     = {A novel phenomenon among the recently observed Geminga pulsar halo is the presence of distinct radiation morphology at high energies, while no extended radiation is detected in the 10–500 GeV energy band within a 40° × 40° region. This phenomenon suggests that pulsar halos play a crucial role in the local propagation of cosmic rays, making it necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. This work focuses on the 3D propagation study of cosmic rays, incorporating the Geminga pulsar into our propagation framework to investigate its contribution to different observational spectra. We consider Geminga a dominant local source of positrons, partially reproducing the observed positron spectrum and multiwavelength radiative spectra of the Geminga halo. Through calculations of signal and background at different angles, we find that: (1) the slow-diffusion properties near the Geminga pulsar and its proper motion may cause the radiation from electrons originating from Geminga to be distributed across a more extended region, and (2) the incomplete subtraction of radiation from the local halo may contribute, to some extent, to the diffuse gamma-ray fluctuations detected by LHAASO. We hope that LHAASO will detect more sources of cosmic-ray halo to further validate our model.},

This is mainly due to the strongly parametrized nature of such investigations. Using a nonparametric model for the joint population-level distributions of BBH component masses and effective inspiral spins, we find hints of multiple subpopulations in the third gravitational-wave transient catalog. The higher (more positive) spin subpopulation is found to have a mass spectrum without any feature at in the 30–40 M ⊙ range, which is consistent with the predictions of isolated stellar binary evolution, simulations for which place the pileup due to pulsational pair-instability supernovae near 50 M ⊙ or higher. The other subpopulation with effective spins closer to zero shows a feature at 30–40 M ⊙ and is consistent with BBHs formed dynamically in globular clusters, which are expected to peak around 30 M ⊙ . We also compute merger rates for these two subpopulations and find that they are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the corresponding formation channels. We validate our results by checking their robustness against variations of several model configurations and by analyzing large simulated catalogs with the same model.},

We investigate the impact of turbulent metal diffusion on multiphase outflows originating from dwarf galaxies ( M halo ∼ 10 10 −10 11 M ⊙ ). We use our state-of-the-art numerical model for the formation of single stars and nonequilibrium cooling and chemistry. We run the simulations at a resolution of ∼4 M ⊙ , and resolve individual supernova explosions in terms of hot phase and momentum input. We find that the mass, energy, and metal loading factors are only weakly affected by the inclusion of a metal diffusion model. The metal enrichment factor at low altitudes above the galactic disk is higher by around 20% when the metal diffusion model is included. Specifically, we find more efficient cooling in the cold interstellar medium, due to more efficient metal mixing that leads to shorter cooling times of the warm gas, which becomes available more quickly for star formation. The most striking effect of the metal diffusion model is that, without metal diffusion, there is more rapid cooling in the hot phase and a reduced sound speed by a factor of 2. Specifically, we find that the hot phase is more metal enriched in the case without metal diffusion leading to more rapid overcooling of that phase, which is consistent with the higher sound speed we find in the runs with metal diffusion.},

  abstract     = {Interior to the orbits of Jupiter’s iconic Galilean moons are four small satellites with individual mean radii R ≲ 84 km. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that these bodies formed at a more distant location in Jupiter’s circumplanetary disk before coming to reside at their current short-period orbits. However, how these moons dynamically evolved to such a location has yet to be explained in the emerging paradigm of Jovian satellite formation. Here, we present a quantitative model for the origin of the largest of these inner moons, Amalthea, that can be extended to its neighbor, Thebe, and to other small bodies in astrophysical disks. We propose that Amalthea’s anomalous features are due to it having formed alongside the Galileans in a reservoir of satellitesimals located at a large Jovian-centric distance. As the innermost Galilean, Io, migrated inward from this reservoir, it captured the satellitesimal Amalthea into resonance and shepherded the small body to its modern neighborhood. During this migration through the disk, dissipative forcing from aerodynamic drag induces overstable librations in the Io–Amalthea resonance, such that only a narrow range of nebular parameters can accommodate the requisite long-range transport. In particular, the disk aspect ratio, h / r , emerges as the key variable. Our calculations indicate that the circumjovian disk had a scale height of h / r ≳ 0.08, implying a relatively hot, actively accreting disk during the epoch of satellite formation. These results thus shed light on the evolution of the Jovian system, along with the more general phenomenon of satellite–disk interactions.},

In this study, we examine two potential scenarios: the gas inflow along the bar and the formation of a bar-induced gaseous nuclear ring. By applying a classical galactic dynamics model, we calculate the radii and rotational velocities of the nuclear rings for all barred DPGs and compare them with the observed properties of their DPSs. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between the predicted radii of the nuclear rings and the maximum centric distances of the DPSs, as well as a marginal correlation between the predicted rotational velocities of the nuclear rings and the observed maximum velocity differences of the DPSs. These findings provide strong evidence to support the hypothesis that the DPSs of a barred DPG in MaNGA primarily originate from the convolution of the point-spread function effect with its bar-induced fast-rotating gaseous nuclear ring.},

In this study, we investigate the jet structure of M84, a nearby radio galaxy and a representative LLAGN, to probe jet collimation properties in the low-accretion regime. Utilizing astrometric phase-referencing observations from the Very Long Baseline Array, supplemented by archival Very Large Array data, we trace the jet geometry of M84 over a broad range of scales, from ∼10 2 to ∼10 7 Schwarzschild radii ( r s ). Our analysis reveals a well-defined transition from a semiparabolic profile, W ( r ) ∝ r 0.71 , to a conical shape, W ( r ) ∝ r 1.16 , occurring at approximately 1.67 × 10 4 r s . This indicates that the M84 jet is notably less collimated than those in other known LLAGN sources. Our findings provide new insights into the relationship between jet collimation and accretion rate, offering crucial constraints for jet formation models of LLAGNs.},

The number, strength, and duration of these pulses can lead to shell collisions that produce shock-powered transients, potentially explaining some of the most luminous events, such as superluminous supernovae, and other rare transients. Rapid progenitor rotation lowers the PPISN mass threshold and influences the dynamics, energetics, and chemical composition of PPISN-driven pulses. In this study, we computed 1D evolutionary models of massive, rotating PPISN progenitor stars with ZAMS masses of 85–140 M ⊙ and metallicities of Z ⊙ and 0.1 Z ⊙ . Our analysis reveals strong correlations between PPISN ejected mass and total energy, as well as between ejected mass and peak ejected shell velocity. Additionally, moderate correlations indicate that higher initial PPISN progenitor mass leads to greater mass ejection and energy release, while negative correlations show that rapid rotation appears to reduce mass ejection and kinetic energy of the shells. Subsequent pulses lead to H-poor, C- and O-enriched ejected shells, indicating the effect of rotationally induced chemical mixing, PPISN-driven episodic mass loss with implications for their transients. We model the light curve and synthetic spectra that arise from the collision of two H-poor shells for one of our models using the radiation transport code SuperLite . We find that shock-heated H-poor PPISN shell collisions from rapidly rotating progenitors can lead to moderately luminous H-poor transients that share some similarities with observed superluminous supernova I events.},

An overview of the broadband spectra of the sources, in combination with the MeerKAT MIGHTEE 1280 MHz data, reveals a clear change in spectral properties at the transition from an active galactic nuclei-dominated population to a population dominated by star-forming galaxies at flux densities of a few mJy. At higher frequencies, the star-forming galaxy population exhibits an optically thin synchrotron spectral index indicative of energy injection from supernovae. At lower frequencies, the spectra flatten significantly with decreasing flux density, and the fraction of sources with peaked spectra increases. This is the first superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release. Subsequent releases will include spectro-polarimetric and spectral line image cubes, as well as images at lower frequencies. The goal of the superMIGHTEE ultra-wideband data set is to enhance our understanding of the evolution of active galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxies over cosmic time, shed light on the evolution of neutral hydrogen, and explore the origins and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields in clusters, filaments, and galaxies.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations are implemented to investigate the energy cascade rate in compressible isothermal magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Utilizing an exact law derived from the Kármán–Howarth equation, we examine the contributions of flux and nonflux terms to the cascade rate across a broad range of sonic and Alfvénic Mach numbers, from subsonic to supersonic regimes and with varying mean magnetic fields. The cascade rates are computed using on-grid 3D decomposition and two plasma increment approaches: signed and absolute values. The anisotropy induced by strong magnetic fields is analyzed through angular-dependent scaling of the cascade terms. Moreover, the increment calculation method significantly influences the relative contributions of the flux and nonflux terms, with absolute methods tending to overestimate the latter. These findings extend current studies of compressible turbulence and offer critical insights into energy transfer mechanisms relevant to many astrophysical phenomena.},

The point-source sequence is more luminous by almost a magnitude than the corresponding sequence in Abell 2744 at z = 0.31, matching the predicted evolutionary change for GC/UCDs over the 4 Gyr difference in look-back time between these two clusters. Deeper observations should allow direct JWST imaging of GC/UCD populations, even without the help of lensing, up to z ∼ 1.4, a look-back time of more than 9 Gyr. Such observations would directly reveal the evolution of these compact stellar systems two-thirds of the way back to the Big Bang.},

Our goal was to detect pulsars that might have been missed in the original survey processing. Of the original 43,842 pointings, 34,869 pointings were archived, along with 440 additional pointings for confirmation or timing. We processed all of these archived data and detected 359 known pulsars: 265 of these were detected in the original survey, while an additional 94 currently known pulsars were detected in our reprocessing. A few among those 94 pulsars are highly accelerated binary pulsars. Furthermore, we detected 5 more pulsars with DMs higher than the original survey thresholds, as well as 6 more pulsars below the nominal survey sensitivity threshold (from the original survey beams with longer integrations). We missed detection of 33 (of the 298) pulsars detected in the original survey, in part because of portions of the survey data missing in the archive and our early-stage candidate sifting method. We discovered one new pulsar in the reanalysis, PSR J0540−69, which has a spin period of 0.909 s and resides in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This new pulsar appeared in three PKS70 beams and one additional L -band observation that targeted the LMC pulsar PSR B0540−69. The numerous pulsar detections found in our reanalysis and the discovery of a new pulsar in the LMC highlight the value of conducting multiple searches through pulsar data sets.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the impact of gravitational wave (GW) emission by a newly born magnetar onto its electromagnetic (EM) counterparts in the Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite (ULTRASAT) band. In particular, we carry out a numerical calculation of magnetar-powered shock breakouts (SBOs) and supernova (SN) light curves. We find that an early SBO peak in the bolometric light curves provides a likely signature of a magnetar central engine, which can help constrain the magnetar’s spin period and magnetic dipole. Moreover, our results show that GW emission by the magnetar has only a minor effect on the SBO light curve. Such SBOs can be detected by ULTRASAT at a rate ∼1–2 yr −1 , provided that the magnetar wind is not efficiently thermalized during the early phases of the evolution. We additionally find that the subsequent SN light curves can be more luminous than SBOs in the ULTRASAT band and can thus be detected at a higher rate. Finally, we find a possible late-time signature of GW emission in the SN light curves, which may provide an additional tool for the detection of GW signals. Our results demonstrate that future ULTRASAT observations will provide crucial insights into the magnetar formation process and unique information for direct searches of long-transient signals with current and future generation GW detectors. In particular, we estimate a rate of multimessenger (UV+GW) detections of newly formed magnetars ≳1 every 2 yr with ULTRASAT and the Einstein Telescope.},

Recent observations have demonstrated systematic excesses of DGE compared with the conventional cosmic-ray propagation model predictions. While gamma-ray emissions have been detected in a subset of globular clusters, their undetected populations may significantly contribute to the DGE. Motivated by this possibility, we present a comprehensive assessment of potential contributions from unresolved globular clusters to the DGE. In our analysis, a nonparametric method is employed to estimate the luminosity function and spatial distribution function of globular clusters using the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) fourth source catalog (4FGL) combined with a reference globular cluster catalog. Based on these distributions, we calculate the cumulative contribution of unresolved globular cluster populations to the DGE observed by Fermi-LAT and the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory. Our results reveal that globular clusters account for only ∼2% of the DGE at the TeV range, and smaller than 1% in the GeV regime, which is effectively negligible.},

  abstract     = {Through studying rotation curves, which depict how the velocity of the stars and gas changes with distance from the center of a galaxy, it has been confirmed that dark matter dominates galaxies’ outer regions, as their rotation curve remains flat. However, recent studies of star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon have shown a decline in their rotation curve beyond a certain point, suggesting a decrease of the abundance of dark matter in galactic halos during earlier times. In this work, we investigate the influence of cosmological surface brightness dimming and loss of resolution on observations of rotation curves at cosmic noon. We used a sample of 19 Lyman break analogs at z ∼ 0.2 and artificially redshifted them as if they were at z ∼ 2.2. By comparing both rotation curves of the observed and mocked objects, we find that the asymmetry of the cosmic noon galaxies is smaller than that of the low- z galaxies. In low- z galaxies, asymmetry increases with radius and becomes relevant at the external parts, where mergers and interactions cause more disturbance in the galaxy’s gravitational field. In contrast, cosmic-noon galaxies appear smoother, smaller, and suitable for dynamical modeling—when in reality they are not. The combined effects of the cosmological bias and loss of resolution lead us to the conclusion that caution should be exercised when using cosmic-noon rotation curves, as they might not accurately trace the gravitational potential of the galaxy.},

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite’s (TESS's) large field of view and continuous observation capabilities make it uniquely positioned to detect and characterize prompt optical flashes from GRBs. In this work, we fit phenomenological models to the gamma-ray through optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 24 bursts with arcsecond-level localizations that fell within the TESS field of view between 2018 July and 2024 December. In four cases, the extrapolation of the high-energy SED agrees with the observed optical flux to within 1 σ . In one case, there is a significant excess of optical flux relative to the extrapolation. In two cases, upper limits from TESS did not constrain the optical portion of the SED. In the remaining 17 cases, the optical flux is overpredicted by the extrapolation from high energies. This discrepancy could be explained by dust extinction in the host galaxy.},

We extend the downward control principle of atmospheric sciences to include compositional stratification. Using a linearized analysis, we show that stable μ -gradients slow down the penetration of circulation into the depths, emphasizing the importance of time-dependent solutions. However, additional effects such as horizontal turbulence or magnetic fields are needed to halt it completely. We also find limits demarcating linear and nonlinear regimes in terms of Schmidt and Rossby numbers. Nonlinear simulations exhibit compositional mixing due to meridional currents, enabling deeper penetration than otherwise. We propose slowly evolving and steady-state scenarios for the solar tachocline, and helioseismically observed heavy element abundances, while acknowledging the absence of constraints on the radial variation of the Schmidt number. In the context of stellar evolution, differential rotation profiles of solar-type main-sequence stars may follow analytical solutions extending from D. Banik & K.
