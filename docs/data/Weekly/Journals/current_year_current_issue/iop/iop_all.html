  abstract     = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has provided critical mid-infrared data for cold brown dwarfs. It has also provided low-resolution near-infrared spectra, and for faint sources these are the first spectra at these wavelengths. We use these data and other literature sources to synthesize near-infrared photometry on the Mauna Kea Observatories (MKO) system for 19 T and Y dwarfs, on the Euclid system for 44 T and Y dwarfs, and on the Roman systems for 48 T and Y dwarfs. We also synthesize Euclid I E magnitudes for 15 T and Y dwarfs. Using the S. A. Beiler et al. ( 2024 ) observational effective temperatures ( T eff ), together with ATMO 2020++ model colors, we show that the absolute 4.6 μ m magnitude can be used as a proxy for T eff . We present a polynomial fit to the M W2 : T eff relationship for cool dwarfs with 250 ≲ T eff K ≲ 1000. We select five Y dwarfs with 275 ≲ T eff K ≲ 400 that have a range in near- to mid-infrared colors. Comparison of the JWST spectral energy distribution to ATMO 2020++ models indicate that Y dwarfs that are bluer in J − W2 are lower gravity or more metal rich than their redder counterparts, with stronger CO and CO 2 absorption at 4.2 ≲ λ μ m ≲ 4.9. The near-infrared color diagrams show significant scatter, with complex dependencies on T eff , metallicity, and gravity. In order to disentangle these effects, opacity sources for cool model atmospheres need to be more complete at λ < 1 μ m.},

VERITAS has collected ∼40 hr of data that we used to set ULs to the emission above 200 GeV. The HAWC data, collected over ∼2400 days, reveal emission between 3 and 146 TeV, with a significance of 7.5 σ , favoring an extended source model. The best-fit spectrum measured by HAWC is characterized by a simple power law with a spectral index of 2.45 ± 0.11 stat . Fermi-LAT analysis finds a point source with a very soft spectrum in the LHAASO J2108+5157 region, consistent with the 4FGL-DR3 catalog results. The XMM-Newton analysis yields a null detection of the source in the 2–7 keV band. The broadband spectrum can be interpreted as a pulsar and a pulsar wind nebula system, where the GeV gamma-ray emission originates from an unidentified pulsar, and the X-ray and TeV emissions are attributed to synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering of electrons accelerated within a pulsar wind nebula. In this leptonic scenario, our X-ray upper limit provides a stringent constraint on the magnetic field, which is ≲1.5 μ G.},

  abstract     = {Extremely metal-poor (XMP) galaxies are systems with gas-phase oxygen abundances below ∼5% solar metallicity (12+log(O/H) ≤ 7.35). These galaxies populate the metal-poor end of the mass–metallicity and luminosity–metallicity relations (MZR and LZR, respectively). Recent studies have found XMP galaxies in the nearby Universe to be outliers on the LZR, where they show enhanced luminosities relative to other galaxies of similar gas-phase oxygen abundance. Here, we present a study of the recently discovered XMP galaxy Leonessa and characterize the system’s properties using new imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope and spectra from the Green Bank Telescope and Hobby–Eberly Telescope. We use these observations to measure a tip of the red giant branch distance (15.86 ± 0.78 Mpc) to Leonessa, the H i gas mass, the gas-phase oxygen abundance, and N/O ratio. We find Leonessa is an isolated, gas-rich (gas fraction μ = 0.69), low-mass (log( M ⋆ / M ⊙ ) = 6.12 ± 0.08), XMP (12+log(O/H) = 7.32 ± 0.04), star-forming galaxy at a distance of 15.86 ± 0.78 Mpc. Our measurements show that Leonessa agrees with the MZR, but disagrees with the LZR; we conclude the LZR offset is due to recent star formation enhancing the system’s luminosity. To investigate possible chemical evolution pathways for nearby XMP galaxies, we also compile a comparison sample of 150 dwarf galaxies (53 XMP systems) taken from the literature with gas-phase metallicity measurements based on the direct method. We find evidence for an anticorrelation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and H i gas-to-stellar mass ratios. We posit Leonessa is undergoing a chemical evolution pathway typical of field dwarf galaxies.},

  abstract     = {Leveraging the large sample size of low-resolution spectroscopic surveys to constrain white dwarf stellar structure requires an accurate understanding of the shapes of hydrogen absorption lines, which are pressure broadened by the Stark effect. Using data from both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Type Ia Supernova Progenitor Survey, we show that substantial biases (5–15 km s −1 ) exist in radial velocity measurements made from observations at low spectral resolution relative to similar measurements from high-resolution spectra. Our results indicate that the physics of line formation in high-density plasmas, especially in the wings of the lines, are not fully accounted for in state-of-the-art white dwarf model atmospheres. We provide corrections to account for these resolution-induced redshifts in a way that is independent of an assumed mass–radius relation, and we demonstrate that statistical measurements of gravitational redshift with these corrections yield improved agreement with theoretical mass–radius relations. Our results provide a set of best practices for white dwarf radial velocity measurements from low-resolution spectroscopy, including those from SDSS, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the 4 m Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope, and the Wide-Field Multiplexed Spectroscopic Facility.},

  abstract     = {There are various surveys that will provide excellent data to search for and localize fast radio bursts (FRBs). The BINGO project will be one such survey, and this collaboration has already estimated an FRB detection rate that the project will yield. We present a forecast of the future constraints on our current cosmological model that the BINGO FRB detections and localizations will have when added to other current cosmological data sets. We quantify the dispersion measure (DM) as a function of redshift ( z ) for the BINGO FRB mock sample. Furthermore, we use current data sets (supernova, baryonic acoustic oscillation, and cosmic microwave background data) prior to assessing the efficacy of constraining dark energy models using Monte Carlo methods. Our results show that a spatially localized BINGO FRB data set will provide promising constraints on the population of host galaxies' intrinsic DM and be able to measure the nuisance parameters present within an FRB cosmological analysis. They will also provide alternative estimates on other parameters such as the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation of state. In particular, we should see that BINGO FRB data can put constraints on the degenerate w − H 0 plane, which the cosmic microwave background is incapable of measuring, allowing FRBs to be a viable alternative to baryonic acoustic oscillation to constrain the dark energy equation of state. We conclude that FRBs remain a promising future probe for cosmology and that the FRBs localized by the BINGO project will contribute significantly to our knowledge of the current cosmological model.},

  abstract     = {The formation and evolution of galaxies are intricately linked to the baryon cycle, which fuels star formation while shaping chemical abundances within galaxies. Investigating the relationship between star formation and metallicity for large samples of galaxies requires expensive IFU surveys or sophisticated tools to analyze grism data. Here we analyze JWST NIRISS slitless grism data using Sleuth , a tool that forward models and infers spatially resolved physical properties from grism data, including observations from JWST NIRISS/NIRCam and future grism data like that from the Roman Space Telescope. Sleuth enables the extraction of high-quality emission line maps from slitless spectra, overcoming contamination and spatially varying stellar populations, which previously limited such studies. Utilizing Sleuth with data from the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey, we investigated the relationship between metallicity and star formation in the star-forming clumps of galaxies at 0.6 < z < 1.35. We analyzed a sample of 20 galaxies, extracted high-quality emission line maps with Sleuth , and analyzed, in detail, the spatially resolved properties of star-forming clumps. Using H α , [S II ], and [S III ] emission line maps, we examined the spatially resolved metallicities, ionization, and star formation rates of our sample. Our findings reveal that these star-forming clumps show lower metallicities (∼0.1 dex) than their surrounding galactic environments, indicating a metallicity dilution of 20% within the clumps’ gas. Our analysis indicates that these clumps exhibit intensified star formation and reduced metallicity, likely due to the inflow of metal-poor gas. These clumps illustrate the dynamic relationship between star formation and chemical enrichment within galaxies.},

  abstract     = {The nonlinear coupling between stellar convection and rotation is of great interest because it relates to understanding both stellar evolution and activity. We investigate the influence of rotation and the Coriolis force on the dynamics and thermodynamic structure of an F-type main-sequence star with a shallow outer convection zone. We perform a series of 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations of a 1.47 M ⊙ star for different rotation rates (periods of rotation 1 and 14 days) and with local computational domains (102.4 Mm × 102.4 Mm × 50.6 Mm) placed at latitudes of 0 ° (equator), 30 ° , and 60 ° , using the f -plane approximation. Because the star has a relatively shallow convection zone (28.5 Mm thick or about 3% R * ), we model its dynamics from the upper layers of the radiative zone, the whole convection zone, and the low atmosphere. The initial simulation results indicate that rotation suppresses temperature and density perturbations in the upper convection zone, leading to a decrease in the mean temperature throughout the convection zone. In addition to the multiscale granular-type convection, the simulations reveal the formation of roll-like patterns, the circulation in which is responsible for the retrograde flows extending from the photosphere to the bottom of the convection zone, where the mean flows transition to prograde motions with the onset of solid body rotation in the radiative zone, forming the tachocline in the overshooting layer. In this paper, we primarily discuss the properties of the outer convection zone for different rotation rates. A detailed analysis of the properties of the tachocline, the overshoot layer, as well as the properties of acoustic and gravity waves, will be discussed in follow-up papers.},

  abstract     = {The solar corona is much hotter than the photosphere and chromosphere, but the physical mechanism responsible for heating the coronal plasma remains unidentified. The thermal microwave emission, which is produced in a strong magnetic field above sunspots, is a promising but barely exploited tool for studying the coronal magnetic field and plasma. We analyzed the microwave observations of eight solar active regions obtained with the Siberian Radioheliograph in the years 2022–2024 in the frequency range of 6–12 GHz. We produced synthetic microwave images based on various coronal heating models, and determined the model parameters that provided the best agreement with the observations. The observations and simulations strongly favor either a steady-state (continuous) plasma heating process or high-frequency heating by small energy release events with a short cadence. The average magnetic field strength in a coronal loop was found to decrease with the loop length, following a scaling law with the most probable index of about −0.55. In the majority of cases, the estimated volumetric heating rate was weakly dependent on the magnetic field strength and decreased with the coronal loop length following a scaling law with an index of about −2.5. Among the known theoretical heating mechanisms, the model based on wave transmission or reflection in coronal loops acting as resonance cavities was found to provide the best agreement with the observations. The obtained results did not demonstrate a significant dependence on the emission frequency in the considered range.},

  abstract     = {The lithium-dip observed in mid-F dwarfs remains a long-standing challenge for stellar evolution models. We present high-precision stellar parameters and A (Li) for 22 new comoving pairs, primarily located on the hotter side of the Li-Dip. Combined with pairs from the C3PO catalog, our sample includes 124 stars with T eff between 6000 and 7300 K, encompassing and extending slightly beyond the Li-Dip. Among them, 49 comoving pairs (98 stars) have both components within the temperature range of interest. Using this expanded set of comoving pairs observed with high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that rotational spin down is the dominant process responsible for Li depletion in the Li-Dip. First, within comoving pairs, the star with v sin i > 12 km s −1 shows higher A (Li) than its more slowly rotating companion within the Li-Dip, indicating that rotation-dependent mixing drives lithium depletion. Second, we observe a correlation between A (Li) and v sin i : fast rotators retain higher A (Li) with less scatter, while slow rotators show lower A (Li) and greater dispersion. Third, among slow rotators, A (Li) varies widely, suggesting that differences in initial rotation rates and spin-down histories influence how much Li is depleted. Some stars may have formed as fast rotators and spun down rapidly, leading to more Li depletion, while others may have started as slow rotators and retained more of their initial Li. These results demonstrate that rotational induced mixing plays an important role in shaping the Li-Dip beyond the effects of stellar age and mass.},

  abstract     = {Kinematics of solar eruptive filaments is one of the important diagnostic parameters for predicting whether solar eruptions would induce geomagnetic storms. Particularly, some geomagnetic storms might be induced by solar filament eruptions originating from unexpected surface source regions because of nonradial ejection. The nonradial ejection of filaments has received widespread attention but remains inconclusive. We select two eruptive filaments, both of which are supported by flux ropes, as indicated by the hot channel structures seen in the 94 Å images and the hook-shaped brightenings where the filament material falls back. We measure the three-dimensional ejection trajectory of the eruptive filaments by integrating the simultaneous observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). Furthermore, we calculate the distribution of the poloidal field along the ejection path and compare it to the ejection acceleration. It is revealed that the reinforcement of the poloidal magnetic field may lead to the suppression of the acceleration, with the acceleration resuming its increase only when the poloidal field diminishes to a certain level. Additionally, we compute the spatial distribution of the poloidal field in various directions and find that the poloidal magnetic field above the filaments is asymmetric. For both investigated events, the filaments appear to eject toward the side where the poloidal magnetic field is weaker, indicating that the eruptive filaments tend to propagate along the side with weaker strapping force. This may provide a new explanation for the inclined ejection of filaments.},

  abstract     = {We present a Chandra/ACIS-I study of X-ray sources in BOSS 1441, a protocluster at z = 2.32 ± 0.02 that exhibits a prominent overdensity of Ly α emitters (LAEs). Using a 45 ks observation, we identify seven X-ray sources spatially coincident with LAE density peaks. The average X-ray photon index for the seven sources, derived from an absorbed power-law model with Galactic absorption fixed, is 1.49 (ranging from −0.68 to 2.51), corresponding to an average luminosity of 6.85 × 10 44 erg s −1 in the rest-frame 2–33 keV band, with individual luminosities spanning (3.57–13.96) × 10 44 erg s −1 . Three sources exhibit relatively flat spectral slopes. Two are associated with the MAMMOTH-1 nebula, while the third, located at the edge of BOSS 1441 with a \gt 5\,^{\prime} \, offset from the LAE density peak, resides in a region with a high submillimeter-band density. We estimate the fraction of X-ray-detected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) among the LAEs to be 11.{5}_{-4.6}^{+3.8} \% , approximately double that of previously studied LAEs. This elevated fraction suggests BOSS 1441 is in a mature evolutionary stage, with even higher AGN fractions expected in massive LAEs such as PKS 1138-262. In contrast, the submillimeter galaxy population shows a lower AGN fraction ( 6.{9}_{-4.5}^{+6.9} \% ), consistent with their typically obscured nature. These results indicate that the protocluster’s massive galaxies are evolving into the bright red sequence galaxies observed in local clusters, where AGNs likely play a critical role in quenching their star formation.},

  abstract     = {We analyze 4859 O stars in the third phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment photometric survey of the LMC, including 415 eclipsing binaries (EBs). After accounting for the geometrical probability of eclipses, the period distribution of O-type binaries across P = 2.5–200 days follows a power law f log P ∝ (log P ) Π with Π = −0.34 ± 0.06, which is skewed toward shorter periods compared to Opik’s law (Π = 0). We divide our O stars into seven environments based on their clustering with B stars and other O stars. The EB fraction of O stars in young clusters is 10.2% ± 0.6%, which matches the 10.8% ± 2.1% for O stars in young Milky Way clusters. O stars in old clusters exhibit a lower EB fraction of 5.5% ± 0.9% due to the effects of binary evolution. O stars in young dense clusters, young sparse associations, and even low-mass clusters that formed in situ in the field have similar EB fractions. This uniformity suggests that the formation of close massive binaries depends on small-scale gas physics, e.g., fragmentation and migration within protostellar disks, whereas N -body interactions that scale with cluster density do not affect the close binary properties of massive stars that remain in clusters. Conversely, ejected O stars in the field exhibit a lower close binary fraction. The EB fractions of field walkaways (projected velocities v proj < 24.5 km s −1 ) and field runaways ( v proj > 24.5 km s −1 ) are 7.3% ± 1.0% and 4.7% ± 1.0%, respectively. These values suggest that most field O stars were dynamically ejected via N -body interactions from their birth clusters, whereas field O stars that formed in situ or were kicked from supernova explosions in binaries contribute 17% and <28%, respectively, to the field population.},

Since becoming operational in 2024 January, MAG has continuously recorded local magnetic field data and has captured several solar transient events over the past 1 yr. During these events, the IMF, typically around 5 nT, exhibited significant enhancements in magnitude. This study focuses on three such solar events observed in 2024 March, May, and October. Analysis of the magnetic field power spectra during these events reveals fluctuations consistent with Kolmogorov-type turbulence, characterized by a spectral slope close to −5/3. To emphasize changes in spectral behavior, the event-day spectra are compared with those from a day when the quiet solar wind conditions prevail. A marked contrast is observed: while the quiet periods exhibit anisotropic turbulence, the extreme events display quasi-isotropic behavior, with spectral slopes closely following the Kolmogorov spectrum across all three IMF components. The results, including detailed variations in spectral slope and turbulence characteristics, are presented and discussed in this paper.},

  abstract     = {The radiation reprocessing model, in which an optically thick outflow absorbs the high-energy emission from a central source and reemits in longer wavelengths, has been frequently invoked to explain some optically bright transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs), whose progenitor and explosion mechanism are still unknown. Previous studies on this model did not take into account the frequency dependence of the opacity. We study the radiative reprocessing and calculate the UV-optical-near-infrared (NIR) band spectra from a spherical outflow composed of pure hydrogen gas, for a time-dependent outflowing mass rate. Electron scattering and frequency-dependent bound–free and free–free opacities are considered. The spectrum deviates from the blackbody at NIR and UV frequencies; in particular, it has νL ν ∝ ν 1.5 at NIR frequencies, because at these frequencies the absorption optical depth from the outflow’s outer edge to the so-called photon trapping radius is large and is frequency dependent. We apply our model to the prototype FBOT AT2018cow by fitting the spectra to the observed spectral energy distribution. The best-fit mass-loss rate suggests that the total outflow mass in AT2018cow is {M}_{{\rm{out}}}\approx 5.{7}_{-0.4}^{+0.4}\,{M}_{\odot } . If that equals the total mass lost during an explosion, and if the progenitor is a blue supergiant (with a preexplosion mass of ∼20 M ⊙ ), then it will suggest that the central compact remnant mass is at least ≈14 M ⊙ . This would imply that the central remnant is a black hole.},

We estimate ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions and densities at z ∼ 17 and z ∼ 25. The number density of galaxies with absolute magnitudes of −19 < M UV < −18 at z ∼ 17 ( z ∼ 25) is a factor of 4 (25) smaller than at z ∼ 12; the luminosity density presents a similar evolution. Compared to state-of-the-art galaxy simulations, we find the need for an enhanced UV-photon production at z = 17–25 in M DM = 10 8.5−9.5 M ⊙ dark matter halos, provided by an increase in the star formation efficiency at early times and/or by intense compact starbursts with enhanced emissivity linked to strong burstiness, low or primordial gas metallicities, and/or a top-heavy initial mass function. There are a few robust theoretical predictions for the evolution of galaxies above z ∼ 20 in the literature; however, the continuing rapid drop in the halo mass function would predict a more rapid evolution than we observe if photon production efficiencies remained constant. Our z > 16 candidates present mass-weighted ages around 30 Myr, and attenuations A ( V ) < 0.1 mag. Their average stellar mass is M ⋆ ∼ 10 7 M ⊙ , implying a stellar-to-baryon mass fraction around 10% if the emissivity increases with redshift, or significantly higher otherwise. Three candidates present very blue UV spectral slopes ( β ∼ −3) compatible with Population III young (≲10 Myr) stars and/or high escape fractions of ionizing photons; the rest have β ∼ −2.5 similar to the z = 10–12 samples.},

If particles injected at the base of the loops have Lorentz factors ≳10 2 , the RICS spectra will be attenuated by both one-photon pair production and photon splitting in the ultrastrong magnetar fields, producing additional spectral components from pair synchrotron radiation and split photons that produce further generations of pairs and split photons. We investigate such cascades initiated by the primary injected electrons through a Monte Carlo simulation, and study the cascade spectra and pair distributions. For most observer angles, the pair synchrotron and split-photon spectra dominate the RICS primary spectra and produce complex polarization signals. In particular, the synchrotron spectra are highly polarized with degree 40%–80%, are softer than the RICS spectra, and may account for the high polarization of some magnetar spectra observed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer above 3 keV.},

Near-infrared data from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) detect the scattered starlight from the disk surface and reveal a large shadow that extends over its entire southern half. We model the ALMA continuum and line data to determine the outer-disk geometry and the central stellar mass. Using radiative transfer models, we demonstrate that a misaligned inner disk, tilted in both inclination and position angle with respect to the outer disk, can reproduce the salient scattered-light features seen with VLT. Applying an image threshold algorithm to compare disk morphologies and training a neural network on a set of high-signal-to-noise-ratio models, we forward model the data and determine the inner-disk geometry. We find that the rotation axes of the inner and outer disks are misaligned by 38° and constrain the mass and location of a perturbing planetary or substellar companion. The technique of simulation-based inference that is illustrated here is broadly applicable for radiative transfer modeling of other objects.},

We find a systematic trend of higher gas excitation with increasing star formation rate (SFR) and SFR surface density (Σ SFR ), with the range of variations being even larger than predicted by simulations. Power-law fits of the CO line ratios as a function of SFR and Σ SFR provide a good description of the trends seen in our sample and also accurately predict values for a wide range of galaxy types compiled from the literature. Based on these fits, we provide prescriptions for estimating CO(1–0) luminosities and molecular gas masses using CO(3–2) or CO(2–1) in cases where CO(1–0) is not observed directly. We compare our observed SLEDs with molecular cloud models in order to examine how the physical properties of cold gas vary across the galaxy population. We find that gas conditions in star-forming and starburst galaxies lie on a continuum with increasing gas density in more actively star-forming systems.},

  abstract     = {M31N 2017-01e is the second-fastest recurrent nova known, with a recurrence period of 2.5 yr in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). This system exhibits a unique combination of properties: a low outburst amplitude (∼3 mag), starkly contrasting with known recurrent novae (typically ≥6 mag), and a very fast evolution ( t 2 ∼ 5 days). Its position coincides with a bright variable source ( M V ∼ −4.2, B − V = 0.042) displaying a 14.3 day photometric modulation, which has been suggested as the likely progenitor. We present a multiwavelength analysis of optical and UV data spanning quiescence and the 2019 and 2024 outbursts. Archival high-resolution imaging reveals two nearby faint sources within 5″ of the proposed nova system, which we identified as unrelated field stars. Color analysis and spectral energy distribution fitting suggest the progenitor is likely an early-type star. Combined with archival spectra consistent with a B-type star with H α in emission, this points to the quiescent counterpart being a Be star with a circumstellar disk. We propose that M31N 2017-01e arises from a rare BeWD binary , where the white dwarf (WD) accretes from the decretion disk of its companion, explaining its rapid recurrence, low-amplitude outbursts, and unusual quiescent luminosity and color. This analysis highlights M31N 2017-01e as a compelling outlier among recurrent novae, suggesting a distinct accretion mechanism and evolutionary path that challenges the prevailing paradigm.},

  abstract     = {Massive stars in the Hertzsprung gap are a mixed population of objects in short-lived evolutionary phases: yellow supergiants (YSGs) evolving toward the red supergiant (RSG) phase, partially stripped post-RSGs, and other, rarer outcomes of stellar evolution. Studies of sufficiently large samples of these objects can constrain massive star structure and evolution during these poorly understood phases. As part of our ongoing program searching for post-RSGs, we characterized the spectral line profiles of 32 YSGs in the Large Magellanic Cloud using high-resolution spectra obtained with the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph on the Magellan 2/Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We find that the line profiles are strongly broadened by turbulent photospheric motion. After fitting the profiles to measure microturbulent and macroturbulent velocities, we identify two groups within our sample that are separated by the ratio of the two velocity scales. In both groups, the macroturbulent velocity ζ RT scales with stellar properties such as effective temperature. Additionally, we find statistically significant correlations between the macroturbulent velocity and other possible probes of large-scale photospheric motions: line profile asymmetry, as well as the amplitude and quality factor of the stochastic low frequency variability measured from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite lightcurves. These correlations differ between the two groups of YSGs. Finally, we construct 1D evolutionary models of YSGs in both pre- and post-RSG phases, and find reasonable agreement between the convective velocities in these models and our measured microturbulent velocities. However, the macroturbulent velocities are much higher than the convective velocities in the models.},

  abstract     = {The stellar obliquity of a planetary system is often used to help constrain the system’s formation and evolution. One of the mechanisms to reorient the stellar spin involves a secular resonance crossing due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk when the system also has an inclined, distant (∼300 au) binary companion. This mechanism is likely to operate broadly due to the ∼50% binary fraction of FGK dwarfs and can play an important role in setting the initial stellar obliquities prior to any dynamical evolution. In this work, we revisit this mechanism analytically for idealized, homologously evolving disk models and show that the resulting stellar obliquities are broadly distributed between 60° and 180° for most warm and cold planets. We further show that nonhomologous disk dissipation, such as the development of a photoevaporatively opened gap at ∼2 au, can help maintain the orbital alignment of warm planets, in agreement with observations. Our results represent the proper primordial obliquities for planetary systems with distant binary companions. They also represent the obliquities of stars with no present-day binary companions if these companions are dynamically unbound during the birth cluster phase of evolution, a process that occurs on a comparable timescale as the disk-driven obliquity excitation.},

Most earlier imaging-spectroscopic studies have relied on slit-based spectrometers, which offer high spectral resolution but are limited in spatiotemporal coverage and temperature diagnostics. In contrast, slitless spectrographs like the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS) produce overlapping spatial-spectral data (overlappograms) to enable wide-field imaging spectroscopy with broader temperature coverage. However, extracting elemental abundances from overlappogram data remains inherently challenging due to spatial and spectral confusion.

  abstract     = {Current galaxy formation models predict the existence of X-ray-emitting gaseous halos around Milky Way (MW)–type galaxies. To investigate properties of this coronal gas in MW-like galaxies, we analyze a suite of high-resolution simulations based on the SMUGGLE framework and compare the results with X-ray observations of both the MW and external galaxies. We find that for subgrid models incorporating any form of stellar feedback, e.g., early feedback (including stellar winds and radiation) and/or supernova (SN) explosions, the total 0.5–2 keV luminosity is consistent within uncertainties with X-ray observations of the MW and with scaling relations derived for external disk galaxies. However, all models exhibit an X-ray surface brightness profile that declines too steeply beyond ∼5 kpc, underpredicting the extended emission seen in recent eROSITA stacking results. Across all subgrid prescriptions, the simulated surface brightness and emission measure fall below MW observations by at least 1–2 orders of magnitude, with the most severe discrepancy occurring in the no-feedback model. Our results suggest that (i) stellar feedback primarily shapes the innermost hot atmosphere (central ∼5 kpc), with comparable contributions from early feedback and SNe to the resulting X-ray luminosity; (ii) additional mechanisms such as gravitational heating, active galactic nuclei feedback, and/or Compton effects of GeV cosmic ray are necessary to generate the extended, volume-filling hot gaseous halo of MW-mass galaxies; (iii) the origins of hot corona in MW-like galaxies are partially distinct from those of the warm (∼10 5 K) gas, by combining our previous finding that the SMUGGLE model successfully reproduces the kinematics and spatial distribution of MW O vi absorbers.},

  abstract     = {Accurate thermal emission models of neutron stars are essential for constraining the dense matter equation of state. However, incorporating realistic magnetic field structures is computationally prohibitive, severely constraining feasible parameter space exploration. In this work, we develop a neural network (NN) emulator to generate model thermal bolometric X-ray light curves of millisecond pulsars with multipolar magnetic fields. We assess the NN’s predictive and computational performance across a broad parameter space. We find that for a static vacuum field model, the NN provides a >400 times speedup. We integrate this NN emulator into a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) framework to replace the computationally expensive physical model during parameter exploration. Applied to PSR J0030+0451, this approach allows the MCMC to reach equilibrium in ∼1 day on 4000 cores, where with the original physical model alone it would have taken more than a year on the same hardware. We compare posterior distributions by running equivalent MCMC iterations with both the NN and the physical model, evaluate differences in distributions when continuing the physical model MCMC from the NN MCMC equilibrium state, and assess variations in posterior distributions resulting from NNs trained on data sets of different sizes. Our NN architecture is agnostic to the underlying physics of the physical model and can be trained for any other physical model, opening many previously intractable avenues of analysis. The NN speed remains the same regardless of the complexity of the physical model it was trained to emulate, allowing greater speedups for more complex physical models.},

Due to the intrinsic nature of this quantity, \dot{P} analysis has been used to probe fundamental physics, such as constraining the mass of hypothetical axion particles. However, most white dwarfs are expected to host planets that could induce an external source of period change, caused by the light travel time variations from reflex motion about the system barycenter. Assuming a plausible distribution of planets that could orbit white dwarf stars, we quantify the amount of reflex motion expected from undiscovered planets as an important source of extrinsic error in \dot{P} analyses. While the median error from reflex motion is ∼10 −15 s s −1 (similar to the secular \dot{P} rates expected for cool DAV pulsators), individual close-in planets could cause \dot{P} errors as large as 10 −11 s s −1 .},

Here we propose that the magnetic reconnection induced by the migration of satellite black holes (sBHs) in the AGN disk can be a new plausible mechanism for AGN short-term variability. During the sBH migration, the comoving plasmas surrounding the sBH could influence the large-scale magnetic field of the AGN disk and trigger the magnetic reconnections to contribute to AGN UV/optical variability. Meanwhile, high-magnetization plasmas are more likely to escape the disk and cause a secondary magnetic reconnection in the corona. For a ∼10 2 –10 3 M ⊙ sBH in the inner regions of the disk surrounding a supermassive black hole with ∼10 7 M ⊙ , the reconnection process that occurred in the space outside of the disk should produce X-ray emission, which can last ∼10 3 –10 6 s with the luminosity ∼10 38 –10 42 erg s −1 .},

  abstract     = {Hot ionized interstellar medium interlinks star formation and stellar feedback processes, redistributing energy, momentum, and material throughout galaxies. We use X-ray data from Chandra to extract the hot gas emission from 78 of the most luminous infrared-selected galaxies in the local Universe. In the extreme star-forming environments, the intrinsic thermal X-ray luminosity of hot gas ( {L}_{0.5-2\,{\rm{keV}}}^{{\rm{gas}}} ) shows a significant excess over the predictions of the standard linear L X −SFR relation for most objects with very high star formation rates (SFRs). The contribution of active galactic nuclei appears to have little impact on the global hot gas luminosity. For galaxies with SFR > 50 M ⊙ yr −1 , the Bayesian analysis gives a superlinear relation of {\rm{log}}({L}_{0.5-2\,{\rm{keV}}}^{{\rm{gas}}}/{\rm{erg}}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1})=1.34\,{\rm{log}}({\rm{SFR}}/{M}_{\odot }\,{{\rm{yr}}}^{-1})+39.82 , similar to that found in the central regions of normal spiral galaxies. These results suggest a scenario in which the merger of galaxies delivers substantial amounts of gas, triggering intense star formation in both the nuclear region and the galactic disk, and ultimately enhancing the global thermal X-ray emission. The ratio of the apparent thermal luminosity in the 0.5−2 keV band ( {L}_{0.5-2\,{\rm{keV}}}^{{\rm{appar}}} ) to {L}_{0.5-2\,{\rm{keV}}}^{{\rm{gas}}} shows statistically significant negative correlations with the intrinsic column density ( N H ) and SFR. Moreover, in contrast to the luminosity ratio, SFR shows a moderate positive correlation with intrinsic N H . This suggests that the correlation between {L}_{0.5-2\,{\rm{keV}}}^{{\rm{appar}}} / {L}_{0.5-2\,{\rm{keV}}}^{{\rm{gas}}} and SFR may be driven by the underlying {L}_{0.5-2\,{\rm{keV}}}^{{\rm{appar}}} / {L}_{0.5-2\,{\rm{keV}}}^{{\rm{gas}}} − N H and SFR− N H relations.},

Both clusters have similar ages (250 and 300 Myr, respectively). Spectra were recorded with the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System located on the Magellan–Clay 6.5 m telescope. Spectra were visually inspected to assess the presence of stellar H α emission lines attributed to B stars rotating close to breakup velocity (Be stars). High fractions of Be stars in the cluster typically indicate the presence of a large population of fast rotating stars, predicted by some models to explain the observed split and extended main sequence. There are numerous Be star candidates in NGC 1856, exhibiting weak but broad H α emission. However, only one such target was detected in NGC 1953. This stark contrast between the observed populations for NGC 1856 and NGC 1953 may suggest that cluster density plays a key role in determining the fraction of Be stars. These results provide essential constraints for the different scenarios attempting to explain the bimodal distribution of rotational velocities and the multiple populations of stars observed in globular clusters. The impact of stellar radial velocity and nebular emission on photometric measures is assessed through simulations relying on the spectra. These simulations suggest that photometric studies can underestimate the fraction of H α emitters in a cluster, in particular for stars with relatively weak emission features. The results also show that nebular emission has minimal impact on the photometric H α excesses.},

Using data from the IllustrisTNG simulation, we construct H i sky cubes at redshift z ∼ 0.1 and the corresponding optical galaxy catalogs, simulating FAST observations under various survey strategies, including pilot, deep-field, and ultradeep-field surveys. The H i MF is measured for distinct galaxy populations—classified by optical properties into red, blue, and bluer galaxies—and injected with systematic effects such as observational noise and flux confusion caused by the FAST beam. The results show that Bayesian stacking significantly enhances H i MF measurements. For red and blue galaxies, the H i MF can be well constrained with pilot surveys, while deeper surveys are required for the bluer galaxy population. Our analysis also reveals that sample variance dominates over observational noise, emphasizing the importance of wide-field surveys to improve constraints. Furthermore, flux confusion shifts the H i MF toward higher masses, which we address using a transfer function for correction. Finally, we explore the effects of intrinsic sample incompleteness and propose a framework to quantify its impact. This work lays the groundwork for future H i MF studies with FAST H i IM, addressing key challenges and enabling robust analyses of H i content across galaxy populations.},

  abstract     = {Centaurus X–3 (Cen X–3) is a bright, high-mass X-ray binary pulsar. We present a pulse phase–resolved X-ray spectral analysis of data from an archival XMM-Newton observation of Cen X–3 taken during the high state of the source. The observation was entirely in the out-of-eclipse part of the binary orbit. We study the pulse phase variability of the three K α fluorescent emission lines from near-neutral, helium-like, and hydrogen-like iron, along with the iron K β emission line. All four lines show clear modulation with the pulse phase of the neutron star (NS), and modulation is found to be higher for the lines from highly ionised iron compared to the neutral lines. Structures within the light travel distance corresponding to the pulse period of the NS are likely responsible for the pulse phase modulation of the emission lines. We have also investigated the orbital phase dependence of the pulse phase variability in the iron lines by dividing the data into four segments at different orbital phases of Cen X–3. The pulse phase modulation behavior of the four lines is quite identical at different orbital phases of Cen X–3, indicating the pulsed iron emission region is persistent in nature and probably phase aligned with respect to the observer. The accretion stream intercepting the line of sight can probably produce the observed phase dependence of the iron fluorescence emission lines.},

  abstract     = {Binary black holes (BBHs) are expected to form and merge in active galactic nuclei (AGN), deep in the potential well of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), from populations that exist in a nuclear star cluster. Here we investigate the gravitational-wave (GW) signature of a BBH lensed by a nearby SMBH. For a fiducial GW150914-like BBH orbiting close to a 10 8 M ⊙ SMBH located at z = 0.1, the lensed GW signal varies in a predictable manner in and out of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) detectability band and across frequencies. The occurrence of such signatures has the potential to confound LISA global fit models if they are not modeled. Detection of these sources provides an independent measure of AGN inclination angles, along with detecting warping of the inner disk and measuring the SMBH spin.},

  abstract     = {Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) typically exhibit a three-component structure in white-light (WL) coronagraphs. Utilizing the seamless observations of the inner corona (≤3 R ⊙ ), we have revealed the early evolution of the cavity and core of a CME starting at ∼18:20 UT on 2014 October 14. The CME originates from a hot channel (HC), which appears as the bright core and compresses the cavity in WL images. Specifically, most of the dark cavity in WL is filled by bright loop-like structures in 174 Å. The differential emission measure analysis indicates that the electron temperature decreases from the core (∼13.4 MK) to the cavity (∼1.35 MK), and the CME cavity is significantly cooler than that enshrouding a prominence (≥2 MK). The effective temperature of the cavity increases over time in general, probably due to the compression by the HC expansion. The evolution of the CME bright core includes slow-rise, fast-rise (up to ∼330 km s −1 ), and residual-acceleration phases. The cavity exhibits an evolution similar to the core but lags by ∼4 minutes, with a lower speed peaking at ∼220 km s −1 . Moreover, the 2D radial speed distribution exhibits the highest speeds at the core apex. The kinematical results further confirm the compression of the cavity. The present event supports the new explanation of the CME structures, i.e., the magnetic flux rope (MFR), which is proxied by the HC, is only responsible for the core, while the cavity is likely a low-density region between the CME front and the MFR.},

  abstract     = {Space irradiation plays a crucial role in surface weathering and hydration processes of airless bodies in the solar system. Despite extensive laboratory studies, the impact of crystal orientation and temperature on these irradiation processes remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted hydrogen-implantation experiments on olivine crystals, controlling both crystal orientation and temperature. Our results reveal that the amount and depth of implanted hydrogen depend on the crystal orientation. Olivine exhibits the largest resistance to ion irradiation along the [100] direction, resulting in a thinner damaged region (∼180–200 nm) and subsurface vesicle formation. In contrast, the [010] and [001] orientations allow deeper damage (∼200–210 nm) accompanied by fracturing. Additionally, increasing temperatures from 25°C to 200°C promote the saturation and retention of implanted hydrogen. However, above a critical temperature (∼200°C for olivine), hydrogen levels stabilize, and no further increase is observed. These findings highlight the critical role of crystal orientation and temperature in the irradiation process, providing important constraints for numerical models simulating the effects of space irradiation on rocky bodies.},

In particular, we examine how different surface temperature models for PSR J0030+0451, categorized as scenarios A, B, and C, lead to significantly different mass–radius estimates. We present a comprehensive study constraining the parameters of the constant speed of sound (CSS) model based on representative observational categories. Our findings indicate that for certain hadronic EoSs (for representative cases, we chose one density-independent and one density-dependent), the results remain consistent for lower values of the energy density discontinuity, but discrepancies emerge as the discontinuity increases. Scenarios involving large jumps in energy density are generally disfavored by the requirement of supporting massive neutron stars, while higher values of the speed of sound in the quark matter phase tend to yield better agreement with various observational trends. These results underscore the importance of phase transition characteristics in aligning hybrid star models with current astrophysical observations. We have also constrained the CSS parameters using observational data from PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0952–0607 by computing the maximum mass supported by these parameters.},

The goal is to understand the nature of the excess MIR emission originally detected by Spitzer redward of 8 μ m. The stellar-subtracted MIR spectrum is well modeled by a power law with a spectral index of α = 0.72 ± 0.01, where the flux density scales with frequency as F ν ∝ ν α . The spectral characteristics, along with rapid variability—a 40% flux flare at 15 μ m and 25% achromatic variability in the 5–12 μ m range—rule out a circumbinary disk as the source of the MIR excess. The Low Resolution Spectrometer reveals a prominent emission feature at 7.5 μ m, resulting from the blend of three hydrogen recombination lines. While the contribution from partially self-absorbed synchrotron radiation cannot be ruled out, we argue that thermal bremsstrahlung from a warm (a few tens of thousands of Kelvin) wind accounts for the MIR excess; the same outflow is responsible for the emission lines. The inferred mass outflow rate indicates that the system’s low luminosity is due to a substantial fraction of the mass supplied by the donor star being expelled through a wind rather than accreted onto the black hole.},

Applying the Histogram of Relative Orientations analysis to the FIREPLACE data, we find that the relative orientation between magnetic fields and column density structures is random in low-density regions ( 2\times 1{0}^{22}\lesssim {N}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\lesssim 1{0}^{23}\,{{\rm{cm}}}^{-2} ) but becomes preferentially parallel in high-density regions (≳10 23 cm −2 ). This trend is in contrast with that of the nearby molecular clouds, where the relative orientation transitions from parallel to perpendicular with increasing column densities. However, the relative orientation varies between individual CMZ clouds. Comparisons with magnetohydrodynamic simulations specific to the CMZ conditions suggest that the observed parallel alignment is intrinsic, rather than artifacts caused by the projection effect. The origin of this parallel configuration may arise from the fact that most dense structures in the CMZ are not self-gravitating, as they are in supervirial states, except for the ministarburst region Sgr B2. These findings are consistent with the low star formation efficiency observed in the CMZ compared to that in the Galactic disk.},

The radio emission from pulsars, magnetars, and fast radio bursts can be elliptically polarized, and measurements of the EA have become increasingly important in interpretations and models of their polarization. An in-depth understanding of the statistical properties of the measured polarization angles is a prerequisite to their detailed interpretation. While the statistics of the PA have been understood for some time, the statistics of the EA do not appear to be as well developed as those of the PA. The statistical properties of the EA are derived when the amplitude of the polarization vector is constant, to include its probability density, mean, standard deviation, and confidence limits. Similar to the PA, the standard deviation and confidence limits of the EA vary inversely with the polarization signal-to-noise ratio. However, unlike the PA, the probability density of the EA is generally asymmetric, its standard deviation and confidence limits are dependent upon the intrinsic value of the EA, and the measured EA is biased by the instrumental noise, particularly at low signal-to-noise ratios and large values of the intrinsic EA. General expressions for the joint probability density of the polarization angles and the probability density of the EA are also derived when the amplitude of the polarization vector fluctuates due to the superposition of incoherent modes of orthogonal polarization.},

In both cases, the properties of the X-ray emission critically probe late stages of stellar evolution for such low- and intermediate-mass stars. While extant Chandra and XMM-Newton observations have detected X-ray emission in PNs, the numbers known remain very small (∼40) compared to the overall Galactic PNs population (∼4000). We have initiated a project aimed at increasing the sample of known PNs with X-ray emission using both current and new space-based X-ray telescopes, such as the Einstein probe. To further investigate their X-ray properties to elucidate what drives current X-ray PN detections, we have cross-searched the SRG eROSITA-DE eRASS1 source catalog and the Hong Kong (HASH) PNs Database. Five known X-ray PNs have been detected (A30, NGC 2392, NGC 3242, NGC 5315, and LoTr 5), two new X-ray PNs are revealed (IC 1297 and NGC 2867), one (K 1–27) is removed from previous X-ray compilations, and another 11 previously detected X-ray emitting PNs are not recovered. A comparison of the X-ray flux of detected and undetected X-ray PNs reveals that eROSITA eRASS1 is sensitive to PNs with X-ray fluxes larger than ≈2 × 10 −14 erg cm −2 s −1 .

This scattering process can be effectively modeled as photon diffusion in phase space. In this study, we present a comprehensive comparison between the quasilinear diffusion coefficients and those calculated by ray-tracing the photon trajectories in numerically generated, broadband, isotropic density fluctuation fields in both 2D and 3D configurations. The comparative analysis demonstrates that for weak scattering, the simulated diffusion coefficients agree well with the quasilinear theoretical predictions. However, when the radio frequency approaches the electron plasma frequency and/or the density fluctuation amplitude becomes significant, photons experience strong scattering. Under such conditions, the quasilinear theory tends to underestimate the scattering strength of photons induced by 2D density fluctuations while overestimating the scattering strength in 3D cases. Furthermore, we implement a group velocity correction to the theoretical diffusion coefficients, based on the effective propagation speed averaged over all test photons. The corrected coefficients provide an accurate quantification of the scattering strength for radio waves propagating through 3D density fluctuations. The physical mechanisms underlying these phenomena are elucidated in the discussion.},

The combination of enhanced speed and accuracy facilitated by 21 cm KAN enables rapid and highly accurate physical parameter estimation analyses of multiple 21 cm models, which is needed to fully characterize the complex feature space across models and produce robust constraints on the early Universe. Rather than using static functions to model complex relationships like traditional fully connected neural networks do, KANs learn expressive transformations that can perform significantly better for low-dimensional physical problems. 21 cm KAN predicts a given signal for two well-known models in the community in 3.7 ms on average and trains about 75 times faster than 21 cm LSTM, when utilizing the same typical GPU. In addition, 21 cm KAN is able to achieve these speeds because of its learnable, data-driven transformations and its relatively small number of trainable parameters compared to a memory-based emulator. We show that 21 cm KAN required less than 30 minutes to train and fit these simulated signals and obtain unbiased posterior distributions. We find that the transparent architecture of 21 cm KAN allows us to conveniently interpret and further validate its emulation results in terms of the sensitivity of the 21 cm signal to each physical parameter. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of KANs and their ability to more quickly and accurately mimic expensive physical simulations in comparison to other types of neural networks.},

The average stellar metallicity decreases from ∼1.9 Z ⊙ near the center of the galaxy to ∼0.3 Z ⊙ at the optical outskirts. The galactocentric radial metallicity gradient is statistically consistent with previous studies of the gas-phase oxygen abundance from H ii regions using the direct method. The H ii region-based Cepheid metallicities used by A. G. Riess et al. in their determination of the Hubble constant H 0 are in substantial agreement with our measurements. The direct method gas-phase metallicities of the 18 star-forming galaxies we have analyzed so far, when adjusted upward for a mean ∼0.15 dex oxygen dust depletion factor, are in good agreement with those we infer from the supergiants, over a factor of 50 in metallicity. From the same data, we derive an expression for the metal-dependent depletion of oxygen in photoionized nebulae. Utilizing the flux-weighted gravity–luminosity relationship (FGLR) of blue supergiants, we measure a distance to M101, D = 6.5 ± 0.2 Mpc ( μ = 29.06 ± 0.08), which is within 1 σ from determinations based on the tip of the red giant branch and Cepheids. With M101 as a nearby Type Ia supernova host and using the observed standardized B -band magnitude of the supernova, our FGLR distance yields an independent value of H 0 = 72.5 ± 4.6 km s −1 Mpc −1 .},

  abstract     = {Broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (BLSy1s), characterized by high black hole masses and low accretion rates, represent a crucial subclass of active galactic nuclei. We present a systematic analysis of the variability and X-ray spectral properties of the BLSy1 Mrk 1220 using 225 high-quality Swift observations from 2016 to 2018. Mrk 1220 exhibits significant multiwavelength variability across X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), and optical bands, with amplitude increasing with energy but remaining weaker than narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) with high accretion rates. Cross-correlation analysis reveals no significant interband time delays. The UV/optical–X-ray correlation weakens with increasing wavelength, with a maximum correlation coefficient of only 0.54. The relatively weak UV/X-ray connection may be attributed to the dynamic evolution of the coronal structure. Structure function (SF) analysis reveals a distinctive double “S” structure in optical/UV bands. Short-timescale SF parameters resemble those of NLSy1s, while X-ray bands show significantly longer decorrelation timescales, indicating an extended X-ray corona. SF spectral coefficients ( β ) across bands generally follow the damped random walk model, with only the U -band long-timescale β slightly elevated, potentially influenced by broad-line region radiation. X-ray spectral characteristics remain consistent between high and low flux states, showing weak soft excess below 1 keV. The stability of the soft excess parameters and power-law spectral index suggests unchanged coronal geometry across states, with X-ray variations primarily driven by intrinsic electron density fluctuations. These results provide valuable observational constraints for understanding the variability mechanisms and spectral characteristics of typical BLSy1s.},

  abstract     = {The behavior of lithium (Li) in Population I main-sequence stars challenges standard stellar theory. Two phenomena stand out: the solar Li problem, which extends to Li depletion in solar analogs, and the Li dip observed in mid-F stars within open clusters. Building on the meridional-circulation-driven radial mixing framework previously developed to explain Li-enriched red clump stars, we explore its relevance to Li depletion on the main sequence. First, our models reproduce the observed A (Li)–age correlation in solar analogs. Through detailed isochrone analysis, we find good agreement between the simulated and observed A (Li)– T eff relationships within the solar analog parameter space. However, the predicted solar Li abundance (∼1.5 dex) is still higher than current solar measurements. Second, our models partially explain the Li dip phenomenon in mid-F cluster stars. The models accurately reproduce Li distributions on the cool side of the Li dip in most clusters and capture the Li behaviors on the hot side observed in systems like the Hyades. However, we identify limitations in the models’ ability to fully reproduce the dip morphology, particularly due to the rotation velocity distribution of sample stars in this temperature zone.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the increasing number of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered soon after their explosions, a nonnegligible fraction of SNe Ia with early-excess emissions (EExSNe Ia) have been confirmed. In this paper, we present a total of 67 early-phase normal SNe Ia from published papers and ongoing transient survey projects to systematically investigate their photometric behaviors from very early time. We found that EExSNe Ia in our sample have longer rise and brighter peak luminosities compared to non-EExSNe Ia. Moreover, EExSNe Ia commonly have “tiny red bump” or “blue plateau” features in the early B − V color while non-EExSNe Ia show blueward evolution from the very beginning. Here, we propose that the thin He-shell double detonation scenario can phenomenologically explain the photometric diversities of normal SNe Ia considering different white dwarf–He-shell mass combinations and the viewing angle effect, implying a unified explosion mechanism of normal-type SNe Ia. To further verify the possible common origin of normal SNe Ia, systematical studies of multiband photometric and spectral properties of early-phase SNe Ia through the new-generation wide-field time-domain survey facilities and global real-time follow-up networks are highly needed.},

  abstract     = {Quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) sources in galactic nuclei are often associated with a stellar object orbiting a supermassive black hole with an hours to days period, which is brought in as an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). In the presence of an accretion disk, repeated star–disk collisions lead to ablation of a small fraction of the stellar mass during each disk passage. We analytically track stellar debris as it is tidally stretched outside the EMRI’s Hill sphere, forming an elongated, dilute stream that collides with the disk half an orbit after the last star–disk encounter. For orbital periods ≳12 hr, the dilute stream is deflected at the disk surface by a strong shock, rather than penetrating it. Due to their low optical depth and prolonged interaction time, radiation from the shocked streams typically dominates over emission from shocked disk gas directly impacted by the star. We find that (1) QPE flare durations reflect the stream–disk collision timescale; (2) flare luminosities of 10 42−43 erg s −1 , consistent with observed QPEs, are robustly produced; (3) soft X-ray flares with temperatures of ∼100 eV arise when the stream mass is sufficient to sustain a radiation-mediated shock at the collision interface. Higher-mass streams yield softer flares, typically outshone by the disk, while lower-mass streams result in collisionless shocks, which likely produce fainter and harder flares. We discuss observational implications of the temporal evolution of the underlying disk, assuming it is the remnant of a prior tidal disruption event in the same galaxy.},

  abstract     = {Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies occasionally disrupt stars or consume stellar-mass black holes (BHs) that wander too close, producing observable electromagnetic or gravitational wave signals. We examine how mass segregation impacts the rates and distributions of such events. Assuming a relaxed stellar cluster, composed of stars and stellar-mass BHs, we show that the tidal disruption rate of massive stars ( m ≳ M ⊙ ) is enhanced relative to their abundance in the stellar population. For stars up to m ≈ 3 M ⊙ , this enhancement is roughly m / M ⊙ and it is driven by segregation within the sphere of influence. Stars with masses m ≳ 3 M ⊙ , if relaxed, are predominantly scattered by more massive stellar-mass BHs, leading to a constant enhancement factor of ≈9, independent of mass. This aligns with observational evidence suggesting an over-representation of massive stars in tidal disruption events. For stellar-mass BHs, we predict an enhancement factor scaling as {m}_{\bullet }^{1/2} for plunges and {m}_{\bullet }^{3/2} for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The power of one-half in both cases reflects the shorter relaxation times of heavier BHs, allowing them to segregate into the sphere of influence from greater distances, thereby increasing their abundance. The additional power in the EMRIs’ rate arises from the tendency of heavier BHs to circularize and sink inward more efficiently. Finally, we estimate the rate of main-sequence star inspirals and find that it favors low-mass stars ( m ≲ M ⊙ ). This seems compatible with the observationally estimated rate of quasiperiodic eruptions.},

  abstract     = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serve as important cosmological probes whose X-ray afterglow light curves (LCs) may exhibit a plateau phase (with temporal slope α between 0 and 0.5) that may originate from magnetar energy injection. Similar to Type Ia supernovae, GRBs with a common physical origin can be used as standardizable candles for cosmological studies. However, observational gaps in GRB LCs introduce significant uncertainties in plateau parameter estimation, thereby affecting cosmological constraints. In this work, we employ a stochastic reconstruction technique to reconstruct the X-ray afterglow LCs for 35 GRB samples exhibiting plateau features, generating 50 simulated data points for each LC. Using the reconstructed LCs, we calibrate three luminosity correlations: the L 0 – t b , L 0 – t b – E p , i , and L 0 – t b – E γ ,iso relations, which are then applied to constrain both flat and nonflat ΛCDM cosmological models. The main results include (i) the L 0 – t b relation yields a slope b ≈ −1, supporting a constant magnetar energy injection rate; (ii) LC reconstruction has limited impact on cosmological parameter constraints; and (iii) for the flat ΛCDM model constrained by the L 0 – t b – E p , i relation, the precision of Ω m improves by 6.25%; for the non-flat ΛCDM model constrained by the L 0 – t b – E p , i relation, the precision of Ω Λ improves by 1.01%. Our findings suggest that increasing the number of LC data points provides limited improvement to cosmological constraints, while expanding the sample size of GRBs with identical physical origins may be more crucial.},

To explore effective survey strategies for detecting FRBs from nearby globular clusters (GCs), we investigate the burst energy distribution, which has a strong influence on the detection rate. We reanalyze FRBs and pulsars exhibiting broad energy distributions by fitting their high-energy tails with power-law models. Two cosmological repeating FRBs (FRB 20201124A and FRB 20220912A), one nearby FRB (FRB 20200120E), and two pulsars (RRATs J1846−0257 and J1854+0306) exhibit power-law indices of α ≳ −1, suggesting that their bright pulses contribute significantly to the total radio pulse energy. The brightest bursts from these sources can be fitted with a power-law model ( α Bri = −0.26 ± 0.05), suggesting that an extremely flat index is required to naturally derive high-luminosity FRBs from low-luminosity sources. We present detailed survey strategies for FAST, MeerKAT, and Parkes cryoPAF in the search for FRBs in nearby GCs using different power-law indices, recommending targets for observation. We suggest that combining observations with FAST (∼3 hr) and Parkes cryoPAF (10−20 hr) is practicable for discovering new FRBs in nearby GCs.},

  abstract     = {The broad emission lines (BELs) emitted by active galactic nuclei respond to variations in the ionizing continuum emission from the accretion disk surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). This reverberation response provides insights into the structure and dynamics of the broad-line region (BLR). In 2024, we introduced a new forward-modeling tool, the Broad Emission Line Mapping Code (B ELMAC ), which simulates the velocity-resolved reverberation response of the BLR to an input light curve. In this work, we describe a new version of B ELMAC , which uses photoionization models to calculate the cloud luminosities for selected BELs. We investigated the reverberation responses of H α , H β , Mg II λ 2800, and C IV λ 1550 for models representing a disk-like BLR with Keplerian rotation, radiatively driven outflows, and inflows. The line responses generally provide a good indication of the respective luminosity-weighted radii. However, there are situations where the BLR exhibits a negative response to the driving continuum, causing overestimates of the luminosity-weighted radius. The virial mass derived from the models can differ dramatically from the actual SMBH mass, depending mainly on the disk inclination and velocity field. In single-zone models, the BELs exhibit similar responses and profile shapes; two-zone models, such as a Keplerian disk and a biconical outflow, can reproduce observed differences between high- and low-ionization lines. Radial flows produce asymmetric line profile shapes due to both anisotropic cloud emission and electron scattering in an intercloud medium. These competing attenuation effects complicate the interpretation of profile asymmetries.},

Our model supersedes previous models by making use of new multiband Hubble Space Telescope data and Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) spectroscopy. We identify two additional lensed galaxies to inform a more well-constrained model using 12 sets of multiple images in five separate lensed sources. The three previously known sources were spectroscopically confirmed by G. Mahler et al. at redshifts of z = 2.363, z = 2.364, and z = 3.048. We measured the spectroscopic redshifts of two of the newly discovered arcs using MUSE data, at z = 3.0205 and z = 5.3288. We increase the number of cluster member galaxies by a factor of 3 compared to previous work. We also report the detection of extended Ly α emission from several background galaxies. We measure the total projected mass density of the two major subcluster components, one dominated by the brightest cluster galaxy and the other by a compact group of luminous red galaxies. We find {M}_{{\rm{B}}{\rm{C}}{\rm{G}}}(\lt 80\,\rm{kpc})=3.9{3}_{-0.14}^{+0.21}\times 1{0}^{13} M ⊙ and {M}_{{\rm{LRG}}}(\lt 80\,\rm{kpc})=2.9{2}_{-0.23}^{+0.16}\times 1{0}^{13} M ⊙ , yielding a mass ratio of 1.3{5}_{-0.08}^{+0.16} . The strong lensing constraints offer a robust estimate of the projected mass density regardless of modeling assumptions; allowing more substructure in this line of sight does not change the results or conclusions.

Improved observational constraints on the cosmological evolution of SMBH demographics are needed. Here we report results of a search via photometric variability for SMBHs appearing as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the cosmological volume defined by the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. This work includes particular focus on a new observation carried out in 2023 with the Hubble Space Telescope using the WFC3/IR/F140W, which is compared directly to equivalent data taken 11 yr earlier in 2012. Two earlier pairs of observations from 2009 to 2012 with WFC3/IR/F105W and WFC3/IR/F160W are also analyzed. We identify 521, 188, and 109 AGN candidates as nuclear sources that exhibit photometric variability at a level of 2 σ , 2.5 σ , and 3 σ , respectively, in at least one filter. This sample includes 13, 3, and 2 AGN candidates at redshifts z > 6, when the Universe was ≲900 Myr old. After variability and luminosity function (down to M UV = −17 mag) completeness corrections, we estimate the comoving number density of SMBHs, n SMBH ( z ). At z ≳ 6, n SMBH ≳ 6 × 10 −3 cMpc −3 . At low z our observations are sensitive to AGN fainter than M UV = −17 mag, and we estimate n SMBH ≳ 10 −2 cMpc −3 . We discuss how these results place strong constraints on a variety of SMBH seeding theories.},

We apply the approach to the SiO–H 2 collision system, which is crucial for reliable astrophysical environment modeling of SiO emission. The most accurate quantum scattering calculation method employs the coupled-channel formalism, which is computationally expensive. Approximate approaches, generally referred to as decoupling approximations, are significantly more computationally efficient, but less accurate. To bridge this accuracy gap, we use a multilayer perceptron to predict the difference between the accurate and approximate results. Our model is trained on a carefully selected and preprocessed data set, which includes both approximate and accurate calculation results. We show that our approach significantly improves the accuracy of the approximate calculation results, as the relative rms errors from the predicted results are orders of magnitude smaller than those from the approximate calculation results, benchmarked against the accurate calculations. The present approach can be applied to similar problems in other fields to improve the accuracy of computationally efficient approximate methods, reducing computation time and enhancing automation.},

  abstract     = {We present a study of quasar host galaxy 3C 297, which is home to a powerful bent-jet radio source suggesting vigorous interaction with a dense interstellar medium (ISM) and/or jet precession. Archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging showed interestingly perturbed morphology of the host with a bright ∼30 kpc arc feature, extended filamentary structure of line-emitting gas, and clumpy blue excess emission cospatial with the radio hotspots. Our Very Large Telescope (VLA)/SINFONI integral-field observations reveal complex, spatially resolved H α + [N II ] emission in this source. A prominent blueshifted wing in H α indicates an ionized gas flow extending out to ∼8 kpc from the nuclear region. Combining our SINFONI narrow-H α data with archival HST/UV and VLA imaging, we map the young stellar population in the host and compare the spatial distribution of star-forming regions with the ionized gas motion and jet structure. In the attempt to characterize the feedback mechanisms in this chaotic system, we suggest that the powerful radio source dominates the feedback, with possible contribution from radiation pressure due to accretion onto the black hole. We also propose that the expanding jet cocoon likely shocked the ISM, triggering a kpc-scale ionized gas outflow and new starbursts that enhanced ongoing merger-induced star formation.},

  abstract     = {The high-redshift ( z > 4) compact sources with “V-shaped” spectral energy distributions, known as Little Red Dots (LRDs), were discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope and provide valuable clues to the physics of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early Universe. The nature of LRDs is controversial. Recently, several studies have investigated LRDs through variability, a characteristic feature of AGNs. These studies explore LRD variability by extrapolating empirical relationships from local quasars. Here, we adopt the Corona-heated Accretion-disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model, which is motivated by accretion physics and is applicable to reproducing AGN conventional variability, to study the variability of 22 LRDs in W. L. Tee et al. Our results indicate that the observed variability in LRDs is dominated by measurement uncertainties. Within the CHAR model, the lack of variability in LRDs can be explained by two scenarios: either AGNs contribute ≲30% of the observed luminosities, or they are intrinsically luminous AGNs. We use simulations to demonstrate the observational requirements to effectively investigate LRDs via variability with the following criteria: first, the sample has about 200 LRDs; second, each LRD has two observations separated by at least 2 yr in the observed frame; third, the photometric uncertainty is ≤0.07 mag. If the LRDs still lack variability under these conditions, the time–domain study would provide independent evidence that the accretion mode of LRDs differs significantly from low-redshift quasars.},

  abstract     = {The young neutron star (NS) in the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant is a fascinating test for theories of NS cooling. Chandra observations have indicated that its surface temperature is declining rapidly, by about 2% per decade, using 20 yr of data, if a uniform carbon atmosphere is assumed for the NS. This rapid decline may be caused by the neutrons in the NS core transitioning from a normal to a superfluid state. However, most of the Cas A NS observations were performed by the Chandra ACIS detectors, which suffer complicated systematic effects. Here, we test the cooling of the Cas A NS with Chandra High Resolution Camera (HRC) data over 25 yr. The Chandra HRC detector has independent systematics, serving as a cross-check. Assuming a fixed hydrogen column density ( N H ), we infer the cooling rate of the Cas A NS to be 0.57 {}_{-0.27}^{+0.26} % per decade. Allowing the N H to vary with time (as estimated using ACIS data), the cooling rate is 1.11 {}_{-0.28}^{+0.25} % per decade. These cooling rates are smaller than measured using ACIS data, implying systematic uncertainties have not been eradicated from either or both data sets. However, we have verified the decline in the absorbed flux from the Cas A NS using an independent instrument, at >3 σ level (4.7% ± 1.5% over 10 yr). Additionally, the weaker cooling rate of Cas A NS inferred from HRC data sets eliminates the tension with the theoretically predicted cooling, and can be explained by the reduced efficiency of the neutrino emission accompanying the Cooper pair breaking and formation process in neutron triplet-state superfluid.},

  abstract     = {Pulse profile stability in millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is a key factor in achieving high-precision timing essential for detecting nanohertz gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). In this work, we present a systematic analysis of profile stabilization timescales in MSPs using a direct method based on pulse stacking, applied to long-term multiepoch observations. Our study utilizes data from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) between 300 and 750 MHz for nine MSPs over 3–5 yr and Parkes Ultra-Wideband, low-frequency receiver observations (covering 704–4032 MHz) for three of them. We find that stable profiles typically require averaging over 10 5 –10 6 pulses. This is the first time such a quantitative approach has been applied to MSPs across a wide frequency range, providing an indirect but practical estimate of jitter noise—a dominant noise source in PTA data sets. We observe that stabilization timescales depend on signal-to-noise ratio, pulse morphology, and surface magnetic field strength, with a moderate correlation indicating a possible role of magnetic field in emission stability. A complementary single-epoch analysis of nine bright MSPs with uGMRT Band-3 (300–500 MHz) reinforces these results and demonstrates the method’s applicability to broader MSP populations. We show that a strong correlation exists between profile-stability slope and the jitter parameter, implying that, for faint MSPs, profile-stability analysis can act as an effective proxy for intrinsic pulse-shape variability. Our work provides a novel and scalable framework to assess intrinsic profile variability, helping to guide integration time choices and reduce timing noise in PTA experiments.},

Space-based interferometers could thus be used to provide independent constraints on their nature.

These spectra are among the latest direct detections of a core-collapse SN, both through emission lines in the optical and thermal continuum from infrared (IR) dust emission. The new IR data show that dust heating from radiation produced by the ejecta interacting with circumstellar matter is still present but greatly reduced from when SN 1995N was observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope and WISE in 2009/2010 and 2018, when the dust mass was estimated to be 0.4 M ⊙ . New radiative-transfer modeling suggests that the dust mass and grain size may have increased between 2010 and 2023. The new data can alternatively be well fit with a dust mass of 0.4 M ⊙ and a much reduced heating source luminosity. The new late-time spectra show unusually strong oxygen forbidden lines, stronger than the H α emission. This indicates that SN 1995N may have exploded as a stripped-envelope SN, which then interacted with a massive H-rich circumstellar shell, changing it from intrinsically Type Ib/c to Type IIn. The late-time spectrum results when the reverse shock begins to excite the inner H-poor, O-rich ejecta. This change in the spectrum is rarely seen but marks the start of the transition from SN to SN remnant.},

  abstract     = {Multiple studies show that planet–planet scattering plays a key role in the dynamical evolution of planetary systems. It can also contribute to the census of free-floating planets. In this work, we run an ensemble of N -body simulations and record the properties of ejected planets. Our simulations sample a wide range of orbital and physical parameters. We find that 40%–80% of planets are ejected, depending on the initial number in the system. Most ejections occur over ∼10 8 –10 9 yr. The mean excess velocity of ejected planets lies in the range 2–6 km s −1 relative to the host star, and strongly depends on the semimajor axis of the innermost planet. Regardless of initial location, all planets are equally likely to be ejected. Bound and ejected planets show distinct mass distributions, with bound planets being more massive. Increasing planetary radii reduces the ejection fraction due to higher collision rates. The properties of ejected planets do not strongly depend on initial spacing, though ejection timescales increase with separation. The ejection fraction is also largely insensitive to the distance from the host star used to define unbound status. Comparing our results with observed free-floating planet populations, we conclude that fewer than five Jovian-mass planets need to form per star to match observations—consistent with current constraints from both observations and planet formation models.},

Here, we analyze a second epoch of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI/Medium-Resolution Spectrometer observations to better characterize the properties of this region, aided by a higher spectral resolving power for the new NIRSpec data. We confirm the presence of the previously identified narrow lines from the central region, i.e., ([Ar vi ] 4.5292 μ m, [Ar ii ] 6.9853 μ m, [S iv ] 10.5105 μ m, and [S iii ] 18.7130 μ m), and also identify similar components in [Ca v ] 4.1585 μ m, [Cl ii ] 14.3678 μ m, and possibly [Fe ii ] 1.6440 μ m. These lines are blueshifted by ∼−250 km s −1 , while the emission region is spatially unresolved and located southeast of the center. The offset and blueshift could imply a kick velocity of 510 ± 55 km s −1 for the neutron star. We also identify [Ca iv ] 3.2068 μ m near the center, but it is displaced to the north and has a redshift of ∼700 km s −1 . We find that scattering by dust in the ejecta with a typical grain size ∼0.3 μ m can explain the [Ca iv ] properties and the absence of other narrow lines at shorter wavelengths, while dust absorption is important at λ ≳ 8 μ m. Photoionization models for a pulsar wind nebula and a cooling neutron star are both compatible with the observations, with the exception of the [Fe ii ] feature. The two models primarily differ at short wavelengths, where new lines are expected to emerge over time as the optical depth of dust in the expanding ejecta decreases.},

The primary ionization product of water is H 2 O + , which is rapidly converted into H 3 O + through proton-transfer reaction with H 2 O in the inner coma. Ion-mass spectrometers on board spacecraft such as Giotto and Rosetta have measured H 2 O + ions in the inner coma, while emission bands of H 2 O + in the optical wavelength region can be observed from ground-based observatories. We present the spatial intensity distribution of the H 2 O + emission in comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy), derived from high-resolution spectra taken on UT 2015 January 11. The observations covered a projected distance of ∼3000 km across the sky along the slit, with a spatial resolution of ∼200 km resulting from the atmospheric seeing. The observed H 2 O + profile scales as {\rho }^{-0.13} (where \rho is the projected distance from the nucleus), in contrast to the {\rho }^{-1} profile seen in sunlight reflected by dust grains. We modeled the intensity profile of H 2 O + using a steady-state, radially expanding coma model. Our results indicate that the proton-transfer reaction of H 2 O + with H 2 O dominates the loss process of H 2 O + in the inner coma. Assuming that H 2 O + is produced primarily by photoionization of H 2 O, the modeled intensity profile of H 2 O + remains constant, which is inconsistent with our observations. However, when an electron-impact ionization frequency inversely proportional to distance from the nucleus is assumed, the model successfully reproduces the observed profile.},

The 1D spectrum exhibits faint dust continuum emission and is relatively poor in molecular gas compared to protoplanetary disks with no inner dust cavities. We identify fundamental CO emission, bright rotationally excited OH lines longward of 9 μ m, weak rotational H 2 O emission, the methyl cation CH {}_{3}^{+} , HCO + , and tentatively identify CO 2 . Otherwise, the spectrum is dominated by H 2 and atomic emission. We model the molecular spectra using slab models and retrieve excitation temperatures, column densities, and emitting areas in a Bayesian framework. The OH line fluxes are used to estimate the photodissociation rate of water. We find that 5.4 × 10 40 H 2 O molecules are photodestroyed every second, which suggests that the highest-energy OH lines trace a region near the 0.2 au dust cavity wall with an incident far-ultraviolet flux of G 0 ∼ 10 7 . The OH emission is compared to DALI models, which point toward a high incident flux of Ly α photons in the OH emitting region. We further use the H I lines to provide an independent estimate of the accretion luminosity and mass accretion rate, in agreement with prior measurements. A comparison with other cavity disks indicates that more evolved systems such as GM Aur may be less volatile rich and are characterized by brighter OH prompt emission and abundant molecular ions.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the long-term modulation of cosmic-ray (CR) intensity across median rigidities from 11 to 107 GV using over four decades (1980–2023) of data from neutron monitors (NMs) and muon detectors (MDs). The analysis incorporates global NM stations and the Nagoya Multi-Directional Muon Telescope to evaluate the influence of key heliospheric parameters: interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength, heliospheric current sheet tilt angle (TA), and solar wind (SW) speed. Results reveal pronounced rigidity-dependent modulation patterns. Lower-rigidity NMs exhibit stronger sensitivity to heliospheric conditions, driven largely by IMF and TA, consistent with diffusion- and drift-dominated transport. In contrast, higher-rigidity MDs show reduced modulation amplitudes, with IMF remaining the dominant influence and SW gaining relative importance as drift effects diminish. These findings provide new insight into the energy-dependent roles of heliospheric drivers in CR modulation and offer a robust framework for advancing space weather prediction and heliospheric transport modeling.},

  abstract     = {The surface rippled structures of Orion molecular cloud have been attributed to the Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instability, and the influence of magnetic field and pressure on the formation and evolution of these structures is one of the important issues that has been considered frequently in the dynamics of clouds. However, the effects of magnetic field inhomogeneity and compressibility variations are still underexplored. Here, the two-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations are performed to study the evolution of the KH instability in the Orion Nebula in the presence of a nonuniform magnetic field parallel to the flow direction. The results indicate that the rippled structures in the near Trapezium Cluster region are more pronounced. Also, the sound Mach number increases with decreasing gas pressure, enhancing the system compressibility and weakening the KH instability. And the position of the slow rarefaction layer, where the gas pressure is relatively weak, corresponds to that of the strong compression layer of the magnetic flux tube. Finally, it is found that the strong magnetic field gradient with small magnetic shear thickness between the H II region and the rippled region has a stabilizing effect on instability, which is a result of the increased magnetic field strength within the shear layer. Based on these results, it is preliminarily discussed that the magnetic field in the Orion Nebula is the key feedback process to regulate or stimulate the formation of stars, and the compressibility also affects the efficiency of the star formation.},

  abstract     = {Compact object binaries with accreting white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes are crucial for understanding accretion physics. In this study, we identify accreting compact object binary candidates in the Spectrum–Roentgen–Gamma/eROSITA eRASS1 by combining their X-ray fluxes with Gaia photometry and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) time-domain observations. Candidates are selected based on their location in the “X-ray Main Sequence,” a diagram incorporating their X-ray-to-optical flux ratios and optical colors, which suggest accretion-driven X-ray emission. We identify 22 candidates in the eRASS1 catalog using a three-step selection process: (1) cross-matching to a unique Gaia optical counterpart within a 10″ radius; (2) requiring X-ray-to-optical flux ratios exceeding the “X-ray Main Sequence”; and (3) detecting short-period variability in ZTF time-domain photometry. The resulting 22 candidates, including two previously confirmed compact object binaries, represent promising candidates for spectroscopic follow-up to confirm their accreting nature. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining X-ray-to-optical flux ratios and optical colors jointly with time-domain photometry to uncover accreting compact object binaries. The approach is scalable and adaptable to future multiwavelength sky surveys, offering a promising path toward a more complete census of compact object binaries in the Galaxy.},

  abstract     = {We present Mantis Shrimp , a multisurvey deep learning model for photometric redshift estimation that fuses ultraviolet (Galaxy Evolution Explorer), optical (PanSTARRS), and infrared (UnWISE) imagery. Machine learning is now an established approach for photometric redshift estimation, with generally acknowledged higher performance in areas with a high density of spectroscopically identified galaxies over template-based methods. Multiple works have shown that image-based convolutional neural networks can outperform tabular-based color/magnitude models. In comparison to tabular models, image models have additional design complexities: It is largely unknown how to fuse inputs from different instruments that have different resolutions or noise properties. The Mantis Shrimp model estimates the conditional density estimate of redshift using cutout images. The density estimates are well calibrated, and the point estimates perform well in the distribution of available spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with (bias = 1e-2), scatter (NMAD = 2.44e-2), and catastrophic outlier rate ( η >0.15 = 4.51%). We find that early-fusion approaches (e.g., resampling and stacking images from different instruments) match the performance of late-fusion approaches (e.g., concatenating latent space representations), so that the design choice ultimately is left to the user. Finally, we study how the model learns to use information across bands, finding evidence that our model successfully incorporates information from all surveys. The applicability of our model to the analysis of large populations of galaxies is limited by the speed and ease of downloading and preparing cutouts from external servers; however, our model could be useful in smaller studies such as in generating priors over redshift for stellar population synthesis.},

  abstract     = {The IBEX-Lo instrument on the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission observes primary and secondary interstellar helium in its four lowest energy steps. Observations of these helium populations have been analyzed and compared to simulations using the analytic full integration of neutrals model. A systematic difference is observed between the simulations and observations of secondary helium during solar cycle (SC) 24. We show that elastic scattering of primary helium by solar wind protons, which redistributes atoms from the core of the primary helium flux distribution, provides an explanation of the observed divergence from simulations. We test the validity of this explanation by showing that the elastic scattering also forms a halo in the wings of the primary helium distribution in the spin-angle plane. Correcting the simulation for the effects of elastic scattering requires an increase of the estimated density of primary helium, compared to previous estimates by Ulysses/GAS. The combined density of interstellar helium, derived from the previous studies, has been recalculated to be 0.0153 ± 0.0011. Based on our analysis of IBEX observations and χ 2 minimization of simulation data that include the effects of elastic scattering, any estimation of neutral interstellar helium density at 1 au by direct detection of the peak flux of neutral helium needs to be adjusted by ∼12%.},

Designing nanoparticles (NPs) to cross the BBB and deliver drugs could greatly improve the treatment of NDDs; however, current approaches to designing materials for drug delivery are generally slow. This study introduces an approach integrating information fusion, Python encoding, perturbation theory, and machine learning to predict the behaviour of NPs as drug delivery systems. Using an extensive pharmacokinetic database, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and decision tree algorithms are trained and optimised. The random forest model achieves accuracies of 95.1% and 89.7% on training and testing data, respectively. As a proof of concept for the model’s utility, four novel Fe 3 O 4 NP systems are synthesised via thermal decomposition and functionalised for water solubility. Structural, morphological, and magnetic characterisations are performed. The ML model is then applied to these synthesised NPs, with predictions identifying PMAO-coated NPs as promising candidates for BBB and neuronal cell lines. This design framework offers significant advancements in the efficient identification of promising potential NP candidates for NDDs drug delivery, enabling predictions of desirable bioactivity profiles.},

We introduce POMMix , a mixture model extension of POM which leverages mono-molecular olfactory data to build meaningful mixture representations of smells. Our model builds upon the symmetries of the problem space in a hierarchical manner: (1) graph neural networks for building mono-molecular embeddings, (2) attention mechanisms for aggregating molecular representations into mixture representations, and (3) cosine prediction heads to encode olfactory perceptual distance in the mixture embedding space. POMMix achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets. We perform comprehensive ablation studies of the components of POMMix to understand the contribution of each component. We evaluate the generalizability of the model, explore olfactory phenomena with the representations, and analyze the interpretability of the representations.

We introduce neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) as a novel data-driven approach for modelling the complex interaction between VN activity and blood glucose levels in rats. We utilise data collected from 12 rats including high-frequency neural recordings from single-channel microwire electrodes implanted around the left cervical VN, alongside capillary blood glucose measurements taken every 5 min. We compare the performance of the NCDE against traditional machine learning models–feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs)— for forecasting future blood glucose levels. The input features comprised the frequency and mean amplitude of detected VN spikes, combined with initial glucose concentration over the prediction window. Results demonstrate that NCDE significantly outperforms FFNNs, CNNs, and GRUs achieving a mean squared error (MSE) below 10%, compared to over 15% for the baseline models. Furthermore, replacing the real neural recordings with random noise led to a sharp increase in MSE (over 20%), confirming the ability of the NCDE in extracting meaningful neural signal information. These findings underscore the potential of NCDEs to enhance physiological time-series modelling, particularly for applications in bioelectronic medicine and precision neural signal decoding.},

  abstract     = {As quantum computing continues to advance alongside machine learning, Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) have gained attention as a compelling generative modeling approach in quantum machine learning. Despite their potential, most existing QGAN implementations rely on manually designed quantum circuits, which often suffer from high complexity and limited scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) method built upon the SuperCircuit framework. This approach enables the automatic discovery of efficient quantum circuit structures tailored for generative tasks, thereby reducing gate count. However, applying SuperCircuit-based QAS directly to QGANs presents two primary challenges: an expansive search space and a lack of guarantees regarding circuit efficiency. To mitigate these issues, we incorporate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a PCA-guided feature distribution mechanism during preprocessing. This strategy both compresses the search space and ensures balanced allocation of principal components across sub-generators. Extensive experiments confirm the viability of the proposed framework. When employing the discovered quantum circuits, QAS-QGAN achieves image quality comparable to a state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline (Silver et al 2023 2023 IEEE/CVF Int. Conf. on Computer Vision (ICCV) pp 7007–16) on both the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. Notably, our model reduces the number of two-qubit gates by 52.08% on MNIST and 52.92% on Fashion MNIST, highlighting substantial improvements in quantum resource efficiency. Furthermore, the model successfully generates high-resolution facial images ( 109 \times 89 ) on the CelebA dataset, demonstrating strong scalability and practical applicability.},

While PINNs typically use multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) as their underlying architecture, recent advancements have explored alternative neural network structures. One such innovation is the Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN), which has demonstrated benefits over traditional MLPs, including faster neural scaling and better interpretability. The application of KANs to physics-informed learning has led to the development of Physics-Informed KANs (PIKANs), enabling the use of KANs to solve PDEs. However, despite their advantages, KANs often suffer from slower training speeds, particularly in higher-dimensional problems where the number of collocation points grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the system. To address this challenge, we introduce Separable Physics-Informed Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (SPIKANs). This novel architecture applies the principle of separation of variables to PIKANs, decomposing the problem such that each dimension is handled by an individual KAN. This approach drastically reduces the computational complexity of training without sacrificing accuracy, facilitating their application to higher-dimensional PDEs. Through a series of benchmark problems, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SPIKANs, showcasing their superior scalability and performance compared to PIKANs and highlighting their potential for solving complex, high-dimensional PDEs in scientific computing.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of scene depth from monocular images has become crucial in fields such as spatial perception and computer vision. However, unsupervised depth estimation methods based on view synthesis often ignore the significant impact of non-Lambertian surfaces and ghosting artifacts. In this study, we propose a self-learning depth reconstruction framework. This framework introduces a depth consistency loss to compensate for the failure of the photometric assumption in non-Lambertian regions. Additionally, we design an intrinsic consistency loss that leverages variance as a game-theoretic strategy to ensure the robustness of our model. Finally, we introduce a physics-inspired ghosting mask to eliminate ghosting artifacts. We also design a multi-path transformer layer that integrates the Transformer’s global dependency modeling capability into CNNs, thereby enhancing the model’s performance. Experimental results show that our model demonstrates excellent performance in non-Lambertian regions. Compared with state-of-the-art methods that merely rely on the photometric assumption, our method achieves average improvements of 9.29% and 2.86% on the Sq Rel and RMSE metrics across three network models. Furthermore, it exhibits outstanding zero-shot generalization capability on external datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/IkeFwd/Icdepth .},

  abstract     = {Computational methods like grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning (ML) have accelerated metal–organic frameworks (MOF) exploration but are typically limited to a narrow range of adsorbates due to data availability and force field constraints. In this study, we introduce a dataset of diverse MOF–molecule pairs for Henry’s constant prediction, D–MOPH–25, which systematically explores a diverse chemical space by combining 113 molecular adsorbates with over 5000 MOF structures through an active learning process. D–MOPH–25 constitutes the most diverse adsorbate dataset used in any ML study of molecular adsorption in MOFs to date. Our workflow builds a benchmark for predicting Henry’s constants at 300 K, leveraging conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification. Assessment through Shannon entropy and uniform manifold approximation and projection confirms the comprehensiveness of D–MOPH–25 while highlighting the importance of robust classification to filter out unphysical data points in regression tasks. Although future enhancements in model architecture and sampling criteria could improve predictive performance, our dataset already spans the target space using only 2.31% of total possibilities. This comprehensive dataset facilitates assessment of model generalizability across adsorbate species and can establish a foundation for high-throughput MOF screening and ML-driven separation processes.},

The framework leverages the equation-constrained generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations with \mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10\,000\} , the approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to deterministic surrogates. At \mathrm{Re} = 1000 and 3000, the model faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ( \mathrm{Re} = 10\,000 ), it remains the first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically meaningful predictions.},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot learning with vision-language models (VLMs) has shown promising results in histopathological image classification. However, existing approaches often under-utilize domain-specific adaptations that could enhance performance in specialized medical tasks. In this study, we systematically evaluate three modular, post-hoc enhancements to standard zero-shot VLM pipelines: (1) cosine similarity calibration for affinity matrix construction, (2) prompt template enhancement via diverse clinical prompts, and (3) adaptive hyperparameter tuning using a Gaussian mixture model-based method for adjusting pseudo-labeling weights ( λ ) and support set contributions ( γ ), following Zanella et al We conduct extensive zero-shot experiments on the NCT-CRC-HE-100 K dataset, using 60 000 patches for validation of inference-time hyperparameters and reserving 40 000 patches as an independent test set. No training or fine-tuning was performed. The evaluation was carried out across five VLMs: CLIP, CONCH, PLIP, Quilt-B16, and Quilt-B32. Results show that each enhancement module yields significant accuracy gains. Cosine calibration improves CLIP (+7.8%), CONCH (+1.53%), PLIP (+14.3%), Quilt-B16 (+16.1%), and Quilt-B32 (+11.4%). Prompt enhancement yields accuracy gains in PLIP (+16.8%) and Quilt-B32 (+29.9%), with limited effect on CLIP or CONCH. Adaptive tuning yields large improvements in PLIP (+28.4%). The best performance is achieved with the full combination of enhancements, with PLIP reaching 87.88% (+27.88%, p < 0.001) and Quilt-B32 reaching 88.38% (+36.1%) over their baselines. CLIP showed significance only with cosine calibration ( p < 0.001), reflecting its contrastive learning backbone. Although CONCH reached the highest raw accuracy (92.63%) under the full enhancement setting, this performance appears primarily driven by its histopathology-specific pretraining; statistically significant gains emerged only in cosine-based combinations, indicating limited responsiveness to prompt or tuning. Our findings highlight the critical role of structured modular enhancements in optimizing VLM performance for specialized clinical domains.},

In this paper, we develop, train, and evaluate a new type of autoencoder, molecular O(3) encoding net (Mo3ENet), for multi-type point clouds, for which we propose a new reconstruction loss, capitalizing on a Gaussian mixture representation of the input and output point clouds. Mo3ENet is end-to-end equivariant, meaning the learned representation can be manipulated on O(3), a practical bonus. An appropriately trained Mo3ENet latent space comprises a universal embedding for scalar, vector, and tensorial molecule property prediction tasks, as well as other downstream tasks incorporating the 3D molecular pose, and we demonstrate its fitness on several such tasks.},

To this end the model is supplied with a set of attractors which are a priori embedded in the inter-node coupling matrix, via its spectral decomposition. Learning amounts to tuning the residual parameters, in order to shape a non-equilibrium path which bridges the input (the data to be classified) and the output (the target memory slot). The imposed attractors are unaltered by the training, and this enables for ex post comparisons to be eventually drawn, e.g. as it concerns the size of their associated basins of attraction. A stochastic variant of the CVFR model is also studied and found to be robust to non-targeted adversarial attacks, which corrupt with a random perturbation the items to be eventually classified. Taken as a whole, here we show that a family of biologically plausible models written in terms of coupled ODEs can efficiently cope with a non-trivial classification task.},

  abstract     = {A critical challenge in particle physics is combining results from diverse experimental setups that measure the same physical quantity to enhance precision and statistical power, a process known as a global fit. Global fits of sterile neutrino searches, hunts for additional neutrino oscillation frequencies and amplitudes, present an intriguing case study. In such a scenario, the key assumptions underlying Wilks’ theorem, a cornerstone of most classic frequentist analyses, do not hold. The method of Feldman and Cousins, a trials-based approach which does not assume Wilks’ theorem, becomes computationally prohibitive for complex or intractable likelihoods. To bypass this limitation, we borrow a technique from simulation-based inference (SBI) to estimate likelihood ratios for use in building trials-based confidence intervals, speeding up test statistic evaluations by a factor \gt\!\!\!10^4 per grid point, resulting in a faster, but approximate, frequentist fitting framework. Applied to a subset of sterile neutrino search data involving the disappearance of muon-flavor (anti)neutrinos, our method leverages machine learning (ML) to compute frequentist confidence intervals while significantly reducing computational expense. In addition, the SBI-based approach holds additional value by recognizing underlying systematic uncertainties that the Wilks approach does not. Thus, our method allows for more robust ML-based analyses critical to performing accurate but computationally feasible global fits. This allows, for the first time, a global fit to sterile neutrino data without assuming Wilks’ theorem. While we demonstrate the utility of such a technique studying sterile neutrino searches, it is applicable to both single-experiment and global fits of all kinds.},

The experiments involve high-energy collisions that produce complex events with many particle trajectories. Tracking charged particles resulting from collisions in the presence of a strong magnetic field is critical to enable the reconstruction of particle trajectories and precise determination of interactions. It is traditionally achieved through combinatorial approaches that scale worse than linearly as the number of hits grows. Since particle hit data naturally form a point cloud and can be structured as graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs) emerge as an intuitive and effective choice for this task. In this study, we evaluate the GNN model for track finding on the data from the GlueX experiment at Jefferson Lab. We use simulation data to train the model and test on both simulation and real GlueX measurements. We demonstrate that GNN-based track finding outperforms the currently used traditional method at GlueX in terms of segment-based efficiency at a fixed purity while providing faster inferences. We show that the GNN model can achieve significant speedup by processing multiple events in batches, which exploits the parallel computation capability of graphical processing units (GPUs). Finally, we compare the GNN implementation on GPU and field-programmable gate array and describe the trade-off.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective for processing graph-structured data but face challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and inefficient sparse matrix operations on GPUs. Quantum computing offers a promising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic approaches. In particular, quantum GNNs (QGNNs) have been explored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the dimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches either simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work introduces the guided graph compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph autoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node features. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream classification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical classifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a classification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that involves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons. We compare GGC to a model that uses the autoencoder as a preprocessing step and to a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results demonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the testing of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.},

  abstract     = {A high-dimensional neural network potential (HDNNP) is developed to accurately model the potential energy surface of boron carbide. The HDNNP is trained on an extensive dataset of structures generated using a Monte Carlo algorithm, covering a wide range of stoichiometries and structural configurations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided energy and atomic force data, which were encoded using atom-centered symmetry functions to capture local atomic environments. The resulting HDNNP exhibits exceptional predictive performance, accurately estimating energies and forces across diverse structural configurations of boron carbide. The model effectively captures essential structural, energetic, and mechanical properties, including elastic behavior and the influence of stoichiometry on stability. The HDNNP development followed an iterative refinement strategy, in which the initial training set was systematically expanded to 2931 structures by incorporating finite-temperature AIMD snapshots at 300 K, 600 K, and 1000 K, as well as extrapolative configurations from MD simulations and defect-containing cells. This approach resulted in an HDNNP model that is numerically stable and physically consistent up to 500 K, with only minor drift observed at 600 K. The HDNNP achieves exceptional accuracy in predicting energies, forces, and mechanical properties across temperatures, reproducing Young’s modulus values of 416 GPa at 10 K and 420\pm20 GPa at 300 K, in close agreement with DFT and experimental ranges. The predicted ultimate tensile strength of 43 GPa at a failure strain of 0.14 at 300 K is consistent with atomistic simulations (40.23 GPa, strain 0.12). Comparative MD simulations show that the HDNNP outperforms Tersoff and ReaxFF in both accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling timesteps up to an order of magnitude larger, achieving 43% faster performance than Tersoff and 79% faster than ReaxFF. These results highlight the HDNNP as a robust and efficient tool for simulating boron carbide across a range of temperatures and deformation conditions, offering quantum-level accuracy for large-scale atomistic modeling in extreme environments.},

  abstract     = {A novel quintile multi-model ensemble (QMME) framework is introduced to improve future precipitation projections from MMEs. The QMME method divides daily precipitation into five quintiles, thereby capturing not only extreme rainfall but also the full spectrum of precipitation intensities. This approach surpasses conventional ensembles, such as the equal MME (EMME) and the weighted MME (WMME), in accurately reflecting the distinct characteristics of individual climate models. To develop the QMME, this study first applies empirical quantile mapping to correct biases in daily precipitation outputs from 14 coupled model intercomparison project 6 (CMIP6) general circulation models (GCMs). Historical observations (1980–2014) from 61-gauge stations in South Korea are then used to evaluate GCM performance within each quintile. The QMME framework integrates each GCM’s historical performance and future uncertainty into a quintile-specific weights and combines them with XGBoost to generate enhanced precipitation time series. Four shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) are considered to assess a range of future scenarios. As a result, the QMME consistently outperforms both EMME and WMME in capturing both extreme precipitation events and moderate rainfall conditions. An evaluation using reliability ensemble averaging confirms that the QMME more effectively accounts for inter-model variability and reduces uncertainty, thus providing robust projections of future precipitation. This quintile-based methodology can be readily extended to other hydroclimatic variables and geographic regions, offering significant potential for improving climate impact assessments and guiding risk management in water resources planning.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted increasing attention in gravitational wave (GW) data analysis due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from raw strain data. However, the physical meaning of these learned features remains underexplored, limiting the interpretability of such models. In this work, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines a CNN-based feature extractor with a random forest (RF) classifier to improve both detection performance and interpretability. Unlike prior approaches that directly connect classifiers to CNN outputs, our method introduces four physically interpretable metrics-variance, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), waveform overlap, and peak amplitude-computed from the final convolutional layer. These are jointly used with the CNN output probability in the RF classifier to enable more informed decision boundaries. Tested on long-duration strain datasets, our hybrid model outperforms a baseline-CNN model, achieving a relative improvement of 21% in sensitivity at a fixed false alarm rate of 10 events per month. Notably, it also shows improved detection of low-SNR signals (SNR \unicode{x2A7D} 10), which are especially vulnerable to misclassification in noisy environments. Feature importance analysis and ablation studies reveal that handcrafted features play a significant role in classification decisions and contribute to improved performance. These findings suggest that physically motivated post-processing of CNN feature maps can serve as a valuable tool for interpretable and efficient GW detection, bridging the gap between deep learning and domain knowledge.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting reaction rate coefficients is crucial for various chemical engineering tasks, such as kinetic modeling and drug synthesis planning. Traditional methods like group additivity and rate rules have limitations, prompting the exploration of machine learning methods to predict these coefficients. These machine learning models are often combined with quantum chemical calculations to improve their performance. While often accurate, these approaches slow down predictions due to the need for quantum chemical calculations, particularly for transition states. This study addresses the issue by introducing a quantum chemical property that does not require transition state calculations but still correlates well with the rate coefficient. We further enhance the prediction speed by training a machine learning model to predict this property. Finally, we propose two approaches using this machine learning model to predict the rate coefficients of nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions in fractions of a second.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a benchmark to evaluate the capability of AI to solve problems in theoretical physics (TP), focusing on high-energy theory and cosmology. The first iteration of our benchmark consists of 57 problems of varying difficulty, from undergraduate to research level. These problems are novel in the sense that they do not come from public problem collections. We evaluate our data set on various open and closed language models, including o3-mini, o1, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o and versions of Llama and Qwen. While we find impressive progress in model performance with the most recent models, our research-level difficulty problems are mostly unsolved. We address challenges of auto-verifiability and grading, and discuss common failure modes. While currently state-of-the art models are still of limited use for researchers, our results show that AI assisted TP research may become possible in the near future. We discuss the main obstacles towards this goal and possible strategies to overcome them. The public problems and solutions, results for various models, and updates to the data set and score distribution, are available on the website of the dataset tpbench.org .},
