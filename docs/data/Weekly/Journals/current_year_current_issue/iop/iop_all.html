The live spectra from TiDES will be used to reveal the diversity and astrophysics of both normal and exotic supernovae across the luminosity-timescale plane. The extensive host-galaxy redshift campaign will allow exploitation of the larger sample of supernovae and improve photometric classification, providing the largest-ever sample of SNe Ia, capable of a sub-2% measurement of the equation-of-state of dark energy. Finally, the TiDES reverberation mapping experiment of 700–1000 AGN will complement the SN Ia sample and extend the Hubble diagram to z ∼ 2.5.},

We find that the angular distribution of satellites in both SDSS and the mock catalog exhibits a pronounced tendency toward lopsidedness, with satellites preferentially located between the two central galaxies. Additionally, there is a significant bulging distribution characterized by a higher concentration of satellites along the line connecting the two centrals compared to those found perpendicular to it. The lopsided and bulging distributions strengthen as pair separation and halo mass increase. The mock catalog successfully reproduces the observational results across all cases considered. We find that the lopsided and bulging distribution of satellites can largely be explained by overlapping two randomly selected halos matched in mass to the actual halo pairs, along with their surrounding satellite distribution, provided that the alignment between the orientations of the halos and the line connecting the halo pairs is taken into account. This suggests that the angular distribution of satellites is a natural consequence of the formation and evolution of large-scale structure in a Λ cold dark matter universe, eliminating the need to introduce other physical origins.},

To further leverage its rich data set, we introduce a machine learning approach for gamma-hadron separation. A multilayer perceptron shows the best performance, surpassing traditional and other machine learning–based methods. This approach shows a notable improvement in the detector’s sensitivity, supported by results from both simulated and real HAWC data. In particular, it achieves a 19% increase in significance for the Crab Nebula, commonly used as a benchmark. These improvements highlight the potential of machine learning to significantly enhance the performance of HAWC and provide a valuable reference for ground-based observatories, such as the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory and the upcoming Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory.},

  abstract     = {We present the survey design and initial results from the Parallel Ionizing Emissivity (PIE) survey. PIE is a large Hubble Space Telescope survey designed to detect Lyman continuum (LyC) emitting galaxies at 3.1 < z < 3.5 and stack their images in order to measure average LyC escape fractions as a function of galaxy properties. PIE has imaged 37 independent fields in three filters (F336W, F625W, and F814W), of which 18 are observed with a fourth band (F475W) from the accompanying PIE+ program. We use photometric colors to select candidate Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at 3.1 < z < 3.5, which can be followed up using ground-based spectrographs to confirm their redshifts. Unlike previous surveys, we use many independent fields to remove biases caused by correlated absorption in the intergalactic medium (IGM). In this paper, we describe the survey design, photometric measurements, and the use of mock galaxy samples to optimize our color selection. With three filters, we can select a galaxy sample of which ≈90% are LBGs and over 30% lie in the 3.1 < z < 3.5 range for which we can detect uncontaminated LyC emission in F336W. We also use mock IGM sight lines to measure the expected transmission of the IGM, which will allow us to determine escape fractions from our stacked galaxies. We color-select ≈1400 galaxies, and predict that this includes ≈80 LyC-emitting galaxies and ≈500 that we can use in stacking. Finally, we present the Keck/LRIS spectrum of a galaxy at z ≈ 2.99, demonstrating that we can confirm the redshifts of z ∼ 3 galaxies from the ground.},

  abstract     = {Short-period ( P < 1 hr orbits) detached double white dwarf binary (DWDB) components identified with transient surveys (e.g., SDSS, Zwicky Transient Facility, hereafter ZTF) have hot surface temperatures (>10,000 K) and observed radii a factor of 2 larger than completely degenerate white dwarfs. We formulate tidal heating in helium composition, extremely low-mass white dwarf components of detached DWDBs, which reach mass transfer within a Hubble time. We combine a mass–radius relation that varies with surface temperature and the equilibrium tidal friction model of Hut 1981, where the additional orbital energy loss from tidal friction is accounted for by increases in the primary surface temperature, and hence increasing radius. Applying this heating model to the current sample of binaries with ZTF, we predict temperature increases from the present day of up to ∼40% before the onset of mass transfer. We find that helium white dwarfs are generically hot and large at the onset of mass transfer, even for the oldest DWDBs whose components can cool to be degenerate by the present day. In the population of Galactic DWDBs, we find that the onset of mass transfer should occur at orbital periods as long as 1000 s (17 minutes), or binary gravitational-wave frequency of 2 mHz. This is over 3 times longer than periods expected for degenerate white dwarfs (5 minutes). Since mass transferring DWDBs are progenitors for a variety of transients and stellar populations, e.g., RCrB stars, AM CVn binaries, so-called Type .Ia supernova, the finite temperature of donor white dwarfs should be taken into account.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning methods are well established in the classification of quasars (QSOs). However, the advent of light-curve observations adds a great amount of complexity to the problem. Our goal is to use the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to create a catalog of QSOs. We process the ZTF DR20 light curves with a transformer artificial neural network and combine different surveys with extreme gradient boosting. Based on ZTF g -band and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) observations, we find 4,849,574 objects classified as QSOs with confidence higher than 90% (QZO). We robustly classify objects fainter than the 5 σ signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) limit at g = 20.8 by requiring g < n obs /80 + 20.375. For 33% of QZO objects, with available WISE data, we publish redshifts with estimated error Δ z /(1 + z ) = 0.14. We find that ZTF classification is superior to the Pan-STARRS static bands, and on par with WISE and Gaia measurements, but the light curves provide the most important features for QSO classification in the ZTF data set. Using ZTF g -band data with at least 100 observational epochs per light curve, we obtain a 97% F1 score for QSOs. We find that with 3 day median cadence, a survey time span of at least 900 days is required to achieve a 90% QSO F1 score. However, one can obtain the same score with a survey time span of 1800 days and the median cadence prolonged to 12 days.},

  abstract     = {Multimessenger observations of gravitational waves and electromagnetic emission from compact object mergers offer unique insights into the structure of neutron stars, the formation of heavy elements, and the expansion rate of the Universe. With the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave detectors currently in their fourth observing run (O4), it is an exciting time for detecting these mergers. However, assessing whether to follow up a candidate gravitational-wave event given limited telescope time and resources is challenging; the candidate can be a false alert due to detector glitches, or may not have any detectable electromagnetic counterpart even if it is real. GWSkyNet-Multi is a machine learning model developed to facilitate follow-up decisions by providing real-time classification of candidate events, using localization information released in LVK rapid public alerts. Here we introduce GWSkyNet-Multi II , an updated model targeted toward providing more robust and informative predictions during O4 and beyond. Specifically, the model now provides normalized probability scores and associated uncertainties for each of the four corresponding source categories released by the LVK: glitch, binary black hole, neutron star–black hole, and binary neutron star. Informed by explainability studies of the original model, the updated model architecture is also significantly simplified, including replacing input images with intuitive summary values that are more interpretable. For significant event alerts issued during O4a and O4b, GWSkyNet-Multi II produces a prediction that is consistent with the updated LVK classification for 93% of events. The updated model can be used by the community to help make time-critical follow-up decisions.},

  abstract     = {Globular clusters (GCs) are fundamental for understanding the integrated light of old stellar populations and galaxy assembly processes. However, the role of hot, evolved stars, such as horizontal branch (HB), extreme HB, and blue stragglers, remains poorly constrained. These stars are often underrepresented or entirely excluded from stellar population models, despite their dominant contribution to the ultraviolet (UV) flux. Their presence can bias age estimates by mimicking the spectral signatures of younger populations. We examined the impact of evolved hot stars on the models using two well-studied Galactic GCs with high-quality Hubble Space Telescope photometry and integrated spectra from the International Ultraviolet Explorer and the Blanco Telescope. NGC 2808 and NGC 7089 (M 2) have extended HBs and are proxies for old stellar populations. Integrated spectra were constructed using a color magnitude diagram–based (CMD-based) method, matching observed stars to evolutionary phases and then to appropriate synthetic stellar libraries, enabling the HB morphology to be taken into account. Our findings show that the inclusion of evolved hot stars significantly improves the agreement between the model and observed spectra from the UV to the optical. The inclusion of these phases reduced the residuals in spectral comparisons. Our results reinforce that comprehensive stellar population models incorporating evolved hot components are essential to accurately date unresolved systems and to robustly trace formation histories of extragalactic galaxies.},

Using data from the Hobby–Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment, we characterized 30 white dwarfs exhibiting infrared excess, including 29 DA and 1 DB stars. While an infrared excess can arise from dusty disks or cool (sub)stellar companions, our sample is limited to stellar companions, due to our selection based on SDSS photometry, which is sensitive to excess emission at wavelengths λ < 1 μ m. Our sample contains 22 newly identified excess sources not previously reported in the literature. Spectroscopic observations are available for 10 sources via SDSS, of which only 8 have prior spectroscopic classifications in the literature. In this paper, we present the determination of the effective temperature and surface gravity of these white dwarfs. We used the Balmer line profiles to compare with current atmospheric models in order to determine the photospheric parameters of the white dwarfs, minimizing contamination introduced by the infrared source. We used photometric data from the SDSS and the Gaia mission to resolve the degeneracies between hot and cold solutions from spectroscopy, constraining the photospheric parameters. These results help refine our understanding of white dwarf evolution in binary systems, focusing on stellar companions that cause the infrared excess. This study contributes to identifying systems with potential substellar companions or unresolved stellar partners, adding to the growing effort to map out the fate of planetary systems after their host stars evolve beyond the main sequence.},

  abstract     = {Radiation exerts pressure, and therefore it is possible for an intensely bright object to balance the gravitational force near a massive compact object. General relativity demonstrates that this balance occurs for super-Eddington luminosities at a finite distance from the center of the mass. These equilibrium positions are referred to as Eddington capture surfaces (ECSs). At the ECSs, particles can collect in a thin shell, balanced between the inward curvature of spacetime and the outward flow of radiation. We adopt spherical symmetry but otherwise leave the metric functions generalized. This approach allows us to study the ECSs under the effect of arbitrary spherically symmetric metrics. We adopt a separable luminosity function that depends on both the radial direction and the angular coordinates over the surface of the star. We demonstrate that the morphology of an ECS varies depending on the angular luminosity distribution and can even split into multiple, separate, disconnected equilibrium surfaces. The ECS phenomenon is closely related to type I photospheric radius expansion X-ray bursts.},

  abstract     = {The formation of massive black holes and their coevolution with host galaxies are pivotal areas of modern astrophysics. Spherical accretion onto a central point mass serves as a foundational framework in cosmological simulations, semi-analytical models, and observational studies. In this paper, we extend the classical spherical accretion model by incorporating the gravitational potential of host galaxies, including contributions from stellar components and dark matter (DM) halos. Numerical solutions spanning scales from parsecs down to ∼10 r s reveal that the flow structure is highly sensitive to the mass and size of the DM halo. Adding a small amount of angular momentum to the accreting gas demonstrates that such flows resemble spherical Bondi accretion, with mass accretion rates converging toward the Bondi rate. We find that the low angular momentum flow resembles the spherical Bondi flow, and its mass accretion rate approaches the Bondi accretion rate. Remarkably, due to the presence of DM, the mass accretion rate increases by more than ∼100% compared to analogous hydrodynamic solutions without DM. These findings underscore the critical role of stellar and DM gravitational potentials in shaping the dynamics and accretion rates of quasi-spherical flows, providing new insights into astrophysical accretion processes.},

  abstract     = {A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star travels too close to a supermassive black hole. In some cases, accretion of the disrupted material onto the black hole launches a relativistic jet. In this paper, we present a long-term observing campaign to study the radio and submillimeter emission associated with the fifth jetted/relativistic TDE: AT 2022cmc. Our campaign reveals a long-lived counterpart. We fit three different models to our data: a nonthermal jet, a spherical outflow consisting of both thermal and nonthermal electrons, and a jet with thermal and nonthermal electrons. We find that the data are best described by a relativistic spherical outflow propagating into an environment with a density profile following R −1.8 . Comparison of AT 2022cmc to other TDEs finds agreement in the density profile of the environment but also that AT 2022cmc is twice as energetic as the other well-studied relativistic TDE, Swift J1644. Our observations of AT 2022cmc allow a thermal electron population to be inferred for the first time in a jetted transient, providing new insights into the microphysics of relativistic transients jets.},

The new lines were predicted to be observable but were not observed previously in the corona. The identifications are confirmed on the basis of observed and expected line wavelengths and radiances. The observed wavelengths are very accurate, as confirmed by neutral H and He lines measured during the same observation. The predicted wavelengths are assessed by reviewing previous experimental data used to estimate the energies of these ions. We find discrepancies with several previous measurements. A reanalysis of Solar Ultraviolet Measurement of Emitted Radiation data corrects previous measurements and provides excellent agreement with the AIR-Spec values for Si xi . AIR-Spec was developed to survey the near-infrared (NIR) coronal spectrum from above Earth’s atmosphere, a critical first step in designing future balloonborne and spaceborne instrumentation to observe coronal plasma and magnetic fields using NIR emission lines. The reported results are also of interest for ground-based observatories, as the precise measurements of line wavelength enable observers to understand the nearby telluric spectrum and determine which lines can be used from the ground.},

They are important objects for studying the accretion history of neutron stars (NSs), pulsar winds, and the origin of isolated MSPs, etc. Recently, a new eclipsing MSP, PSR J1928+1815, was discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. It is the first known pulsar with a He star companion, as suggested in Yang et al. The system features a short orbital period of ∼0.15 days and a relatively massive companion ≳1.0 M ⊙ . However, the origin of PSR J1928+1815 remains highly uncertain. In this paper, we investigated the formation of the new subclass of eclipsing MSPs containing (evolved) He star companions through the NS + He star channel. We found that if an NS binary undergoes subsequent mass-transfer phases following Case BA or Case BB, it may appear as an eclipsing MSP during the detached phase. Additionally, we obtained the initial parameter space for producing eclipsing MSPs with He star companions. Using the binary population synthesis approach, we estimated their birth rate to be ∼2.1–4.7 × 10 −4 yr −1 , corresponding to a total number of ∼220 systems in the Galaxy. Moreover, we concluded that PSR J1928+1815 may originate from the evolution of an NS + He star system with an initial orbital period of ∼0.1 days, which can undergo the Case BB mass transfer.},

Making such measurements is important both from a space weather perspective and for understanding the detailed evolution of the CME. In spite of significant efforts and multiple proposed methods, achieving this goal has not been possible to date. Here we report the first possible detection of gyroresonance emission from a CME. Assuming that the emission is happening at the third harmonic, we estimate that the magnetic field strength ranges from 7.9 to 5.6 G between 4.9 and 7.5 R ⊙ . We also demonstrate that this high magnetic field is not the average magnetic field inside the CME, but most probably is related to small magnetic islands, which are also being observed more frequently with the availability of high-resolution and high-quality white-light images.},

  abstract     = {The stellar model is still facing challenges in explaining the origin of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Double-lined detached eclipsing binaries with low-mass and similar components play an important astrophysical role in accurately deriving fundamental parameters, investigating stellar properties, and restricting theoretical stellar models of low-mass stars. Using high-precision light curves and Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope spectra, we first obtained the fundamental parameters of the four detached binaries (NSVS 07453183, V644 Aur, V912 Per, and V1250 Tau). Except for V1250 Tau ( q sp ∼ 0.95), the mass ratios of the other three targets are almost equal to 1, which is consistent with the core fragmentation and dynamical capture theories of binary formation. The O − C curves of these systems based on current data exhibit cyclic variations, which is due to the light-travel time effect caused by the presence of a third body. Among them, the third body of V912 Per is likely to be a stellar black hole ({M}_{3}\sin {i}_{3}=12.57{M}_{\odot }) . The O − C diagram of NSVS 07453183 shows double-cycle oscillations, which means that it is perhaps a quadruple system. The third body of NSVS 07453183 is an M3-type main-sequence star based on third light analysis, and the fourth body maybe a brown dwarf. The obtained Hertzsprung–Russell diagram based on the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics code suggested that the components of these four targets are main-sequence stars. These four targets will gradually form Algol-type binaries in the future, which are important systems for studying the reversal of the mass ratio.},

The investigation focuses on waves in the unique lunar environment, characterized by the absence of a global magnetic field and the presence of localized crustal magnetic anomalies. We carefully investigate the spatial distribution, amplitude, and peak frequencies of these waves, including their dependence on solar wind speed ( V sw ), dynamic pressure ( P dyn ), and interplanetary magnetic field strength ( B tot ). The results show that the wave amplitudes are predominantly between 0.01 and 0.3 nT, with significant differences in the spatial distribution of the ∼100 Hz waves inside and outside the Earth’s magnetosphere. Magnetic connection to the lunar surface significantly enhances the wave occurrence rate, while strong crustal magnetic fields suppress it. Wave amplitude exhibits a positive correlation with P dyn , and peak frequency increases with B tot . These obtained distribution features and dependencies of lunar ∼100 Hz whistler-mode waves are valuable to improve the current understanding of wave generation mechanisms and the underlying contribution of wave–particle interactions in the lunar plasma environment.},

Although synchrotron radiation is intrinsically highly polarized, the observed fractional polarization f = P / I is below 5% over most of the sky. Despite this marked depolarization, the remaining signal is highly aligned, with median scatter in polarization angle less than 15° within regions of 20° diameter on the sky. We use magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to determine the extent to which MHD turbulence can reproduce the observed pattern of substantial depolarization with minimal angular scatter. We evaluate both the synchrotron fractional polarization and polarization angle as projected through a suite of simulations with sonic Mach number 0.5\lt {{ \mathcal M }}_{{ \mathcal S }}\lt 6 and magnetic (Alfvén) Mach number 0.5\lt {{ \mathcal M }}_{{\rm{A}}}\lt 4 . Simulations with a weakly magnetized plasma and strongly supersonic flow ( {{ \mathcal M }}_{{\rm{A}}}=2 with 4\lt {{ \mathcal M }}_{{ \mathcal S }}\lt 6 ) match the observed high-latitude sky. The fit improves when the angle between the observer and the seed magnetic field is 15°–30° from perpendicular, in agreement with models of the local inclination angle of the large-scale Galactic magnetic field. Additional improvement occurs if the estimated brightness of the unpolarized Galactic synchrotron emission is reduced, either by subtracting an unpolarized extragalactic component from the observed radio maps or by applying a steeper spectra index when scaling the unpolarized synchrotron intensity from 408 MHz to 30 GHz.},

  abstract     = {Both eruptive and confined flares—those having and lacking, respectively, an associated large-scale coronal mass ejection—are frequently observed in solar active regions (ARs). The physical mechanisms controlling the nature of these flares are poorly understood, requiring a detailed investigation of both the magnetic environment and the dynamic flare production process within the source region. Here we study a confined X6.4 flare with a failed filament eruption in AR 13590, observed by the SDO spacecraft on 2024 February 22. AR 13590 exhibited a quadrupolar magnetic configuration consisting of one central and two side arcades of low-lying loops, overlain by a fourth arcade of high-lying loops. A potential-field extrapolation contains a low-altitude null point at a height of approximately 5 Mm. This is a classic magnetic-breakout topology, except that the rising filament lay under one of the side arcades. The confined flare generated four ribbons located in all four of the major polarities, and proceeded in two phases, characterized by two successive stages of ribbon brightenings accompanied by forward and then reverse motion of the brightenings along the interior ribbons. We propose that the two phases represent breakout reconnection in the null region, which removed the flux ahead of the rising filament, followed by “anti-breakout” reconnection, corresponding to a reversed process as those flux systems evolved back toward the pre-eruption configuration. We discuss the implications of these observations for understanding how intense flares can occur without the expulsion of material from the solar corona.},

  abstract     = {Identifying active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies is critical for understanding black hole formation but remains observationally challenging due to their low luminosities, metallicities, and star formation–driven emission that can obscure AGN signatures. Machine learning techniques, particularly unsupervised methods, offer new ways to address these challenges by uncovering patterns in complex, multiwavelength data. In this study, we apply Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to explore the spectral energy distribution (SED) manifold of dwarf galaxies and evaluate AGN selection biases across various diagnostics. We train a 51 × 51 SOM on 30,344 dwarf galaxies ( z < 0.055, M * < 10 9.5 M ⊙ ) from the NSA catalog using nine-band photometry spanning near-UV to mid-infrared. A set of 438 previously identified dwarf AGNs, selected via mid-infrared color, optical emission lines, X-ray, optical variability, and broad-line features, was mapped onto the SOM. AGNs identified by different methods occupy distinct and partially overlapping regions in SED space, reflecting biases related to host galaxy properties. Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)-selected AGNs are strongly concentrated in lower-mass regions and form two distinct clumps: one associated with bluer, starburst-like systems and the other with redder galaxies showing spectral features more typical of AGNs. This separation may help disentangle true AGN hosts from starburst contaminants in WISE-selected samples. Additionally, AGNs selected via various diagnostics tend to avoid regions of strong star formation, while a subset of lower-mass AGNs occupy SOM regions indicative of high AGN luminosity relative to their stellar content. Our results demonstrate the utility of manifold learning in refining AGN selection in the low-mass regime.},

  abstract     = {We propose a model for dust formation in Type II supernovae (SNe) interacting with confined circumstellar material (CSM), motivated by recent time-domain surveys that have revealed a substantial fraction of SN progenitors to be surrounded by CSM ejected shortly before core collapse. We simulate the pre-SN mass eruption and the resulting confined CSM using the open-source code CHIPS , and follow the subsequent evolution of the SN ejecta and its interaction with the CSM. We show that a cold dense shell (CDS) is formed at the radiative shock under a wide range of conditions and later undergoes rapid adiabatic cooling during free expansion, leading to efficient dust condensation. The resulting dust mass ranges from ∼10 −3 M ⊙ to 0.1 M ⊙ , depending on the mass and spatial extent of the CSM. We further calculate the infrared (IR) emission from the newly formed dust and find broad consistency with observations of SN 1998S. Notably, the IR light curve exhibits a rapid rise within ≲10 days, closely resembling that of kilonovae (KNe). This suggests that dust emission powered by confined CSM interaction may be also discovered in KN searches. Moreover, the high-density environment of the CDS may allow dust grains to grow to larger sizes, enhancing their survivability against destruction by reverse shocks propagating from the interstellar medium at later times.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel formation channel for supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in the early Universe, driven by primordial black holes (PBHs). Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs ( m BH ∼ 10 6 M ⊙ ) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation, and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion. Lyman–Werner radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H 2 cooling, shifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with significant baryon–dark matter streaming velocities ( v b χ ≳ 0.8 σ b χ , where σ b χ is the rms streaming velocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense, gravitationally unstable atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH’s wake. These clouds exhibit sustained high inflow rates ( {\dot{M}}_{{\rm{infall}}}\gtrsim 0.1-0.01\,{M}_{\odot } yr −1 ), providing ideal conditions for DCBH formation from rapidly growing supermassive stars of ∼10 5 M ⊙ at redshift z ∼ 20–10. The resulting systems form SMBH binaries with initial mass ratios q\sim { \mathcal O }(0.1) and separations of ∼10 pc. Such PBH-DCBH binaries provide testable predictions for JWST and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, potentially explaining select high- z sources like little red dots, and represent gravitational-wave sources for future missions like LISA and TianQin—bridging early-Universe black hole physics, multimessenger astronomy, and dark matter theory.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) to experimental data recorded by the KASCADE experiment to reconstruct the mass composition of cosmic rays around the knee region. A set of four extensive air shower parameters sensitive to the primary particle mass ( LCm , N μ , N e , and lateral shower age) was considered, whose coordinates were transformed into a new orthogonal basis that maximally captures the data variance. Based on the experimental distributions of the first two principal components (PCA0 versus PCA1) and full Monte Carlo simulations of the KASCADE array considering five types of primary particles (p, He, C, Si, and Fe) and three hadronic interaction models (EPOS-LHC, QGSjet-II-04, and SIBYLL 2.3d), we obtained the evolution of the abundance of each primary species as a function of energy, as well as the evolution of the mean logarithmic mass with energy. We found that the reconstruction of the mass composition resulting from this comprehensive analysis significantly reduces dependence on the hadronic interaction model used in the simulation process, even though the initial input parameters are model dependent. Moreover, the results support the idea that around the knee region, the abundance of the light component (protons) decreases, while the heavy component shows a slight increase. The evolution of \langle \mathrm{ln}(A)\rangle as a function of energy derived from this analysis shows excellent agreement with recent results from the LHAASO–KM2A experiment and aligns very well with the predictions of the data-driven Global Spline Fit model.},

It produces strong ultraviolet and optical emission that irradiates the planet-forming environment. In this work, we characterize the magnetospheric geometries, accretion rates, extinction properties, and hotspot structures of 67 T Tauri stars in the largest and most consistent study of ultraviolet and optical accretion signatures to date. To do so, we apply an accretion flow model to velocity-resolved H α profiles for T Tauri stars from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ULLYSES program with consistently derived stellar parameters. We find typical magnetospheric truncation radii to be almost half of the usually assumed value of 5 stellar radii. We then model the same stars’ HST/STIS spectra with an accretion shock model, finding a diverse range of hotspot structures. Phase-folding multiepoch shock models reveals rotational modulation of observed hotspot energy flux densities, indicative of hotspots that persist for at least three stellar rotation periods. For the first time, we perform a large-scale, self-consistent comparison of accretion rates measured using accretion flow and shock models, finding them to be consistent within ∼0.16 dex for contemporaneous observations. Finally, we find that up to 50% of the total accretion luminosity is at short wavelengths accessible only from space, highlighting the crucial role of ultraviolet spectra in constraining accretion spectral energy distributions, hotspot structure, and extinction.},

  abstract     = {The dynamical evolution of short-period low-mass binary stars (with mass M < 1.5 M ⊙ , from formation to the late main sequence, and with orbital periods less than ∼10 days) is strongly influenced by tidal dissipation. This process drives orbital and rotational evolution that ultimately results in circularized orbits and rotational frequencies synchronized with the orbital frequency. Despite the fundamental role of tidal dissipation in binary evolution, constraining its magnitude (typically parameterized by the tidal quality factor { \mathcal Q } ) has remained discrepant by orders of magnitude in the existing literature. Recent observational constraints from time-series photometry (e.g., Kepler, K2, TESS), as well as advances in theoretical models to incorporate a more realistic gravitational response within stellar interiors, are invigorating new optimism for resolving this long-standing problem. To investigate the prospects and limitations of constraining tidal { \mathcal Q } , we use global sensitivity analysis and simulation-based inference to examine how the initial conditions and tidal { \mathcal Q } influence the observable orbital and rotational states. Our results show that, even under the simplest and most tractable models of tides, the path toward inferring { \mathcal Q } from individual systems is severely hampered by inherent degeneracies between tidal { \mathcal Q } and the initial conditions, even when considering the strongest possible constraints (i.e., binaries with precise masses, ages, orbital periods, eccentricities, and rotation periods). Finally, as an alternative, we discuss how population synthesis approaches may be a more promising path forward for validating tidal theories.},

In this paper, we investigate the magnetic fields in the Eos cloud, near the interface between the atomic cold neutral medium (CNM) and molecular gas, using dust emission and extinction polarimetry. A histogram of relative orientation analysis shows that the magnetic field is preferentially parallel to the density structure of the cloud, while a Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi analysis finds magnetic field strengths of 6 ± 3 μ G across the Eos cloud and 12 ± 4 μ G in the somewhat denser MBM 40 subregion. These results are consistent with a previous estimate of magnetic field strength in the Local Bubble and suggest that the fields in the Eos cloud are dynamically important compared to both gravity and turbulence. Our findings are fully consistent with the expected behavior of magnetized, non-self-gravitating gas near the CNM/molecular cloud boundary.},

Among many scientific applications, the overlap of this stellar sample with targeted exoplanet transit survey stars presents an opportunity to understand planet occurrence in the context of stellar multiplicity on a large scale. Yet, any interpretation of occurrence relies upon an understanding of survey sensitivity. While the sensitivity to planets in transit surveys is well-understood, a characterization of the sensitivity of Gaia to unresolved binaries is also critical. We describe here a statistical framework called paired , which we developed to enable the forward modeling of Gaia radial velocity observables for large samples of stars. The paired machinery links the reported radial velocity noise for a given star from Gaia to the probability of a spatially unresolved stellar companion. We demonstrate how this enables the user, given an observed distribution of individual binary “probabilities” for a set of stars, to understand this distribution within the sensitivity limits of Gaia. For the subset of stars with the highest probability of excess radial velocity noise, we describe the ability of paired to constrain the semi-amplitude of the stellar binary. Where possible, we benchmark our inferred radial velocity semi-amplitudes against those from ground-based radial velocity surveys, as well as the subset published by Gaia DR3 itself. We aim for paired to be a community tool for the exploration of the effects of binarity on planets at a population level, but also for any user interested in stellar populations.},

  abstract     = {A damped random walk (DRW) process is often used to describe the temporal UV/optical continuum variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, recent investigations have shown that this model fails to capture the full spectrum of AGN variability. In this work, we model the 22 yr long light curves of 21,767 quasars, spanning the redshift range 0.28 < z < 2.71, as a noise-driven damped harmonic oscillator (DHO) process. The light curves, in the optical g and r bands, are collected and combined from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, and the Zwicky Transient Facility. A DHO process can be defined using four parameters, two for describing its long-term behavior/variability, and the other two for describing its short-term behavior/variability. We find that the best-fit DHO model describes the observed variability of our quasar light curves better than the best-fit DRW model. Furthermore, the best-fit DHO parameters exhibit correlations with the rest-frame wavelength, the Eddington ratio, and the black hole mass of our quasars. Based on the power spectral density shape of the best-fit DHOs and these correlations, we suggest that the observed long-term variability of our quasars can be best explained by accretion rate or thermal fluctuations originating from the accretion disk, and the observed short-term variability can be best explained by reprocessing of X-ray variability originating from the corona. The additional information revealed by DHO modeling emphasizes the need to go beyond DRW when analyzing AGN light curves delivered by next-generation wide-field time-domain surveys.},

Toward 3C 409, we make a 4 σ Zeeman detection and infer B LOS = 9.1 ± 1.9 μ G, in agreement with Arecibo results. We quantify the dispersion of H I filaments at the locations and velocities of Zeeman components using GALFA-H I narrow-channel emission maps. Focusing on a subsample of 42 spectrally distinct components, we find a weak but statistically significant positive correlation (Spearman ρ = 0.3, p = 0.01) between ∣ B LOS ∣ and the circular variance of H I filament orientation angles. To examine its origin, we characterize the environments probed by H I absorption using dust emission, 3D dust maps, OH absorption, and CO emission. We find evidence that existing H I absorption Zeeman measurements trace magnetic fields that are coherent on parsec scales, probe primarily local gas (100–500 pc, often at distances consistent with the Local Bubble wall), and exhibit systematic differences in the magnitude of B LOS . We attribute the correlation between Zeeman measurements and filamentary H I morphology to large-scale variations in magnetic field strength and/or inclination angle across different Galactic environments, which could arise due to the Local Bubble geometry or enhanced total field strength in denser regions.},

  abstract     = {Measuring plasma parameters in the upper solar corona and inner heliosphere is challenging because of the region’s weakly emissive nature and inaccessibility for most in situ observations. Radio imaging of broadened and distorted background astronomical radio sources during solar conjunction can provide unique constraints for the coronal material along the line of sight. In this study, we present radio spectral imaging observations of the Crab Nebula (Tau A) from 2024 June 9 to June 22 when it was near the Sun with a projected heliocentric distance of 5–27 solar radii, using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory’s Long Wavelength Array at multiple frequencies in the 30–80 MHz range. The imaging data reveal frequency-dependent broadening and distortion effects caused by anisotropic wave propagation through the turbulent solar corona at different distances. We analyze the brightness, size, and anisotropy of the broadened images. Our results provide detailed observations showing that the eccentricity of the unresolved source increases as the line of sight approaches the Sun, suggesting a higher anisotropic ratio of the plasma turbulence closer to the Sun. In addition, the major axis of the elongated source is consistently oriented in the direction perpendicular to the radial direction, suggesting that the turbulence-induced scattering effect is more pronounced in the direction transverse to the coronal magnetic field. Lastly, when the source undergoes large-scale refraction as the line of sight passes through a streamer, the apparent source exhibits substructures at lower frequencies. This study demonstrates that observations of celestial radio sources with lines of sight near the Sun provide a promising method for measuring turbulence parameters in the inner heliosphere.},

  abstract     = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are among the most energetic and enigmatic transients in the radio sky, with mounting evidence suggesting newborn, highly magnetized neutron stars formed in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) as their sources. A definitive spatial association between an FRB and a historic CCSN would confirm this link and tightly constrain young neutron-star source models. Here we report on the first systematic crossmatching of 886 spectroscopically classified CCSNe in the local Universe ( z ≤ 0.043) against 241 CHIME/FRB Catalog 1 events, applying rigorous spatial, dispersion measure (DM), and scattering time ( τ ) criteria. We identify four positional overlaps, all consistent with a chance alignment; however, one pair, FRB 20190412B–SN 2009gi, also satisfies independent host-DM and τ constraints, making it a promising candidate for targeted follow-up. Next, we search for compact (persistent or transient) radio emission at all matched supernova sites using multiepoch Very Large Array Sky Survey data and detect none. Treating every CCSN sight line as a nondetection, we derive Poisson upper limits on the FRB burst rate at these locations, which lie well below the rates observed for the most active repeaters unless their activity is heavily suppressed by beaming, intermittency, or residual free–free absorption. We then develop a galaxy-integrated FRB-rate model that incorporates an intrinsic spectral index, secular magnetar-activity decay, and frequency-dependent free–free opacity. Applying this formalism to existing FRB data shows that reproducing the observed CHIME/CRAFT all-sky rate ratio requires a steep decline in magnetar burst rate with age. Finally, our work underscores the necessity of subarcsecond localizations and multiwavelength follow-up to definitively test the young neutron star source hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {Investigating the atmospheres of giants and supergiants is critical to expanding our knowledge of stellar life cycles, galaxy formation, and the origin of material that forms exoplanets. This paper presents the analysis of the evolved K-type giant β Cet using high-quality spectral data collected by the Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), including an ultraviolet atlas with line identifications that will support future studies of cool, evolved stars. Beta Cet exhibits chromosphere emission, transition region diagnostics, and coronal X-ray flux, placing it near the Linsky–Haisch dividing line that separates objects with strong coronal signatures from the cooler giants and supergiants with massive stellar winds. The transition region in β Cet produces clear features in the STIS spectra that are formed at {\mathrm{log}}\,T\lt 5.40 K, in addition to the highly ionized Fe xxi λ 1354. It is stronger and more dominant than observed in the K5III hybrid star γ Dra, with a line surface flux as much as 2–3 orders of magnitude greater. The majority of the transition region lines are significantly broader than expected from thermal motion alone, and this nonthermal broadening appears to increase with formation temperature. The nonthermal width of the C iv and Si iv doublets is used to investigate the dominant heating mechanisms in β Cet’s transition region. We find that the radiative losses observed in the ultraviolet are balanced by an energy influx from sound waves and turbulence, while the Alfvén waves supported by a magnetic field are required to account for the reported X-ray flux.},

  abstract     = {Asteroid (269) Justitia is one of the more unusual asteroids in the main belt due to its extremely red spectral slope at visible and near infrared (VNIR) wavelengths. While the surface composition of (269) Justitia remains uncertain due to a lack of diagnostic absorption features in the VNIR region, intriguing clues to its nature are provided by recent mid- and thermal-infrared wavelength observations (MIR and TIR, respectively). In the VNIR, no identifiable analogs to Justitia can be found among the known meteorites. Instead, the best spectral matches come from Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), possibly suggesting a genetic relationship with those bodies. On the other hand, recent TIR emissivity spectra reveal the likely presence of fine-grained anhydrous silicates on Justitia’s surface, possibly inconsistent with a TNO origin. To explore this issue, we used a radiative transfer mixing model to investigate the spectral nature of Justitia in the VNIR and TIR. In the VNIR, our results are consistent with mixtures of space weathered silicates and carbonaceous material, though the presence of complex organics cannot be ruled out. In the TIR, our results favor either carbonaceous material or a mixture of space-weathered silicates and carbonaceous components. The best spectral match to Justitia’s spectra was found by blending carbonaceous material with moderate to extensively space-weathered silicates. This combination could, in turn, indicate a potential collision between silicate-rich and carbonaceous bodies during the early history of Justitia.},

With the aim of further constraining the structure of L1544 as well as assessing the completeness of chemical networks, we turn to radiative transfer modeling of observed molecular lines toward this source. We obtained high-sensitivity and high spectral resolution observations of HCO + ( J = 1–0), CS ( J = 2–1), C 34 S ( J = 2–1), H 2 CO ( J {}_{{K}_{a},{K}_{c}} = 2 1,2 –1 1,1 ), c-C 3 H 2 ( J {}_{{K}_{a},{K}_{c}} = 2 1,2 –1 0,1 ), SO ( N , J = 2, 3–1, 2), and 34 SO ( N , J = 2, 3–1, 2) with the IRAM 30 m telescope toward the dust peak of L1544. A non–local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer code is coupled to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to model the observations. We find that with just one transition for each isotope, the modeling cannot find a global minimum that fits the observations. The derived fractional abundance profiles are compared to those computed with chemical models. The observed transitions trace gas components with distinct dynamics at different distances along the radius of the core. Moreover, the results evidence a poor reproduction of sulfur chemistry by chemical modeling and stress the need to include a more consistent S-depletion process to accurately reproduce the S-chemistry toward dense cores.},

The decades-long baseline now enabled by large radio surveys allows us to identify cases where new outflows or jets have been launched. Here, we present the results of a targeted Very Large Array program observing four poststarburst galaxies that have brightened significantly in radio emission over the past ∼20 yr. We obtain quasi-simultaneous observations in five bands (1–18 GHz) for each source. We find peaked spectral energy distributions, indicative of self-absorbed synchrotron emission. While all four sources have risen significantly over the past ∼20 yr in the 1–2 GHz band, two also show clear recent flares in the 2–4 GHz band. These sources are less luminous than typical peaked-spectrum radio active galactic nucleus (AGN). It remains unclear whether these sources are low luminosity analogs of the peaked radio AGN from accreted gas, or driven by tidal disruption events with missed optical flares. Regardless of the source of the accreted material, these newly launched outflows contain sufficient energy to drive the molecular gas outflows observed in poststarburst galaxies and to drive turbulence, suppressing star formation.},

SN 2024rmj reached a peak absolute magnitude of M g ≈ −21.9, placing it at the luminous end of the SLSN-I distribution. The light curve exhibits a pronounced prepeak bump (≈60 days before the main peak) and a postpeak bump (≈55 days after the main peak). The bulk of the light curve is otherwise well fit by a magnetar spin-down model, with typical values (spin: ≈2.1 ms; magnetic field: ≈6 × 10 13 G; ejecta mass: ≈12 M ⊙ ). The optical spectra exhibit characteristic SLSN-I features and evolution, but with a relatively high velocity of ≈8000 km s −1 postpeak. Most significantly, we find a clear detection of helium in the NIR spectra at He i λ 1.083 μ m and λ 2.058 μ m, blueshifted by ≈15,000 km s −1 (13 days before peak) and ≈13,000 km s −1 (40 days after peak), indicating that helium is confined to the outermost ejecta; based on these NIR detections, we also identify likely contribution from He i λ 5876 in the optical spectra on a similar range of timescales. This represents the most definitive detection of helium in a bright SLSN-I to date, and indicates that progenitors with a thin helium layer can still explode as SLSNe.},

Following a framework that describes the conditional [O II ] luminosity–stellar mass distribution as a function of halo mass, we simultaneously model the clustering measurements of all samples at fixed redshift. Based on the modeling result, most ELGs in our samples are classified as central galaxies, residing in halos of a narrow mass range with a typical median of ∼10 12.2−12.4 h −1 M ⊙ . We observe a weak dependence of clustering amplitude on stellar mass, which is reflected in the model constraints and is likely a consequence of the 0.5 dex measurement uncertainty in the stellar mass estimates.

  abstract     = {Quasiperiodic eruptions (QPEs) are luminous, recurring X-ray outbursts from galactic nuclei, with timescales of hours to days. While their origin remains uncertain, leading models invoke accretion disk instabilities or the interaction of a massive black hole (MBH) with a lower-mass secondary in an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI). EMRI scenarios offer a robust framework for interpreting QPEs by characterizing observational signatures associated with the secondary’s orbital dynamics. This, in turn, enables extraction of the MBH/EMRI physical properties and provides a means to test the EMRI scenario, distinguishing models and addressing the question: what can QPE timings teach us about MBHs and EMRIs? In this study, we employ analytic expressions for Kerr geodesics to efficiently resolve the trajectory of the secondary object and perform GPU-accelerated Bayesian inference to assess the information content of QPE timings. Using our inference framework, referred to as QPE-FIT (Fast Inference with Timing; https://github.com/joheenc/QPE-FIT/tree/main ), we explore QPE timing constraints on astrophysical parameters, such as EMRI orbital parameters and MBH mass/spin. We find that mild-eccentricity EMRIs ( e ∼ 0.1–0.3) can constrain MBH mass and EMRI semimajor axis/eccentricity to the 10% level within tens of orbital periods, while MBH spin is unconstrained for the explored semimajor axes ≥100 R g and monitoring baselines { \mathcal O } (10–100) orbits. Introducing a misaligned precessing disk generally degrades inference of EMRI orbital parameters, but can constrain disk precession properties within 10%–50%. This work both highlights the prospect of QPE observations as dynamical probes of galactic nuclei and outlines the challenge of doing so in the multimodal parameter space of EMRI–disk collisions.},

  abstract     = {This study analyzes energetic neutral atom (ENA) spectral properties across distinct regions of globally distributed flux (GDF) sky maps, using Interstellar Boundary Explorer data from a full solar cycle, corrected for time dispersion. By time-shifting the data to the heliosheath using GDF source distances from D. B. Reisenfeld et al., we achieve a more accurate representation of heliosheath GDF energy spectra. We quantify ENA spectral characteristics, heliosheath line-of-sight-integrated proton pressure, and heliosheath proton temperature, comparing these to solar wind properties at 1 au and interplanetary scintillation-derived solar wind data. Our findings show that the spectral index is generally anticorrelated with heliosheath proton temperature and pressure, except in the central tail, where a partial positive correlation is observed. The lowest spectral index values occur when high-latitude heliosheath regions are dominated by fast solar wind from polar coronal holes. The south pole exhibits the flattest energy spectra due to plasma heating from both fast solar wind and a late-2014 pressure pulse. The central tail shows shorter variability (5–6 yr) for spectral index and heliosheath proton temperature, while proton pressure follows the 11 yr solar cycle. Most spectral shapes exhibit a “knee” distribution, peaking during solar maximum, with an “ankle” shape observed only at the south pole during solar cycle transitions. Asymmetry in proton pressure in the lobes is driven by the draping effect of the local interstellar magnetic field. This study provides insights into the energetic properties of GDF across the heliosphere, enhancing our understanding of the heliospheric environment.},

  abstract     = {As the Sun moves through the local interstellar medium (LISM), it emits charged particles, creating the heliosphere occupied by the plasma of solar origin. Determining the structure of the heliosphere is a fundamental question that can be answered only by numerical simulations based on sophisticated theoretical models. Apart from the physics involved in the interaction of fully ionized, collisionless solar wind (SW) with the partially ionized, weakly collisional LISM, it is natural for humankind to speculate about our place of habitat as seen from a distance. This is especially germane now in light of recently observed astrospheres that possess substantially different shapes and structures. We present simulations of the SW–LISM interaction in a very large computational box, paying specific attention to modifications of the LISM properties caused by the presence of the heliosphere. Our results show that the heliosphere has a long heliotail, whose morphology is affected by the interstellar magnetic field pressure, so it acquires a sheetlike shape oriented along the plane formed by the interstellar magnetic field and velocity vectors in the unperturbed LISM. The SW–LISM boundary is subject to instabilities. A possibility is demonstrated of a quasi-parallel, slow-mode bow shock that affects some parts of the LISM flow. We demonstrate that the complex heliospheric structure affects the distribution of plasma and magnetic field in the LISM, resulting in a Galactic cosmic ray anisotropy consistent with the Tibet air shower experiment. We also analyze the effect of turbulence on the length of the heliotail and its ultimate destruction.},

In this study, we compare their multiwavelength SEDs to investigate whether LRDs, or a subset of them, could be high-redshift analogs of BHDs. Our analysis reveals that despite their similar “V-shape” SEDs, LRDs appear to be a different population than BHDs. The “V-shape” of BHDs appears at longer wavelengths compared to LRDs due to different selection strategies, suggesting LRDs have much less dust attenuation than typical BHDs. The bluer colors in the rest-frame infrared (continuum) emission of LRDs suggest the absence of hot dust heated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion activities. We also argue that the blue excess in LRDs is unlikely from AGN scattered light. The compact morphologies and lower X-ray detection frequencies of LRDs suggest a distinct formation pathway from BHDs, which are thought to be powered by super-Eddington accretion onto central SMBHs following major galaxy mergers.},

  abstract     = {Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are prolific GeV γ -ray emitters, and nearly 80% of Fermi Large Area Telescope MSPs reside in compact binaries. For the first time in the literature, we demonstrate that the companions in these compact MSPs binaries are also 511 keV annihilation line emitters using MEGAlib simulations (a high-energy radiation transport software built with Geant4 ) to compute the particle showers and resulting backsplash emission from the pulsar irradiation. The 511 keV signal exhibits strong flux modulation and red- and blueshifts associated with a binary orbit, enabling powerful coherent searches. Measuring the 511 keV emission would enable direct γ -ray characterization of unusual pulsar exoplanets and companions, and allow one to identify the unambiguous presence of active pulsars whose beams do not intercept Earth. Intriguingly, the 511 keV flux is brightest for ultracompact systems, against which pulsar surveys are systematically biased. These ultracompact systems are also possibly prime Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) Galactic sources. This necessitates future joint LISA–MeV γ -ray techniques to characterize MSP binaries. These MSP binaries may also contribute to the puzzling source of the excess 511 keV photons near the Galactic bulge and center.},

In this work, we investigate whether anomalous magnetic braking (MB) of intermediate-mass Ap/Bp stars, characterized by surface magnetic fields of ∼10 2 –10 4 G, could drive orbital decay through magnetic wind–field coupling. Using the stellar evolution code MESA , we simulate the evolution of several main-sequence binaries containing Ap/Bp stars, with typical initial parameters of Algol binaries. Our models indicate that the anomalous MB mechanism could induce orbital decay in long timescales (hundreds of Myr to several Gyr), reproducing several basic Algol parameters such as the effective temperatures and luminosities of donor stars. However, the predicted orbital period decay rates are much lower than those observed in several Algol systems. We analyze the limitations of the anomalous MB model and discuss alternative mechanisms that could account for the long- or short-term orbital period variations observed in Algol systems, including a surrounding circumbinary disk, stellar expansion, the Applegate mechanism, and the light-travel-time effect. Long-term observations are still required to distinguish between these mechanisms in the future.},

  abstract     = {We present the implementation of a fully time-dependent relativistic disk model—based on the light-curve fitting package FitTeD —into the X-ray spectral fitting environment, pyXspec . This implementation enables simultaneous fitting of multi-epoch and multiwavelength spectral data, where the only free parameters are those describing the black hole and the initial conditions, while the subsequent evolution is governed by the dynamical equations of an evolving accretion flow. We use it to fit seven epochs of X-ray spectra and two epochs of UV spectra of the “long-lived” tidal disruption event (TDE) and quasiperiodic eruption (QPE) source GSN 069, from 2010 through late-2019. Our results show that such “long-lived,” X-ray-bright TDEs—of which GSN 069 is a prime, but not unique, example—can naturally be explained within the same framework as events with shorter-lived X-ray emission, like ASASSN-14li and AT2019dsg. Their distinction lies in the “viscous” timescale parameter—tied to the disk’s angular momentum transport efficiency—which should be treated as a free parameter when modeling the disk evolution of transient events. We examine the implications for QPE models by tracking the time evolution of disk properties such as mass surface density and accretion rate. We argue that existing QPE models may not be able to reproduce the observed connection between the presence (2018) or absence (2014) of eruptions and the disk properties. In the context of orbiter–disk collision models, the change in mass surface density appears insufficient to explain the needed variation in the eruption’s temperature. The absence of eruptions in GSN 069 in 2014 remains a challenge for QPE models.},

In this paper, we report on multiepoch interstellar scintillation from the millisecond pulsar B1937+21 (J1939+2134) using Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) observations at 1250 MHz with 500 MHz bandwidth. The diffractive scintillation properties are investigated for an observing baseline of 3 yr. The scintillation timescale, exponential index, and decorrelation bandwidth are determined to be 7.67  ±  1.61 minutes, 1.54  ±  0.09, and 0.56  ±  0.25 MHz, respectively, from the autocorrelation functions of the dynamic spectra. These scintillation parameters are found to vary temporally. The frequency dependencies of scintillation parameters exhibit single-power spectral behaviors; however, the derived spectral indices deviate from the theoretical Kolmogorov spectrum. The fringe pattern that forms from interference of scattered waves is revealed in the secondary spectrum as a parabolic arc with a well-determined curvature of 0.95  ±  0.50 s 3 . The parabolic arc is present contemporaneously over a wide frequency range and scales with frequency as a power law with an index of −0.80 ± 0.18, indicating the broadband nature of the scintillation arc. The arc curvature exhibits annual variation and is well approximated by a one-dimensional scattering screen located approximately 95% of the distance toward the pulsar. These findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying physics of the ionized interstellar medium.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the formation of magnetic islands and the onset of tearing instability within kinetic Alfvén solitary waves in a two-fluid space plasma. These localized structures, featuring internal magnetic shear, naturally support magnetic reconnection processes analogous to tearing modes in magnetically confined fusion plasmas. Treating the solitary wave as a quasi-static background equilibrium, we analyze the resulting topological modifications by making use of the magnetic flux function, in analogy with tokamak plasmas. We find that the spatial size of the magnetic island scales with the square root of the magnetic flux perturbation. Introducing the tearing stability index {{\rm{\Delta }}}^{{\prime} } , we derive the growth rate of the tearing mode using a resistive magnetohydrodynamic framework. Our analysis reveals that tearing modes grow only when the mode’s wavenumber exceeds the inhomogeneity scale, becoming marginally stable when the two are comparable. The emergence of magnetic islands has significant implications for cross-field particle transport, turbulence, and acceleration. In particular, the electron diffusion across magnetic fields may be governed by the island size rather than the Larmor radius, potentially accounting for anomalous transport. Furthermore, in certain regimes, unbounded island growth may signal the collapse of the solitary wave structure, enabling a large-scale transfer of magnetic energy to particle energy. These results suggest a unifying mechanism connecting magnetic reconnection in space plasmas with tearing instabilities in laboratory fusion plasmas.},

Previous work identified nearby planetary companions as potential roadblocks to habitability of planets around white dwarfs, as such companions could induce secular oscillations in eccentricity for the potentially habitable planet, which could in turn heat a surface ocean and induce a runaway greenhouse for even very low values ( e ∼ 10 −4 ) of the eccentricity of the potentially habitable planet. In this work, we examine the potential for general relativistic orbital precession to protect habitable planets orbiting white dwarfs from such a runaway greenhouse and demonstrate that, for some system architectures, general relativity can be protective for planetary habitability.},

  abstract     = {The 136 yr long optical light curve of OJ 287 is explained by a binary black hole model where the secondary is in a 12 yr orbit around the primary. Impacts of the secondary on the accretion disk of the primary generate a series of optical flares that follow a quasi-Keplerian relativistic mathematical model. The orientation of the binary in space is determined from the behavior of the primary jet. Here, we ask how the jet of the secondary black hole projects onto the sky plane. Assuming that the jet is initially perpendicular to the disk, and that it is ballistic, we follow its evolution after the Lorentz transformation to the observer’s frame. Since the orbital speed of the secondary is of the order of one-tenth of the speed of light, the result is a change in the jet direction by more than a radian during an orbital cycle. We match the theoretical jet line with the recent 12 μ as resolution RadioAstron map of OJ 287 and determine the only free parameter of the problem, the apparent speed of the jet relative to speed of light. It turns out that the Doppler factor of the jet, δ ∼ 5, is much lower than in the primary jet. Besides following a unique shape of the jet path, the secondary jet is also distinguished by a different spectral shape than in the primary jet. The present result on the spectral shape agrees with the huge optical flare of 2021 November 12, also arising from the secondary jet.},

  abstract     = {A key science goal of large sky surveys such as those conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and precursors to the Square Kilometre Array is the identification of variable and transient objects. One approach is analyzing time series of the changing brightness of sources, namely, light curves. However, finding adequate statistical representations of light curves is challenging because of the sparsity of observations, irregular sampling, and nuisance factors inherent in astronomical data collection. The wide diversity of objects that a large-scale survey will observe also means that making parametric assumptions about the shape of light curves is problematic. We present a Gaussian process (GP) regression approach for characterizing light-curve variability that addresses these challenges. Our approach makes no assumptions about the shape of a light curve and, therefore, is general enough to detect a range of variable and transient source types. In particular, we propose using the joint distribution of GP amplitude hyperparameters to distinguish variable and transient candidates from nominally stable ones and apply this approach to 6394 radio light curves from the ThunderKAT survey. We compare our results with two variability metrics commonly used in radio astronomy, namely η ν and V ν , and show that our approach has better discriminatory power and interpretability. Finally, we conduct a rudimentary search for transient sources in the ThunderKAT data set to demonstrate how our approach might be used as an initial screening tool. Computational notebooks in Python and R are available to help deploy this framework to other surveys.},

The Gaia mission has discovered seven such hypervelocity WDs with inflated radii indicative of shock heating by SN ejecta. We study the interaction between SN ejecta and Roche lobe filling, 0.08–0.45 M ⊙ helium WD companions using 3D hydrodynamical simulations with Athena++ . Given the importance of the later thermal evolution, we include an accurate equation of state for the degenerate helium WD donor. We show that a lower-mass, larger-radius WD companion is more strongly impacted by SN ejecta and undergoes substantial mass loss. We find a tight relation between the fractional mass loss and the ratio between the ejecta ram pressure and donor volume-averaged pressure, which can be used for predicting mass loss in other systems. In the most extreme case, the companion becomes a very inflated ≈0.02 M ⊙ object. We find helium mass loss ≈ 0.005−0.06 M ⊙ with velocities ≈ 1000−4000 km s −1 , which may lead to emission lines in the nebular phase. The surviving helium WD receives a kick velocity, but its final velocity is essentially determined by its orbital velocity, ≲1600 km s −1 . We model the postexplosion evolution of the shock-heated companions using MESA , and find reasonable agreement with the hypervelocity stars D6-2, J0546+0836, J1332–3541, and SDSS J1637+3631. A surviving ≳0.3 M ⊙ helium WD can be ruled out in SN 1972E and SN 2011fe, and any surviving helium WD is likely ruled out in SN remnants 0509-67.5 and SN 1006.},

We carried out Director’s Discretionary Time observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory to identify any X-ray emission from the companion and constrain its nature as either a compact object or young stellar object (YSO). Past X-ray observations occurred at the wrong phase of the companion’s orbit for optimal detection prospects and/or lacked the deep exposure required to constrain the typical X-ray luminosities of YSOs. In our 41.85 ks exposure with Chandra, we do not detect an X-ray source at the position of Betelgeuse. For an estimated hydrogen column density N H = 6 × 10 22 cm −2 , we place a limit on the X-ray luminosity L X ≲ 2 × 10 30 erg s −1 (≲4.7 × 10 −4 L ⊙ ) in 0.5–8 keV for a 10 MK plasma temperature spectral model, or L X ≲ 5 × 10 29 erg s −1 (≲1.2 × 10 −4 L ⊙ ) for an absorbed power law with photon index Γ = 2. These limits robustly exclude an accreting compact object (white dwarf or neutron star) as the companion. Solar-mass YSOs with an age similar to Betelgeuse (∼10 Myr) display a range of X-ray luminosities (10 28−32 erg s −1 ), and we can place upper bounds within this range for most absorbing columns. Based on these considerations, we conclude that the companion to Betelgeuse is likely a low-mass YSO.},

From the ensemble of SFHs, we find (i) an average quenching time (here defined as the lookback time by which 80% of the stellar mass formed, τ 80 ) of 12.48  ±  0.18 Gyr ago ( z=4.{6}_{-0.5}^{+0.6} ), which is compatible with reionization-based quenching scenarios; and (ii) modest evidence of a delay (≲800 Myr) in quenching times of UFDs thought to be satellites of the LMC or on their first infall, relative to long-term Galactic satellites, which is consistent with previous findings. We show that robust SFH measurement via the ancient main-sequence turnoff (MSTO) requires a minimum effective luminosity (i.e., luminosity within the observed field of view) of M V ≤ −2.5, which corresponds to ∼100 stars around the MSTO. We also find that increasing the signal-to-noise ratio above ∼100 at the MSTO does not improve SFH precision, which remains dominated by stochastic effects associated with the number of available stars. A main challenge driving the precision of UFD SFHs is the limitations in the accuracy of foreground dust maps. We make all photometry catalogs public as the first data release of a larger HST archival program targeting all dwarf galaxies within ∼1.3 Mpc.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, periodic amplitude modulation has emerged as a unique emission feature in the single-pulse sequence of pulsars alongside periodic nulling and subpulse drifting. Despite ample evidence for the uniqueness of this phenomenon, the periodic modulation in several pulsars are often confused with subpulse drifting, primarily due to lack of clear characterization of the emission features from a representative sample of pulsars. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the single-pulse behavior from 17 pulsars exhibiting periodic amplitude modulation, 6 of them being new detections. The pulsar switches between different intensity states as a result of periodic amplitude modulation, and we propose a novel statistical scheme to identify these emission states. The periodic modulation can be divided into three broad categories: phase stationary modulation, modulations with phase shift, and intermittent periodic modulations. The phase stationary behavior is seen when the emission intensity across a major part of the pulse window changes periodically. The phase shifts are associated with intensity changes at specific locations within the emission window in a periodic manner, while in some pulsars, the periodic modulations become more prominent only at specific intervals resulting in intermittent behavior.},

In this paper, one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio are used to show that in cases with upstream electron temperature T e exceeding the ion temperature T i , the magnitude of the fluctuations increases with the electron plasma-to-cyclotron frequency ratio ω pe /Ω ce , reaching realistic values at ω pe /Ω ce ≳  30. The large-amplitude fluctuations in the simulations are shown to be associated with electrostatic solitary structures, such as ion phase-space holes.

We found a bimodal distribution of ROs with peaks at 0° (parallel) and 90° (orthogonal) for the entire sample combined, as well as for NGC 6334. We investigate the physical origin of this bimodal distribution through a projected Rayleigh statistical analysis in relation to column densities and local gravity in NGC 6334. We found an excess of parallel magnetic fields at column densities >10 23 cm −2 . The underlying cause of the RO distribution of the magnetic field is gravitational collapse at higher gas densities, which drags and reorients the magnetic field as shown in the alignment between the magnetic field and the direction of gravitational forces. The distribution of ROs observed here is consistent with the evolution of ROs of an initially sub-Alvénic cloud that becomes magnetically supercritical and super-Alvénic as the cloud collapses to form stars.},

  abstract     = {Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have revealed a boost in gravitational acceleration with respect to the prediction by Newtonian gravity at low internal accelerations ≲10 −9 m s −2 . This phenomenon is important because it does not permit the dark matter interpretation, unlike galaxy rotation curves. We extend previous analyses by increasing the maximum sky-projected separation from 30 to 50 kilo astronomical units (kau). We show that the so-called “perspective effects” are not negligible at this extended separation and, thus, incorporate it in our analysis. With wide binaries selected with very stringent criteria, we find that the gravitational acceleration boost factor, γ g ≡ g obs / g N , is 1.6{1}_{-0.29}^{+0.37} (from {\delta }_{{\rm{obs}}-{\rm{newt}}}\equiv ({\mathrm{log}}\,_{10}{\gamma }_{g})/\sqrt{2}=0.147\pm 0.062 ) at Newtonian accelerations g N = 10 −11.0 m s −2 , corresponding to separations of tens of kau for solar mass binaries. At Newtonian accelerations g N = 10 −10.3 m s −2 , we find {\gamma }_{g}=1.2{6}_{-0.10}^{+0.12} ( δ obs−newt = 0.072 ± 0.027). For all binaries with g N ≲ 10 −10 m s −2 from our sample, we find {\gamma }_{g}=1.3{2}_{-0.11}^{+0.12} ( δ obs−newt = 0.085 ± 0.027). These results are consistent with the generic prediction of modified Newtonian dynamics-type modified gravity, although the current data are not sufficient to pin down the low-acceleration limiting behavior. Finally, we emphasize that the observed deviation from Newtonian gravity cannot be explained by the perspective effects or any separation-dependent eccentricity variation that we have taken into account.},

  abstract     = {To model the temperature evolution of optically thin astrophysical environments at MHD scales, radiative and collisional cooling rates are typically either pretabulated or fit into a functional form and then input into MHD codes as a radiative loss function. Thermal balance requires estimates of the analogous heating rates, which are harder to calculate, and due to uncertainties in the underlying dissipative heating processes these rates are often simply parameterized. The resulting net cooling function defines an equilibrium curve that varies with density and temperature. Such cooling functions can make the gas prone to thermal instability (TI), which will cause departures from equilibrium. There has been no systematic study of thermally unstable parameter space for nonequilibrium states. Motivated by our recent finding that there is a related linear instability, catastrophic cooling instability, that can dominate over TI, here we carry out such a study. We show that Balbus instability criteria for TI can be used to define a critical cooling rate, Λ c , that permits a nonequilibrium analysis of cooling functions through the mapping of TI zones. We furthermore illustrate how thermal conduction modifies the shape of TI zones. Upon applying a Λ c -based stability analysis to coronal loop simulations, we find that loops undergoing periodic episodes of coronal rain formation are linearly unstable to catastrophic cooling instability, while TI is stabilized by thermal conduction.},

Originally presented by W. V. Jacobson-Galán et al., this sample also includes multicolor light curves and spectra extending to late-time phases of 35 SNe with no evidence for IIn-like features at <2 days after first light. We measure photospheric phase light-curve properties for the distance-corrected sample and find that SNe II with IIn-like features have significantly higher luminosities and decline rates at +50 days than the comparison sample, which could be connected to inflated progenitor radii, lower ejecta mass, and/or persistent CSM interaction. However, we find no statistical evidence that the measured plateau durations and 56 Ni masses of SNe II with and without IIn-like features arise from different distributions. We estimate progenitor zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) masses for all SNe with nebular spectroscopy through spectral model comparisons and find that most objects, both with and without IIn-like features, are consistent with progenitor masses ≤12.5 M ⊙ . Combining progenitor ZAMS masses with CSM densities inferred from early-time spectra suggests multiple channels for enhanced mass loss in the final years before core collapse, such as a convection-driven chromosphere or binary interaction. Finally, we find spectroscopic evidence for ongoing ejecta-CSM interaction at radii >10 16 cm, consistent with substantial progenitor mass-loss rates of ∼10 −4 –10 −5 M ⊙ yr −1 ( v w < 50 km s −1 ) in the final centuries to millennia before explosion.},

A random forest regression model is trained and tested on time series divided into multiple temporal subsets and input parameter combinations. The model achieves strong predictive performance ( R 2 > 0.92) across configurations and significantly outperforms a classical linear regression model. Our results show that S ph effectively captures long-term variations, while the seismic amplitude parameter H max is more responsive to short-term fluctuations.

Single-dish data from the Arizona Radio Observatory Submillimeter Telescope (ARO SMT) were added to provide sensitivity on spatial scales up to 30″—essential for these data. The images show that the molecular gas resides primarily in the central regions of the nebulae and not in the bipolar flows of the optical images. CO appears to trace the remnant asymptotic giant branch (AGB) wind ( V exp ∼ 12–14 km s −1 ) but has a higher velocity component ( V > 16–23 km s −1 ) that represents gas swept up in the outflows. The orientations, with respect to the plane of the sky, of the bipolar outflows are 45° ± 5, 65° ± 10, and 65° ± 5 for K3–45, K3-58, and M1-7, respectively, with the blueshifted lobes oriented to the NE, W, and NW. For M2-48 and M3-28, the flows lie in the plane of the sky, with the blueshifted lobes roughly lying E and N. Based on CO, velocities in the bipolar flows are estimated to be V outflow > 18–31 km s −1 . Revised CO column densities are consistent with past measurements, except for M2-48, where the value increased to N tot ∼ 9.3{\rm{\times }}{10}^{16} cm −2 ; a value was also obtained for the first time for K3-58 ( N tot ∼ 5 × 10 16 cm −2 ).

The disparate processes of high-frequency gyrosynchrotron and low-frequency electron cyclotron maser emissions have traditionally suggested an absence of correlation in their radio luminosities. Our study presents a frequency-independent linear correlation between radio luminosity ( L R ) and orbital/rotational periods ( P ) in RS CVn binaries. Analyzing the Sydney Radio Star Catalogue data, we derived orbital periods for 42 of 60 RS CVn sources using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite light curves, revealing a strong positive correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) = 0.698 and P = 3.95e-7) between {\mathrm{log}}\,_{10}{L}_{R} and {\mathrm{log}}\,_{10}P . This correlation remains across frequencies from 144 to 3000 MHz, showing uniform luminosity behavior. By combining light curve analysis with stellar mass–radius–luminosity relationships, we calculated parameters like binary mass, primary/secondary mass, Rossby number, and binary separation for eight RS CVn systems. The results show a notable correlation between radio luminosity and binary mass, primary mass, and separation (PCC = 0.663, 0.663, and 0.719), with separation showing the strongest correlation. This suggests the radio emission may largely originate from the binary components’ interaction, challenging existing models of RS CVn radio emission mechanisms and offering insights into the individual versus collective origins of these emissions.},

These clusters, selected for their bright Pa α and 3.3 μ m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, are still associated with their natal gas cloud and have been largely missed in previous HST optical campaigns. We modeled their SEDs using the CIGALE fitting code and identified (i) a systematic flux excess at 1.5–2.5 μ m that is not accounted for by current stellar population models and (ii) the preference for a set of dust model parameters that is not aligned with expectations from self-consistent analyses of star-forming regions, suggesting model shortcomings also in the 3–5 μ m. The near-infrared excess is most prominent in low-mass (≤3000 M ⊙ ) and young (≤6 Myr) clusters. Additionally, we see that the SED fitting analysis wrongly assigns ages ≥6 Myr to a fraction of strong Pa α emitters with equivalent widths suggestive of significantly younger ages. A parallel analysis with the slug code suggests that stochastic initial mass function (IMF) sampling of pre-main-sequence stars combined with extinction might partially reduce the gap. We conclude that the inclusion of young stellar object SEDs, along with more realistic sampling of the cluster IMF, might be needed to fully account for the stellar population and dust properties of eYSCs.},

  abstract     = {The paper develops a new statistical method for forecasting the arrival time and maximum flux of solar energetic particle (SEP) events. We recently showed the persistent behavior of the SEP time series during SEP events. In that study, we also used persistence to determine the onset time (OT) of an SEP event and suggested using the entropy change in a time domain called natural time under time reversal Δ S as a way to estimate the maximum SEP flux of the ongoing SEP event. Here, we use EPI-Lo data for H + below 2 MeV over the whole Orbit 15 from the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS⊙IS) instrument suite on board NASA’s Parker Solar Probe to investigate the broader applicability of these methods. We clearly demonstrate that during SEP events the corresponding time series is persistent and are able to employ the persistence-based OT method to predict SEP events. We find a prediction rate greater than 87.5% (14 out of the 16 SEP events) and a false alarm rate below 2.2%. These values when inserted in the receiver operating characteristics plane indicate that this method is highly statistically significant. Finally, we develop a relationship between the maximum SEP flux and the minimum of Δ S , allowing us to provide a prediction of the future maximum SEP flux during an ongoing event.},

A positive correlation is observed between stellar luminosity, intrinsic reddening due to circumstellar dust self-extinction, and elevated mass-loss rates.

  abstract     = {Low-mass stars and brown dwarfs—spectral types (SpTs) M0 and later—play a significant role in studying stellar and substellar processes and demographics, reaching down to planetary-mass objects. Currently, the classification of these sources remains heavily reliant on visual inspection of spectral features, equivalent width measurements, or narrow/wideband spectral indices. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods offer automated approaches for spectral typing, which are becoming increasingly important as large spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, SDSS, and SPHEREx generate data sets containing millions of spectra. We investigate the application of ML in spectral type classification on low-resolution ( R ∼ 120) near-infrared spectra of M0–T9 dwarfs obtained with the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We specifically aim to classify the gravity- and metallicity-dependent subclasses for late-type dwarfs. We used binned fluxes as input features and compared the efficacy of spectral type estimators built using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models. We tested the influence of different normalizations and analyzed the relative importance of different spectral regions for surface gravity and metallicity subclass classification. Our best-performing model (using KNN) classifies 95.5% ± 0.6% of sources to within ±1 SpT, and assigns surface gravity and metallicity subclasses with 89.5% ± 0.9% accuracy. We test the dependence of signal-to-noise ratio on classification accuracy and find sources with SNR ≳60 have ≳95% accuracy. We also find that zy band plays the most prominent role in the RF model, with FeH and TiO having the highest feature importance.},

While traditional cosmological simulations often assume a fixed dust-to-gas or dust-to-metal (DTM) mass ratio to model dust effects, recent advancements have enabled on-the-fly (OTF) dust modeling that captures the spatial and temporal evolution of dust. In this work, we investigate the impact of dust modeling on galaxy morphology using the NewCluster simulation, which implements a detailed OTF dust model. We generate mock images of NewCluster galaxies under both OTF and fixed DTM models using the radiative transfer code SKIRT , and compare their morphology to JWST observations. We measure morphology indices and use the G – M 20 test to classify galaxies. We find that the OTF galaxy models exhibit brighter centers and more pronounced bulges than those of the fixed DTM models, resulting in a lower late-type galaxy fraction, particularly at high redshifts. This central brightening is linked to a phenomenon we refer to as the DTM cavity, a localized depression in the DTM ratio driven by intense bulge starbursts. Our results highlight the importance of modeling dust evolution in a physically motivated manner, as fixed DTM models fail to capture key morphological features.},

  abstract     = {The origin of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons responsible for reionizing the Universe remains largely unknown, with the fraction of escaping LyC photons from galaxies at z ∼ 6 to 12 still uncertain. Direct detection of LyC photons from this epoch is challenging due to intergalactic medium absorption, making lower-redshift analogs valuable for studying LyC leakage. In this study, we present Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations of five low-redshift ( z ∼ 0.3) massive starburst galaxies, selected for high stellar mass and weak [S II ] nebular emission, an indirect tracer of LyC escape. LyC leakage is detected in three of the five galaxies, highlighting weak [S II ] as a reliable tracer—a finding supported by recent JWST discoveries of z > 5 galaxies with similarly weak [S II ] emission. The dust-corrected LyC escape fractions ( f esc,H I ), representing LyC photons that would escape without dust, range from 33% to 84%. However, the absolute escape fractions ( f esc,tot ), accounting for both neutral hydrogen absorption and dust attenuation, are substantially lower, between 1% and 3%. This indicates that, although these galaxies are nearly optically thin to H I , their significant dust content restricts LyC escape. These [S II ]-weak, massive leakers differ from typical low-redshift LyC emitters, exhibiting higher metallicity, lower ionization states, greater dust extinction, and higher star formation surface densities. We suggest that feedback-driven winds in these compact starbursts generate ionized channels, allowing LyC escape in line with a “picket-fence” model, indicating a distinct mechanism for LyC leakage.},

We compare the kinematics, composition, and simulated X-ray emission of starburst (SB) versus active galactic nuclei (AGN) dominated galactic outflows. Our set of simulations includes galactic outflows driven solely by a nuclear SB, an AGN wind, and a mixture of SBs and AGN winds. We find significant differences in the kinematics, composition, and simulated X-ray emission between SB- versus AGN-dominated outflows. Starburst-driven outflows are characterized by turbulent, multiphase, complex flows, with each phase having a distinct kinematic profile (as traced by various oxygen ions), while AGN-driven outflows are more symmetric, more single phase, with primarily very hot (>10 7 K) gas, and are smooth in appearance. In mixed SB-AGN simulations, the dominant component (SB or AGN) determines the outflow characteristics. In cases where the energy input of the SB is similar to the energy of the AGN, the resulting outflow appears similar to the SB-only outflow, but when the energy input from the AGN wind is much greater than the SB then the outflow appears similar to the AGN-only outflow. When we generate synthetic X-ray observations, the AGN-dominated outflows are essentially invisible in soft to medium-energy X-rays (0.1–10.0 keV), but the SB-driven outflows show complex filamentary structures that are visible in the X-ray. Finally, we show the observational possibilities for various proposed and future X-ray telescopes.},

  abstract     = {The corona is a crucial region that connects the solar surface to the solar wind and serves as the primary site of solar activity. The 2024 total solar eclipse (TSE) provides a unique opportunity to investigate the large-scale coronal structure. Combined with TSE observations, we study the impact of the magnetic structure of the farside active region, located in the eastern hemisphere of the Sun that has not yet rotated into the Earth field of view, on a global magnetohydrodynamic simulation. To address the limitation of single-view measurements for the routine synoptic map, we correct the magnetic field in the farside region by incorporating full-disk magnetograms measured several days after the TSE, allowing us to capture the temporal evolution of the photospheric magnetic field in near real time. Simulation results demonstrate that the local magnetic field in the farside active region can significantly influence the global coronal structure, by altering the position of the heliospheric current sheet, and further affect the global distribution of plasma parameters, even in polar regions. A comparison of the simulation results with white-light TSE + Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph C2 observations and in situ measurements by the Parker Solar Probe reveals that the composite synoptic map improves the accuracy of the coronal modeling. This work provides robust support for advancing our understanding of coronal evolution, as well as deepening the link between the photosphere and large-scale coronal structure. Furthermore, it establishes a theoretical foundation for the future development of multiview stereoscopic measurements of the photospheric magnetic field.},

These clusters are known to host ∼Mpc scale sources, known as radio halos, which are formed by the acceleration of cosmic rays by turbulence injected into the intracluster medium during cluster mergers. Our new images reveal previously undetected faint outermost regions of halos, extending to over 2 Mpc. This discovery highlights the presence of radio halos with large extents at high frequencies and suggests that their observable size depends on a combination of the observation sensitivity and uv -coverage, as well as their radio power. We additionally compare the properties of these three clusters with MACS J0717+3745 and A2142, both of which are known to host prominent large radio halos. Remarkably, all five halos, despite their exceptionally large extents, exhibit properties similar to other classical halos: their radial profiles are described by a single-component exponential fit, they show radial spectral index steepening, and have an average radio emissivity of about 10 −42 erg s −1 cm −3 Hz −1 . Our results demonstrate that radio halos can extend to the cluster’s periphery, without the transition to an observationally distinguishable different halo component in the outermost regions. Our findings also highlight that careful subtraction of unrelated sources embedded in the halo is necessary to measure the radio surface brightness accurately, since incomplete subtraction can introduce an apparent secondary component in the peripheral regions.},

However, interstellar medium (ISM) absorption typically obscures most of the Ly α profile, requiring reconstructions that introduce systematic uncertainties. We present intrinsic Ly α profiles for 12 high-radial-velocity (RV) K and M dwarfs, where Doppler shifting minimizes ISM contamination, allowing direct measurements of ∼50%–95% of the line flux. Our sample spans the K-to-M spectral transition, enabling us to constrain the dependence of self-reversals in Ly α emission profiles on effective temperature ( T eff ). The depth of self-reversal, driven by non–local thermodynamic equilibrium effects, decreases with decreasing T eff , with M dwarfs exhibiting little to none. Two stars, Ross 1044 and Ross 451, were observed over multiple days, revealing ∼20% Ly α variability confined to the line core—implying that studies relying on reconstructions may underestimate temporal variability. We find strong correlations between Ly α flux, peak-to-trough ratio, and hydrogen departure coefficients with T eff , providing empirical constraints for stellar atmosphere models. A comparison of Ly α flux in the habitable zone shows measured values for high-RV stars less than the reconstructed values for the rest of the sample, likely due to the older ages of the high-RV stars and/or overestimated reconstructed fluxes due to model deficiency (e.g., neglecting self-reversal). Our results establish an empirical foundation for Ly α emission in K and M dwarfs, reducing uncertainties in reconstructions and improving models of stellar UV emission relevant to exoplanetary studies.},

The bubbles are manifested by extraplanar soft X-ray emission with an X-shaped morphology, which is tightly cospatial with H α line emission and partially coincident with radio continuum. Low surface brightness diffuse X-ray emission can be traced out to ∼90 kpc from the galactic center, revealing the presence of an extended hot gaseous halo. X-ray spectral analysis of the bubbles yields a gas temperature of 0.7{0}_{-0.18}^{+0.16} keV, a relatively high value among known galactic-scale bubbles in the local Universe. An average energy injection rate of ∼10 43 erg s −1 is required to inflate the bubbles within an estimated dynamical age of ∼6.4 Myr. The multiwavelength properties of the bubbles can be understood with the conventional superwind scenario, in which disk/halo gas is swept up into an expanding, cooling shell by a hot tenuous wind. The current starburst in NGC 6286 is energetically sufficient to launch the superwind, although we cannot rule out the possibility of a more violent active galactic nucleus in the recent past as the driving source. Future high-resolution spectroscopic observations will help to shed light on the origin of the superwind and its role as an important galactic feedback process.},

We have developed a simple radiative transfer model for PPDs that reasonably treats stellar nonthermal (X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV)), stellar thermal (optical/infrared), and reemitted radiation, reproducing the temperature structures from Monte Carlo radiative transfer. Our simulations show fast one-sided surface accretion (∼10% of Keplerian velocity) and asymmetric disk winds when the vertical magnetic field is aligned with the disk angular momentum. The asymmetry is due to the failure of the wind on the side with the accretion layer. On the accreting surface, clumps are repeatedly generated and accrete, driven by radiative feedback. For the antialigned fields, surface accretion becomes more moderate and time variable, while the winds remain largely symmetric. For the thermal structure, accretion heating does not affect the disk temperature in any of our runs. This is because (1) the accretion energy dissipates via Joule heating at two to three gas scale heights, where low optical depth enables efficient radiative cooling, and (2) the winds remove ≳10% of the accretion energy. In contrast, the winds enhance radiative heating by elevating the irradiation front. These results highlight the importance of coupling between gas dynamics and radiation transport in PPDs and provide observable magnetic activities such as fast episodic accretion, wind asymmetry, and molecular survival in XUV-irradiated winds.},

  abstract     = {The gravitational potential of the Milky Way encodes information about the distribution of all matter—including dark matter—throughout the Galaxy. Gaia Data Release 3 has revealed a complex structure that necessitates flexible models of the Galactic gravitational potential. We make use of a sample of 5.6 million upper-main-sequence stars to map the full three-dimensional gravitational potential in a 1 kpc radius from the Sun using a data-driven approach called “Deep Potential.” This method makes minimal assumptions about the dynamics of the Galaxy—that the stars are a collisionless system that is statistically stationary in a rotating frame (with pattern speed to be determined). We model the distribution of stars in six-dimensional phase space using a normalizing flow and the gravitational network using a neural network. We recover a local pattern speed of Ω p = 28.2 ± 0.1 km s −1 kpc −1 , a local total matter density of ρ = 0.086 ± 0.010 M ⊙ pc −3 , and local dark matter density of ρ DM = 0.007 ± 0.011 M ⊙ pc −3 . The full three-dimensional model exhibits spatial fluctuations, which may stem from the model architecture and nonstationarity in the Milky Way.},

This study examines the petrogenesis of anorthosites and noritic anorthosites from the lunar farside using samples collected by the CE-6 mission. The analysis reveals that the ferroan anorthosite (FAN) clasts display plagioclase An# and mafic mineral Mg# within the range of Apollo FANs, highlighting the compositional similarity between the lunar nearside and farside. The identification of FANs on the farside underscores the global nature of these lithologies, indicating that the early lunar crust formation processes were not confined to the nearside but were widespread across the Moon. The noritic anorthosite clast shows characteristics consistent with KREEP-free/poor Mg-suite rocks. This finding supports the idea that both the nearside and farside experienced similar magmatic processes, challenging the simplistic hemispheric dichotomy models. The study emphasizes significant lithological variations at local scale and the need for further sample-return missions to elucidate the compositional diversity and formation history of the lunar crust.},

  abstract     = {We present a systematic analysis on the X-ray variability in 13 bright quasars at z > 4.5, combining recent Swift observations from 2021 to 2023 and archival multiepoch observations. Upper limits of the luminosity measurements were included in the analysis by using the Kaplan–Meier estimator method. It is found that the high-redshift quasars exhibit X-ray variability on both short-term (hours to days) and intermediate-term (weeks to months) timescales, with short-term variability dominating the overall variation. A linear correlation exists between the global mean ( μ L 2 − 10 k e V ) and standard deviation ( σ L 2 − 10 k e V ) of X-ray luminosities, which is independent of the X-ray photon index and optical-to-X-ray spectral slope. The localized stochastic magnetic reconnection mechanism is strongly favored, which can naturally lead to a scale-invariant power-law energy distribution and satisfactorily explain the correlation. The σ – μ correlation parallels the well-documented rms–flux relation of low-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs), implying that the magnetic reconnection mechanism could drive short-timescale X-ray variability in both high- and low-redshift AGNs. The highest-redshift quasar in our sample, J142952+544717 ( z = 6.18), shows a luminosity distribution extending to 10 47 erg s −1 with a not conspicuous median luminosity. On the other hand, J143023+420436 ( z = 4.7), which hosts the most relativistic jet among known high-redshift blazars, is dominated in the high-luminosity regime (10 47 erg s −1 ), making it an ideal target for multiwavelength follow-up observations. J090630+693030 is found to have a rest-frame period of 182.46 days, and J143023+420436 has a period of 16.89 days; both could be explained by the global evolution of plasmoid chains, in which magnetic islands formed during reconnection may merge successively.},

Our work combines ultraresolved magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of MFR eruption, with test-particle studies performed using the guiding center approximation. Our grid-adaptive, fully 3D, high-resolution MHD simulations model MFR eruptions that form complex current-sheet topologies, serving as background electromagnetic fields for particle acceleration. Within the current sheet, tearing-mode instabilities give rise to mini flux ropes. Electrons become temporarily trapped within these elongated structures, undergoing acceleration and transport processes that significantly differ from those observed in 2D or 2.5D simulations. Our findings reveal that these fine-scale structures act as efficient particle accelerators, surpassing the acceleration efficiency of single X-line reconnection events, and are capable of energizing electrons to energies exceeding 100 keV. High-energy electrons accelerated in different mini flux ropes follow distinct trajectories, due to spatially varying magnetic field connectivity, ultimately precipitating onto opposite sides of flare ribbons. Remarkably, double electron sources at the flare ribbons originate from different small-flux-rope acceleration regions, rather than from the same reconnecting field line, as previously suggested. Distinct small flux ropes possess opposite magnetic helicity, to accelerate electrons to source regions with different magnetic polarities, establishing a novel conjugate double-source configuration. Furthermore, electrons escaping from the lower regions exhibit a broken-power-law energy spectrum. This spectral break arises from electrons accelerated in disparate mini flux ropes, each exhibiting magnetic reconnection rates and acceleration efficiencies, which reflect the varying local reconnection conditions.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that electron current oscillations may generate electromagnetic waves as type III radiation and whistler waves without the involvement of the classical plasma emission via the coalescence of waves. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation results of a core–strahl plasma without initial current compensation are presented, which describe the conversion of current-driven Langmuir oscillations/waves into type III radiation, whereby simultaneously whistler waves are excited. In contrast to the classical approach of V. L. Ginzburg & V. V. Zhelezniakov, after which beam-excited Langmuir waves in a two-step process are converted into electromagnetic radiation, any instability is suppressed by selecting a low strahl velocity. Rather, electric field oscillations at the electron plasma frequency are triggered by the initially noncompensated current of the strahl. The arising electromagnetic fields exhibit amplitude oscillations, which are caused by the superposition of the two wave modes of mixed polarization at the point of mode coupling. This basic mechanism of wave generation and transformation has already been described in earlier papers using simple fluid models. It is also the topic of the companion paper. Besides the fundamental electromagnetic radiation, the second harmonic of nearly the same intensity has been obtained, which is an indication of its generation by nonlinear currents. Measurements of Langmuir waves, type III radiation, and whistler waves on board various satellites in the solar wind, in particular Parker Solar Probe observations, are analyzed in the light of our results. Interpretations of earlier PIC simulations are critically reviewed.},

  abstract     = {Recent observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope have revealed abundant reservoirs of neutral hydrogen (H I ) in low-redshift poststarburst galaxies (PSBs), raising the question of why star formation ceases rapidly in these systems. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of the shape of the integrated H I spectra of 67 PSBs. We find that PSBs exhibit significantly higher H I spectral concentration values ( K ) compared to a matched sample from xGASS, and are more comparable to those of starburst galaxies. By extending our analysis to spatially resolved H I data from THINGS and Atlas 3D , we show that both centrally concentrated H I distributions and dynamically unsettled H I can effectively increase K , while nonaxisymmetric structures only contribute to the scatter of the K distribution. Distinguishing between central concentration and dynamically unsettled gas as the origin of high K can be achieved by measuring the spectral asymmetry ( A F ), making the K – A F plane a powerful diagnostic tool for identifying galaxies with unsettled H I using integrated spectra alone. Based on their location in the K – A F plane, we find that most PSBs are not dominated by unsettled H I , but rather exhibit elevated central gas concentration. Both modes of gas redistribution in PSBs may eventually contribute to their quenching.},

These include χ 2 light-curve similarity tests, photon-count-based hardness ratio (HR count ) comparisons, T 90 duration measurements, spectral lag, Norris pulse-shape fitting, and both time-resolved and time-integrated spectral analyses. We propose an evaluation framework in which any single test that reveals a statistically significant inconsistency between the two pulses is sufficient to reject the lensing hypothesis for that burst. Although certain diagnostics, such as T 90 and parametric model fits, have known limitations, they are applied and interpreted in conjunction with the more robust, model-independent χ 2 and HR count tests. For all six GRBs, at least one diagnostic shows a significant discrepancy, leading us to conclude that none are consistent with a gravitational lensing interpretation.},

We perform 2D and 3D PIC simulations in the regime of M A ≥ 10, where shock-driven turbulence contains a number of current sheets and magnetic reconnection sites. The nonresonant ion–ion beam mode grows in the shock transition region, which creates current sheets, and some of them drive magnetic reconnection. The ion temperature in magnetic islands produced by ion-coupled reconnection becomes significantly higher than those in the surrounding regions. This temperature enhancement is due to two physical reasons: the reduction of the number density of the incident ions in the nonresonant wave, and the energization and heating in the magnetic islands. Ions that enter magnetic islands are energized by the Hall electric field pointing toward the island center. Ions are also energized by the motional electric field produced in the outer regions of the islands and the current sheets. The energy increase rate of ions by these energization mechanisms is much larger than that of the conventional shock drift acceleration. These energetic ions are unmagnetized, and they escape from the shock transition region toward the upstream region; therefore, ions in shocks with reconnecting current sheets can be injected into diffusive shock acceleration more efficiently than those in laminar shock waves.},

This study compares in situ dust detection data in near-Sun solar wind against predictions made by a simplified zodiacal dust cloud model to search for small-scale meteoroid stream structures. A strong localized departure from the model is found. A small number of asteroids and comets have been identified that have orbits appropriate to produce the observed departure from the model through either direct meteoroid stream detection or through enhanced β -meteoroid production. These observations suggest that discrete meteoroid streams may be common in the inner zodiacal cloud and therefore may be important for its structure and dynamics.},

We identify 95 single members, 14 binary members, 9 members with uncertain multiplicity, and 1 single likely member. We determine effective temperatures using empirical color–temperature relations, surface gravities from isochrones, and microturbulence from empirical relations for main-sequence stars. Our sample includes G dwarfs with temperatures between 6000 and 5300 K, which expands significantly on earlier observations. We find that lithium abundances in NGC 188 are lower than predictions from standard stellar evolution theory. As expected, stars in NGC 188 are more lithium-depleted than those in the younger Hyades and Praesepe clusters (650 Myr). However, their abundances are higher, or at least comparable, to those in the slightly younger cluster M67 (4 Gyr), challenging the idea that older stars have lower lithium than younger ones. Lithium depletion may depend on factors beyond age and mass, such as metallicity.},

We derive a simple scaling relation for {Q}_{\,\rm{TD}\,}^{\star } and demonstrate that for close-in planetary or asteroidal satellites, the tides from the central body can significantly reduce their catastrophic disruption threshold. We show that many satellites in the solar system are in such a regime, where their disruption threshold should be much lower than that predicted by classical scaling laws that neglect tidal effects. Some notable examples include Mars’s Phobos, Jupiter’s Metis and Adrastea, Saturn’s ring moons, Uranus’s Ophelia, and Neptune’s Naiad and Thalassa, among others. We argue that traditional impact scaling laws should be modified to account for tides when modeling the formation and evolution of these close-in satellites.

Apart from the extensively used multimessenger astrophysics information, we introduce three new constraints to tighten the EoS at intermediate densities: (i) the absent direct Urca process in the 1.5 M ⊙ NS; (ii) the symmetry energy (coefficient) a sym of 208 Pb; (iii) the strong linear correlation between the slope parameter L of symmetry energy E sym ( ρ ) at saturation density ρ 0 and E sym ( ρ 0 ) − a sym . These constraints turn out to be highly effective for symmetry energy. As an alternative strategy, we employ the Bayesian statistical method with a multi-iteration procedure to ensure that the resulting posterior probability distribution is free of the initial prior distribution as far as possible. The most probable result of symmetry energy exhibits a soft behavior up to ∼2.5 ρ 0 , and then it rises rapidly as the density increases. On the one hand, our results allow one to explore a series of topics in NS physics. For instance, the radius and tidal deformability for a 1.4 M ⊙ NS are {R}_{1.4}=12.4{6}_{-0.80}^{+0.22}\,{\rm{km}} and {{\rm{\Lambda }}}_{1.4}=47{8}_{-183}^{+90} . The vast majority of NSs are unlikely to contain deconfined quark matter in their cores. On the other hand, almost all the widely used nuclear many-body approaches fail to reproduce such a trend of symmetry energy, and hence our results serve as an important calibration for nuclear force and nuclear many-body approaches.},

  abstract     = {Solar white-light flares (WLFs) have been observed since 1859, but their occurrence rate is not yet fully understood. The physical properties of WLFs in super active regions (SARs) are also well worth investigating. With full-disk images at 3600 Å (in the Balmer continuum) from the White-light Solar Telescope on board the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory, we here study the M- and X-class WLFs occurring in SAR NOAA 13664/13697 (a same region in two solar Carrington rotations) during 2024 May/June. In all, 48 WLFs at 3600 Å are identified from 89 available samples with an occurrence rate of 53.9%, which is much higher than that (23.9%) of a long-term-continuous data set from 2022 October to 2023 May in our previous work. In particular, with an additional sample of over 730 M- and X-class flares from 2022 October to 2024 June, we find that the occurrence rate of WLFs shows a good correlation with the solar cycle represented by sunspot counts. As regards the properties of the emission at 3600 Å, the WLFs in SAR NOAA 13664/13697 have some different characteristics, say, a longer duration but a weaker relative enhancement and a smaller brightening area compared with the previous long-term-continuous sample. We also find that for WLFs in NOAA 13664/13697 the relation between the duration and energy at 3600 Å is described by a power law with index of 0.35, which is similar to the results found for superflares in Sun-like stars. All these help us understand the solar WLFs in SARs and also provide important insights into the superflares on Sun-like stars.},

  abstract     = {We analyze 99 photometrically selected Little Red Dots (LRDs) at z ≈ 4–8 in the GOODS fields, leveraging ultradeep JADES NIRCam short-wavelength (SW) data. Among the 99 selected LRDs, we examine the morphology of 30. The remaining 69 appear predominantly compact, with sizes ≲400 pc and no extended components even in stacked SW images. However, their unresolved nature may partly reflect current depth limitations, which could prevent the detection of faint diffuse components. Among the 30 morphologically analyzed LRDs, 50% show multiple associated components, while the rest exhibit highly asymmetric structures, despite appearing as single sources. This diversity in rest-frame UV morphologies may point to interactions or strong internal feedback. We find median stellar masses of {{\mathrm{log}}_{10}}\,({M}_{\star }/{M}_{\odot })=9.0{7}_{-0.08}^{+0.11} for pure stellar models with {A}_{V}\approx 1.1{6}_{-0.21}^{+0.11} mag, and {{\mathrm{log}}_{10}}\,({M}_{\star }/{M}_{\odot })=9.6{7}_{-0.27}^{+0.17} for models including active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with {A}_{V}\approx 2.7{4}_{-0.71}^{+0.55} mag, in line with recent studies suggesting higher masses and dust content for AGN-fitted LRDs. NIRSpec spectra are available for 15 sources, six of which are also in the morphological sample. Broad H α is detected in 40% (FWHM = 1200–2900 km s −1 ), and one source shows broad H β emission. Emission line ratios indicate a composite nature, consistent with both AGN and stellar processes. Altogether, these results suggest that LRDs are a mixed population, and their rest-frame UV morphology reflects this complexity. Morphological studies of larger samples could provide a new way to understand what drives their properties and evolution.},

  abstract     = {We discovered a hyperluminous dust-obscured galaxy with mysterious blue-excess emission (BlueDOG) in the rest-frame UV of its spectral energy distribution (SED) from a multiwavelength survey in the AKARI Deep Field - South (ADF-S). We present the results of SED analysis with multiwavelength photometric data and spectroscopic analysis, observed with Gemini-S/GMOS, FLAMINGOS-2, to explore the origin of blue-excess emission of a hyperluminous BlueDOG, ADFS-KMTDOG-102, at z = 2.6. The SED analysis shows that this BlueDOG is a highly massive system (log M * / M ⊙ = 12.3) with substantial extinction. Additionally, the proportion of the old stellar population exceeds that of the young stellar population, which suggests stellar evolution cumulated from the early Universe. The mass of the supermassive black hole estimated using the extinction-corrected broad H α emission line yields log M BH / M ⊙ = 10.2. We discuss the similarity between the BlueDOG and “Little Red Dots” (LRDs), recently discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope, showing SED shapes remarkably similar to those of LRDs. The UV emission line ratios indicate that the emission lines are primarily powered by the central active galactic nuclei (AGN). In contrast, the origin of the blue-excess UV continuum remains ambiguous, since both recent star formation and AGN-induced scattered light are viable explanations, based on the results from the SED fitting and scattered light modeling.},

  abstract     = {The first close flyby of Ganymede by Juno on 2021 June 7 provided a unique opportunity to visit the previously unexplored wake and magnetopause regions. During the flyby, the Juno Waves instrument recorded traces of the existence of electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs) in the wake and magnetopause boundary. The flyby detected the presence of H 2 + and H 3 + ions in Ganymede’s wake for the first time, indicating that the wake is dominated by water products from the surface of Ganymede. The conditions for the occurrence of ESWs and double layers in the wake region and the associated existence domains (in parameter space) are explored in this paper. A magnetized fluid plasma is introduced to model Ganymede’s wake conditions, comprising of warm H + , O + , and H 3 + ions and an electron beam, in addition to a non-Maxwellian background of suprathermal electrons. We have explored in particular the role of the third ion component H 3 + on the properties of ESWs. Different acoustic modes are predicted and used as basis for our analysis, namely identified as one slow and two fast ion-acoustic modes and a higher-frequency electron-acoustic mode. Nonlinear analysis shows that the model may support the existence of positive and negative potential ion-acoustic solitons and double layers depending on the number density and on the temperature of H 3 + ions. The theoretical prediction is correlated with observed ESWs in Ganymede’s wake.},

  abstract     = {Population III (Pop III) stars, the first generation of stars formed from primordial gas, played a fundamental role in shaping the early Universe through their influence on cosmic reionization, early chemical enrichment, and the formation of the first galaxies. However, to date, they have eluded direct detection due to their short lifetimes and high redshifts. The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revolutionized observational capabilities, providing the opportunity to detect Pop III stars via caustic lensing, where strong gravitational lensing magnifies individual stars to observable levels. This prospect makes it compelling to develop accurate models for their spectral characteristics to distinguish them from other stellar populations. Previous studies have focused on computing the spectral properties of nonrotating, zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) Pop III stars. In this work, we expand upon these efforts by incorporating the effects of stellar rotation and post-ZAMS evolution into spectral calculations. We use the JWST bands and magnitude limits to identify the optimal observing conditions, both for isolated stars, as well as for small star clusters. We find that, while rotation does not appreciably change the observability at ZAMS, the subsequent evolution can significantly brighten the stars, making the most massive ones potentially visible with only moderate lensing.},

  abstract     = {Cosmic ray (CR) feedback has been proposed as a powerful mechanism for driving warm gas outflows in galaxies. We use cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the impact of CR feedback on neutral hydrogen (H i ) in a 10 11 M ⊙ dark matter halo at 2 < z < 4. To this end, we postprocess the simulations with ionizing radiative transfer and perform Monte Carlo Lyman- α (Ly α ) transfer calculations. CR feedback reduces H i column densities around young stars, thereby allowing more Ly α photons to escape and consequently offering a better match to the Ly α luminosities of observed Ly α emitters. Although galaxies with CR-driven outflows have more extended H i in the circumgalactic medium, two Ly α line properties sensitive to optical depth and gas kinematic—the location of the red peak relative to the Ly α line center in velocity space ( v red ) and relative strength of the blue-to-red peaks ( B / R )—cannot distinguish between the CR-driven and non-CR simulations. This is because Ly α photons propagate preferentially along low H i density channels created by the ionizing radiation, thereby limiting the scattering with volume-filling H i . In contrast, the observed low flux ratios between the valley and peak and the surface brightness profiles are better reproduced in the model with CR-driven outflows because the Ly α photons interact more before escaping, rather than being destroyed by dust as is the case in the non-CR simulation. We discuss the potential cause of the paucity of sightlines in simulations that exhibit prominent red peaks and large v red , which may require the presence of more volume-filling H i .},

  abstract     = {The cosmic far-infrared background (CIB) encodes dust emission from all galaxies and carries valuable information on structure formation, star formation, and chemical enrichment across cosmic time. However, its redshift-dependent spectrum remains poorly constrained due to line-of-sight projection effects. We address this by cross-correlating 11 far-infrared intensity maps spanning a 50-fold frequency range from Planck, Herschel, and Infrared Astronomical Satellite, with spectroscopic galaxies and quasars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey I–IV tomographically. We mitigate foregrounds using a CIB-free Milky Way dust map. These cross-correlation amplitudes on two-halo scales trace bias-weighted CIB redshift distributions and collectively yield a 60 σ detection of the evolving CIB spectrum, sampled across hundreds of rest-frame frequencies over 0 < z < 4. We break the bias–intensity degeneracy by adding monopole information from FIRAS+Planck. The recovered spectrum reveals a dust temperature distribution that is broad, spanning the full range of host environments, and moderately evolving. Using low-frequency CIB amplitudes, we constrain cosmic dust density, Ω dust , which peaks at z = 1–1.5 and declines threefold to the present. Our broad spectral coverage enables a determination of the total infrared luminosity density to 0.04 dex statistical precision, tracing star formation history with negligible cosmic variance across 90% of cosmic time. We find that cosmic star formation is 80% dust-obscured at z = 0 and 60% at z = 4. Our results, based on intensity mapping, are complete, requiring no extrapolation to faint galaxies or low-surface-brightness components. We release our tomographic CIB spectrum and redshift distributions as a public resource for future studies of the CIB, both as a cosmological matter tracer and cosmic microwave background foreground.},

Despite the fact that these models are able to reproduce the data well, they often lack realistic geometries and most of them consist of simplified configurations such as a slab or a torus. We use the ray-tracing code R efle X to generate new spectral models that cover a wide energy range in the X-ray band, adopting a realistic configuration for the surrounding material. We introduce two new table models that are publicly available: (1) the RXToPo model, which features an X-ray source along with a dusty torus and a polar hollow cone; and (2) the RXagn1 model, which also includes, besides the torus and polar cone, the accretion disk and the broad line region. Both models were applied to the X-ray spectrum of NGC 424, demonstrating their potential to study sources whose X-ray emission is dominated by reprocessed radiation.},

JWST has revealed an unexpectedly large population of bright ( M UV ≲ −20) galaxies at z ≳ 10, implying fundamental changes in the star-forming properties of galaxies at increasingly early times. However, constraining the fainter population ( M UV ≳ −18) has been more challenging. In this work, we present the z ≳ 9 UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. We calculate the UV luminosity function from several hundred z ≳ 9 galaxy candidates that reach UV luminosities of M UV ∼ −17 in redshift bins of z ∼ 8.5–12 (309 candidates) and z ∼ 12–16 (63 candidates). We search for candidates at z ∼ 16–22.5 and find none. We also estimate the z ∼ 14–16 luminosity function from the z ≥ 14 subset of the z ∼ 12–16 sample. Consistent with other measurements, we find an excess of bright galaxies that is in tension with many theoretical models, especially at z ≳ 12. However, we also find high number densities at −18 ≲ M UV ≲ −17, suggesting that there is a larger population of faint galaxies than expected, as well as bright ones. From our parametric fits for the luminosity function, we find steep faint-end slopes of −2.5 ≲ α ≲ −2.3, suggesting a large population of faint ( M UV ≳ −17) galaxies. Combined, the high normalization and steep faint-end slope of the luminosity function could imply that the reionization process is appreciably underway as early as z = 10.},

  abstract     = {Galaxy cluster mergers drive powerful shock fronts that heat the intracluster medium (ICM) and accelerate particles, redistributing the energy in a merger. A665 is one of only a few clusters with such a powerful shock ( { \mathcal M }\sim 3), and it provides a unique opportunity to study the thermalization timescale of the ICM, particularly the electron–ion equilibration timescale. Understanding this timescale is crucial for determining how the energy from the merger is distributed between thermal and nonthermal particle populations. Using ∼200 ks of NuSTAR observations, we measure the temperature distribution across the shock to distinguish between two heating models: (1) an instant collisionless model, where ions and electrons are immediately heated at the shock front; and (2) a collisional model, where electrons are initially adiabatically compressed at the shock and subsequently equilibrate with the ions over ∼100 Myr. Our measurements favor the delayed-equilibration model, suggesting that electrons do not immediately reach thermal equilibrium with the ions at the shock front and instead equilibrate over t eq = (4.0 ± 3.4) × 10 8 yr. Additionally, our temperature measurements indicate that the Mach number may be lower than previously estimated ( { \mathcal M }=2.8\pm 0.7 ), suggesting that the shock strength has been overestimated in past studies. These results add to our understanding of the microphysics governing how thermal energy is distributed in diffuse plasmas like the ICM, with implications for galaxy cluster evolution, large-scale structure formation, and cosmology.},

  abstract     = {We use a zero-dimensional stochastic dynamo model describing the coupled oscillatory behavior of the toroidal and poloidal components of the solar magnetic field. The model includes a time delay, arising from the assumption that the two field components are generated in spatially segregated locations, and a quenching of the α -effect for amplitudes of the toroidal magnetic field outside a range defined by a lower and an upper threshold. We apply two distinct simulation-based Bayesian inference methods to calibrate the model parameters. The first approach employs a Simulated Annealing Approximate Bayesian Computation algorithm, based on the comparison of relevant features extracted from observed data with their counterparts from simulated data. The second one leverages a sequential neural posterior density estimation method known as Automatic Posterior Transformation. The inference was carried out using two different data sets: the observed sunspot record and a recent millennial solar activity reconstruction based on 14 C cosmogenic radionuclides from tree rings. The different methods and data sets produce remarkably consistent posterior distributions for the model parameters. Bayesian inference results corroborate the hypothesis presented in a previous publication that the solar dynamo might be operating close to a critical bifurcation point characterized by the coexistence of two modes akin to normal and Grand Minima regimes. We show that the calibrated dynamo model, despite its simplicity, can be used to make predictions about solar cycles.},

By applying a combined time-series analysis using Fourier and wavelet techniques, we identify quasiperiodic variations indicative of orbital motion in compact binary SMBH systems. The derived parameters point to highly compact configurations, with total system masses reaching up to ∼2.4 · 10 10 M ⊙ and near-equal mass ratios. The inferred orbital separations and periods suggest that these binaries are in a late inspiral stage, emitting gravitational waves in the nanohertz range. Estimated strain amplitudes indicate that such sources may be detectable by current and upcoming pulsar timing arrays, including IPTA, NANOGrav, and EPTA. These results support the hypothesis that a subset of bright blazars host tightly bound SMBH pairs and represent a promising population of low-frequency gravitational-wave sources.},

  abstract     = {Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), as crucial drivers of space weather, necessitate a comprehensive understanding of their initiation and evolution in the solar corona in order to better predict their propagation. Solar Cycle 24 exhibited lower sunspot numbers compared to Solar Cycle 23, along with a decrease in the heliospheric magnetic pressure. Consequently, a higher frequency of weak CMEs was observed during Solar Cycle 24. Forecasting CMEs is vital, and various methods, primarily involving the study of the global magnetic parameters using data sets like Space-weather Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager Active Region Patches, have been employed in earlier works. In this study, we perform numerical simulations of CMEs within a magnetohydrodynamics framework using Message Passing Interface–Adaptive Mesh Refinement Versatile Advection Code in 2.5D. By employing the breakout model for CME initiation, we introduce a multipolar magnetic field configuration within a background bipolar magnetic field, inducing shear to trigger the CME eruption. Our investigation focuses on understanding the impact of the background global magnetic field on CME eruptions. Furthermore, we analyze the evolution of various global magnetic parameters in distinct scenarios (failed eruption, single eruption, and multiple eruptions) resulting from varying amounts of helicity injection in the form of shear at the base of the magnetic arcade system. Our findings reveal that an increase in the strength of the background poloidal magnetic field constrains CME eruptions. Furthermore, we establish that the growth rate of absolute net current helicity is the crucial factor that determines the likelihood of CME eruptions.},

  abstract     = {Identifying Earth-like planets outside our solar system is a leading research goal in astronomy, but determining if candidate planets have atmospheres, and more importantly if they can retain atmospheres, is still out of reach. In this paper, we present our study on the impact of enhanced extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) flux on the stability and escape of the upper atmosphere of an Earth-like exoplanet using the Global Ionosphere and Thermosphere Model. We also investigate the differences between 1D and 3D solutions. We use a baseline case of EUV flux experienced at the Earth, and multiply this flux by a constant factor going up to 50. Our results show a clear evidence of an inflated and elevated ionosphere due to enhanced EUV flux, and they provide a detailed picture of how different heating and cooling rates, as well as the conductivity, are changing at each EUV flux level. Our results also demonstrate that 1D solutions are limited in their ability to capture a global atmosphere that is not uniform. We find that a threshold EUV flux level for a stable atmosphere occurs around a factor of 10 times the baseline level, where EUV fluxes above this level indicate a rapidly escaping atmosphere. This threshold EUV flux translates to about 0.3 au for a planet orbiting the Sun. Thus, our findings indicate that an Earth-like exoplanet orbiting its host star in a close-in orbit is likely to lose its atmosphere quickly.},

We aim to verify the chemical composition hypothesis by determining the mean metallicity of each RC. We use infrared photometric data and metallicities from a previous study (that are based on the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System spectra). In contrast with previous studies, we assign stars to RCs or the red giant branch using a Bayesian approach.

We conducted Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array-Atacama Compact Array standalone observations of ortho-H 2 D + (1 1,0 –1 1,1 ) emission, which is believed to trace cold high-density regions, toward three dense cores in the Taurus molecular cloud: (1) L1544, likely in the densest prestellar phase; (2) MC 35 mm, a candidate for the first hydrostatic core; and (3) MC 27/L1521F, which hosts a Class 0 very-low-luminosity object. These observations provide high angular resolution data for the line across a set of cores selected to represent consecutive stages around the onset of star formation, offering a unique opportunity to trace the time evolution of ∼10 4 yr. With the single-dish total-power array, we detected ortho-H 2 D + emission in all three cores, revealing its presence over scales of ∼10,000 au. In the interferometric 7 m array data with a beam size of 3 \mathop{.}\limits^{^{\prime\prime} } 5 (∼500 au), emission was detected only toward the central continuum source of MC 35 mm, with a significance of ∼3 σ . No significant detections were found in the other targets, placing an upper limit on the H 2 D + abundance of ∼10 −11 in the dense components traced by the interferometric continuum emission. These results suggest that ortho-H 2 D + predominantly exhibits an extended distribution over several thousand au in the early stages of star formation. Detection in compact, dense central structures may only be achieved within a few ×10 4 yr immediately before or after protostar formation.},

A combination of Advanced Camera for Surveys/wide filed channel (WFC) and WFPC2 exposures is utilized, spanning a 20 yr time baseline. The WFPC2 exposures are processed using a recently developed deep-learning centering procedure as well as the most up-to-date astrometric calibration of the camera. We use on the order of 100 background galaxies per satellite to determine the correction to absolute proper motion. For And V, we obtain an absolute proper motion of {({\mu }_{\alpha },{\mu }_{\delta })}_{\mathrm{And}\,{\rm{V}}}=(26.1\pm 21.5,-74.2\pm 19.1)\,\mu \mathrm{as} yr −1 .

Orbit integrations and analyses are made for these two Andromeda satellites using two estimates of both the mass and proper motion of M31. It is found that And V has an orbit consistent within errors with alignment with M31’s disk and counter orbiting it, although this alignment is not well constrained. And VI’s orbit is better determined and is very much consistent with coorbiting with M31’s disk. While currently at a distance of ∼280 kpc from M31, And VI will remain beyond a distance of ∼90 kpc from M31, thus experiencing low tidal influence compared to the other M31 satellites with known orbits.

Probabilistic criteria based on proximity to the candidate central galaxy and the expected stellar mass of member galaxies are applied to identify likely members of each structure. We produced updated photometric redshift estimates using deep learning methods trained on a data set combining spectroscopic redshifts from the HSC-SSP Wide PDR3, high-accuracy photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020 catalog, and midinfrared data from the unWISE catalog for matched sources. Our method achieves a predicted purity of ∼90% in detecting (proto)clusters, with ≳65% correctly identifying the (proto)BCG. A total of 16,007 candidate (proto)clusters were identified over an effective area of ∼850 deg 2 within the HSC-SSP Wide footprint. Comparisons with other existing catalogs reveal a good level of consistency, while also highlighting that different methods yield complementary discoveries. We further compare richness and halo masses from our optical catalog with those from recent X-ray cluster catalogs (eROSITA and MCXC-II), finding a moderate positive correlation and a scatter of ∼0.4 dex.

  abstract     = {We present an algorithm designed to identify galaxy (proto)clusters in wide-area photometric surveys by first selecting their dominant galaxy—i.e., the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) or protoBCG—through the local stellar mass density traced by massive galaxies. We focus on its application to the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) Wide Survey to detect candidates up to z ∼ 2. In this work, we apply the method to mock galaxy catalogs that replicate the observational constraints of the HSC-SSP Wide Survey. We derive functions that describe the probability of a massive galaxy being the dominant galaxy in a structure as a function of its stellar mass density contrast within a given redshift interval. We show that galaxies with probabilities greater than 50% yield a sample of BCGs/protoBCGs with ≳65% purity, where most of the contamination arises from galaxies in massive groups below our cluster threshold. Using the same threshold, the resulting (proto)cluster sample achieves 80% purity and 50% completeness for halos with M halo ≥ 10 14 M ⊙ , reaching nearly 100% completeness for M halo ≥ 10 14.5 M ⊙ . We also assign probabilistic membership to surrounding galaxies based on stellar mass and distance to the dominant galaxy, from which we define the cluster richness as the number of galaxies more likely to be true members than contaminants. This allows us to derive a halo mass–richness relation. In a companion paper, we apply the algorithm to the HSC-SSP data and compare our catalog with others based on different cluster-finding techniques and X-ray detections.},

  abstract     = {We present an unprecedented simulation of how two large-scale heliospheric transients—a coronal mass ejection (CME) and a corotating stream interaction region—collide, producing a dramatic increase in the complexity of the CME due to formation of mesoscale flux ropes. These structures are captured for the first time by a numerical simulation using high-resolution numerical grids. The circumstances that lead to the formation of these complex structures occur during solar maximum. At the time of the solar maximum taken for this study, 2014 September, the heliospheric current sheet is vertically inclined running over the poles, allowing the CME to impact a preceding slow-fast stream interaction region. The simulation is performed with the Alfvén Wave Solar Atmosphere Model (or AWSoM), with which we initiate a fast CME from active region (AR) 12158 by applying a Gibson–Low magnetic flux rope. Magnetic reconnection within the leading extremity of the CME results in the formation of mesoscale flux ropes, which contain sufficiently strong magnetic fields (∼30 nT) to affect planetary magnetospheres. Finally, we use a tetrahedral configuration of four virtual probes, corresponding to the Space Weather Investigation Frontier mission concept, to show that the mission can uniquely resolve the spatial characteristics and temporal evolution of reconnecting current sheets within the CME, as well as the resulting mesoscale structures.},

  abstract     = {Current structure models of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that helium becomes immiscible in hydrogen in the outer part of the planets’ electrically conducting regions. This likely leads to a layer in which overturning convection is inhibited due to a stabilizing compositional gradient. The presence of such a stably stratified layer impacts the location and mechanism of convectively driven dynamo action. Juno’s measurements of Jupiter’s magnetic field enabled an estimate of its dynamo radius based on the magnetic Lowes spectrum. A depth of ∼0.8 R J is obtained, where 1 R J is Jupiter’s radius. This is rather deep, considering that the electrical conductivity inside Jupiter is expected to reach significant values at ∼0.9 R J . Here, we use three-dimensional numerical dynamo simulations to explore the effects of the existence and location of a stably stratified helium rain layer on both the inferred Lowes radius and the location of the radial extent of dynamo action. We focus on a Jupiter-like internal structure and electrical conductivity profile. We find that for shallower stable layers, there is no magnetic field generation occurring above the stable layer, and the effective dynamo radius and the inferred Lowes radius are at the base of the layer. For deeper stable layers, Lowes radii of ∼0.87 R J are inferred as a shallow secondary dynamo operates above the stable layer. Our results strongly suggest the existence of a stable layer extending from ∼0.8 R J up to at least ∼0.9 R J inside Jupiter. The physical origin of this extended stable layer and its connection to helium rain remain to be elucidated.},

  abstract     = {We present JWST/MIRI spectra from the Medium-Resolution Spectrometer of I Zw 18, a nearby dwarf galaxy with a metallicity of ∼3% solar. Its proximity enables a detailed study of highly ionized gas that can be interpreted in the context of newly discovered high-redshift dwarf galaxies. We derive aperture spectra centered on 11 regions of interest; the spectra show very low extinction, A V ≲ 0.1, consistent with optical determinations. The gas is highly ionized; we have detected 10 fine-structure lines, including [O iv ] 25.9 μ m with an ionization potential (IP) of ∼55 eV, and [Ne v ] 14.3 μ m with an IP of ∼97 eV. The ionization state of I Zw 18 falls at the extreme upper end of all of the line ratios we analyzed, but not coincident with galaxies containing an accreting massive black hole (active galactic nucleus). Comparison of the line ratios with state-of-the-art photoionization and shock models suggests that the high-ionization state in I Zw 18 is not due to shocks. Rather, it can be attributed to metal-poor stellar populations with a self-consistent contribution of X-ray binaries or ultra-luminous X-ray sources. It could also be partially due to a small number of hot low-metallicity Wolf−Rayet stars ionizing the gas; a small fraction (a few percent) of the ionization could come from an intermediate-mass black hole. Our spectroscopy also revealed four 14 μ m continuum sources, ≳30–100 pc in diameter, three of which were not previously identified. Their properties are consistent with H ii regions ionized by young star clusters.},

The DP1 data set for 47 Tuc includes four nights of observations from the Rubin Commissioning Camera (LSSTComCam), covering multiple bands ( ugriy ). We address challenges of crowding in the inner region of the cluster and toward the SMC in DP1, and demonstrate improved star–galaxy separation by fitting fifth-degree polynomials to the stellar loci in color–color diagrams and applying multidimensional sigma clipping. We compile a catalog of 3576 probable 47 Tuc member stars selected via a combination of isochrone, Gaia proper-motion, and color–color space matched filtering. We explore the sources of photometric scatter in the 47 Tuc color–color sequence, evaluating contributions from various potential sources, including differential extinction within the cluster. Finally, of the 72 well-characterized variables in the field, we recover three known variable stars, including two RR Lyrae and one eclipsing binary, in the coadd-based object catalog, and identify 62 in the difference image-based object catalog. Although the DP1 lightcurves have sparse temporal sampling, they appear to follow the patterns of densely sampled literature lightcurves well. Despite some data limitations for crowded-field stellar analysis, DP1 demonstrates the promising scientific potential for future LSST data releases.},

  abstract     = {We use Tibet AS γ anisotropy data for 4 TeV cosmic rays to investigate the properties of the pitch-angle focusing and diffusion caused by the interstellar magnetic field and turbulence. The pitch-angle distribution (PAD) in the local interstellar medium is reconstructed from the anisotropy map using Liouville mapping. Under the diffusion approximation, we found that the expected pitch-angle diffusion coefficient is an asymmetric function of pitch angle. Without organized magnetic/cross-helicities of interstellar magnetic field turbulence, such an asymmetry can be interpreted as evidence of focusing by a nonuniform magnetic field. A model incorporating a symmetric pitch-angle diffusion coefficient and focusing effects reproduces the observed PAD. It also indicates that the length of the magnetic field inhomogeneity is a few times the parallel mean free path of TeV particles, and that the interstellar field weakens along the field direction into the northern Galactic halo. The inferred pitch-angle diffusion coefficient might suggest scattering by compressible magnetic field turbulence. Additionally, we estimate that the parallel and perpendicular flux gradients have lengths ∼1.72 κ 29 kpc and ∼7.76 pc, respectively, where κ 29 is the spatial diffusion coefficient in units of 10 29 cm 2 s −1 . The lack of a significant observed diffusion flow perpendicular to the local magnetic field puts an upper bound on the perpendicular-to-parallel local diffusion coefficient ratio of 0.00045/ κ 29 . Moreover, we show that the temporal rate of change is no more than 7.08 × 10 −7 / κ 29 yr −1 in relative intensity.},

Here we present a comprehensive overview of the MIRI imaging observations, the data reduction procedure, the COSMOS-Web MIRI photometric catalog, and the first data release including the entire COSMOS-Web MIRI coverage. Data reduction primarily relies on the JWST Science Calibration Pipeline, supplemented by custom background subtraction to mitigate prominent instrumental artifacts and sky background within the MIRI images. We reach 5 σ (point source) limiting depths ( m F770W ∼ 25.51 based on r ∼ 0 \mathop{.}\limits^{\unicode{x02033}} 3 circular apertures) that are significantly better than initial expectations. Using the images provided in this release, we construct a photometric catalog and compare the F770W flux densities to the Spitzer/IRAC CH4 measurements from the COSMOS2020 catalog (for CH4 detections with signal-to-noise ratio S/N > 5). We find that these are in reasonable agreement with a small median offset of <0.05 mag. We also derive robust 7.7 μ m number counts spanning five orders of magnitude in flux (∼0.2–2300 μ Jy)—making COSMOS-Web the only JWST survey to date to sample such a large flux range—which are in good agreement with estimates from other JWST and IRAC surveys.},

  abstract     = {The triggers of starburst episodes are a key component to our understanding of the baryon cycle in galaxies. Galaxy mergers are a commonly suggested catalyst for starbursts, but once the galaxies coalesce into a single kinematically disturbed system, their merger history can be difficult to assess. This is particularly true for dwarf galaxies, which are expected to dominate the merger rate at all redshifts due to their large numbers. One such dwarf galaxy undergoing an enigmatic starburst episode is Henize 2–10, which appears to be isolated. Possible scenarios that might have caused the starburst episode include a previous merger or stochastic processes within the galaxy itself, such as self-regulation via feedback processes. We present new Very Large Array 21 cm observations and unpublished archival Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy CO data to investigate the dynamical state and star formation activity in the galaxy. We do not detect an H i tail consistent with the structure reported by H. A. Kobulnicky et al. ( 1995 ), which was suggested as evidence for a merger or interaction, but rather, these new observations indicate an extended H i distribution. We also find that the H i appears dynamically decoupled from an extended CO feature (inferred to be a tidal tail in previous work), suggesting large-scale dynamical processes of some type are affecting the gas in this system. We provide a metaanalysis of available results to enhance our understanding of what might be triggering the starburst episode in Henize 2–10, and speculate that the large CO feature could be falling into the galaxy and potentially trigger starburst activity.},

The CME is associated with an M3.6 flare and filament eruption. Observations from the AIA 171 Å images reveal the origin of pre-CME arcade ≈1 hr prior to the eruptive event. Before the onset of event, the hot AIA 131 and 94 Å images exhibit an existence of a hot flux rope, which on eruption results in the activation and eruptive expansion of the pre-CME coronal arcade. The eruptive process of pre-CME arcade consists of a slow rise evolution with a speed ≈3 km s −1 , “arcade-to-bubble” transformation, and blowout expansion of the CME-bubble with a fast speed of ≈400 km s −1 . A differential emission measure analysis suggests the presence of multithermal plasma in the bubble-structure and strong plasma heating at the core of the AR. A blowout expansion of CME is accompanied with multiple type III and a split-band type II radio bursts in association with X-ray emission up to 50 keV energies from its source region. Our observations reveal that the formation and expansion of the CME-bubble serve as the earliest signatures of the CME, capturing its development in the low corona. Concurrent X-ray and radio emissions further highlight the critical role of large-scale magnetic reconnection in powering both the flare emissions and the early evolution and dynamics of the CME.},

However, eight galaxies exhibit nonrotational kinematic signatures (e.g., kinematic twists, possible outflows) in their ionized gas velocity fields near the nucleus. We compare aperture-wide measurements of the gas and stellar velocity dispersions ( σ gas and σ ⋆ ) to test the use of the width of the [O iii ] line core as a surrogate for σ ⋆ . Direct comparisons between σ gas and σ ⋆ show that σ gas tends to underestimate σ ⋆ , and thus is not a reliable tracer of σ ⋆ for our selected galaxies. We measure the extent of the narrow-line region (NLR) using several definitions, resulting in sizes of ∼0.1–10 kpc.

  abstract     = {We use the Illustris-TNG300 simulation to investigate the anisotropic distribution of subhalos in/around dark matter halo pairs. We measure the position angle ( θ ) of each subhalo by the angle between the line connecting it to the nearest host halo and the line connecting the paired halos, and examine P(\cos \theta ) (the distribution of \cos \theta of all subhalos) for halo pairs with various separations ( d sep ), primary halo masses ( M p ), and secondary-to-primary halo mass ratios ( M s / M p ). We find that P(\cos \theta ) generally exhibits a combined result of two distinct features: the “bulging” distribution characterized by an overabundance along the pairwise direction, and the “lopsided” distribution showing an overabundance in the region between the paired halos. The bulging signal is stronger for halo pairs with larger d sep and smaller M p , while the lopsidedness strengthens as M p increases. Both signals depend weakly on M s / M p , and are primarily contributed by subhalos that are relatively distant from the host halos. Remarkably, these measurements can be broadly reproduced by the overlap effect, provided the spatial alignment of the halos is properly taken into account. Our findings suggest distinct origins: lopsidedness arises from simple halo overlap, while bulging reflects alignment with large-scale filaments. We examine the impact of projection and selection effects by conducting the same analysis in two dimensions and in a mock catalog that replicates the selection effects of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy sample. We find that the 3D-to-2D projection significantly suppresses the bulging distribution, with particularly strong effects at large d sep , small M p , and large M s / M p .},

  abstract     = {Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for probing the internal structure and evolution of galaxies, the nature of dark matter, and the expansion history of the Universe, among many other scientific applications. For almost all of these science cases, modeling the lensing mass distribution is essential. For that, forward modeling of imaging data to the pixel level is the standard method used for galaxy-scale lenses. However, the traditional workflow of forward lens modeling necessitates a significant amount of human investigator time, requiring iterative tweaking and tuning of the model settings through trial and error. An automated lens-modeling pipeline can substantially reduce the need for human investigator time. In this paper, we present dolphin , an automated lens-modeling pipeline that combines artificial intelligence with the traditional forward-modeling framework to enable full automation of the modeling workflow. dolphin uses a neural network model to perform visual recognition of the strong lens components, then autonomously sets up a lens model with appropriate complexity and fits the model with the modeling engine, lenstronomy . Thanks to the versatility of lenstronomy , dolphin can autonomously model both galaxy–galaxy and galaxy–quasar strong lenses.},

To construct the map, we first infer the distance, extinction, and stellar types of over 700 million stars using the brutus stellar inference framework with a set of theoretical MESA Isochrone and Stellar Tracks ( MIST ) stellar models. Our resultant 3D dust map has an angular resolution of 1^{\prime} \rm{}\,\rm{}\, roughly an order of magnitude finer than existing 3D dust maps and comparable to the angular resolution of the Herschel 2D dust emission maps. We detect complexes at the range of distances associated with the Sagittarius-Carina and Scutum-Centaurus arms in the fourth quadrant, as well as more distant structures out to a maximum reliable distance of d ≈ 10 kpc from the Sun. The map is sensitive up to a maximum extinction of roughly A V ≈ 12 mag. We publicly release both the stellar catalog and the 3D dust map, the latter of which can easily be queried via the Python package dustmaps . When combined with the existing Bayestar19 3D dust map of the northern sky, the DECaPS 3D dust map fills in the missing piece of the Galactic plane, enabling extinction corrections over the entire disk ∣ b ∣ < 10°. Our map serves as a pathfinder for the future of 3D dust mapping in the era of LSST and Roman, targeting regimes accessible with deep optical and near-infrared photometry but often inaccessible with Gaia.},

  abstract     = {From the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, we identify 14 off-nuclear broad (FWHM > 1000 km s −1 ) H α and/or H β emission line sources that indicate spatially offset active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates. In addition to massive black holes (MBHs) in ongoing galaxy mergers, this selection can also find MBHs that have been ejected from the host galaxy nucleus due to MBH binary coalescence and asymmetric gravitational wave emission or the dynamical “slingshot” mechanism. Recoiling/slingshot MBHs are predicted to affect coevolution between MBHs and their host galaxies, and they are observational tracers of past binary MBH mergers and gravitational wave emission. This is the first systematic search through an integral field spectroscopy survey for ejected MBHs to enable uniform constraints on their surface densities. We find that 42% (6/14) have optical image counterparts consistent with galaxy stellar cores from infalling MBHs before the close binary MBH stage. The remaining 58% (8/14) have large broad line luminosities relative to their stellar core mass upper limits (∼2 times larger than for central AGN), suggesting merger-driven MBH accretion enhancements or potentially ejected MBHs. The signatures of AGN-ionized narrow emission lines for recoil/slingshot candidates are weaker by 68%, which is consistent with the ejected MBH scenario. The broad line projected velocity offsets range from ∼10 to 600 km s −1 and suggest motion within the host galaxy potentials. Finally, the implied recoiling MBH surface density upper limit is consistent with predictions that assume random spin orientations in MBH binaries.},

  abstract     = {Utilizing high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, and the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we investigated the nature and origin of counterstreaming flows within a forming active region filament. The ever-present counterstreaming flows observed within the filament are identified as interleaved unidirectional mass flows in opposing directions occurring in neighboring threads. Multiwavelength observations corroborate the multithermal nature of these counterstreaming flows: the cool H α component flows at about 10−20 km s −1 , while the warm ultraviolet and extreme-ultraviolet components reach 40–70 km s −1 . The Si iv 1400 Å line reveals significant microturbulence in the filament’s counterstreaming flows, with a nonthermal velocity width of ∼40 km s −1 . These multithermal flows emanate from compact brightenings at the filament’s ends, manifesting as small-scale, collimated upflows at their nascent phase. They continuously inject both chromospheric and transition region plasma into the filament channel, thereby feeding the counterstreaming flows. At their base, the Si iv and C ii spectral lines show pronounced line broadening and intensity enhancements, indicating significant localized chromospheric heating. Additionally, numerous small-scale photospheric flux emergence and cancellation events, with a magnitude of ∼10 17 Mx, are detected near their base. We suggest that such weak magnetic-field activities, possibly associated with unresolved magnetic reconnection events, drive these persistent upflows and localized footpoint heating. This work elucidates the multithermal origin of counterstreaming flows within a forming filament and provides evidence of localized chromospheric heating at the filament footpoints.},

To do so, we train an ML model on a bank of nucleosynthesis calculations derived from hydrodynamic simulations for events such as neutron star mergers where the rapid ( r ) neutron capture process can take place. Likewise, we consider a bank of calculations from simulations of the slow ( s ) neutron capture process. We explore the performance of both a binary classifier and a one-class classifier. We demonstrate that our ML models do well overall in recognizing the s process from the r process, and after training on theoretical calculations, ML stellar assignments match conventional labels 87% of the time. We highlight that this method then points to stars that could benefit from additional observational measurements. We then apply the one-class classifier to numerous cases on which it did not train, including i -process stars, and a few nucleosynthesis predictions for the i process in rapidly accreting white dwarfs and r process in MHD supernovae. We demonstrate that the ML assigns some of the presently considered i -process stars to instead be of r or s in origin but likewise finds stars currently labeled as s to be potentially more aligned with i enrichment. This first application of ML to classify metal-poor star enrichment using theoretical nucleosynthesis calculations reveals the promise, and some challenges, associated with this new data-driven path forward.},

  abstract     = {General relativity (GR) is the most successful theory of gravity, with great observational support on local scales. However, to keep GR valid over cosmic scales, some phenomena require the assumption of exotic dark matter, especially the cosmic expansion history and flat rotation curves of galaxies. Their radial acceleration relation (RAR) indicates a tight correlation between the dynamical mass and the baryonic mass. This suggests that galactic observations could be better explained by modified gravity theories without exotic matter. Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is an alternative theory that was originally designed to do exactly this using a new fundamental acceleration scale, a 0 , the so-called Milgromian parameter. However, this nonrelativistic model lacks the flexibility needed to account for the wide variety of observed phenomena. In contrast, a relativistic MOND-like gravity naturally emerges from the hyperconical model, which derives a fictitious acceleration compatible with observations. We analyze the compatibility of the hyperconical model with respect to distinct RAR observations of 10 galaxy clusters obtained from HIFLUGCS and 60 high-quality SPARC galaxy rotation curves. The results show that a general relation can be fitted to most cases with only one or two parameters, with an acceptable χ 2 and p -value. These findings suggest a possible way to complete the proposed modification of GR on cosmic scales.},

  abstract     = {Corotating interaction regions (CIRs) are long-lasting solar wind structures that persist over multiple solar rotations. These structures accelerate particles throughout the heliosphere and can impart significant energy onto planetary ionospheres and magnetospheres. Understanding how CIRs and their associated energetic particles evolve radially with heliocentric distance is of great interest and can give insight into acceleration mechanisms that occur within these structures. CIR solar wind and particle properties have been examined at numerous heliocentric distances but have been largely unexplored at Mars. We examine the properties of a CIR observed over two Carrington rotations by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)-A at 1 au and the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft at 1.5 au. This CIR was observed during near-radial alignment of the spacecraft, allowing for the exclusion of significant longitudinal variations in the CIR’s properties. We find that during both rotations, the scaled solar wind density and interplanetary magnetic field are slightly higher at MAVEN than measurements at STEREO-A, and the CIR compression occurs over similar periods at both spacecraft during each event. Suprathermal particle enhancements are observed at both spacecraft during both passes of the CIR. Variations in the particle spectra between observations indicate suprathermal particle acceleration at both spacecraft, with higher-energy populations observed at 1.5 au compared to 1 au. Spectral anisotropies observed at MAVEN also indicate a combination of local and nonlocal particle acceleration, further demonstrating that the acceleration mechanisms associated with CIRs are complex and evolve with heliocentric distance.},

  abstract     = {Quasiperiodic disturbances in EUV emission intensity, propagating along polar plumes in the solar corona, are frequently observed. Analysis of these propagating disturbances in the 171 Å bandpass of the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly reveals that the wave spectrum evolves with height. Near the footpoints, the dominant spectral peak corresponds to oscillation periods of 12–15 minutes. As the disturbances propagate upward, the shorter-period spectral component diminishes, while a longer-period component of 20–30 minutes becomes dominant. Theoretical modeling of coronal slow magnetoacoustic waves effectively reproduces this spectral evolution. The model incorporates field-aligned thermal conduction and the back reaction of wave-induced perturbations on local thermal equilibrium. Coronal slow waves, driven by a broadband source with a peak at a shorter period, show a decrease in shorter-period spectral power with height, while the 20–30 minute spectral power increases due to thermal overstability. Analysis of the dispersion relations reveals that, given the chosen model parameters, the most rapidly growing spectral component corresponds to a 22.5 minute period, which aligns well with the observational findings.},

  abstract     = {The singularity structure of the electromagnetic field fluctuations in strong Alfvénic turbulence is addressed. Owing to the transverse polarization of the fluctuations, the turbulent cascade is essentially perpendicular to the direction of the guiding magnetic field. A scaling analysis of the local energy transfer rates suggests that the most intense singularities are the sites of inertial dissipation of the energy. The lack of smoothness of the electromagnetic fields can give rise to dissipative processes unrelated to collisional transport phenomena in the magnetized plasma. A log-Poisson cascade model is developed. The random multiplicative cascade process is quantized and acts on the Elsässer field increments. In a multifractal interpretation, the log-Poisson cascade is characterized by three parameters: the most probable singularity strength, the strongest singularity, and its fractal codimension. The resulting probability distribution functions are derived from discrete superpositions of dilated integral scale distributions weighted by scale-dependent Poisson distributions. In addition to the three parameters mentioned above, they depend on the standard deviation of the integral scale fluctuations. The four-parameter family of normal log-Poisson mixture distributions is sensitive to the strongest singularities responsible for inertial dissipation of the electromagnetic energy in collisionless space plasma environments.},

The thermonuclear burst detected with NICER shows clear evidence of a photospheric radius expansion (PRE) event and a distinct feature in the burst profile. The burst profiles demonstrate significant energy dependence, with the hardness ratio varying notably during the PRE phase. The radius of the neutron star photosphere expanded to a maximum of 23.{1}_{-3.2}^{+3.8} km while its temperature reached a minimum of ∼1.4 keV. The time-resolved burst spectra can be modeled using the variable persistent emission method, indicating that the soft excess may arise from enhanced mass accretion onto the neutron star, potentially due to the Poynting–Robertson drag. Alternatively, the disk reflection model can be used to explain the soft excess emission during a burst. The time-resolved spectral study is performed for three thermonuclear bursts detected with XMM-Newton. The XMM-Newton time-resolved burst spectra can be modeled using an absorbed blackbody model, without any signatures of the PRE. We conduct a detailed spectral analysis of the 2025 NuSTAR observation of 4U 1702–429, revealing a broad iron line at 6.4 keV and a Compton hump around 20 keV, indicating X-ray reflection features. The disk reflection model relxill provides an inner disk radius of ∼12 R g and an inclination angle of ∼39°. The magnetic field strength at the pole of the neutron star is estimated to be 5.1 × 10 8 G, assuming that the accretion disk is truncated at the magnetosphere boundary.},

This study is based on high-resolution optical spectra obtained with ESPaDOnS at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope. We first calculated the average chemical element abundance, the rotational velocity, and the radial velocity of the stars using the ZEEMAN2 spectrum synthesis code with the PHOENIX model atmospheres. We then studied the abundances of titanium and iron inferred from individual lines in the spectra of each star and their variations with their predicted formation depths τ 5000 . Similarly to the BHB stars cooler than 11,500 K observed in globular clusters, no clear observational evidence of vertical stratification is detected in the atmosphere of these stars. In the second part of this project, we searched for the presence of a magnetic field in the stars, applying the least-squares deconvolution technique on the Stokes I and V spectra. The measured mean longitudinal magnetic field uncertainties, ranging from 8 to 30 G, effectively rule out the presence of an organized magnetic field in these targets with a strength larger than a few 100 G.},

  abstract     = {Enceladus exhibits some remarkable phenomena, including water geysers spraying through surface cracks, a global ice shell that is librating atop an ocean, a large luminosity, and rapid outward orbital migration. Here, we model the coupled evolution of Enceladus’s orbit and interior structure. We find that Enceladus is driven into a periodic state—a limit cycle. Many of Enceladus’s observed phenomena emerge from the model, and the predicted values for the orbital eccentricity, libration amplitude, shell thickness, and luminosity agree with observations. A single limit cycle lasts around 10 million years, and has three distinct stages: (1) freezing, (2) melting, and (3) resonant libration. In our model, Enceladus is currently in the freezing stage, meaning that its ice shell is getting thicker. That pressurizes the ocean, which in turn cracks the shell and pushes water up through the cracks. In this stage, the orbital eccentricity increases, as Saturn pushes Enceladus deeper into resonance with Dione. Once the eccentricity is sufficiently high, tidal heating begins to melt the shell, which is the second stage of the cycle. In the third stage, the shell remains close to 3 km thick. At that thickness, the shell’s natural libration frequency is resonant with the orbital frequency. The shell’s librations are consequently driven to large amplitude, for millions of years. Most of the tidal heating of Enceladus occurs during this stage, and the observed luminosity is a relic from the last episode of resonant libration, while the present-day heat production is small (∼1 GW).},

We have been dedicated to developing methods for the analysis of neutrinos emitted during the late phase and observed at Super-Kamiokande (SK). Our previous studies have successfully demonstrated the potential of various analysis methods in extracting essential physical properties; however, the lack of background consideration has limited their practical application. In this study, we address this issue by incorporating a realistic treatment of the experimental signal and background events with the on-going SK experiment. We therefore optimize our analysis framework to reflect realistic observational conditions, including both signal and background events. Using this framework we study several long-time supernova models, simulating the late phase neutrino observation in SK and focusing in particular on the identification of the last observed event. We discuss the possibility of model discrimination methods using timing information from this last observed event.},

  abstract     = {JWST has revealed a large population of compact, red objects at z > 4 known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). We analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 88 LRDs from the JWST PRIMER survey with complete photometric coverage from 1 to 18 μ m using NIRCam and MIRI imaging, representing the most extensive SED analysis on a large LRD sample with long-wavelength MIRI data. We examine SED models in which either galaxy or active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission dominates the rest-frame UV or optical continuum, extracting physical properties to explore each scenario’s implications. In the galaxy-only model, we find massive, dusty stellar populations alongside unobscured, low-mass components, hinting at inhomogeneous obscuration. The AGN-only model indicates dusty, luminous AGNs with low hot dust fractions compared to typical quasars. A hybrid AGN and galaxy model suggests low-mass, unobscured galaxies in the UV, with stellar mass estimates spanning ∼2 dex across the different models, underscoring the need for caution in interpreting LRD stellar masses. With MIRI photometry, the galaxy-only model produces stellar masses within cosmological limits, but extremely high stellar mass densities are inferred. The hybrid model infers highly overmassive black holes exceeding those in recently reported high-redshift AGNs, hinting at a partial AGN contribution to the rest-optical continuum or widespread super-Eddington accretion. Our findings highlight the extreme conditions required for both AGN- and galaxy-dominated scenarios in LRDs, supporting a mixed contribution to the red continuum, or novel scenarios to explain the observed emission.},

  abstract     = {A near-infrared (NIR) excess has been discovered in the emission of the representative fast blue optical transient (FBOT) AT 2018cow. It was suggested that this NIR excess could be emitted by the dust surrounding the source and thus could provide a probe into the nature of its progenitor. We develop a model to describe the influence of the FBOT emission on the environmental dust, and as a result, a dust-free evaporation cavity can be formed on a timescale of 1 day. Outside this cavity, the surviving dust grains can have different size distributions at different distances from the source. With such a special dust environment, we fit the multiwavelength light curves of AT 2018cow by taking into account the evolutionary dust echo of the FBOT emission. It is found that the dust temperature can vary with time along with the evolution of the irradiating FBOT emission. Even at a fixed time, the dust temperature can be distributed in a wide range rather than having only a unique value. Furthermore, both the mass of the dust shell and its distance to the FBOT are found to be much larger than those derived with a direct empirical fitting of the NIR spectra but without considering the evolutionary relationship between the spectra.},

Compared to other SEP populations, the extremely large enrichment of 3 He and much smaller though significant heavy ion enhancements suggest a common origin but without firm observational evidence due to the small size of the events. Using improved instruments close to the Sun on Solar Orbiter, we surveyed the period 2020 April—2025 May for 3 He-rich events whose rise phase phases were sufficiently undistorted and intense that the particle arrival times could be measured accurately. We found six events that met the criteria and that appear to be typical impulsive SEP events but with unusually high counting statistics. For C–Fe the mean arrival times of 226–320 keV nucleon −1 ions are simultaneous to ∼5 minutes, a small fraction of the ion propagation time from the Sun (110–310 minutes depending on heliocentric distance). H and 4 He mean arrival times showed a maximum difference of 1.6 minutes. Overall 3 He arrival times differ from the others by ∼3 ± 3 minutes. These times are sufficiently close to simultaneity to give evidence for a common acceleration mechanism. This adds a new constraint to models for these events, namely, that the accelerating waves can interact with the broad range of gyrofrequencies associated with the range charge-to-mass ratios for H–Fe.},

  abstract     = {While plane-of-sky magnetic field observations in molecular clouds are now common, observations of their line-of-sight magnetic field remain limited. To address this issue, M. Tahani et al. developed a technique based on Faraday rotation. The technique incorporates an ON–OFF approach to identify the rotation measure induced by the magnetic fields associated with the cloud. The upcoming abundance of observations of Faraday rotation from the Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders necessitates robustly tested software to automatically obtain line-of-sight magnetic fields of molecular clouds. We developed software, called MC-BLOS (for molecular cloud line-of-sight magnetic field; DOI:10.5281/zenodo.15338512), to carry out the technique in an automated manner. The software’s inputs are Faraday rotation of point sources, maps of extinction or column density, results from chemical evolution code, and a parameter file that allows the user to specify the cloud name or other parameters pertaining to the technique. For each cloud, the software invokes a set of predefined initial parameters such as density, temperature, and surrounding boundary, which the user can modify. The software then runs the technique automatically, outputting line-of-sight magnetic field maps and tables (including uncertainties) at the end of the process. MC-BLOS generates diagnostic files for result evaluation and input parameter refinement, allowing for expert judgment in parameter selection. We have tested the software on previously published clouds, and the results are consistent within the reported uncertainty range. This software will facilitate the analysis of forthcoming observations of Faraday rotation, enabling a better understanding of the role of magnetic fields in molecular cloud dynamics and star formation.},

The shock fronts produced after the explosion of the supernova are ideal regions for particle acceleration. IC 443 is a supernova remnant that has been studied extensively at different wavelengths. Using 2966 days of gamma-ray data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, we study the emission of IC 443 with the objective of finding signatures of cosmic-ray acceleration at the PeV scale. Using a maximum likelihood method, we find a point source located at ( α = 94 \mathop{.}\limits^{\unicode{x000b0}} 42, δ = 22 \mathop{.}\limits^{\unicode{x000b0}} 35) that we associate with IC 443. The measured spectrum is a simple power law with an index of −3.14 ± 0.18, which is consistent with previous TeV observations. Although we cannot confirm that IC 443 is a hadronic PeVatron, we do not find any sign that the spectrum has a cutoff at tens of TeV energies, with the spectrum extending to ∼30 TeV. Furthermore, we also find a new extended component in the region whose emission is described by a simple power law with an index of −2.49 ± 0.08 and which we call HAWC J0615+2213.

  abstract     = {We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA) to explore the redshift, luminosity, and black hole mass dependence of the quasar halo occupation distribution (HOD). In both simulations, we find that the quasar activity is quenched at a characteristic halo mass (∼10 13 M ⊙ ) scale affecting the nature of its occupation distribution function. We note that the quenching is more pronounced at low redshifts for quasars selected through a luminosity threshold. We show that a very significant bias (a factor of ∼10–50 in the central occupation and ∼10%–70% in the satellite occupation fraction) is introduced in the reconstruction of quasar host halo mass distributions from the observed two-point-correlation function, if the HOD modeling does not account for the quenching effect in the central occupation function. While there is strong suppression of the occupation fraction of central quasars, the satellite occupation still follows a power-law-like behavior. Our results show that the global satellite fraction of quasars increases monotonically from high to low redshifts, with 20%–40% of the quasars being satellite at intermediate redshifts, consistent with previous clustering-based estimates. In addition, our study reveals that while the occupation function of quasars depends on redshift, luminosity, and feedback modes, there is hardly any evolution in the supermassive black hole (SMBH; mass-selected sample) occupation. The SMBH HOD over the entire parameter space is well modeled by a power-law and a step function similar to what has been found for galaxies and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.},

  abstract     = {Modeling the light curves (LCs) of luminous astronomical transients, such as supernovae, is crucial for understanding their progenitor physics, particularly with the exponential growth of survey data. However, existing methods face limitations: efficient semianalytical models (e.g., Arnett-like) employ significant physical simplifications (like time-invariant temperature profiles and simplified heating distributions), often compromising accuracy, especially for early-time LCs. Conversely, detailed numerical radiative transfer simulations, while accurate, are computationally prohibitive for large data sets. This paper introduces TransFit , a novel framework that numerically solves a generalized energy conservation equation, explicitly incorporating time-dependent radiative diffusion, continuous radioactive or central engine heating, and ejecta expansion dynamics. The model accurately captures the influence of key ejecta properties and diverse heating source characteristics on LC morphology, including peak luminosity, rise time, and overall shape. Furthermore, TransFit provides self-consistent modeling of the transition from shock-cooling to 56 Ni-powered LCs. By combining physical realism with computational speed, TransFit provides a powerful tool for efficiently inverting LCs and extracting detailed physical insights from the vast data sets of current and future transient surveys.},

For the different elements, our results for the DR rate coefficients for recombining from the ionization states of II to I, III to II, and IV to III vary between 2 × 10 −12 –5 × 10 −11 cm 3 s −1 , 10 −13 –5 × 10 −11 cm 3 s −1 , and 2 × 10 −15 –10 −11 cm 3 s −1 , respectively, at a temperature of T = 10,000 K. Using this new atomic data (DR), we study the impact on kilonova model spectra at phases of t = 10 days and t = 25 days after the merger using the spectral synthesis code SUMO . Compared to models using the previous treatment of recombination as a constant rate, the new models show significant changes in ionization and temperature, and, correspondingly, in emergent spectra. With the new rates, we find that Zr ( Z = 40) plays a yet more dominant role in kilonova spectra for light r -process compositions. Furthermore, we show that previously predicted mid-infrared (e.g., [Se III ] 4.55 μ m) and optical (e.g., Rb I 7802, 7949 Å) lines weaken in the new model. Instead, [Se I ] 5.03 μ m emerges as a signature. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the detailed microphysics for modelling and interpreting the late-time kilonova spectra.},

  abstract     = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the Class 0 protostar IRAS 04166+2706, obtained as part of the ALMA Large Program Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks. These observations were made in the 1.3 mm dust continuum and molecular lines at angular resolutions of \sim 0\mathop{.}\limits{^{\prime\prime} }05 (∼8 au) and \sim 0\mathop{.}\limits{^{\prime\prime} }16 (∼25 au), respectively. The continuum emission shows a disklike structure with a radius of ∼22 au. Kinematical analysis of 13 CO (2–1), C 18 O (2–1), H 2 CO (3 0,3 –2 0,2 ), CH 3 OH (4 2 –3 1 ) emission demonstrates that these molecular lines trace the infalling-rotating envelope and possibly a Keplerian disk, enabling us to estimate the protostar mass to be 0.15 M ⊙ < M ⋆ < 0.39 M ⊙ . The dusty disk is found to exhibit a brightness asymmetry along its minor axis in the continuum emission, probably caused by a flared distribution of the dust and the high optical depth of the dust emission. In addition, the 12 CO (2–1) and SiO (5–4) emissions show knotty and wiggling motions in the jets. Our high-angular-resolution observations revealed the most recent mass ejection events, which have occurred within the last ∼25 yr.},

  abstract     = {Within the molecular clouds of the Camelopardis OB1 (Cam OB1) association exists a region previously noted as one subgroup. However, bulk clustering from Gaia astrometry has recently shown three distinctive kinematically coherent groups, all found in a similar location in the sky (137 ⪅ l ⪅ 145 and −2 ⪅ b ⪅ 5) and at a similar distance (∼1 kpc). In this work, we derive from first principles the three proposed clusters in this region, refine the membership list and cluster ages, and, for the first time, examine the 3D structure, motion, and origin of the clusters. Using clustering of Gaia data in 3D position + 2D velocity space, supplemented by available fifth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey radial velocities, we find clusters of ages 10, 15.8, and 20 Myr with members numbering 140, 469, and 184, respectively. All three clusters overlap currently in 3D space. Tracing their previous locations, based on present-day motions, shows that each cluster originated in its own distinct region and exhibited no influence on each other’s formation. Two of the clusters trace their origin to different areas within the Cam OB1 association, with the oldest cluster tracing its origins to the near edge of the Perseus Arm, in the direction of the Perseus OB1 or Cassiopeia OB6 associations. Overall, this work illustrates how different stellar groups, even those originating in a different spiral arm, can visit and pass through each other as they travel through the Galaxy.},

These systems are potential progenitors of Type Ia supernovae and could serve as independent probes of cosmic expansion. We examine two proposed lunar gravitational-wave detector concepts operating in the subhertz band (0.1–1 Hz): the Gravitational-Wave Lunar Observatory for Cosmology (a proxy for suspended test mass detectors) and the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (a proxy for seismic array detectors). We estimate that these detectors could reach distances of up to ∼1 Gpc for the most massive mergers. We show that lunar detectors could observe up to dozens of massive WD mergers annually, including those originating from globular clusters. Lunar detectors would constrain the masses of these WDs with an unprecedented accuracy of one part in a million. Furthermore, these detectors would provide early warnings weeks before mergers, including sky-localization of square arcminute resolution, enabling a new era of coordinated multimessenger follow-up of electromagnetic transients—whether they evolve into Type Ia supernovae or accretion-induced collapse events.},

  abstract     = {Many nova and Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosion scenarios involve accretion disks. However, direct numerical simulations of these explosive phenomena have barely addressed the question of the impact of ejecta−disk collision on the midterm evolution of such explosions. This is particularly critical for a better understanding of classical and recurrent novae, where each nova cycle depends on the imprint left by the precedent explosion. In this work, we describe and analyze a set of high-resolution simulations of the ejecta−disk interaction. We show that, depending on the initial configuration of the binary system, the disk is partially or, more often, totally destroyed, which will impact the next nova explosion cycle. In the case of SNe Ia, the much larger kinetic energy carried by the ejecta always provokes complete destruction of the accretion disk. We also discuss the alterations induced in the geometry of the ejecta by the shielding effect of the disk, which has been shown to cause reduced contamination of the companion star up to a factor ∼1.5–2 in key nuclei produced during the nova outburst. In the framework of recurrent nova simulations, we report for the first time on the formation of a cavity in the ejecta after its interaction with the disk. We also describe the onset and development of several hydrodynamic instabilities such as Kelvin–Helmholtz and Richtmyer–Meshkov.},

  abstract     = {MRC 0600–399, in the merging galaxy cluster A3376, is one of the unique head–tail radio galaxies that have abruptly bending structures, the origin of which is still under discussion. A previous study suggested that the interaction between the jets and the magnetic fields on the cold front has produced such an outstanding feature; however, it is still not known how the jet propagates such a long distance while keeping its sharp shape. In this study, we performed a polarization analysis of MRC 0600–399 and a nearby radio source using MeerKAT L -band data. To interpret the Faraday structure, we constructed a pseudo-3D visualization map of the reconstructed 3D cube of the Faraday dispersion function. MRC 0600–399 has a complicated Faraday depth structure, and some of the Faraday depth features are in good agreement with the 2D structure on the celestial sphere. For the northern jet of MRC 0600–399, the Faraday depth values show a clear gap at the tip region. Based on the polarization analysis and comparison with other observations, we concluded that the synchrotron radiation from the tip region of the northern jet originates from the magnetic field on the cold front.},

  abstract     = {Starburst galaxies, such as M82, launch kiloparsec-scale galactic outflows that interact with the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in complex ways. Apart from enriching the CGM with metals and energy, these outflows may trigger star formation in the halo—either by driving shocks into the CGM or transporting cold, star-forming gas. To investigate such processes, we analyze the star formation history (SFH) of the Southern Arcs—arc-like stellar features located ∼5 kpc from M82’s star-forming disk along the minor axis—using Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 photometry. From resolved stellar populations, we derive SFHs over the last ∼500 Myr, finding that ∼85% of the stellar mass formed between ∼150 and ∼70 Myr ago, followed by a brief pause, with the remaining ∼15% forming since ∼30 Myr ago. The two stellar populations are cospatial on scales of at least ∼200 pc. The timing of the ∼100 Myr burst aligns with star formation in the M82 disk and the age distribution of its star clusters, suggesting a causal link between the disk starburst and halo star formation. We explore two mechanisms that could explain these observations. In the first, shocks driven by the interaction between hot outflowing gas and cooler CGM material compress dense clouds, triggering collapse and star formation. In the second, stars form directly within massive, cool clouds associated with the outflow. As these clouds move ballistically through the halo, subsequent interactions with tidal debris may trigger additional star formation, producing the observed episodic structure.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the influence of disruptive collisions on chondrule rim growth, emphasizing the role of kinetic energy in determining the outcomes of these interactions. We establish a threshold of approximately 10 cm s −1 for the “hit-and-stick” collision regime, beyond which significant changes occur in the structure of rimmed chondrules. Our findings highlight that at low collision energies (KE < 10 −12 J), minimal structural alteration takes place, while higher energies (KE up to 10 −10 J) lead to compaction of the rim, reducing both its thickness and porosity. Collisions with energies exceeding 10 −8 J result in the complete disruption of the rim, with particles being expelled from it. These results are correlated with the turbulence levels within the disk, as kinetic energy scales with the relative velocities of colliding particles. Leveraging machine learning models trained on our collision data, we predict changes in rim characteristics and employ these predictions in a Monte Carlo simulation to explore rim growth dynamics. Our simulations reveal that rim development is sustained in low-turbulence environments ( α ≤ 10 −5 ), while intermediate turbulence levels ( α = 10 −3 –10 −4 ) lead to erosion, preventing further rim accumulation in high-turbulence contexts.},

  abstract     = {The transport of high-energy particles in the presence of small-scale, turbulent magnetic fields is a long-standing issue in astrophysics. Analytical theories on transport perpendicular to the large-scale magnetic field disagree with numerical simulations at rigidities where the particles’ gyroradii are slightly smaller than the correlation length of turbulence. At the same time, extending the numerical simulations to lower rigidities has proven computationally prohibitive. We present an analytical model for the perpendicular transport, based on (1) initial particle transport along field lines, (2) the transport of field lines, and (3) the eventual decorrelation of particles from field lines. Transport parallel to the large-scale field is governed by pitch-angle scattering, and so for times larger than the inverse pitch-angle diffusion coefficient, particles spatially diffuse in the parallel direction. Our results suggest that perpendicular diffusion occurs when particles have displaced in the perpendicular direction by a few correlation lengths of turbulence. We have tested the analytical theory by running a large suite of test particle simulations at unprecedentedly low rigidities, making extensive use of graphical processing units. Our numerical results exhibit a nonstandard rigidity dependence for the perpendicular diffusion coefficient at intermediate rigidities. At the lowest rigidities, the standard rigidity dependence is recovered. The simulated diffusion coefficients are nicely reproduced by our analytical model. We have traced the nonstandard rigidity dependence to a subdiffusive phase in the field line transport. Our study confirms our understanding of the escape of cosmic rays from the Galactic halo and its rigidity dependence. It also rejects speculations about different rigidity dependencies of the parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients at very low rigidities that were invoked to explain nonstandard gamma-ray spectra from the Galactic center. Other possible applications concern particle acceleration at perpendicular shocks.},

  abstract     = {We present multiband ATLAS and ZTF photometry for SN 2019tsf, a Type Ib stripped-envelope supernova (SESN). The slow spectral evolution could be associated with an uncommon explosion mechanism specific to this SN. Possible explanations include fallback accretion onto a compact remnant or a long-lived central engine, both of which could provide extended energy injection responsible for the late-time rebrightening and unusual spectral features. The rebrightening observations represent the latest photometric measurements of a multipeaked Type Ib SN. As late-time photometry and spectroscopy suggest no hydrogen, the potential circumstellar material (CSM) must be H-poor. The absence of a nebular phase and the lack of narrow emission lines in the late-time spectra (>142 days) of the SNe suggest that any CSM interaction is likely asymmetric and enveloped by the SN ejecta. However, an extended CSM structure is evident through a follow-up radio campaign with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), indicating a source of bright optically thick radio emission at late times, which is highly unusual among H-poor SESNe. We attribute this phenomenology to an interaction of the supernova ejecta with asymmetric CSM, potentially disk-like, and we present several models that may explain the origin of this rare Type Ib supernova. We propose a warped disk model in which a tertiary companion—commonly present around massive stars—perturbs the progenitor’s CSM, producing density enhancements that may explain the observed multipeaked SN 2019tsf light curve. This SN 2019tsf is a unique SN Type Ib among the recently discovered class of SNe that undergo mass transfer at the moment of explosion.},

The Cyg OB2-12 data include a new ground-based 2.86−3.70 μ m spectrum and a previously published, but here further analyzed, spectrum of the 5.50–7.34 μ m region. Higher-spectral-resolution data for the Cyg OB2-12 sightline in the 3 μ m region allows a detailed comparison of the 3.4 μ m aliphatic bands to those observed toward the Quintuplet. Despite differences in interstellar environments along each sightline, strong similarities are observed in the central wavelengths and relative strengths for bands at ∼3.3, 3.4, 5.85, 6.2, and 6.85 μ m. Analysis of these bands, produced by aromatic, aliphatic, olefinic, hydrogenated, and oxygenated components, shows that carbonaceous dust is a significant component of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM), second in abundance only to silicates, and is primarily aromatic in nature. The grains producing these bands likely consist of large aromatic carbon cores with thin aliphatic mantles composed of hydrogenated amorphous carbon. Laboratory analog spectra reproduce the observed aliphatic absorption bands well, supporting the presence of such mantles.

  abstract     = {Stars with outflows interacting with ambient gas experience accelerations arising from the gravitational feedback induced by the interaction structure. In this work, three-dimensional local shearing box simulations are performed to investigate the dynamical evolution of a star with outflows embedded in the outer regions of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk. Two types of stellar wind are considered, isotropic winds and axisymmetric jets, along with variations in the radial pressure gradient profile. The results show that antifriction enables AGN stars to acquire angular momentum from the ambient gas, resulting in outward migration away from the disk center. The formation and stability of the headwind structure, which is crucial for maintaining antifriction, are sensitive to both the strength of the stellar outflow and the radial pressure gradient of the disk gas. Once the headwind structure is disrupted, the antifriction effect ceases to operate effectively. A case study is also presented, focusing on a stellar-mass black hole (sBH) in an AGN disk. It is shown that jet material launched along the z -axis is confined to the trailing side of the object’s motion by high gas inflow velocities, thereby activating antifriction and inducing outward migration. If such an sBH migrates inward initially, the interplay between inward and outward migration may trap it at an equilibrium radius, potentially facilitating the formation and merger of black hole binaries.},

  abstract     = {We present a new method for identifying Galactic halo substructures accreted from dwarf galaxies by combining metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) with orbital parameters. Using apogalactic distance–orbital phase space, we assume that the MDF peak of a substructure reflects its progenitor’s chemical signature. We test this approach with two Galactic potentials (St \ddot{a} ckel and McMillan) and find consistent results. Our sample consists of retrograde halo stars with low orbital inclinations and intermediate eccentricities (0.5 < e ≤ 0.7), drawn from Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Large sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope spectroscopy combined with Gaia DR3 astrometry. We identify four distinct low-inclination retrograde substructures (LRS 1, LRS 2, LRS 3, LRS 4) with MDF peaks at [Fe/H] = −1.5, −1.7, −1.9, and −2.1, respectively; LRS 3 is newly discovered. Further analysis reveals an additional stream (LRS 2B) with [Fe/H] = −2.3 embedded within LRS 2; the remaining LRS 2 stars (LRS 2A) are associated with Sequoia. LRS 1 is likely linked to Thamnos 2 and Arjuna, and LRS 4 is likely linked to I’itoi. Comparison with the ED-2 stream suggests that LRS 2B is chemically distinct, but high-resolution spectroscopy is required to confirm whether they originate from separate progenitors. Our MDF-based approach demonstrates the utility of chemodynamical space for uncovering halo substructures, while highlighting caveats such as metallicity gradients and redshift evolution of the mass–metallicity relation, which may blur the mapping between MDF peaks and progenitors.},

By disentangling the pulsar’s emission from its surrounding wind nebula across joint Chandra, NuSTAR, and NICER observations, we find the pulsar’s broadband X-ray spectrum (1.3–79 keV) is best-described by a broken power-law model. The model features photon indices of Γ 1 = 1.19 ± 0.07 and Γ 2 = 1.47 ± 0.02 below and above a break energy of E b = 7.7 ± 0.8 keV. The resulting unabsorbed 2–10 keV flux from the pulsar is (9.{5}_{-0.3}^{+0.4})\times 1{0}^{-12}\,{\rm{erg}}\,{{\rm{cm}}}^{-2}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1} . Furthermore, timing analysis of NICER data spanning MJD 58250 to 60630 reveals a very large glitch occurring around MJD 59300, characterized by a frequency jump of Δ ν = 29.367(7) × 10 −6 Hz, which can be well explained by the vortex creep model. Phase-resolved spectral analysis indicates a clear anticorrelation between the photon index and the pulse intensity, suggesting spectral hardening at the pulse peak.},

  abstract     = {Radiative losses play a critical role in the cooling of plasmas. When chromospheric plasma is sufficiently heated, it can flow into coronal loops, which subsequently cool down due to radiation. From observations, we infer that this cooling does not occur uniformly, often resulting in coronal condensations such as coronal rain. To date, coronal condensations have only been found in simulations of steadily heated loops, and never in impulsively heated ones. We implement spatiotemporally variable elemental abundances in a radiative hydrodynamic code. Flows, including chromospheric evaporation, directly cause a shift in the local elemental abundances, which then affects the local radiative loss rate. As a consequence, we find that incorporating spatiotemporal low first ionization potential elemental abundances into coronal loop simulations directly causes coronal condensations, which are otherwise absent in impulsively heated loop or flare models. We conclude that spatiotemporal variations in elemental abundances are a fundamental feature of the solar corona and are therefore necessary to accurately model radiation.},

  abstract     = {Together with gas, stars, and supermassive black holes, dust is crucial in stellar and galaxy evolution. Hence, understanding galaxies’ dust properties across cosmic time is critical to studying their evolution. In addition to photometric constraints on the absorption of blue light and its reemission at infrared wavelengths, dust grain properties can be explored spectroscopically via polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission bands in the mid-IR. The new SPHEREx space telescope conducts an all-sky spectrophotometric survey of stars and galaxies at wavelengths of 0.75–5 μ m, making it ideal for studying the widespread presence of the 3.3 μ m PAH emission across galaxy populations out to z ∼ 0.4. In this paper, we simulated galaxy spectra to investigate SPHEREx's capability to study PAH emission in such galaxies. We find that for the all-sky survey the PAH 3.3 μ m emission band flux can be measured to 30% accuracy at {\mathrm{log}}\,(M/{M}_{\odot })\gt 9.5 and star formation rate (SFR) > 1 M ⊙ yr −1 at z = 0.1, {\mathrm{log}}\,(M/{M}_{\odot })\gt 10.5 and SFR > 10 M ⊙ yr −1 at z = 0.2–0.3, and {\mathrm{log}}\,(M/{M}_{\odot })\gt 11 and SFR > 100 M ⊙ yr −1 at z = 0.4. For deep SPHEREx fields, a factor of ∼10 deeper sensitivity limits can be reached. Overall, SPHEREx will enable the measurement of the 3.3 μ m PAH band emission in several hundred thousand galaxies across the sky, providing a population study of the smallest dust grains (“nano grains”) and radiation properties in massive galaxies in the nearby Universe.},

This collision results in shock heating and a modified density structure for the ejecta, both of which affect the light curve. As highlighted by D. Kasen, these considerations are particularly relevant for Type Ia supernovae, as the companion is expected to be Roche-lobe filling at the time of the explosion. We simulate here the interaction between Type Ia supernova ejecta and a white dwarf donor using Athena++, finding the formation of a low-density wake extending to higher velocities than the unperturbed ejecta. Radiation hydrodynamics is then used to generate synthetic light curves for the first day after the explosion for a range of viewing angles. We find that the hot, high-velocity, shocked ejecta yield L > 10 40 erg s −1 over half the sky in the first few hours. The photosphere within the shock-heated ejecta cools and recedes in velocity space, partially obscuring it from view, as heating from radioactive nickel becomes increasingly important in driving the supernova’s luminosity. By one day after the explosion, the luminosity measured by observers looking directly into the wake is dimmer than that of a normal Type Ia supernova by 15% due to the modified density structure.},

The radio emission spatially overlaps with the X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by PSR J1640−4631 and the GeV/TeV γ -ray source HESS J1640−465. The morphology of this radio emission is centrally peaked and its extent is well contained within the SNR shell. A lack of mid- and far-infrared counterparts and the absence of cataloged H ii regions argue against a thermal origin, while the morphology and radial profile are suggestive of a PWN origin powered by PSR J1640−4631. Under this assumption, we use a one-zone, time-dependant model to reproduce the size and broadband (radio, X-ray, and γ -ray) spectral energy distribution of the PWN. The modeling and broadband properties of this PWN suggest it is currently interacting with the reverse shock within its host SNR. This evolutionary stage is associated with particles escaping the PWN and entering the interstellar medium, suggesting this object may be an important source of Galactic PeV e ± .},

To address this challenge, we explore uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on direct propagation of shallow ensembles (DPOSEs) as a computationally efficient alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we assess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across several density functional theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold dataset. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for unobserved molecule and material classes.

In this paper, we investigate the potential of MLLMs for image understanding and visual question answering (VQA) in radio astronomy. This can facilitate the use of MLLMs as AI assistants in both research and education by discerning and describing complex astronomical information in human-readable languages. However, general-purpose MLLMs show inferior performance in radio astronomy because they typically lack specialized knowledge. To bridge this gap, we construct a new VQA dataset, RadioAstroVQA, from open data repositories. Specifically, we transform data samples from different repositories into VQA examples by extracting questions based on task descriptions and observation reports associated with images and then composing their answers using ground-truth labels and captions. Furthermore, by leveraging the RadioAstroVQA dataset, we fine-tune two MLLMs of different parameter scales to specifically enhance their capacities for radio astronomical image classification and VQA tasks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show that the fine-tuned MLLMs are capable of handling multiple types of radio astronomical images and generating customized textual output tailored to specific task needs. They achieve accuracy comparable to or even better than that of existing deep learning models for classification tasks. They also demonstrate significantly better performance on VQA tasks compared to several state-of-the-art MLLMs in general domains. These results confirm the potential of MLLMs to serve as specialized AI assistants in the field of radio astronomy.},

We show that conditioning neural network-based models on trainable embedding vectors can effectively account for quantitative differences between methods. This allows for joint training on multiple datasets that would otherwise be incompatible. Therefore, this procedure circumvents the need for re-computations at a unified level of theory. Numerical experiments demonstrate that training on multiple reference methods enables transfer learning between tasks, resulting in even lower errors compared to training on separate tasks alone. Furthermore, we show that this approach can be used for multi-fidelity learning, improving data efficiency for the highest fidelity by an order of magnitude. To test scalability, we train a single model on a joint dataset compiled from ten disjoint subsets of the MultiXC-QM9 dataset generated by different reference methods. Again, we observe transfer learning effects that improve the model errors by a factor of 2 compared to training on each subset alone. We extend our investigation to machine learning force fields for material simulations. To this end, we incorporate trainable embedding vectors into the readout layer of a deep graph neural network (M3GNet) that is simultaneously trained on PBE and r2SCAN labels of the MatPES dataset. We observe that joint training on both fidelity levels reduces the amount of r2SCAN data required to achieve the accuracy of a single-fidelity model by a factor of 10.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone of neural network optimization due to its computational efficiency and generalization capabilities. However, the gradient noise introduced by SGD is often assumed to be uncorrelated over time, despite the common practice of epoch-based training where data is sampled without replacement. In this work, we challenge this assumption and investigate the effects of epoch-based noise correlations on the stationary distribution of discrete-time SGD with momentum. Our main contributions are twofold: first, we calculate the exact autocorrelation of the noise during epoch-based training under the assumption that the noise is independent of small fluctuations in the weight vector, revealing that SGD noise is inherently anti-correlated over time. Second, we explore the influence of these anti-correlations on the variance of weight fluctuations. We find that for directions with curvature of the loss greater than a hyperparameter-dependent crossover value, the conventional predictions of isotropic weight variance under stationarity, based on uncorrelated and curvature-proportional noise, are recovered. Anti-correlations have negligible effect here. However, for relatively flat directions, the weight variance is significantly reduced, leading to a considerable decrease in loss fluctuations compared to the constant weight variance assumption. Furthermore, we present a numerical experiment where training with these anti-correlations enhances test performance, suggesting that the inherent noise structure induced by epoch-based training may play a role in finding flatter minima that generalize better.},

  abstract     = {Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in tasks like synthetic data generation and detecting anomalies. Recent developments have increasingly integrated traditional machine learning techniques to boost the performance of QGANs. Motivated by this progress, we propose an innovative QGAN architecture that incorporates a classical learning component and employs a dual-generator design. Our approach improves upon the traditional hybrid quantum–classical GAN structure and introduces a redesigned loss function tailored for the new model. Experiments on multiple datasets indicate that our method surpasses previous techniques in image generation quality, achieving a 1.38% average reduction in Fréchet inception distance scores compared to the current state-of-the-art, and improvements of 6.52%, 0.36%, and 0.38% in structural similarity index, cosine similarity, and peak signal-to-noise ratio metrics, respectively. Additionally, our architecture supports the generation of larger images (up to 78\,\times\,78 ), as verified on the CelebA dataset. Simulations conducted in noisy conditions further confirm the robustness and effectiveness of both the proposed architecture and loss function.},
