  abstract     = {Abstract. Dense kernel matrices resulting from pairwise evaluations of a kernel function arise naturally in machine learning and statistics. Previous work in constructing sparse approximate inverse Cholesky factors of such matrices by minimizing Kullback–Leibler divergence recovers the Vecchia approximation for Gaussian processes. These methods rely only on the geometry of the evaluation points to construct the sparsity pattern. In this work, we instead construct the sparsity pattern by leveraging a greedy selection algorithm that maximizes mutual information with target points, conditional on all points previously selected. For selecting points out of , the naive time complexity is , but by maintaining a partial Cholesky factor we reduce this to . Furthermore, for multiple targets we achieve a time complexity of , which is maintained in the setting of aggregated Cholesky factorization where a selected point need not condition every target. We apply the selection algorithm to image classification and recovery of sparse Cholesky factors. By minimizing Kullback–Leibler divergence, we apply the algorithm to Cholesky factorization, Gaussian process regression, and preconditioning the conjugate gradient method, improving over -nearest neighbors selection.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Stochastic computational physics simulators often exist at varying fidelities, with those of higher fidelities being more physically accurate but at an increased computational cost relative to biased, low-fidelity simulators. The underlying stochasticity suggests running ensemble simulations, which may be prohibitively expensive at high fidelities. In this work we propose a functional data distribution-on-distribution bias correction model that predicts high-fidelity distributional output from a corresponding paired low-fidelity distributional output. Our model respects constraints on distribution-based functional data objects (e.g., probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions) through the use of log quantile density (LQD) functions. In particular, we specify a Gaussian process (GP) emulator on a basis decomposition of LQD discrepancies, which allows known covariates from the low-fidelity simulation to inform the bias correction model. GPs have the benefits of fast uncertainty quantification and reasonably fast training time for small to moderate amounts of training data, both desirable for the emulation of computer model output. We examine properties of our model through a comprehensive set of synthetically generated density pairs, considering various classes of discrepancies in densities (location, scale, shape, and modality). We then demonstrate the model on particle transport simulations through bifidelity representations of subsurface fracture networks.},

However, simulation-based inference methods for such implicit models, like approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), often scale poorly as data size increases. We develop a scalable inference method for implicitly defined models using a metamodel for the Monte Carlo log-likelihood estimator derived from simulations. This metamodel characterizes both statistical and simulation-based randomness in the distribution of the log-likelihood estimator across different parameter values. Our metamodel-based method quantifies uncertainty in parameter estimation in a principled manner, leveraging the local asymptotic normality of the mean function of the log-likelihood estimator. We apply this method to construct accurate confidence intervals for parameters of partially observed Markov process models where the Monte Carlo log-likelihood estimator is obtained using the bootstrap particle filter. We numerically demonstrate that our method enables accurate and highly scalable parameter inference across several examples, including a mechanistic compartment model for infectious diseases.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Bayesian physics-informed neural networks serve as important scientific machine learning methods for uncertainty quantification. Although multilayer perceptrons are commonly employed as surrogates, they often suffer from overfitting due to their large number of parameters. Kolmogorov–Arnold networks (KANs) offer an alternative solution with fewer parameters. However, gradient-based inference methods, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), may result in computational inefficiency when applied to KANs, especially for large-scale datasets, due to the high cost of back-propagation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, combining the dropout Tikhonov ensemble Kalman inversion with Chebyshev KANs. This gradient-free scheme effectively mitigates overfitting and enhances numerical stability. Additionally, we incorporate the active subspace method to reduce the parameter-space dimensionality, allowing us to improve the accuracy of predictions and obtain more reliable uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in various test cases, including scenarios with large datasets and high noise levels. Our results demonstrate that the new method achieves comparable or better accuracy and much higher efficiency as well as stability compared to HMC, in addition to scalability.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Computer models are widely used to study complex real world physical systems. However, there are major limitations to their direct use including their complex structure; large numbers of inputs and outputs; and long evaluation times. Bayesian emulators are an effective means of addressing these challenges providing fast and efficient statistical approximation for computer model outputs. It is commonly assumed that computer models behave like a “black-box” function with no knowledge of the output prior to its evaluation. This ensures that emulators are generalizable but potentially limits their accuracy compared with exploiting such knowledge of constrained or structured output behavior. We assume a “grey-box” computer model and develop a methodological toolkit for its analysis. This includes multimodel ensemble subsampling to identifying a representative model subset to reduce computational expense; constructing a targeted Bayesian design for optimization or decision support; a “divide-and-conquer” approach to emulating sums of outputs; structured emulators exploiting known constrained and structured behavior of constituent outputs through splitting the parameter space and imposing truncations; emulation of sums of time series outputs; and emulation of multimodel ensemble outputs. Combining these methods establishes a hierarchical emulation framework which achieves greater physical interpretability and more accurate emulator predictions. This research is motivated by and applied to the commercially important TNO OLYMPUS Well Control Optimization Challenge from the petroleum industry which we re-express as a decision support under uncertainty problem. We thus encourage users to examine their “black-box” simulators to achieve superior emulator accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Bayesian inference provides a powerful tool for leveraging observational data to inform model predictions and uncertainties. However, when such data are limited, Bayesian inference may not adequately constrain uncertainty without the use of highly informative priors. Common approaches for constructing informative priors typically rely on either assumptions or knowledge of the underlying physics, which is not always available. In this work, we consider the scenario where data are available on a population of assets/individuals, which occurs in many problem domains such as biomedical or digital twin applications, and leverage this population-level data to systematically constrain the Bayesian prior and subsequently improve individualized inferences. The approach proposed in this paper is based upon a recently developed technique known as data-consistent inversion (DCI) for constructing a pullback probability measure. Succinctly, we utilize DCI to build population-informed priors for subsequent Bayesian inference on individuals. While the approach is general and applies to nonlinear maps and arbitrary priors, we prove that for linear inverse problems with Gaussian priors, the population-informed prior produces an increase in the information gain as measured by the determinant and trace of the inverse posterior covariance. We also demonstrate that the Kullback–Leibler divergence often improves with high probability. Numerical results, including linear-Gaussian examples and one inspired by digital twins for additively manufactured assets, indicate that there is significant value in using these population-informed priors.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Specifying a prior distribution is an essential part of solving Bayesian inverse problems. The prior encodes a belief on the nature of the solution and this regularizes the problem. In this article we completely characterize a Gaussian prior that encodes the belief that the solution is a structured tensor that lies in a low-dimensional subspace. We define the notion of -constrained tensors and show that they describe a large variety of different structures such as Hankel, circulant, triangular, symmetric, and so on. We prove that the low-dimensional subspace defined by this prior is the right nullspace of the matrix that defines the tensor structure. We completely characterize the Gaussian probability distribution of such tensors by specifying its mean vector and covariance matrix in terms of and . Furthermore, explicit expressions are proved for the covariance matrix of tensors whose entries are invariant under a permutation. These results unlock a whole new class of priors for Bayesian inverse problems. We illustrate how new kernel functions can be designed and efficiently computed and apply our results on two particular Bayesian inverse problems: completing a Hankel matrix from a few noisy measurements and learning an image classifier of handwritten digits. The effectiveness of the proposed priors is demonstrated for both problems. All applications have been implemented as reactive Pluto notebooks in Julia.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multifidelity modeling has been steadily gaining attention as a tool to address the problem of exorbitant model evaluation costs that makes the estimation of failure probabilities a significant computational challenge for complex real-world problems, particularly when failure is a rare event. To implement multifidelity modeling, estimators that efficiently combine information from multiple models/sources are necessary. In past works, the variance reduction techniques of control variates (CV) and importance sampling (IS) have been leveraged for this task. In this paper, we present the CVIS framework—a creative take on a coupled CV and IS estimator for bifidelity reliability analysis. The framework addresses some of the practical challenges of the CV method by using an estimator for the control variate mean and sidestepping the need to estimate the covariance between the original estimator and the control variate through a clever choice for the tuning constant. The task of selecting an efficient IS distribution is also considered, with a view towards maximally leveraging the bifidelity structure and maintaining expressivity. Additionally, a diagnostic is provided that indicates both the efficiency of the algorithm as well as the relative predictive quality of the models utilized. Finally, the behavior and performance of the framework is explored through analytical and numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Fitting models to data to obtain distributions of consistent parameter values is important for uncertainty quantification, model comparison, and prediction. Standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches for fitting ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to time-series data involve proposing trial parameter sets, numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time, and accepting or rejecting the trial parameter sets. When the model dynamics depend nonlinearly on the parameters, as is generally the case, trial parameter sets are often rejected, and MCMC approaches become prohibitively computationally costly to converge. Here, we build on methods for numerical continuation and trajectory optimization to introduce an approach in which we use Langevin dynamics in the joint space of variables and parameters to sample models that satisfy constraints on the dynamics. We demonstrate the method by sampling Hopf bifurcations and limit cycles of a model of a biochemical oscillator in a Bayesian framework for parameter estimation, and we attain performance that matches or exceeds the performance of leading MCMC approaches that require numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time. We describe numerical experiments that provide insight into the speedup. The method is general and can be used in any framework for parameter estimation and model selection.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization methods such as the plain vanilla SGD method and the popular Adam optimizer are nowadays the method of choice in the training of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Despite the remarkable success of SGD methods in the ANN training in numerical simulations, it remains in essentially all practical relevant scenarios an open problem to rigorously explain why SGD methods seem to succeed to train ANNs. In particular, in most practically relevant supervised learning problems, it seems that SGD methods do with high probability not converge to global minimizers in the optimization landscape of the ANN training problem. Nevertheless, it remains an open problem of research to disprove the convergence of SGD methods to global minimizers. In this work, we solve this research problem in the situation of shallow ANNs with the rectified linear unit (ReLU) and related activations with the standard mean square error loss by disproving in the training of such ANNs that SGD methods (such as the plain vanilla SGD, the momentum SGD, the AdaGrad, the RMSprop, and the Adam optimizer) can find a global minimizer with high probability. Even stronger, we reveal in the training of such ANNs that SGD methods do with high probability fail to converge to global minimizers in the optimization landscape. The findings of this work do, however, not disprove that SGD methods succeed to train ANNs since they do not exclude the possibility that SGD methods find good local minimizers whose risk values are close to the risk values of the global minimizers. In this context, another key contribution of this work is to establish the existence of a hierarchical structure of local minimizers with distinct risk values in the optimization landscape of ANN training problems with ReLU and related activations.},

The former one serves as the pioneer in exploring new modes and passing useful information to the other, while the latter one samples the target distribution after receiving the information. We derive a mean-field limit and show how the exploration component accelerates the sampling process. Moreover, we prove exponential asymptotic convergence under mild assumption.

These novel parametric regularity results allow the application of quasi–Monte Carlo (QMC) methods to efficiently compute an a priori chosen feedback law based on the expected value. Moreover, under moderate assumptions on the input random field, QMC methods achieve superior error rates compared to ordinary Monte Carlo methods, independently of the stochastic dimension of the problem. Indeed, our paper for the first time studies Banach space–valued integration by higher-order QMC methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we develop a class of interacting particle Langevin algorithms to solve inverse problems for partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, we leverage the statistical finite element method (statFEM) formulation to obtain a finite-dimensional latent variable statistical model where the parameter is that of the (discretized) forward map and the latent variable is the statFEM solution of the PDE which is assumed to be partially observed. We then adapt a recently proposed expectation-maximization–like scheme, interacting particle Langevin algorithm (IPLA), for this problem and obtain a joint estimation procedure for the parameters and the latent variables. We consider three main examples: (i) estimating the forcing for a linear Poisson PDE, (ii) estimating diffusivity for a linear Poisson PDE, and (iii) estimating the forcing for a nonlinear Poisson PDE. We provide computational complexity estimates for forcing estimation in the linear case. We also provide comprehensive numerical experiments and preconditioning strategies that significantly improve the performance, showing that the proposed class of methods can be the choice for parameter inference in PDE models.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In statistical analysis, Monte Carlo (MC) is a classical numerical integration method. When faced with challenging sampling problems, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a commonly employed method. However, the MCMC estimator is biased after a fixed number of iterations. Unbiased MCMC, an advancement achieved through coupling techniques, addresses this bias issue in MCMC and allows us to run many short chains in parallel. Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC), known for its high order of convergence, is an alternative to MC. By incorporating the idea of QMC into MCMC, Markov chain quasi-Monte Carlo (MCQMC) effectively reduces the variance of MCMC, especially in Gibbs samplers. This work presents a novel approach that integrates unbiased MCMC with MCQMC, referred to as an unbiased MCQMC method. This method renders unbiased estimators while improving the rate of convergence significantly. Numerical experiments demonstrate that for Gibbs sampling, unbiased MCQMC with a sample size of can yield a faster root mean square error (RMSE) rate than the rate of unbiased MCMC, approaching an RMSE rate of for low-dimensional problems. Surprisingly, in a challenging problem of a 1049-dimensional Pólya Gamma Gibbs sampler, the RMSE can still be reduced by several times for moderate sample sizes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper establishes error bounds for the convergence of a piecewise linear approximation of the constrained optimal smoothing problem posed in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This problem can be reformulated as a Bayesian estimation problem involving a Gaussian process related to the kernel of the RKHS. Consequently, error bounds can be interpreted as a quantification of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no error bounds have been proposed for this type of problem so far. The convergence results are provided as a function of the grid size, the regularity of the kernel, and the distance from the kernel interpolant of the approximation to the set of constraints. Inspired by the MaxMod algorithm from recent literature, which sequentially allocates knots for the piecewise linear approximation, we conduct our analysis for nonequispaced knots. These knots are even allowed to be nondense, which impacts the definition of the optimal smoothing solution and our error bound quantifiers. Finally, we illustrate our theorems through several numerical experiments involving constraints such as boundedness and monotonicity.},

The key challenge in these estimation tasks is the polynomial growth of the condition number of the target matrices with their size. For precision estimation, our theory hinges on an intuitive local regression technique on the lattice graph which exploits the approximate sparsity implied by the screening effect.

The new algorithms retain the ease of implementation of the classical GP-UCB algorithm, but the additional random exploration step accelerates their convergence, nearly achieving the optimal convergence rate. Furthermore, to facilitate Bayesian inference with intractable likelihoods, we propose to utilize optimization iterates for maximum a posteriori estimation to build a Gaussian process surrogate model for the unnormalized log-posterior density. We provide bounds for the Hellinger distance between the true and the approximate posterior distributions in terms of the number of design points. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Bayesian optimization algorithms in nonconvex benchmark objective functions, in a machine learning hyperparameter tuning problem, and in a black-box engineering design problem.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study optimal control of partial differential equations (PDEs) under uncertainty with the state variable subject to joint chance constraints. The controls are deterministic, but the states are probabilistic due to random variables in the governing equation. Joint chance constraints ensure that the random state variable meets pointwise bounds with high probability. For linear governing PDEs and elliptically distributed random parameters, we prove existence and uniqueness results for almost-everywhere state bounds. Using the spherical-radial decomposition (SRD) of the uncertain variable, we prove that when the probability is very large or small, the resulting Monte Carlo estimator for the chance constraint probability exhibits substantially reduced variance compared to the standard Monte Carlo estimator. We further illustrate how the SRD can be leveraged to efficiently compute derivatives of the probability function, and we discuss different expansions of the uncertain variable in the governing equation. Numerical examples for linear and bilinear PDEs compare the performance of Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo sampling methods, examining probability estimation convergence as the number of samples increases. We also study how the accuracy of the probabilities depends on the truncation of the random variable expansion, and we numerically illustrate the variance reduction of the SRD.},

Although devising an efficient experimental design for simulation metamodeling can be elusive, the MLMC-based approach addresses this challenge by dynamically adjusting the number of design points and budget allocation at each level, thereby automatically creating an efficient design. Theoretical analyses show that, under mild conditions, the proposed MLMC metamodeling approach for variance function estimation can achieve superior computational efficiency compared to standard Monte Carlo metamodeling while achieving the desired level of accuracy. Additionally, this work establishes the asymptotic normality of the MLMC metamodeling estimator under certain sufficient conditions, providing valuable insights for uncertainty quantification. Finally, two MLMC metamodeling procedures are proposed for variance function estimation: one to achieve a target accuracy level and another to efficiently utilize a fixed computational budget. Numerical evaluations support the theoretical results and demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach in facilitating global sensitivity analysis.},

The main tool hereby are exponential moment estimates for the empirical covariance of the EnKBF, which may be of independent interest.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent experiments have shown that magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) can exhibit correlated insulator behavior at half-filling. Seminal theoretical results towards understanding this phase in MATBG have shown that Hartree–Fock ground states (with a positive single-particle excitation gap) can be exact many-body ground states of an idealized flat band interacting (FBI) Hamiltonian. We prove that in the absence of spin and valley degrees of freedom, the only Hartree–Fock ground states of the FBI Hamiltonian for MATBG are two ferromagnetic Slater determinants. Incorporating spin and valley degrees of freedom, we provide a complete characterization of the Hartree–Fock ground state manifold, which is generated by a hidden symmetry group acting on five elements. We also introduce new tools for ruling out translation symmetry breaking in the Hartree–Fock ground state manifold, which may be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Blind image deconvolution is a challenging, highly ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem. We introduce a Multiscale Hierarchical Decomposition Method (MHDM) that iteratively solves variational problems with adaptive data and regularization parameters, towards obtaining finer and finer details of the unknown kernel and image. We establish convergence of the residual in the noise-free data case, and then in the noisy data case when the algorithm is stopped early by means of a discrepancy principle. Fractional Sobolev norms are employed as regularizers for both kernel and image, with the advantage of computing the minimizers explicitly in a pointwise manner. In order to break the notorious symmetry occurring during each minimization step, we enforce a positivity constraint on the Fourier transform of the kernels. Numerical comparisons with a single-step variational method and a nonblind MHDM show that our approach produces comparable results, while less laborious parameter tuning is necessary at the price of more computations. Additionally, the scale decomposition of both reconstructed kernel and image provides a meaningful interpretation of the involved iteration steps.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Noise-induced transitions between multistable states happen in a multitude of systems, such as species extinction in biology, protein folding, or tipping points in climate science. Large deviation theory is the rigorous language to describe such transitions for nonequilibrium systems in the small noise limit. At its core, it requires the computation of the most likely transition pathway, solution to a PDE constrained optimization problem. Standard methods struggle to compute the minimizer in the particular coexistence of (1) multistability, i.e., coexistence of multiple long-lived states, and (2) degenerate noise, i.e., stochastic forcing acting only on a small subset of the system’s degrees of freedom. In this paper, we demonstrate how to adapt existing methods to compute the large deviation minimizer in this setting by combining ideas from optimal control, large deviation theory, and numerical optimization. We show the efficiency of the introduced method in various applications in biology, medicine, and fluid dynamics, including the transition to turbulence in subcritical pipe flow.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this article, we extend the study of embedded corrector problems, that we have previously introduced in the context of the homogenization of scalar diffusive equations, to the context of homogenized elastic properties of materials. This extension is nontrivial and requires mathematical arguments specific to the elasticity case. Starting from a linear elasticity model with highly oscillatory coefficients, we introduce several effective approximations of the homogenized tensor. These approximations are based on the solution to an embedded corrector problem, where a finite-size domain made of the linear elastic heterogeneous material is embedded in a linear elastic homogeneous infinite medium, the constant elasticity tensor of which has to be appropriately determined. The approximations we provide are proven to converge to the homogenized elasticity tensor when the size of the embedded domain tends to infinity. One of the approximations we propose is based on a self-consistent formulation, for which proving, in the general case, the existence of a solution is challenging. We show that, by restricting ourselves to a class of heterogeneous isotropic materials for which the homogenized elasticity tensor is known to be isotropic, it is possible to introduce a weaker self-consistent formulation for which both existence of a solution and convergence of that approximation to the homogenized tensor can be shown.},

Using a paraxial model of wave propagation, we show in the long-distance weak-coupling regime that the wavefields are approximately described by a complex Gaussian field whose scintillation index is unity. This provides a model of the speckle formation observed in many practical settings. The main step of the derivation consists in showing that closed-form moment equations in the Itô–Schrödinger regime are still approximately satisfied in the paraxial regime. This is done via Duhamel expansions, under the assumption that the random medium has Gaussian statistics. The rest of the proof is then an extension of results derived in [G. Bal and A.

A strongly coupled nonlinear system of a time-fractional equation and a time-fractional Hamilton–Jacobi equation is derived based on the first-order optimality condition. After changing of variables, we reformulate the nonlocal SBP as a related minimization problem constrained by a time-fractional transport equation. The corresponding cost function introduces an additional intricate term involving the time-fractional derivative compared with its classical analogue, and this reformulation again yields a coupled nonlinear system equivalent to the original system. The widely used general-proximal primal-dual hybrid gradient (G-prox PDHG) algorithm is extended to solve the nonlocal SBP, and we apply a preconditioner induced by the discretization scheme of the time-fractional model to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Numerical experiments between Gaussian distributions are performed to investigate the performance of the nonlocal SBP, which demonstrate the reliability, efficiency, and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and the multiscale feature of the nonlocal SBP.},

Thanks to our layer potential approach, we also provide a novel explanation of the conductivity matrix in Darcy’s model, of the Brinkman term in Brinkman’s model, and explain the special behavior for .

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multiscale flow in heterogeneous porous media finds application across numerous fields of science and engineering. In this work, we first review the well-known averaged-parameter and distributed microstructure modeling frameworks for simulating diffusive transport phenomena in a porous (binary) medium comprised of a connected phase surrounding disconnected inclusions. We show that while the averaged-parameter model performs well when the diffusivity ratio of the inclusion to that of the surrounding phase is large, it fails to describe the diffusive transport phenomena for small diffusivity ratios. The distributed microstructure model, on the other hand, produces a more realistic representation of the transport behavior over all diffusivity ratios. However, this class of models is computationally demanding because of the need to compute over the macroscopic and microscopic scales concurrently. By representing the integral exchange term appearing in the macroscopic averaged equation as a convolution integral with a kernel describing the fading memory effects, it is well known that the fully coupled dual-scale model reduces to a single implicit evolution equation. We explore a connection between the dual-scale modeling framework and fractional calculus through the choice of two specific kernel functions. The first is a power-law function used with good success in the modeling of subsurface hydrology, and the second is the ubiquitous Mittag-Leffler function. Both choices produce implicit evolution equations involving time-fractional operators; however, it is only the generalized Mittag-Leffler function kernel that is capable of capturing the evolution of the average concentration over the inclusion across a wide range of diffusivities for the associated microcell problem. We measure the accuracy of this new fractional model against a semianalytical solution and make comparisons with the full dual-scale model to highlight not only its predictive capability but also its superior computational performance.},

We first prove the existence and uniqueness of globally bounded weak solutions using the characteristic curves and Banach fixed point theorem after transforming the partial differential equation (PDE) into an equivalent system of integral equations. We then investigate the long-time behavior of the PDE in the case when the growth rate is separable. Applying a classical time-scaling transformation, the problem boils down to a PDE with linear growth rate and nonlinear inflow boundary condition, entering the theoretical framework of abstract semilinear Cauchy problems. We can then perform a bifurcation analysis which reveals the richness of the model behavior. Depending on the ratio of the recruitment to the growth rate, the model can exhibit multistability and stable oscillatory solutions emanating, respectively, through saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations. We illustrate these theoretical results on the biological application motivating this work, oogenesis, the process of production and maturation of female gametes (oocytes) that is critical to reproductive fitness.},

This equation exhibits two conservation laws of interest: positivity and mass conservation. This article constructs a novel sparse spectral discretization technique that conserves these invariants while simultaneously qualitatively improving spectral convergence rates. Specifically, densities are transformed into their corresponding half-densities and it is shown that the advection of these half-densities corresponds to a unitary evolution. A hyperbolic cross approximation is implemented to provide sub-exponential complexity with respect to system dimension. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated in several numerical experiments and outperforms a standard spectral scheme. The convergence rate and error bounds of the proposed approach are likewise derived.},

We use the center manifold reduction technique, which is a standard one in dynamical systems, and prove that the CL suffers bifurcations at which the one-parameter family of completely synchronized state becomes unstable and a stable two-parameter family of -humped sinusoidal shape stationary solutions appears. This contrasts the author’s recent result on the classical KM for which bifurcation behavior in its CL is very different from ones in the KM and difficult to explain by standard techniques in dynamical systems such as the center manifold reduction. Moreover, similar bifurcation behavior is shown to occur in the KM, based on the previous fundamental results. The occurrence of such bifurcations were suggested by numerical simulations for the deterministic graphs in a previous study. We also demonstrate our theoretical results by numerical simulations for the KM with the zero natural frequency.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Any autonomous nonlinear dynamical system can be viewed as a superposition of infinitely many linear processes, through the so-called Koopman mode decomposition. Its data-driven approximation, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), has been extensively developed and deployed across a plethora of fields. In this work, we study the effect of subtracting the temporal mean on the DMD approximation for observables possessing only a finite number of Koopman modes. Preprocessing time-sequential training data by removing the temporal mean has been a point of contention in the companion matrix formulation of DMD. This stems from the potential of said preprocessing to render DMD equivalent to a temporal discrete Fourier transform (DFT). We prove that this equivalence is impossible when the training data is linearly consistent and the order of the DMD model exceeds the number of Koopman modes. Since model order and training set size are synonymous in this variant of DMD, the parity of DMD and DFT can, therefore, be indicative of inadequate training data.},

Despite that, in a time-invariant framework, sensitivity analysis has been successfully employed to assess the overall effects stemming from sustained changes in species growth rates on the equilibrium values of other, indirectly related species, and its generalization to the time-varying case has remained elusive. Our accomplishments were based on two classical topics of ODEs: (i) the smoothness of solutions with respect to parameters and (ii) the properties of exponential dichotomy and admissibility, which were combined with recent advances in the theory of nonautonomous dynamical systems inspired by the new concept of nonautonomous equilibrium and its local properties. Specifically, we derive the sensitivity matrix as the solution of a nonhomogeneous linear matrix differential equation, which can be explicitly computed by using results from exponential dichotomy and admissibility. In addition, time averaging provides alternative characterizations for the sensitivity matrix in terms of the community one.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The border-collision normal form is a piecewise-linear family of continuous maps that describe the dynamics near border-collision bifurcations. Most prior studies assume each piece of the normal form is invertible, as is generic from an abstract viewpoint, but in applied problems one piece of the map often has degenerate range, corresponding to a zero determinant. This provides simplification, yet even in two dimensions the dynamics can be incredibly rich. The purpose of this paper is to determine broadly how the dynamics of the two-dimensional border-collision normal form with a zero determinant differs for different values of its parameters. We identify parameter regions of period-adding, period-incrementing, mode-locking, and component doubling of chaotic attractors, and characterize the dominant bifurcation boundaries. The intention is for the results to enable border-collision bifurcations in mathematical models to be analyzed more easily and effectively, and we illustrate this with a flu epidemic model and two stick-slip friction oscillator models. We also discuss the robustness of the dynamics and describe three novel bifurcation structures that remain to be explored.},

Our main result is of Massera type, namely we show that the existence of a bounded solution implies the existence of the global periodic attractor for the reduced dynamics. In establishing this result, a contractive property of the dynamics of our model plays a central role. We then prove sufficient conditions on the friction forces for the existence of a bounded solution, and therefore of the attractor.

Despite the lack of symmetry in a communication weight, we present a sufficient framework leading to multicluster flocking asymptotically. Our proposed framework is formulated in terms of initial data and system parameters.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular algorithm for minimizing objective functions that arise in machine learning. For constant step-sized SGD, the iterates form a Markov chain on a general state space. Focusing on a class of separable (nonconvex) objective functions, we establish a “Doeblin-type decomposition,” in that the state space decomposes into a uniformly transient set and a disjoint union of absorbing sets. Each of the absorbing sets contains a unique invariant measure, with the set of all invariant measures being the convex hull. Moreover, the set of invariant measures are shown to be global attractors to the Markov chain with a geometric convergence rate. The theory is highlighted with examples that show (1) the failure of the diffusion approximation to characterize the long-time dynamics of SGD; (2) the global minimum of an objective function may lie outside the support of the invariant measures (i.e., even if initialized at the global minimum, SGD iterates will leave); and (3) bifurcations may enable the SGD iterates to transition between two local minima. Key ingredients in the theory involve viewing the SGD dynamics as a monotone iterated function system and establishing a “splitting condition” of Dubins and Freedman [Ann. Math. Statist., 37 (1966), pp. 837–848] and Bhattacharya and Lee [Ann. Probab., 16 (1988), pp. 1333–1347].},

We show how certain everywhere-regular real rational function solutions of the KP1 equation (“multilumps”) can be constructed via the polynomial analogs of theta-functions from singular rational curves with only cuspidal singularities. The method we use can be understood in two ways: either directly or via degenerations of soliton solutions. From the second point of view, ithe method can be seen as a variation on the long-wave limit technique of Ablowitz and Satsuma, as developed by Zhang, Yang, Li, Guo, and Stepanyants. Our main explicit example is a three-lump solution constructed via the polynomial analog of the theta-function from a rational curve with two cuspidal singular points, each with semigroup ( double points). We show that there are similar six-lump solutions from a rational curve with two cusps, each with semigroup ( double points). We conjecture that these ideas will generalize to give similar -lump solutions with for starting from rational curves with two singular points with semigroup ( double points). Finally, we present a five-lump solution constructed from a rational curve with two cusps, each with semigroup . Similar solutions have been constructed previously using other methods; our contribution is to show how they arise from the algebraic-geometric setting by considering singular curves with several cusps, as in work of Agostini, Çelik, and the current author.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. For each , let denote the Kneser graph, whose vertices are labeled by -element subsets of and whose edges indicate that the corresponding subsets are disjoint. Fixing and allowing to vary, one obtains a family of nested graphs, each equipped with a natural action by a symmetric group such that these actions are compatible. Collections of graphs of this type are common in algebraic combinatorics and include families such as Johnson graphs, crown graphs, and rook graphs. In previous work [RW], the authors systematically studied families of this type using the language of representation stability and -modules. In that work, it is shown that such families of graphs exhibit a large variety of asymptotic regular behaviors. The present work applies the theory developed in [RW], later refined in [RSW], to study random walks on the graphs of such families. We show that the moments of hitting times exhibit rational function behavior asymptotically. By consequence, we conclude similar facts about the entries of the discrete Green’s functions, as considered by Chung and Yau [CY]. Finally, we illustrate how the algebro-combinatorial structure of the graphs in these families give bounds on the mixing times of random walks on those graphs. We suggest some possible directions for future study, including of the appearance (or not) of the cutoff phenomenon, originally presented by Aldous and Diaconis [AD] and Diaconis [D].},

The matching distance between persistent Betti numbers functions (or rank invariants) is among the most studied metrics in this context, particularly in 2-parameter persistence. The main reason for this interest is that, in the 2-parameter case, the foliation method allows for an effective computation of the matching distance, based on filtering the space along lines of positive slope. Our work provides a qualitative analysis, based on a construction called extended Pareto grid, of the filtering lines that contribute to the computation of the matching distance. Under certain genericity assumptions, we show that these lines must either have slope 1 or belong to a collection of special lines associated with discontinuity phenomena.},

A theory of finite presentations and resolutions is developed for modules over an arbitrary poset to parallel the theory for finitely generated modules over polynomial rings. Since the Noetherian hypothesis fails, an alternative finiteness condition is introduced: the notion of a tame -module, which captures the hypothesis that, as a family of vector spaces indexed by , the module should be constant on finitely many regions, each marked by a single vector space of finite dimension. Four characterizations of tameness are provided: the initial topological definition in terms of constant regions; a combinatorial version by poset encoding; an algebraic version by fringe presentation that combines poset analogues of free presentation and injective copresentation; and a homological version culminating in a syzygy theorem, in analogy with the Hilbert syzygy theorem for modules over polynomial rings. Data structures for tame modules are introduced using monomial matrices to serve both theoretical and computational purposes. In the context of persistent homology of filtered topological spaces, especially with multiple real parameters, monomial matrices for tame modules yield topologically interpretable data structures in terms of birth and death of homology classes.},

The main novelty is the extension of the linear sampling and factorization methods to an electrostatic problem with partial measurements. These methods so far have only mainly applied to recovering interior defects, which is a simpler problem. Another important aspect of this paper is in our numerics, where we derive a system of boundary integral equations to recover the mixed Green’s function needed for our inversion. With this, we are able to analytically and numerically solve the inverse shape problem. For the inverse parameter problem, we prove uniqueness and Lipschitz-stability (in a finite dimensional function space) assuming that one has the associated Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator on the accessible part of the boundary.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Understanding the mechanisms that drive biodiversity and ecosystem resilience in a rapidly changing world requires a deeper investigation into behavioral diversity among individuals. Consistent individual differences in behavior, often referred to as animal personality, play a crucial role in shaping ecological and evolutionary dynamics, particularly in foraging behavior. Traditional approaches in behavioral and evolutionary ecology typically focus on average behavior, neglecting the significance of individual variability. This study explores the influence of consumer personality on ecological dynamics, specifically examining how variations in food availability affect behavioral strategies and ecosystem functioning. We develop a consumer-resource model that incorporates personality-dependent saturating attack rates based on the mean-field ratio of resources to consumers. The well-posedness of the model is established, and we analyze the existence and stability of all steady-state solutions. Through bifurcation analysis, we identify critical transition parameters and describe the nonlinear phenomena induced by personality-dependent attack rates. Our findings demonstrate that boldness in consumers enhances their persistence, particularly under low levels of boldness, where populations can survive even with moderate or high food supply, which was not captured in classical frameworks.},

In this paper, a model where microscopic organisms carry out the dweller-wanderer conversion is considered; the conversion occurs at microscopic time scale and is based solely on the chemical concentrations. Cells in the dweller state are modeled with zero diffusivity, while those in the wanderer state are assigned positive diffusivity, resulting in a coupled system of an ODE and a PDE.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many scientific questions can be framed as asking for a first passage time (FPT), which generically describes the time it takes a random “searcher” to find a “target.” The important timescale in a variety of biophysical systems is the time it takes the fastest searcher(s) to find a target out of many searchers. Previous work on such fastest FPTs assumes that all searchers are initially present in the domain, which makes the problem amenable to extreme value theory. In this paper, we consider an alternative model in which searchers progressively enter the domain at a constant “immigration” rate. In the fast immigration rate limit, we determine the probability distribution and moments of the th fastest FPT. Our rigorous theory applies to many models of stochastic motion, including random walks on discrete networks and diffusion on continuous state spaces. Mathematically, our analysis involves studying the extrema of an infinite sequence of random variables which are both not independent and not identically distributed. Our results constitute a rare instance in which extreme value statistics can be determined exactly for strongly correlated random variables.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper we use singular perturbation theory to solve the 2D narrow capture problem for a set of partially accessible targets , in a bounded domain . In contrast to previous models of narrow capture, we assume that when a searcher finds a target by attaching to the partially adsorbing surface it does not have immediate access to the resources within the target interior. Instead, the searcher remains attached to the surface for a random waiting time , after which it either gains access to the resources within (surface absorption) or detaches and continues its search process (surface desorption). We also consider two distinct desorption scenarios – either the particle continues its search from the point of desorption or rapidly returns to its initial search position. In applications to animal foraging, the latter would correspond to an animal returning to its home base whereas the resources within a target could represent food or shelter. We formulate the narrow capture problem in terms of a set of renewal equations that relate the probability density and target flux densities for absorption to the corresponding quantities for irreversible adsorption. The renewal equations, which effectively sew together successive rounds of adsorption and desorption prior to the final absorption event, provide a general probabilistic framework for incorporating non-Markovian models of desorption/absorption and different search scenarios following desorption. We solve the general renewal equations in two stages. First, we calculate the Laplace transformed target fluxes for irreversible adsorption by solving a Robin boundary value problem (BVP) in the small-target limit using matched asymptotic analysis. We then use the inner solution of the BVP to solve the corresponding Laplace transformed renewal equations for non-Markovian desorption/absorption, which leads to explicit Neumann series expansions of the corresponding target fluxes. Finally, the latter are used to determine the corresponding splitting probabilities and conditional mean FPTs for absorption.},

The quadratic autocatalytic reaction, a pivotal step in many reaction systems, is closely monitored by the complexing agent, which tracks the reaction process and locates the position of the reaction front, underscoring its significance. Thus, it is interesting to study how the complexation reaction affects traveling waves in the quadratic autocatalytic system. Two critical questions on traveling waves of a system are (1) does there exist a such that a traveling wave with speed exists if and only if and (2) if such a exists, is the minimum wave speed derived from the linearization of the system at the unstable steady state? For the quadratic autocatalytic reaction system without complexation reactions, the answers to these two questions are affirmative. However, in the presence of a complexing agent, we give sufficient conditions for linear and nonlinear minimal speed selection mechanisms in different parameter regimes. Our findings reveal that the complex agent, far from being a passive observer, plays a dynamic and active role in the wave propagation of the quadratic autocatalytic reaction system, significantly impacting its behavior.},

In the present work, we develop and analyze such a model based on harmonic functions and linear diffusion. Our general problem is known to be NP-hard and that the objective function is monotone and submodular; consequently, we can greedily approximate the solution within a constant factor. Introducing and analyzing a convex relaxation, we show that the problem can be approximately solved using smooth optimization methods.

However, most functional elements of chromatin are not located at the chain ends, raising questions about analytical scaling relationships for non-end-to-end MFETs. Through the asymptotic expansion of the principal eigenvalue of the Fokker–Planck equation with absorbing boundary, we reveal a mixed scaling law between the MFET of monomer pairs deep within the polymer interior and their linear distance, and propose an approximate formula for the MFET of monomer pairs near the chain ends.

  abstract     = {Abstract. When a fluid carrying a passive solute flows quickly through porous media, three key macroscale transport mechanisms occur. These mechanisms are diffusion, advection, and dispersion, all of which depend on the microstructure of the porous medium; however, this dependence remains poorly understood. For idealized microstructures, one can use the mathematical framework of homogenization to examine this dependence, but heterogeneous materials are more challenging. Here, we consider sorption of a solute by a two-dimensional microstructure comprising an array of adsorbent obstacles of smooth but arbitrary shape, the size and spacing of which can vary along the length of the porous medium. We use homogenization via the method of multiple scales to systematically upscale a microscale problem involving nonperiodic cells of varying area to obtain effective continuum equations for macroscale transport and sorption. The equations are characterized by the local porosity, an effective local adsorption rate, and an effective local anisotropic solute diffusivity. All of these macroscale properties depend nontrivially on the two degrees of microstructural geometric freedom in our problem; obstacle size, and obstacle spacing. Further, the coefficient of effective diffusivity comprises the molecular diffusivity, the suppressive effect of the presence of obstacles, and the enhancing effect of dispersion. To illustrate the mathematical model, we focus on a simple example geometry comprising circular obstacles on a hexagonal lattice, for which we numerically determine the macroscale permeability and effective diffusivity. We find a power law for the dispersive component of solute transport, consistent with classical Taylor dispersion.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this study, we obtain the exact switching time distributions between the free and bound gene states for a detailed stochastic model of an autoregulatory feedback loop with transcription, translation, mRNA, and protein decay, as well as protein-gene interactions. The analytical solution generalizes and corrects the previous ones obtained in [P. Visco, R. J. Allen, and M. R. Evans, Phys. Rev. Lett., 101 (2008), 118104] and [Z. Cao and R. Grima, Nat. Commun., 9 (2018), 3305] for a reduced model of an autoregulatory loop that ignores the mRNA dynamics. We find that when the mRNA dynamics is modelled explicitly, the holding time in the free gene state can produce three shapes of steady-state distributions (decaying, bell-shaped, and bimodal). In particular, the detailed model with both mRNA and protein descriptions can produce a distribution shape that the reduced model fails to capture—the detailed model of a negative (positive) feedback loop can display a bimodal (bell-shaped) holding time distribution, while the reduced model cannot. Interestingly, we find that an autoregulatory loop can produce a heavy-tailed holding time distribution and the origin of this phenomenon is clarified using our analytical solution. We also investigate how the distribution shape is affected by the type of feedback, the binding and unbinding rates, and the transcription rates. Finally, based on the distribution shape, we have developed a new method of inferring autoregulation using single-cell time-trace gene expression data.},

In this work, we investigate the generalized bathtub model, a nonlocal transport equation for describing network trip flows served by privately operated vehicles inside a road network. First, we establish the well-posedness of the mathematical model for both classical and weak solutions. Then we consider an inverse source problem of the model with model parameters embodying particular traffic situations. We establish a conditional Lipschitz stability of the inverse problem under a suitable a priori regularity assumption on the problem data, using a Volterra integral formulation of the problem. Inspired by the analysis, we develop an easy-to-implement numerical method for reconstructing the flow rates, and we provide the error analysis of the method. Further we present several numerical experiments to complement the theoretical analysis.},

Similarly, the electric field produced by a dielectric nano-particle (with positive but high permittivity) is given as a polarization of the incident magnetic field. In this work, we demonstrate that a hybrid dimer—composed of two closely coupled nano-particles, one plasmonic and the other dielectric—can polarize both the incident electric and the magnetic fields. Consequently, such hybrid dimers have the potential to modify both the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the surrounding medium. However, this dual modification occurs only when the two nano-particles share common resonant frequencies. We derive the asymptotic expansion of the fields generated by these hybrid dimers in the subwavelength regime for incident frequencies near their shared resonant frequencies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We settle the complexity of computing an equilibrium in atomic splittable congestion games with player-specific affine cost functions as we show that the computation is -complete. To prove that the problem is contained in , we develop a homotopy method that traces an equilibrium for varying flow demands of the players. A key technique for this method is to describe the evolution of the equilibrium locally by a novel block Laplacian matrix where each entry of the Laplacian is a Laplacian again. Using the properties of this matrix allows us to recompute efficiently the Laplacian after the support of the equilibrium changes by matrix pivot operations. These insights give rise to a path following formulation for computing an equilibrium where states correspond to supports that are feasible for some demands and neighboring supports are feasible for increased or decreased flow demands. A closer investigation of the block Laplacian system further allows us to orient the states giving rise to unique predecessor and successor states, thus putting the problem into . For the -hardness, we reduce from computing an approximate equilibrium of a bimatrix win-lose game. As a byproduct of our reduction we further show that computing a multiclass Wardrop equilibrium with class-dependent affine cost functions is -complete as well. As another byproduct of our -completeness proof, we obtain an algorithm that computes a continuum of equilibria parametrized by the players’ flow demand. For player-specific costs, the continuum may involve several increases and decreases of the demand and yields an algorithm that runs in polynomial space. For games with player-independent costs, only demand increases are necessary, yielding an algorithm computing all equilibria as a function of the flow demand that runs in time polynomial in the output.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. One of the major open problems in complexity theory is proving superlogarithmic lower bounds on the depth of circuits (i.e., ). [Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson Super-logarithmic depth lower bounds via direct sum in communication complexity, in Proceedings of the Sixth Annual Structure in Complexity Theory Conference, IEEE Computer Society, Chicago, 1991, pp. 299–304] suggested approaching this problem by proving that the depth complexity of a composition of functions is roughly the sum of the depth complexities of and . They showed that the validity of this conjecture would imply that . The intuition that underlies the Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson (KRW) conjecture is that the composition should behave like a “direct-sum problem”, in a certain sense, and, therefore, the depth complexity of should be the sum of the individual depth complexities. Nevertheless, there are two obstacles toward turning this intuition into a proof: first, we do not know how to prove that must behave like a direct-sum problem; second, we do not know how to prove that the complexity of the latter direct-sum problem is indeed the sum of the individual complexities. In this work, we focus on the second obstacle. To this end, we study a notion called “strong composition”, which is the same as except that it is forced to behave like a direct-sum problem. We prove a variant of the KRW conjecture for strong composition, thus overcoming the above second obstacle. This result demonstrates that the first obstacle above is the crucial barrier toward resolving the KRW conjecture. Along the way, we develop some general techniques that might be of independent interest.},

Noting that the control is based on the state observations at discrete times , we see that this stabilization problem is significantly different from the classical one where the feedback control is based on continuous-time state observations. This stabilization problem was initiated by Mao in 2013 and has been intensively studied by many authors for the past ten years. In this paper, we will further develop an event-triggered control based on a trajectory of the state or output observations at discrete times. This is significantly different from most of the existing papers where an event-triggered mechanism for SDEs is designed based on a criterion in terms of the mathematical expectation of the system state. The novel approach in this paper is to relate the stability of the event-triggered controlled SDE to the stability of the corresponding uncertain SDE.},

They established criteria for fundamental system-theoretic notions such as stability, reachability, and observability through tensor decomposition. Building on this new research direction, the purpose of our paper is to extend the study to continuous-time MLTI control systems. Specifically, we define Hamiltonian tensors and symplectic tensors, and we establish the Schur-Hamiltonian tensor decomposition and the symplectic tensor singular value decomposition (SVD). Based on these concepts, we propose the algebraic Riccati tensor equation (ARTE) and demonstrate that it has a unique positive semidefinite solution if the system is stabilizable and detectable. To find numerical solutions to the ARTE, we introduce a tensor-based Newton method. Additionally, we establish the tensor versions of the bounded real lemma and the small gain theorem. A first-order robustness analysis of the ARTE is also conducted. Finally, we provide a numerical example to illustrate the proposed theory and algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The direct method and the Yau–Yau algorithm are two crucial filtering methods in nonlinear filtering problems. Recently, a series of research works [X. Luo and S.-T. Yau, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 58 (2013), pp. 2563–2578; X. Luo and S.-T. Yau, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 58 (2013), pp. 2495–2507; Z. Wang, X. Luo, S. S.-T. Yau, and Z. Zhang, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 65 (2019), pp. 1613–1624; W. Dong, X. Luo, and S. S.-T. Yau, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 66 (2021), pp. 1559–1572; S. Li, Z. Wang, S. S.-T. Yau, and Z. Zhang, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 68 (2023), pp. 4405–4412; X. Chen, J. Shi, and S. S.-T. Yau, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 64 (2019), pp. 1648–1654; J. Shi, X. Chen, W. Dong, and S. S. T. Yau, IEEE Control Systems Lett., 1 (2017), pp. 233–237] in these two methods have gained great success in nonlinear numerical experiments. Therefore, a key issue is whether a general framework of convergence analyses can be developed for these numerical algorithms based on partial differential equations. The contributions of this work consist of two parts. The first one is that we set up a convergence analysis framework for the direct method and the Yau–Yau algorithm, which can show the deep connections between these two methods. They are different formulations of solving the robust DMZ equation by reducing it to solve the Yau–Yau PDE [B. Balaji, PMC Phys. A, 3 (2009), pp. 1–28]. The second one is that we prove the explicit convergence rates of the Yau–Yau algorithm with the spectral method and the direct method with Gaussian approximation, in terms of the numbers of spectral basis and time steps.},

This paper explores discretization and its convergence rates for stochastic linear quadratic optimal control problems governed by stochastic heat equations with control-dependent noise. To achieve the optimal rates while maintaining computational performance, a mixed strategy is proposed, in combining the open-loop approach for spatial discretization with the closed-loop approach for temporal discretization. The open-loop approach is employed to achieve optimal spatial convergence rates, while the Riccati-based closed-loop approach enhances temporal convergence rates and reduces the computational complexity. Relying on this mixed strategy, the proposed algorithm, which requires solving only deterministic equations and forward stochastic heat equations, demonstrates significant advantages in both accuracy and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper presents a comprehensive study of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs) in Hilbert spaces, generalizing the classic LQ MFG theory to scenarios involving agents with dynamics governed by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, both state and control processes of each agent take values in separable Hilbert spaces. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population which appears in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. Specifically, the dynamics of each agent incorporates an infinite-dimensional noise, namely a -Wiener process, and an unbounded operator. The diffusion coefficient of each agent is stochastic involving the state, control, and average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of coupled semilinear infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations establishing the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. We then specialize to -player LQ games described above and study the asymptotic behavior as the number of agents, approaches infinity. We develop an infinite-dimensional variant of the Nash certainty equivalence principle and characterize a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting MFG. Finally, we study the connections between the -player game and the limiting MFG, demonstrating that the resulting limiting best-response strategies form an -Nash equilibrium for the -player game in Hilbert spaces. This property is established by showing that the mean field approximates the empirical average state within when agents follow these strategies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is customary to design a control system in such a way that, whatever the chosen control satisfying the constraints, the system does not enter so-called unsafe regions. This work introduces a general computer-assisted methodology to prove that a given linear control system with compact constraints avoids a chosen unsafe set at a chosen final time . Relying on support hyperplanes, we devise a functional such that the property of interest is equivalent to finding a point at which the functional is negative. Actually evaluating the functional first requires time discretization. We thus provide explicit, fine discretization estimates for various types of matrices underlying the control problem. Second, computations lead to roundoff errors, which are dealt with by means of interval arithmetic. The control of both error types then leads to rigorous, computer-assisted proofs of nonreachability of the unsafe set. We illustrate the applicability and flexibility of our method in different contexts featuring various control constraints, unsafe sets, types of matrices, and problem dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Zero-sum linear quadratic (LQ) games are fundamental in optimal control and can be used (i) as a dynamic game formulation for risk-sensitive or robust control and (ii) as a benchmark setting for multiagent reinforcement learning with two competing agents in continuous state-control spaces. In contrast to the well-studied single-agent linear quadratic regulator problem, zero-sum LQ games entail solving a challenging nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problem with an objective function that lacks coercivity. Recently, Zhang et al. [Adv. Neural Inf. Process. Syst., 34 (2021), pp. 2949–2964] showed that an -Nash equilibrium (NE) of finite-horizon zero-sum LQ games can be learned via nested model-free natural policy gradient algorithms with poly sample complexity. In this work, we propose a simpler nested zeroth-order (ZO) algorithm improving sample complexity by several orders of magnitude and guaranteeing convergence of the last iterate. Our main result is twofold: (i) in the deterministic setting, we establish the first global last-iterate linear convergence result for the nested algorithm that seeks NE of zero-sum LQ games; (ii) in the model-free setting, we establish an sample complexity using a single-point ZO estimator. For our last-iterate convergence results, our analysis leverages the implicit regularization property and a new gradient domination condition for the primal function. Our key improvements in the sample complexity rely on a more sample-efficient nested algorithm design and a finer control of the ZO natural gradient estimation error utilizing the structure endowed by the finite-horizon setting.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a new family of logit-Q dynamics for efficient learning in stochastic games by combining the log-linear learning (also known as logit dynamics) for the repeated play of normal-form games with Q-learning for unknown Markov decision processes within the auxiliary stage-game framework. In this framework, we view stochastic games as agents repeatedly playing some stage game associated with the current state of the underlying game while the agents’ Q-functions determine the payoffs of these stage games. We show that the logit-Q dynamics presented reach (near) efficient equilibrium in stochastic teams with unknown dynamics and quantify the approximation error. We also show the rationality of the logit-Q dynamics against agents following pure stationary strategies. The key idea is to approximate the dynamics with a fictional scenario where the Q-function estimates are stationary over epochs whose lengths grow at a sufficiently slow rate. We then couple the dynamics in the main and fictional scenarios to show that these two scenarios become more and more similar across epochs due to the vanishing step size and growing epoch lengths.},

These results pave the way for Monte Carlo methods to stochastic optimal control for generic target functionals and dynamics.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Switching among affine systems under dwell-time constraints in order to steer the state as close as possible to a desired point involves the consideration of a nontrivial region into which the state is eventually driven and maintained. Suitable regions for this aim have the following property: For every point within the region, a switching law satisfying the dwell-time constraint exists so that the trajectory beginning at that point remains within the region for all future times. This paper focuses on addressing and characterizing the latter property, which is here called switching-controlled invariance (SCI) with dwell time, through a convexity-based approach. It is shown that SCI of a set is equivalent to the existence of some cover of , where each subset in the cover can be selected to share specific properties of : convexity, closedness, boundedness, and, most important, polytopic structure. Our theoretically most important result is to establish that if an SCI with dwell time set is a (closed and convex) polytope and the switched affine system has subsystems, then can be covered by subpolytopes so that the state trajectories beginning within each subpolytope are kept within during at least one dwell time without switching. This result is highly nontrivial, is not true for other geometric structures such as ellipsoids, and further motivates the consideration of polytopic sets in the control of switched affine systems with dwell time.},

Motivated by the concepts of volumetric controllability score (VCS) and average energy controllability score (AECS) proposed for linear time-invariant systems, we consider the generalization of such concepts to switched linear systems in this paper. The key step of the generalization is to build a similar link between the controllability scores and the optimization objects as in the time-invariant case. Through the link, two families of convex optimization problems, corresponding to the concepts of generalized VCS (GVCS) and generalized AECS (GAECS), respectively, are proposed. Then, we show the uniqueness of the solutions to these problems. These unique solutions are exactly the finite-time controllability scores we want, which provide a quantitative measure of the importance of each state node on controllability during each switching interval. Besides, an algorithm is provided to calculate the GVCS and GAECS based on the projected gradient method. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the generalized scores to evaluate the importance of each state node on controllability under a switched network structure.},

Applying the decoupling method and the heat kernel estimates for parabolic equations, we show that the value function is a viscosity solution to an appropriate HJB equation on the Wasserstein space, where the characterization of absolutely continuous curves on the Wasserstein space by the continuity equations plays an important role. To establish the uniqueness of the viscosity solution, we generalize the construction of a distance-like function initiated in Burzoni et al. [SIAM J.

In this work, we study the case of two-rowed set-valued SYT with a fixed number of entries. These tableaux are a new combinatorial model for the Catalan, Narayana, and Kreweras numbers and can be shown to be in correspondence with both 321-avoiding permutations and a certain class of bicolored Motzkin paths.

In this paper, by characterizing the singular values and singular vectors of the corresponding incidence matrix through group algebras, we prove a bound on the number of incidences between points and varieties of a certain form over finite fields. Our result leads to a new incidence bound for points and flats in finite geometries, which improves previous results for certain parameter regimes.

Our approach employs a singular value decomposition of the incidence matrix between points and polynomials and an analysis of the related group algebras. This bound is then applied to coding theory, specifically to the problem of average-radius list decoding of Reed–Solomon (RS) codes. We demonstrate that RS codes of certain lengths are average-radius list-decodable with a constant list size that depends only on the code rate and the distance from the Johnson radius. While a constant list size for list-decoding of RS codes in this regime was previously established, its existence for the stronger notion of average-radius list-decoding was not known to exist.},

This paper studies an optimal dividend problem for a company that aims to maximize the mean-variance (MV) objective of the accumulated discounted dividend payments up to its ruin time. The MV objective involves an integral form over a random horizon that depends endogenously on the company’s dividend strategy, and these features lead to a novel time-inconsistent control problem. To address the time inconsistency, we seek a time-consistent equilibrium dividend rate strategy. We first develop and prove a new verification lemma that characterizes the value function and equilibrium strategy by an extended Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman system. Next, we apply the verification lemma to obtain the equilibrium strategy and show that it is a barrier strategy for small levels of risk aversion.},

Using large deviations theory methods, the asymptotics for the OTM options are expressed as a rate function which is represented as a two-dimensional variational problem. We develop a novel expansion method for the variational problem by expanding the rate function around the ATM point. In particular, we derive series expansions in log-moneyness for the solution of this variational problem around the ATM point and obtain explicit results for the first three terms. We give the ATM volatility level, skew, and convexity of the implied volatility of an Asian option in a general local-stochastic volatility model, which can be used as an approximation for pricing Asian options with strikes sufficiently close to the ATM point. Using numerical simulations in the SABR, Heston, and an LSV model with bounded local volatility, we show good performance of the asymptotic result for Asian options with sufficiently small maturity.},

We consider two compliance frameworks: one based on an emission trading system (ETS) mechanism and the other relying only on abatement efforts. The shocks in the economy are spanned by a multivariate Brownian motion, and the companies’ emissions are modeled as general diffusions. Firms must match their projected emission imbalance with their reduction effort at the compliance date in both frameworks. Under the ETS program, to do so firms can both abate and trade carbon permits in the ETS permits exchange. Existence and uniqueness of the optimal abatement and trade, together with the equilibrium carbon price, are proven under mild necessary and sufficient conditions. The optimizers and the carbon price are explicit, and their analytic expressions provide an instance of classic economic principles. Numerical examples illustrate the flexibility of the model in the study of the effect of significant allocation policies. Under the net-zero framework, firms can only rely on abatement, which is also provided in closed-form.},

Such problems are typically computationally challenging due to the martingale constraint; however, by extending the state space we can identify them with problems that exhibit a certain sequential martingale structure. Our method exploits such structures in combination with entropic regularization, enabling fast computation of optimal solutions and allowing us to solve problems with a large number of marginals. We demonstrate the method by using it for computing robust price bounds for different options, such as lookback options and Asian options.},

It employs the sparse Hermite polynomial expansion as a surrogate model for the continuation value function, and essentially exploits the fast evaluation of gradients. The expansion coefficients are computed by solving a linear least squares problem that is enhanced by gradient information of simulated paths. We analyze the convergence of the proposed method, and establish an error estimate in terms of the best approximation error in the weighted space, the statistical error of solving discrete least squares problems, and the time step size. We present comprehensive numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art least squares Monte Carlo method with more accurate price, Greeks, and optimal exercise strategies in high dimensions but with nearly identical computational cost, and it can deliver comparable results with recent neural-network-based methods up to dimension 100.},

This paper investigates the optimal retirement decision, investment, and consumption strategies in a market with jump diffusion, taking into account habit persistence and stock-wage correlation. Our analysis considers multiple stocks and a finite time framework, intending to determine the retirement boundary of the “wealth-habit-wage” triplet . To achieve this, we use the habit reduction method and a duality approach to obtain the retirement boundary of the primal variables and feedback forms of optimal strategies. When dealing with the dual problem, we address technical challenges in the proof of integral equation characterization of optimal retirement boundary using a version of It’s formula. Our results show that when the so-called de facto wealth exceeds a critical proportion of wage, an immediate retirement is the optimal choice for the agent. Additionally, we find that the introduction of jump risks allows for the possibility of discontinuous investment strategies within the working region, which is a novel and insightful finding. Our numerical results effectively illustrate these findings by varying the parameters.},

The aim of this work is to propose an extension of the deep solver by Han, Jentzen, and E (2018) to the case of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) with jumps. As in the aforementioned solver, starting from a discretized version of the FBSDE and parametrizing the (high-dimensional) control processes by means of a family of artificial neural networks (ANNs), the FBSDE is viewed as a model-based reinforcement learning problem, and the ANN parameters are fitted so as to minimize a prescribed loss function. We take into account both finite and infinite jump activity by introducing, in the latter case, an approximation with finitely many jumps of the forward process. We successfully apply our algorithm to option pricing problems in low and high dimensions and discuss the applicability in the context of counterparty credit risk.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We extend the discrete-time construction of [J. Guyon, Risk, April (2020)] and explain how to build a continuous-time stochastic volatility (SV) model which jointly and exactly calibrates S&P 500 (SPX) smiles, VIX futures, and VIX smiles at discrete dates, via minimum-entropy. The Schrödinger problem approach of [J. Guyon, Risk, April (2020)] is now formulated in continuous time: among all the (arbitrage-free) jointly calibrated semimartingale models, we aim to build the one that minimizes the relative entropy with respect to a reference SV model. This naturally leads to dispersion-constrained martingale Schrödinger bridges, a new type of Schrödinger bridges which is constrained by the martingality of the SPX and by the prices of VIX derivatives. A dual problem is derived heuristically and gives rise to a candidate model, which is then jointly calibrated provided a number of conditions are met. The dual problem consists of solving Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman PDEs and maximizing a concave functional of those solutions over SPX and VIX payoffs. The candidate model is identical to the reference model, but for an extra drift in the SV which explicitly depends on the solution to the dual HJB PDE. Focusing on the practical case where we calibrate to a finite number of vanilla options, we show that the gradient of the dual functional simply reads as the difference between model and market prices and is therefore easily computed using classical finite difference methods, such as the alternating-direction implicit scheme. The dual maximization is then performed by classical least squares techniques and is shown to yield a jointly calibrated model. Interestingly, the extra drift in SV is path-dependent in both the SPX and the instantaneous volatility. Numerical results on model-generated data illustrate the accuracy of the method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a fully explicit and empirically sound option pricing model based on additive processes. The model yields analytic closed formulae for pricing vanilla options, is easy to calibrate and simulate, and it fits very well the market implied volatility at an extremely low computational cost. The explicit expressions for commonly traded products imply that both large and small maturity leading orders of the implied volatility level and skew—as well as large strike asymptotics—can be determined exactly. A plethora of implied volatility shapes can thus be reproduced by just supplying appropriate term functions, leading to nearly complete control of the implied volatility surface. The methodological implication of our study is that, in contrast to widespread belief, realistic continuous-time models allowing explicit option pricing do exist. We finally argue that explicit additive models need not be only of the proposed Beta type, but by taking into account skew generation mechanisms, analyticity of vanilla prices can be potentially determined by other kinds of distributions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Image restoration is critical across many fields, as it addresses the challenge of recovering clear images from degraded data. Two prominent approaches to this problem are wavelet-based methods and partial differential equation (PDE) models. Wavelet methods can be viewed as discrete analogs of PDE models, and through asymptotic analysis, wavelet models often converge to PDE-based approaches such as the total variation model. Wavelet methods are known for their simple implementation and multiscale time-frequency analysis, while PDE models provide a geometric interpretation of image structures, particularly edges. The relationship between these two approaches offers a comprehensive framework for image restoration. This paper designs a wavelet frame-based image restoration model, focusing on enhancing edge preservation and regularity. More importantly, we establish a connection to the version of the Mumford–Shah model, showing that the wavelet model converges to this variational model. This connection is significant, as it combines the geometric explanation of edges in the Mumford–Shah model with the simplicity of wavelet-based implementation. The primary contribution of this paper lies in the asymptotic analysis and proof of convergence of the two-scale wavelet model to the Mumford–Shah model, providing both theoretical insights and practical wavelet models for image restoration with enhanced edge detection.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the task of image reconstruction while simultaneously decomposing the reconstructed image into components with different features. A commonly used tool for this is a variational approach with an infimal convolution of appropriate functions as a regularizer. Especially for noise corrupted observations, incorporating these functionals into the classical method of Bregman iterations provides a robust method for obtaining an overall good approximation of the true image by stopping the iteration early according to a discrepancy principle. However, crucially, the quality of the separate components depends further on the proper choice of the regularization weights associated with the infimally convoluted functionals. Here, we propose the method of Nested Bregman iterations to improve a decomposition in a structured way. This allows for the transformation of the task of choosing the weights into the problem of stopping the iteration according to a meaningful criterion based on normalized cross-correlation. We discuss the well-definedness and the convergence behavior of the proposed method and illustrate its strength numerically with various image decomposition tasks employing infimal convolution functionals.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The multimodal variational autoencoder (VAE) is a probabilistic latent variable model for modeling the generative process of multiple modalities. Existing multimodal VAEs typically divide the latent variable into two types of variables, aiming to represent shared information across modalities and specific information for each modality. However, previous models lack a mechanism to ensure the disentanglement of these two latent variables, causing degraded generation coherence and quality. Failing in disentanglement hampers their performances, particularly concerning the unconditional coherence metric. Further, since these models are derived from VAE, they inherently struggle to generate high-quality samples. In this work, a new probabilistic latent variable model, named multimodal VAE with mixture-of-distributions prior (MVP), is proposed to address these issues. A mixture of conditional distributions is used as priors for the two latent variables separately, while each mixture component is conditioned on learnable pseudoinputs. These pseudoinputs function as prototypes for modal-specific information, which are parameters of the prior for modal-specific latent variables. Experiments conducted on the PolyMNIST and Tri-modal Fashion-MNIST datasets show that MVP outperforms all previous models in terms of generation coherence and quality. Furthermore, experiments confirm that MVP achieves better disentanglement between the two latent variables than that of other existing methods. An implementation of the MVP model is available at https://github.com/fan222/MVP_multimodal-vae-with-mixture-of-prior.},

However, traditional segmentation models primarily focus on the visual attributes of the image, often neglecting the topological properties of the target objects. This limitation can lead to segmentation results that deviate from the ground truth, particularly in images with complex topological structures. In this paper, we introduce a connected-component preserving constraint into the iterative convolution-thresholding method (ICTM), resulting in the connected-component preserving ICTM (CP-ICTM). Extensive experiments demonstrate that, by explicitly preserving the topological properties of target objects—such as connectivity—the proposed algorithm achieves enhanced accuracy and robustness, particularly in images with intricate structures or noise.},

We tackle this using a Krylov subspace approach, with a nonequispaced fast Fourier transform utilized to approximate matrix–vector products in a matrix–free manner. We accelerate the algorithm using a novel change–of–basis approach to account for the (known) smallest eigenvalue–eigenvector pair of the matrices involved, coupled with a simple but frequently very effective diagonal preconditioning approach. We present a number of theoretical results concerning the eigenvalues and predicted convergence behavior and a range of numerical experiments which validate our solvers and use them to tackle parameter learning problems.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Image restoration tasks often admit a wide range of solutions that are equally consistent with the observed data. Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for the robust interpretation of restored images and their reliable use in science and decision-making. We consider the classification of images reconstructed from noisy and corrupted measurements, with special attention to the quantification of uncertainty in the delivered classification results. We address this problem by constructing a Bayesian statistical approach that combines learning-based image priors and image classifiers with explicit image observation models specified during inference. Following the manifold hypothesis, we assume that the image prior is supported on a submanifold of the ambient space—which we learn from uncorrupted training data using a variational autoencoder—and use as a classifier a support vector machine operating in this low-dimensional representation. The observation model is incorporated during inference time through its likelihood function. Bayesian computation is then efficiently performed by leveraging variants of the unadjusted Langevin algorithm that operate directly on the submanifold and are robust to multimodality. This results in a robust image classification method that provides uncertainty estimates that are provably well-posed, derived from Bayesian decision theory rigorously and transparently, and which incorporate physical and instrumental aspects of the data acquisition process through Bayes’ theorem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through experiments on the MNIST and CelebA datasets, where we achieve accurate uncertainty estimates, as measured by the expected calibration error, even in challenging image restoration problems with significant inherent uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Deep learning-based image denoising models demonstrate remarkable performance, but their lack of robustness analysis remains a significant concern. A major issue is that these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, where small, carefully crafted perturbations to input data can cause them to fail. Surprisingly, perturbations specifically crafted for one model can easily transfer across various models, including convolutional neural networks, transformers, unfolding models, and plug-and-play models, leading to failures in those models as well. Such high adversarial transferability is not observed in classification models. We analyze the possible underlying reasons behind the high adversarial transferability through a series of hypotheses and validation experiments. By characterizing the manifolds of Gaussian noise and adversarial perturbations using the concept of a typical set and the asymptotic equipartition property, we prove that adversarial samples deviate slightly from the typical set of the original input distribution, causing the models to fail. Based on these insights, we propose a novel adversarial defense method: the out-of-distribution typical set sampling (TSS) training strategy. TSS training strategy not only significantly enhances the model’s robustness but also marginally improves denoising performance compared to the original model.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Image vectorization converts raster images into vector graphics composed of regions separated by curves. Typical vectorization methods first define the regions by grouping similar colored regions by color quantization, then approximate their boundaries by Bézier curves. In that way, the raster input is converted into an SVG format parameterizing the regions’ colors and the Bézier control points. This compact representation has many graphical applications thanks to its universality and resolution-independence. In this paper, we remark that image vectorization is nothing but an image segmentation, and that it can be built by fine to coarse region merging. Our analysis of the problem leads us to propose a vectorization method that alternates region merging and curve smoothing. We formalize the method by alternate operations on the dual and primal graph induced by any domain partition. In that way, we address a limitation of current vectorization methods, which separate the update of regional information from curve approximation. We formalize region merging methods by associating them with various gain functionals, including the classic Beaulieu–Goldberg and Mumford–Shah functionals. More generally, we introduce and compare region merging criteria that involve the number of regions, the scale, the area, and the internal standard deviation of each region. We also show that the curve smoothing, implicit in all vectorization methods, can be performed by the shape-preserving affine scale-space. We extend this flow to a network of curves and give a sufficient condition for the topological preservation of the segmentation. The general vectorization method that follows from this analysis shows explainable behaviors, explicitly controlled by a few intuitive parameters. It is experimentally compared to state-of-the-art software and proved to have comparable or superior fidelity and cost efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) refers to the recovery of three-dimensional data cubes, such as videos or hyperspectral images, from their two-dimensional projections, which are generated by a special encoding of the data with a mask. SCI systems commonly use binary-valued masks that follow certain physical constraints. Optimizing these masks subject to these constraints is expected to improve system performance. While prior theoretical analysis of SCI systems has primarily focused on independent and identically distributed Gaussian masks, recent empirical, data-driven mask optimizations yield structured and sometimes interpretable patterns. However, such empirical optimizations typically involve computationally intensive joint procedures that are expected to be suboptimal due to the nonconvexity and complexity of the optimization. In this paper, we analytically characterize the performance of SCI systems employing binary masks and leverage our analysis to optimize hardware parameters. Our findings provide a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of the role of binary masks, with both independent and dependent elements, and their optimization. We also present simulation results that confirm our theoretical findings and further illuminate different aspects of mask design.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work introduces a method for preprocessing measurements of electrical impedance tomography to considerably reduce the effect uncertainties in the electrode contacts have on the reconstruction quality, without a need to explicitly estimate the contacts. The idea is to compute the Jacobian matrix of the forward map with respect to the contact strengths and project the electrode measurements and the forward map onto the orthogonal complement of the range of this Jacobian. Using the smoothened complete electrode model as the forward model, it is demonstrated that inverting the resulting projected equation with respect to only the internal conductivity of the examined body results in good quality reconstructions both when resorting to a single step linearization with a smoothness prior and when combining lagged diffusivity iteration with total variation regularization. The quality of the reconstructions is further improved if the range of the employed projection is also orthogonal to that of the Jacobian with respect to the electrode positions. These results hold even if the projections are formed at internal and contact conductivities that significantly differ from the true ones; it is numerically demonstrated that the orthogonal complement of the range of the contact Jacobian is almost independent of the conductivity parameters at which it is evaluated. In particular, our observations introduce a numerical technique for inferring whether a change in the electrode measurements is caused by a change in the internal conductivity or alterations in the electrode contacts, which has potential applications, e.g., in bedside monitoring of stroke patients. The ideas are tested both on simulated data and on real-world water tank measurements with adjustable contact resistances.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the imaging of cosmic strings by using cosmic microwave background data. Mathematically, we study the inversion of an X-ray transform in Lorentzian geometry, called the light ray transform. The inverse problem is highly ill-posed, with additional complexities of being large-scale and dynamic, with unknown parameters that represent multidimensional objects. This presents significant computational challenges for the numerical reconstruction of images that have high spatial and temporal resolution. In this paper, we begin with a microlocal stability analysis for inverting the light ray transform using the Landweber iteration. Next, we discretize the spatiotemporal object and light ray transform and consider iterative computational methods for solving the resulting inverse problem. We provide a numerical investigation and comparison of some advanced iterative methods for regularization including Tikhonov and sparsity-promoting regularizers for various example scalar functions with conormal-type singularities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Automatic anomaly detection (AD) in a series of images of industrial parts is a key component of industrial production and an exemplary problem for machine learning. Since it can only realistically function with minimal supervision, unsupervised methods dominate the field. Their principle is that the “normal aspect” of objects is learned from recently observed samples, so that anomalies can be detected as outliers. In this paper, we start by reviewing recent AD methods and their performance-based ranking on recent benchmark datasets. The recent progress of such methods is such that they learn from a few hundred normal samples only. However, we argue that the current method evaluation based on static datasets is limited and biased. Indeed, a main feature of industrial production is that the aspect of objects evolves over time, due to changes in production and acquisition conditions, thus leading to significant probability distribution shifts. By introducing artificial but realistic deviations into the classic MVTec benchmark we show that the smallest deviation is sufficient to make these stationary models collapse. We argue that some of these models, especially the stochastic ones, can be easily adapted to cope with distribution shifts. The Global-to-Local Anomaly Detector (GLAD) is such an example of a method that uses Gaussian Mixture Models to model the distribution of regular objects. Using the stochastic approximation of expectation maximization, we design Online-GLAD, an improved GLAD that can update and adapt online. In the experiments, we show that Online-GLAD is able to maintain good performance even in the presence of multiple progressive deviations, and with constant complexity compatible with real-time implementation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a variational regularization approach based on a multiscale representation called cylindrical shearlets aimed at dynamic imaging problems, especially dynamic tomography. The intuitive idea of our approach is to integrate a sequence of separable static problems in the mismatch term of the cost function, while the regularization term handles the nonstationary target as a spatio-temporal object. This approach is motivated by the fact that cylindrical shearlets provide (nearly) optimally sparse approximations on an idealized class of functions modeling spatio-temportal data and the numerical observation that they provide highly sparse approximations even for more general spatio-temporal image sequences found in dynamic tomography applications. To formulate our regularization model, we introduce cylindrical shearlet smoothness spaces, which are instrumental for defining suitable embeddings in functional spaces. We prove that the proposed regularization strategy is well-defined, and the minimization problem has a unique solution (for ). Furthermore, we provide convergence rates (in terms of the symmetric Bregman distance) under deterministic and random noise conditions, within the context of statistical inverse learning. We numerically validate our theoretical results using both simulated and measured dynamic tomography data, showing that our approach leads to an efficient and robust reconstruction strategy.},

In different regions of the -parameter plane, maximality is conjectured for the ball, the vertices of a regular simplex, or the endpoints of an interval. These cases are separated by a symmetry-breaking transition region where the shape of maximizers remains unclear. On the boundary of -parameter space, one encounters existing theorems and conjectures, including Watanabe’s theorem minimizing Riesz capacity for given volume, the classical isodiametric theorem that maximizes volume for given diameter, Szegő’s isodiametric theorem maximizing Newtonian capacity for given diameter, and the still-open isodiametric conjecture for Riesz capacity. The first quadrant of parameter space contains Pólya and Szegő’s conjecture on maximizing Newtonian over logarithmic capacity for planar sets. The maximal shape for each of these scenarios is known or conjectured to be the ball. Maximizers are quite different in the third quadrant where and are both negative. On the outer boundary of the quadrant, where one of or equals and the other is suitably negative, maximality is proved to occur when consists of the endpoints of an interval or else the vertices of a regular simplex. Considerably stronger results are shown in dimensions 1 and 2, where intervals, endpoints of intervals, and vertices of equilateral triangles provide the maximizers in large regions of the third quadrant.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Motivated by recent interest in elastic problems in which the target space is non-Euclidean, we study a limit where local rest distances within an elastic body are incompatible, yet close to, distances within the ambient space. Specifically, we obtain, via -convergence, a limit elastic model for a sequence of elastic bodies in an ambient space , for Riemannian metrics and such that . Furthermore, we relate the minimum of the limit problem to a linearized curvature discrepancy between and , using recent results of Kupferman and Leder [Forum Math. Sigma, 13 (2025), e51]. This relation confirms a linearized version of a long-standing conjecture in elasticity regarding the relation between the elastic energy and the curvature of the underlying space. The main technical challenge, compared to other linearization results in elasticity, is obtaining the correct notion of displacement for manifold-valued configurations, using Sobolev truncations and parallel transport. We show that the associated compactness result is obtained if satisfies a quantitative rigidity property, analogous to the Friesecke–James–Müller rigidity estimate in Euclidean space, and show that this property holds when is a round sphere.},

We prove exponential instability properties for the fractional Calderón problem and the conductivity formulation of the fractional Calderón problem in the regime of fractional powers . We particularly focus on two settings: First, we discuss instability properties in general domain geometries with scaling critical potentials and constant background metrics. Second, we investigate instability properties in general geometries with potentials and low regularity, variable coefficient, possibly anisotropic background metrics. In both settings, we make use of the methods introduced in Koch, Rüland, and Salo [Ars Inveniendi Anal., (2021), 7], and we deduce strong compression estimates for the forward problem. In the first setting, this is based on analytic smoothing estimates for a suitable comparison operator, while in the second setting, involving low regularity metrics, this is based on an iterated compression gain. We thus generalize the results from Rüland and Salo [Inverse Problems, 34 (2018), 045003] to generic geometries and variable coefficients and also further discuss the setting of fractional conductivity equations. In particular, this proves that the logarithmic stability estimates for the fractional Calderón problem from Rüland and Salo [Nonlinear Anal., 193 (2020), 111529] are optimal.},

For any weakly interacting particle system with bounded kernel, we give uniform-in-time estimates of the norm of correlation functions, provided that the diffusion coefficient is large enough. When the condition on the kernels is more restrictive, we can remove the dependence of the lower bound for diffusion coefficient on the initial data and estimate the size of chaos in a weaker sense. Based on these estimates, we also obtain results on fluctuation of the empirical measure.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, a reaction-diffusion system modeling tumor invasion is investigated. The model is proposed by renowned biologist and cancer expert Gatenby and his collaborator [R. A. Gatenby and E. T. Gawlinski, Cancer Res., 56 (1996), pp. 5745–5753]. The underlying partial differential equation system has cross-diffusion and density-dependent degenerate diffusion coefficient and involves the interactions of three quantities: tumor tissue density, acid concentration, and normal tissue density. The most challenging and interesting issue for the analysis of the current model is the existence of the traveling wave solution which signifies the invasion of tumor tissue into normal tissue. Because the diffusion of tumor tissue is influenced by the density of normal cells (cross-diffusion) and the diffusion coefficient is zero when normal cells are at the carrying capacity, this causes the diffusion coefficient of tumor tissue to be degenerate, a hallmark of the underlying partial differential equation (PDE) system. A rigorous proof of existence of traveling wave is proved for one-dimensional case.},

The fluid flow is described by quasi-static Stokes equations, and for the elastic solid, we consider linear elasticity equations, and both are coupled via continuity of the velocities and the normal stresses. The aim is to pass to the limit in the weak microscopic formulation by using multiscale techniques adapted to the simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction in continuum mechanics. The macroscopic limit model is given by a coupled Biot plate system consisting of a generalized Darcy law coupled to a Kirchhoff–Love-type plate equation including the Darcy pressure.},

We study second-order MFG PDI with convex, Lipschitz continuous, but possibly nondifferentiable, Hamiltonians, and their approximation by systems of classical MFG PDE with regularized Hamiltonians. Under very broad conditions on the problem data, we show that, up to subsequences, the solutions of the regularized problems converge to solutions of the MFG PDI. In particular, we show the convergence of the value functions in the -norm and of the densities in -norms. Under stronger hypotheses on the problem data, we also show rates of convergence between the solutions of the original and regularized problems, without requiring any higher regularity of the solutions. We give concrete examples that demonstrate the sharpness of several aspects of the analysis.},

We study formally determined inverse problems with passive measurements for one dimensional (1D) evolution equations where the goal is to simultaneously determine both the initial data as well as the variable coefficients in such an equation from the measurement of its solution at a fixed spatial point for a certain amount of time. This can be considered as a 1D model of widely open inverse problems in photo-acoustic and thermo-acoustic tomography. We provide global uniqueness results for wave and heat equations stated on bounded or unbounded spatial intervals. Contrary to all previous related results on the subject, we do not impose any genericity assumptions on the coefficients or initial data. Our proofs are based on creating suitable links to the well understood spectral theory for 1D Schrödinger operators. In particular, in the more challenging case of a bounded spatial domain, our proof for the inverse problem partly relies on the following two key ingredients, namely (i) Paley–Wiener type theorems due to Kahane [Annales de l’Institut Fourier, 7 (1957), pp. 293–314] and Remling [J. Funct. Anal., 196 (2002), pp. 323–394] that together provide a quantifiable link between support of a compactly supported function and the upper density of its vanishing Schrödinger spectral modes and (ii) a result of Gesztesy and Simon [Trans.

New developments of optical trapping techniques make it possible to confine atoms independently of their spin orientation in experiments and thus result in spinor condensates. As a continuation of our previous work [M. Li, X. Luo, J. Wei, and M. Zhen, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 56 (2024), pp. 4375–4414], we investigate physical states as well as qualitative properties describing the aggregation and extinction of atoms, of spin-1 Bose–Einstein condensate in an Ioffe–Pritchard magnetic field, through two conserved quantities, the number of atoms and the total magnetization. Unlike the related free case which is well studied in [Y. Z. Kong, Q. X. Wang, and D. Zhao, Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations, 60 (2021), 152] and our previous work, the presence of the Ioffe–Pritchard magnetic field, which competes dramatically with the harmonic trapping, requires new ideas to capture the physical states and analyze their qualitative properties.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multiphase poromechanics describes the evolution of multiphase flow in deformable porous media. Mathematical models for such multiphysics systems are inherently nonlinear, potentially degenerate, and fully coupled systems of partial differential equations. In this work, we present a thermodynamically consistent multiphase poromechanics model falling into the category of Biot equations and obeying a generalized gradient flow structure. It involves capillarity effects, degenerate relative permeabilities, and gravity effects. In addition to established models, it introduces a Lagrange multiplier associated to a bound constraint on the effective porosity in particular ensuring its positivity. We establish existence of global weak solutions under the assumption of a weak coupling strength, implicitly utilizing the gradient flow structure, as well as a twofold regularization, first, relaxing the porosity constraint to provide strong monotonicity of the underlying energy, and second, adding coercivity by mitigating the degeneracy in the relative permeability through uniform positivity. This finally enables a Faedo–Galerkin approach and compactness arguments including vanishing regularization. This comprises the first global existence result for multiphase poromechanics accounting for degeneracies that are consistent with the multiphase nature of the flow.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Plasma sheaths are inhomogeneous stationary states that form when a plasma is in contact with an absorbing wall. We prove linear and nonlinear stability of a kinetic sheath stationary state for a Vlasov–Poisson-type system in a bounded interval. Notably, in the linear setting, we obtain exponential decay of the fluctuation, provided the rate of injection of particles at equilibrium is smaller than the rate of absorption at the wall. In the nonlinear setting, we prove a similar result for a small enough equilibrium and a small localized perturbation of the equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The hard phase model describes a relativistic barotropic fluid with sound speed equal to the speed of light. In the framework of general relativity, the motion of the fluid is coupled to the Einstein equations which describe the structure of the underlying spacetime. This model with free boundary admits a 1-parameter family of steady states with spherical symmetry. In this work, for perturbations within spherical symmetry, we study the stability and instability of this family. We prove that the linearized operator around steady states with large central densities admits a growing mode, while such growing modes do not exist for steady states with small central densities. Based on the linear analysis, we further demonstrate a dynamical nonlinear instability for steady states with large central densities. The proof relies on a spectral analysis of the linearized operator and an a priori estimate on the full nonlinear free boundary problem.},

We present an energy method to prove finite speed of propagation (“FSOP”) for energy-dissipating solutions to stochastic thin-film equations with conservative nonlinear multiplicative noise under periodic boundary conditions. Physically, the equations under consideration correspond to weak slippage, i.e., the case of mobility exponents . Analytically, our approach relies on a new weighted decay estimate for appropriate powers of the solution which is set up in combination with Bernis inequalities and energy estimates. An intricacy related to this estimate are multiple power-type nonlinearities on the right-hand side —not occurring in previous studies for finite speed of propagation of stochastic versions of degenerate parabolic equations. They result from the different scaling behavior of the thin-film operator and the specific porous-medium operator which comes up as a correction term for Stratonovich or for Hänggi–Klimontovich noise. Combining this decay estimate with tailored filtering techniques, a qualitative result on finite speed of propagation is established.},

We show that the particle method converges as the number of particles goes to infinity towards weak measure solutions to the nonlocal equation. Such a results is proven under the assumption of initial data in the space of probability measures with finite second moment. In particular, our method is able to capture a measure-to- smoothing effect of the limit equation. Moreover, as the Morse potential is rescaled to approach a Dirac delta, corresponding to strongly localized repulsive interactions, the scheme becomes a particle approximation for the quadratic porous medium equation. We show that in the joint limit (localized repulsion and increasing number of particles) the reconstructed density converges to a weak solution of the porous medium equation. The strategy relies on various estimates performed at the particle level, including estimates and an entropy dissipation estimate, which benefit from the particular structure of our particle scheme and from the absolutely continuous reconstruction of the density from the particle locations.},

In this paper, we revisit the robustness to noise of SPA and several of its variants. In particular, when , we prove the tightness of the existing error bounds for SPA and for two more robust preconditioned variants of SPA. We also provide significantly improved error bounds for SPA, by a factor proportional to the conditioning of the vertices, in two special cases: for the first extracted vertex and when . We then provide further improvements for the error bounds of a translated version of SPA proposed by Arora et al. [Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, 2013, pp. 280–288] in two special cases: for the first two extracted vertices and when . Finally, we propose a new more robust variant of SPA that first shifts and lifts the data points in order to minimize the conditioning of the problem. We illustrate our results on synthetic data.

We derive a new explicit expression for the optimal backward error of a TLS system and relate it to the well-known result in the least squares setting. This work formally provides theoretical analysis on the feasibility of leveraging the LS information to solve the TLS problem. As for the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) subroutine, we innovate by substituting the complete Cholesky factorization with the sketching preconditioner. We verify its effectiveness within the finite-precision arithmetic with respect to the reduced condition number and the preservation of the convergence rate. Numerical experiments show that the RQI-SPCGTLS beats the classic RQI-PCGTLS and its mixed precision variant and is likely to be a stable solver when effective.},

In this paper, we develop the theory of perfect state transfer (PST) between real pure states with emphasis on the adjacency and Laplacian matrices as Hamiltonians of a graph representing a quantum spin network. We characterize PST between real pure states based on the spectral information of a graph and prove three fundamental results: (i) every periodic real pure state admits PST with another real pure state , (ii) every connected graph admits PST between real pure states, and (iii) for any pair of real pure states and and for any time , there exists a real symmetric matrix such that and admit PST relative to at time . We also determine all real pure states that admit PST in complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and cycles. This leads to a complete characterization of pair and plus state transfer in paths and complete bipartite graphs. We give constructions of graphs that admit PST between real pure states. Finally, using results on the spread of graphs, we prove that amongst all -vertex simple unweighted graphs, the least minimum PST time between real pure states is attained by any join graph for the Laplacian case, while it is attained by the join of an empty graph and a complete graph of appropriate sizes for the adjacency case.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Sketching-based preconditioners have been shown to accelerate the solution of dense least-squares problems with coefficient matrices having substantially more rows than columns. The cost of generating these preconditioners can be reduced by employing low precision floating-point formats for all or part of the computations. We perform finite precision analysis of a mixed precision algorithm that computes the -factor of a QR factorization of the sketched coefficient matrix. Two precisions can be chosen and the analysis allows understanding how to set these precisions to exploit the potential benefits of low precision formats and still guarantee an effective preconditioner. If the nature of the least-squares problem requires a solution with a small forward error, then mixed precision iterative refinement (IR) may be needed. For ill-conditioned problems the GMRES-based IR approach can be used, but good preconditioner is crucial to ensure convergence. We theoretically show when the sketching-based preconditioner can guarantee that the GMRES-based IR reduces the relative forward error of the least-squares solution and the residual to the level of the working precision unit roundoff. Small numerical examples illustrate the analysis.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Communication, i.e., data movement, is a critical bottleneck for the performance of classical Krylov subspace method solvers on modern computer architectures. Variants of these methods which avoid communication have been introduced, which, while equivalent in exact arithmetic, can be unstable in finite precision. In this work, we address the backward stability of -step GMRES, also known as communication-avoiding GMRES. Building upon the “modular framework” proposed in [A. Buttari et al., preprint, hal-04525918v2, 2024.], we present an improved framework for simplifying the analysis of -step GMRES, which includes standard GMRES as a special case, by isolating the effects of rounding errors in the QR factorization and the solution of the least squares problem. The key advantage of this new framework is that it is evident how the orthogonalization method affects the backward error, and it is not necessary to reevaluate anything other than the orthogonalization itself when modifying the orthogonalization used in GMRES. Using this framework, we analyze -step GMRES with popular block orthogonalization methods: block modified Gram–Schmidt and reorthogonalized block classical Gram–Schmidt algorithms. An example illustrates the resulting instability of -step GMRES when paired with the classical -step Arnoldi process and shows the limitations of popular strategies for resolving this instability. To address this issue, we propose a modified -step Arnoldi process that allows for much larger block size while maintaining satisfactory accuracy, as confirmed by our numerical experiments. An example illustrates the resulting instability of s-step GMRES when paired with the classical s-step Arnoldi process and shows the limitations of popular strategies for resolving this instability. To address this issue, we propose a modified Arnoldi process that allows for much larger block size s while maintaining satisfactory accuracy, as confirmed by our numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The notion of “stable rank” of a matrix is essential in the analysis of randomized matrix algorithms, covariance estimation, deep neural networks, and recommender systems. We compare the properties of the stable rank of a real or complex matrix and the related concept of “intrinsic dimension” of a Hermitian positive semi-semidefinite matrix to those of the classical rank. Basic proofs and examples illustrate that the stable rank does not satisfy any of the fundamental rank properties, while the intrinsic dimension satisfies a few. In particular, the stable rank and intrinsic dimension of a submatrix can exceed those of the original matrix; adding a Hermitian positive semi-semidefinite matrix can lower the intrinsic dimension of the sum; and multiplication by a nonsingular matrix can drastically change the stable rank and intrinsic dimension. We generalize the concept of stable rank to the -stable rank in a Schatten -norm, thereby unifying the concepts of stable rank and intrinsic dimension: the stable rank is the 2-stable rank, while the intrinsic dimension is the 1-stable rank of a Hermitian positive semi-semidefinite matrix. We derive sum and product inequalities for the th root of the -stable rank and show that it is well-conditioned in the norm-wise absolute sense. The conditioning improves if the matrix and the perturbation are Hermitian positive semidefinite.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In Parts I and II of this series of papers, three new methods for the computation of eigenvalues of singular pencils were developed: rank-completing perturbations, rank-projections, and augmentation. It was observed that a straightforward structure-preserving adaption for symmetric pencils was not possible and it was left as an open question how to address this challenge. In this Part III, it is shown how the observed issue can be circumvented by using Hermitian perturbations. This leads to structure-preserving analogs of the three techniques from Parts I and II for Hermitian pencils (including real symmetric pencils) as well as for skew-Hermitian, -even, -odd, and -(anti-)palindromic pencils. It is an important feature of these methods that the sign characteristic of the given pencil is preserved.},

We develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation-maximization algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of positive definite MLR matrix is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the recursive Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities, yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement.

Unless the system is consistent, MINRES is not guaranteed to obtain the pseudoinverse solution. We propose a novel and remarkably simple minimum-norm (MN) refinement that seamlessly integrates with the final MINRES iteration, enabling us to obtain the minimum-norm solution with negligible additional computational cost. We extend our MN refinement to complex-symmetric systems, building on S.-C. Choi’s extension of MINRES for solving these systems. Given the flexibility of MINRES to accommodate singular preconditioners, we further investigate the MN refinement in preconditioned settings that involve singular preconditioners. We also provide numerical experiments to support our analysis and showcase the effects of our MN refinement.},

Polynomial Krylov subspace methods are among the most widely used methods for approximating , the action of a matrix function on a vector, in particular when is large and sparse. When is Hermitian positive definite, the Lanczos method is the standard choice of Krylov method, and despite being very simplistic in nature, it often outperforms other, more sophisticated methods. In fact, one often observes that the error of the Lanczos method behaves almost exactly as the error of the best possible approximation from the Krylov space (which is in general not efficiently computable). However, theoretical guarantees for the deviation of the Lanczos error from the optimal error are mostly lacking so far (except for linear systems and a few other special cases). We prove a rigorous bound for this deviation when belongs to the important class of Stieltjes functions (which, e.g., includes inverse fractional powers as special cases) and a related class (which contains, e.g., the square root and the shifted logarithm), thus providing a near instance optimality guarantee. While the constants in our bounds are likely not optimal, they greatly improve upon the few results that are available in the literature and resemble the actual behavior much better.},

Since optimization on Riemannian manifolds relies on the chosen metric, it is appealing to know how the performance of a Riemannian optimization method varies with different metrics and how to exquisitely construct a metric such that a method can be accelerated. To this end, we propose a general framework for optimization problems on product manifolds endowed with a preconditioned metric, and we develop Riemannian methods under this metric. Generally, the metric is constructed by an operator that aims to approximate the diagonal blocks of the Riemannian Hessian of the cost function. We propose three specific approaches to design the operator: exact block diagonal preconditioning, left and right preconditioning, and Gauss–Newton type preconditioning. Specifically, we tailor new preconditioned metrics and adapt the proposed Riemannian methods to the canonical correlation analysis and the truncated singular value decomposition problems, which provably accelerate the Riemannian methods. Additionally, we adopt the Gauss–Newton type preconditioning to solve the tensor ring completion problem. Numerical results among these applications verify that a delicate metric does accelerate the Riemannian optimization methods.},

While many algorithms have been developed to optimize some of these aspects, practical ID algorithms proficient in all aspects remain absent. To fill in the gap, we introduce robust blockwise random pivoting (RBRP) that is asymptotically fast, hardware efficient, and rank-adaptive, providing accurate skeletons and interpolation matrices comparable to the best existing ID algorithms in practice.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent advances in matrix-mimetic tensor frameworks have made it possible to preserve linear algebraic properties for multilinear data analysis and, as a result, to obtain optimal representations of multiway data. Matrix mimeticity arises from interpreting tensors as operators that can be multiplied, factorized, and analyzed analogously to matrices. Underlying the tensor operation is an algebraic framework parameterized by an invertible linear transformation. The choice of linear mapping is crucial to representation quality and, in practice, is made heuristically based on expected correlations in the data. However, in many cases, these correlations are unknown and common heuristics lead to suboptimal performance. In this work, we simultaneously learn optimal linear mappings and corresponding tensor representations without relying on prior knowledge of the data. Our new framework explicitly captures the coupling between the transformation and representation using variable projection. We preserve the invertibility of the linear mapping by learning orthogonal transformations with Riemannian optimization. We provide an original theory of the uniqueness of the transformation and convergence analysis of our variable-projection-based algorithm. We demonstrate the generality of our framework through numerical experiments on a wide range of applications, including financial index tracking, image compression, and reduced order modeling.

The source of the latter improvement is CholeskyQR with randomized preconditioning. Comprehensive analysis is provided in both exact and finite-precision arithmetic to characterize the algorithm’s rank-revealing properties and its numerical stability granted probabilistic assumptions of the sketching operator. An implementation of the proposed algorithm is described and made available inside the open-source RandLAPACK library, which itself relies on RandBLAS. Experiments with this implementation on an Intel Xeon Gold 6248R CPU demonstrate order-of-magnitude speedups over LAPACK’s standard function for QRCP, and comparable performance to a specialized algorithm for unpivoted QR of tall matrices, which lacks the strong rank-revealing properties of the proposed method.},

Often, involved Riccati-type equations are of small scale, but have to be solved repeatedly in real time. A new inner-outer iterative method that combines the fixed-point strategy and the structure-preserving doubling algorithm (SDA) is proposed. It is proved that the method is monotonically convergent to the desired stabilizing solution. Previously, Newton’s method has been called to solve SCARE, but it was mostly investigated from its theoretical aspects rather than numerical aspects in terms of robust and efficient numerical implementation. For that reason, we revisit Newton’s method for SCARE, focusing on how to make Newton’s method practical. Finally numerical experiments are conducted to validate the new method and robust implementations of Newton’s method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Feature alignment methods are used in many scientific disciplines for data pooling, annotation, and comparison. As an instance of a permutation learning problem, feature alignment presents significant statistical and computational challenges. In this work, we propose the covariance alignment model to study and compare various alignment methods and establish a minimax lower bound for covariance alignment that has a nonstandard dimension scaling because of the presence of a nuisance parameter. This lower bound is in fact minimax optimal and is achieved by a natural quasi maximum likelihood estimator. However, this estimator involves a search over all permutations which is computationally infeasible even when the problem has moderate size. To overcome this limitation, we show that the celebrated Gromov–Wasserstein algorithm from optimal transport, which is more amenable to fast implementation even on large-scale problems, is also minimax optimal. These results give the first statistical justification for the deployment of the Gromov–Wasserstein algorithm in practice.},

We prove that under mild conditions, at most samples (suppressing constants and log factors) suffice for our proposed estimator to be within of the original density in squared Hellinger distance. On the computational front, while the usual log-concave maximum likelihood estimate can be obtained via a finite-dimensional convex program, it is slow to compute—especially in higher dimensions.

However, exact computation of Tukey’s depth is known to be a hard problem in high dimensions. As a remedy, randomized approximations of Tukey’s depth have been proposed. In this paper we explore when such randomized algorithms return a good approximation of Tukey’s depth. We study the case when the data are sampled from a log-concave isotropic distribution. We prove that if one requires that the algorithm runs in polynomial time in the dimension, the randomized algorithm correctly approximates the maximal depth and depths close to zero. On the other hand, for any point of intermediate depth, any good approximation requires exponential complexity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many Bayesian statistical inference problems come down to computing a maximum a posteriori (MAP) assignment of latent variables. Yet, standard methods for estimating the MAP assignment do not have a finite time guarantee that the algorithm has converged to a fixed point. Previous research has found that MAP inference can be represented in dual form as a linear programming problem with a nonpolynomial number of constraints. A Lagrangian relaxation of the dual yields a statistical inference algorithm as a linear programming problem. However, the decision as to which constraints to remove in the relaxation is often heuristic. We present a method for maximum a posteriori inference in general Bayesian factor models that sequentially adds constraints to the fully relaxed dual problem using Benders’ decomposition. Our method enables the incorporation of expressive integer and logical constraints in clustering problems such as must-link, cannot-link, and a minimum number of whole samples allocated to each cluster. Using this approach, we derive MAP estimation algorithms for the Bayesian Gaussian mixture model and latent Dirichlet allocation. Empirical results show that our method produces a higher optimal posterior value compared to Gibbs sampling and variational Bayes methods for standard data sets and provides a certificate of convergence.},

Here, we rigorously characterize the behavior of transformers with hardmax self-attention and normalization sublayers as the number of layers tends to infinity. By viewing such transformers as discrete-time dynamical systems describing the evolution of points in a Euclidean space, and thanks to a geometric interpretation of the self-attention mechanism based on hyperplane separation, we show that the transformer inputs asymptotically converge to a clustered equilibrium determined by special points called leaders. We then leverage this theoretical understanding to solve sentiment analysis problems from language processing using a fully interpretable transformer model, which effectively captures “context” by clustering meaningless words around leader words carrying the most meaning. Finally, we outline remaining challenges to bridge the gap between the mathematical analysis of transformers and their real-life implementation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) have recently emerged as state-of-the-art approaches for image generation. Existing SBDMs are typically formulated in a finite-dimensional setting, where images are considered as tensors of finite size. This paper develops SBDMs in the infinite-dimensional setting, that is, we model the training data as functions supported on a rectangular domain. In addition to the quest for generating images at ever-higher resolutions, our primary motivation is to create a well-posed infinite-dimensional learning problem that we can discretize consistently on multiple resolution levels. We thereby intend to obtain diffusion models that generalize across different resolution levels and improve the efficiency of the training process. We demonstrate how to overcome two shortcomings of current SBDM approaches in the infinite-dimensional setting. First, we modify the forward process using trace class operators to ensure that the latent distribution is well-defined in the infinite-dimensional setting and derive the reverse processes for finite-dimensional approximations. Second, we illustrate that approximating the score function with an operator network is beneficial for multilevel training. After deriving the convergence of the discretization and the approximation of multilevel training, we demonstrate some practical benefits of our infinite-dimensional SBDM approach on a synthetic Gaussian mixture example, the MNIST dataset, and a dataset generated from a nonlinear 2D reaction-diffusion equation.},

Under minimal assumptions, we show that our proposal, which we call the Sinkhorn bridge, provably estimates the Schrödinger bridge with a rate of convergence that depends on the intrinsic dimensionality of the target measure.

Such smooth changes are parametrized by a Hölder exponent and coefficient . While various subcases of this general model have been studied in isolation, we first establish the minimax dynamic regret rate generally for all . Next, we show that this optimal dynamic regret can be attained adaptively, without knowledge of . To contrast, even with parameter knowledge, upper bounds were only previously known for limited regimes and [A. Slivkins, J. Mach. Learn. Res., 15 (2014), pp. 2533–2568], [R. Krishnamurthy and A.

Thus, our work resolves open questions raised by disparate threads of the literature. We also study the problem of attaining faster gap-dependent regret rates in nonstationary bandits. While such rates are long known to be impossible in general [A. Garivier and E. Moulines, On upper-confidence bound policies for switching bandit problems, in Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory, Springer, 2011, pp. 174–188], we show that environments admitting a safe arm [J. Suk and S. Kpotufe, Tracking most significant arm switches in bandits, in Conference on Learning Theory, 2022] allow for much faster rates than the worst-case scaling with . While previous works in this direction focused on attaining the usual logarithmic regret bounds, as summed over stationary periods, our new gap-dependent rates reveal new optimistic regimes of nonstationarity where even the logarithmic bounds are pessimistic. We show that our new gap-dependent rate is tight and that its achievability (i.e., as made possible by a safe arm) has a surprisingly simple and clean characterization within the smooth Hölder class model.},

Singh, Dimension-robust Function Space Mcmc with Neural Network Priors, 2020] which can be preferable to traditional DNNs because they (a) are identifiable and (b) possess desirable convergence properties. TNN priors are defined on functions with infinitely many hidden units, and have strongly convergent Karhunen–Loeve-type approximations with finitely many hidden units. A practical hurdle is that the Bayesian solution is computationally demanding, requiring simulation methods, so approaches to drive down the complexity are needed. In this paper, we leverage the strong convergence of TNN in order to apply multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) to these models. In particular, an MLMC method that was introduced by Beskos et al. [SIAM/ASA J. Uncertain. Quantif., 6 (2018), pp. 762–786] is used to approximate posterior expectations of Bayesian TNN models with optimal computational complexity, and this is mathematically proved. The results are verified with several numerical experiments on model problems arising in machine learning, including some toy regression and classification models, MNIST image classification, and a challenging reinforcement learning problem. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical utility of the method on MNIST as well as IMDb sentiment classification.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Generative adversarial networks are popular for generative tasks; however, they often require careful architecture selection and extensive empirical tuning, and they are prone to mode collapse. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel model that identifies the low-dimensional structure of the underlying data distribution, maps it into a low-dimensional latent space while preserving the underlying geometry, and then optimally transports a reference measure to the embedded distribution. We prove three key properties of our method: (1) the encoder preserves the geometry of the underlying data; (2) the generator is -cyclically monotone, where is an intrinsic embedding cost employed by the encoder; and (3) the discriminator’s modulus of continuity improves with the geometric preservation of the data. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating high-quality images and exhibiting robustness to both mode collapse and training instability.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is well known that randomly initialized, push-forward, fully connected neural networks weakly converge to isotropic Gaussian processes in the limit where the width of all layers goes to infinity. In this paper, we propose to use the angular power spectrum of the limiting fields to characterize the complexity of the network architecture. In particular, we define sequences of random variables associated with the angular power spectrum and provide a full characterization of the network complexity in terms of the asymptotic distribution of these sequences as the depth diverges. On this basis, we classify neural networks as low-disorder, sparse, or high-disorder; we show how this classification highlights a number of distinct features for standard activation functions and, in particular, sparsity properties of ReLU networks. Our theoretical results are also validated by numerical simulations.},

In this work, we introduce diffusion estimators for the problems of angular synchronization and smoothing on graphs, in the presence of a rotation associated to each edge. Unlike classical WoS algorithms that are pointwise estimators, our diffusion estimators allow for global estimations by propagating along the branches of random spanning subgraphs called multitype spanning forests. Building upon efficient samplers based on variants of Wilson’s algorithm, we show that our estimators outperform standard numerical-linear-algebra solvers in challenging instances, depending on the topology and density of the graph.},

We extend our argument to tensor-train approximation of tensors generated with functions of the “higher-order inner product” of their multiple variables.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Sequential lateration is a class of methods for multidimensional scaling where a suitable subset of nodes is first embedded by some method, e.g., a clique embedded by classical scaling, and then the remaining nodes are recursively embedded by lateration. A graph is a lateration graph when it can be embedded by such a procedure. We provide a stability result for a particular variant of sequential lateration. We do so in a setting where the dissimilarities represent noisy Euclidean distances between nodes in a geometric lateration graph. We then deduce, as a corollary, a perturbation bound for stress minimization. To argue that our setting applies broadly, we show that a (large) random geometric graph is a lateration graph with high probability under mild conditions, extending a previous result of Aspnes et al.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Neural networks often operate in the overparameterized regime, in which there are far more parameters than training samples, allowing the training data to fit perfectly. That is, training the network effectively learns an interpolating function, and properties of the interpolant affect predictions the network will make on new samples. This manuscript explores how properties of such functions learned by neural networks of depth greater than two layers. Our framework considers a family of networks of varying depths that all have the same capacity but different representation costs. The representation cost of a function induced by a neural network architecture is the minimum sum of squared weights needed for the network to represent the function; it reflects the function space bias associated with the architecture. Our results show that adding additional linear layers to the input side of a shallow ReLU network yields a representation cost favoring functions with low mixed variation–-that is, it has limited variation in directions orthogonal to a low-dimensional subspace and can be well approximated by a single- or multi-index model. This bias occurs because minimizing the sum of squared weights of the linear layers is equivalent to minimizing a low-rank promoting Schatten quasi-norm of a single “virtual” weight matrix. Our experiments confirm this behavior in standard network training regimes. They additionally show that linear layers can improve generalization and the learned network is well-aligned with the true latent low-dimensional linear subspace when data is generated using a multi-index model.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Sampling from a high-dimensional distribution is a fundamental task in statistics, engineering, and the sciences. A canonical approach is the Langevin algorithm, i.e., the Markov chain for the discretized Langevin diffusion. This is the sampling analog of gradient descent. Despite being studied for several decades in multiple communities, tight mixing bounds for this algorithm remain unresolved even in the seemingly simple setting of log-concave distributions over a bounded domain. This paper characterizes the mixing time of the Langevin algorithm to its stationary distribution in this setting (and others). This mixing result can be combined with any bound on the discretization bias in order to sample from the stationary distribution of the continuous Langevin diffusion. In this way, we disentangle the study of the mixing and bias of the Langevin algorithm. Our key insight is to introduce a technique from the differential privacy literature to the sampling literature. This technique, called privacy amplification by iteration, uses as a potential a variant of Rényi divergence that is made geometrically aware via optimal transport smoothing. This gives a short, simple proof of optimal mixing bounds and has several additional appealing properties. First, our approach removes all unnecessary assumptions required by other sampling analyses. Second, our approach unifies many settings: it extends unchanged if the Langevin algorithm uses projections, stochastic minibatch gradients, or strongly convex potentials (whereby our mixing time improves exponentially). Third, our approach exploits convexity only through the contractivity of a gradient step—reminiscent of how convexity is used in textbook proofs of gradient descent. In this way, we offer a new approach towards further unifying the analyses of optimization and sampling algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Various tasks in data science are modeled utilizing the variational regularization approach, where manually selecting regularization parameters presents a challenge. The difficulty gets exacerbated when employing regularizers involving a large number of hyperparameters. To overcome this challenge, bilevel learning can be employed to learn such parameters from data. However, neither exact function values nor exact gradients with respect to the hyperparameters are attainable, necessitating methods that only rely on inexact evaluation of such quantities. State-of-the-art inexact gradient-based methods a priori select a sequence of the required accuracies and cannot identify an appropriate step size since the Lipschitz constant of the hypergradient is unknown. In this work, we propose an algorithm with backtracking line search that only relies on inexact function evaluations and hypergradients and show convergence to a stationary point. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm determines the required accuracy dynamically rather than manually selected before running it. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of our approach for hyperparameter estimation on a range of relevant problems in imaging and data science such as total variation and field of experts denoising and multinomial logistic regression. Particularly, the results show that the algorithm is robust to its own hyperparameters such as the initial accuracies and step size.},

While online machine teaching example selection strategies are typically designed assuming omniscience, i.e., the teacher has absolute knowledge of the learner state, we show that efficient machine teaching is possible even when the teacher is uncertain about the learner initialization. Specifically, we consider the case of learners that perform gradient descent of a quadratic loss to learn a linear classifier, and we propose an online machine teaching algorithm in which the teacher simultaneously learns the learner state while teaching the learner. We theoretically show that the learner’s mean square error decreases exponentially with the number of examples, thus achieving a performance similar to the omniscient case and outperforming two stage strategies that first attempt to make the teacher omniscient before teaching. We empirically illustrate our approach in the context of a cross-lingual sentiment analysis problem.},

This paper focuses on the noiseless complete dictionary learning problem, where the goal is to represent a set of given signals as linear combinations of a small number of atoms from a learned dictionary. There are two main challenges faced by theoretical and practical studies of dictionary learning: the lack of theoretical guarantees for practically used heuristic algorithms and their poor scalability when dealing with huge-scale datasets. Towards addressing these issues, we propose a simple and efficient algorithm that provably recovers the ground truth when applied to the nonconvex and discrete formulation of the problem in the noiseless setting. We also extend our proposed method to mini-batch and online settings where the data is huge-scale or arrives continuously over time. At the core of our proposed method lies an efficient preconditioning technique that transforms the unknown dictionary to a near-orthonormal one, for which we prove a simple alternating minimization technique converges linearly to the ground truth under minimal conditions. Our numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets showcase the superiority of our method compared with the existing techniques.},

While it is known that solutions computed using this scheme converge at optimal rates to smooth solutions, this does not establish the stability of the method or convergence to solutions with minimal regularity.

These expansions are useful in a variety of contexts such as in the development of modified equation schemes, the design of high-order accurate energy stable discretizations, and error analysis of certain finite element or finite difference schemes. Here, we provide closed form expressions for the coefficients in the series expansions for derivatives of all orders. We also provide some short recursions defining the series coefficients, and formulae for the stencil coefficients in standard difference approximations. The series expansions are used to show some useful properties of the Fourier symbols of difference approximations and to derive rules of thumb for the number of points-per-wavelength needed to achieve a given error tolerance when solving wave propagation problems involving higher spatial derivatives.},

Furthermore, we design a diagonal preconditioner to efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional linear system by reducing the condition number of the stiffness matrix. These techniques collectively contribute to the computational effectiveness of our proposed approach. Convergence analysis shows the polynomial accuracy of the proposed method.

Specifically, we prove stability, show an a priori error bound, and show parameter scalings for the TR-ROM. Our numerical investigation shows that the theoretical convergence rate and the parameter scalings with respect to the ROM dimension and filter radius are recovered numerically. In addition, the parameter scaling can be used to extrapolate the time-relaxation parameter to other ROM dimensions and filter radii. Moreover, the parameter scaling with respect to the filter radius is also observed in the predictive regime.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent work established that rank overparameterization eliminates spurious local minima in nonconvex low-rank matrix recovery under the restricted isometry property (RIP). But this does not fully explain the practical success of overparameterization, because real algorithms can still become trapped at nonstrict saddle points (approximate second-order points with arbitrarily small negative curvature) even when all local minima are global. Moreover, the result does not accommodate for noisy measurements, but it is unclear whether such an extension is even possible, in view of the many discontinuous and unintuitive behaviors already known for the overparameterized regime. In this paper, we introduce a novel proof technique that unifies, simplifies, and strengthens two previously competing approaches—one based on escape directions and the other based on the inexistence of counterexample—to provide sharp global guarantees in the noisy overparameterized regime. We show, once local minima have been converted into global minima through slight overparameterization, that near-second-order points achieve the same minimax-optimal recovery bounds (up to small constant factors) as significantly more expensive convex approaches. Our results are sharp with respect to the noise level and the solution accuracy, and hold for both the symmetric parameterization and the asymmetric parameterization under a balancing regularizer; we demonstrate that the balancing regularizer is indeed necessary.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Model update (MU) and candidate evaluation (CE) are classical steps incorporated inside many stochastic trust-region (TR) algorithms. The sampling effort exerted within these steps, often decided with the aim of controlling model error, largely determines a stochastic TR algorithm’s sample complexity. Given that MU and CE are amenable to variance reduction, we investigate the effect of incorporating common random numbers (CRN) within MU and CE on complexity. Using ASTRO and ASTRO-DF as prototype first-order and zeroth-order families of algorithms, we demonstrate that CRN’s effectiveness leads to a range of complexities depending on sample-path regularity and the oracle order. For instance, we find that in first-order oracle settings with smooth sample paths, CRN’s effect is pronounced—ASTRO with CRN achieves a.s. sample complexity compared to a.s. in the generic no-CRN setting. By contrast, CRN’s effect is muted when the sample paths are not Lipschitz, with the sample complexity improving from a.s. to and a.s. in the zeroth- and first-order settings, respectively. Since our results imply that improvements in complexity are largely inherited from generic aspects of variance reduction, e.g., finite-differencing for zeroth-order settings and sample-path smoothness for first-order settings within MU, we anticipate similar trends in other contexts.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The optimistic gradient method has seen increasing popularity as an efficient first-order method for solving convex-concave saddle point problems. To analyze its iteration complexity, a recent work [A. Mokhtari, A. E. Ozdaglar, and S. Pattathil, SIAM J. Optim., 30 (2020), pp. 3230–3251] proposed an interesting perspective that interprets the optimistic gradient method as an approximation to the proximal point method. In this paper, we follow this approach and distill the underlying idea of optimism to propose a generalized optimistic method, which encompasses the optimistic gradient method as a special case. Our general framework can handle constrained saddle point problems with composite objective functions. Moreover, we also develop a backtracking line search scheme to select the step sizes without knowledge of the smoothness coefficients. By instantiating our general framework with a second-order oracle, we propose a second-order optimistic method and prove a complexity bound of in terms of the primal-dual gap in the convex-concave setting and a complexity bound of in terms of the distance to the optimal solution in the strongly-convex-strongly-concave setting, where is the Lipschitz constant of the Jacobian, is the strong convexity parameter, and is the initial Euclidean distance to the saddle point. We also establish convergence rates in terms of the tangent residual, which generalizes the operator norm as a metric in the unconstrained setting. Moreover, our line search scheme provably only requires a constant number of calls to a subproblem solver per iteration on average.},

We propose a new numerical method for solving a generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) involving players, incorporating general constraints formulated in Hilbert spaces. These constraints may include linear equality, linear inequality, or conic constraints. Instead of handling joint constraints and nonlinear objectives directly, we reformulate the problem as an equality-constrained GNEP with separable structure and then construct a quadratic majorization augmented Lagrangian function for the resulting GNEP. A majorized augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) is then designed to solve the equivalent GNEP. Each iteration requires solving a coupled Nash equilibrium problem (NEP). To address this, we introduce a symmetric Gauss–Seidel (sGS) decomposition method to decouple the NEP into a sequence of single-objective unconstrained quadratic programs. We establish the convergence of this ALM under mild assumptions in a weak topology and prove the strong convergence of the primal sequence under additional regularity assumptions. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Monotone inclusion problems occur in many areas of optimization and variational analysis. Splitting methods, which utilize resolvents or proximal mappings of the underlying operators, are often applied to solve these problems. Bredies et al. [SIAM J. Optim., 32 (2022), pp. 2376–2401] introduced a new elegant algorithmic framework that encompasses various well-known algorithms, including Douglas–Rachford and Chambolle–Pock. They obtained powerful weak and strong convergence results, where the latter type relies on additional strong monotonicity assumptions. In this paper, we complement the analysis by Bredies et al. by relating the projections of the fixed point sets of the underlying operators that generate the (reduced and original) preconditioned proximal point sequences. We obtain a new strong convergence result when the underlying operator is a linear relation. We note that without assumptions such as linearity or strong monotonicity, one may encounter weak convergence without strong convergence. In the case of the Chambolle–Pock algorithm, we obtain a new result that yields strong convergence to the projection onto the intersection of a linear subspace and the preimage of a linear subspace. Splitting algorithms by Ryu and by Malitsky and Tam are also considered. Various examples are provided to illustrate the applicability of our results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The problems of computing graph colorings and clique covers are central challenges in combinatorial optimization. Both of these are known to be NP-hard and thus computationally intractable in the worst-case instance. A prominent approach for computing approximate solutions to these problems is the celebrated Lovász theta function , which is specified as the solution of a semidefinite program (SDP) and hence is tractable to compute. In this work, we move beyond the worst-case analysis and set out to understand whether the Lovász theta function recovers clique covers for random instances that have a latent clique cover structure, possibly obscured by noise. We answer this question in the affirmative and show that for graphs generated from the planted clique model we introduce in this work, the SDP formulation of has a unique solution that reveals the underlying clique cover structure with high probability. The main technical step is an intermediate result where we prove a deterministic condition of recovery based on an appropriate notion of sparsity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In pure integer linear programming it is often desirable to work with polyhedra that are full-dimensional, and it is well known that it is possible to reduce any polyhedron to a full-dimensional one in polynomial time. More precisely, using the Hermite normal form, it is possible to map a non-full-dimensional polyhedron to a full-dimensional isomorphic one in a lower-dimensional space, while preserving integer vectors. In this paper, we extend the above result simultaneously in two directions. First, we consider mixed integer vectors instead of integer vectors, by leveraging on the concept of “integer reflexive generalized inverse.” Second, we replace polyhedra with convex quadratic sets, which are sets obtained from polyhedra by enforcing one additional convex quadratic inequality. We study structural properties of convex quadratic sets, and utilize them to obtain polynomial time algorithms to recognize full-dimensional convex quadratic sets, and to find an affine function that maps a non-full-dimensional convex quadratic set to a full-dimensional isomorphic one in a lower-dimensional space, while preserving mixed integer vectors. We showcase the applicability and the potential impact of these results by demonstrating that they can be used to prove that mixed integer convex quadratic programming is fixed parameter tractable with parameter the number of integer variables. Our algorithm unifies and extends the known polynomial time solvability of mixed integer convex quadratic programming in fixed dimension and of convex quadratic programming.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A common strategy for solving an unconstrained two-player Nash equilibrium problem with continuous variables is applying Newton’s method to the system obtained by the corresponding first-order necessary optimality conditions. However, when taking into account the game dynamics, it is not clear what is the goal of each player when considering they are taking their current decision following Newton’s iterates. In this paper we provide an interpretation for Newton’s iterate as follows: instead of minimizing the quadratic approximation of the objective functions parameterized by the other player current decision (the Jacobi-type strategy), we show that the Newton iterate follows this approach but with the objective function parameterized by a prediction of the other player action. This interpretation allows us to present a new Newtonian algorithm where a backtracking procedure is introduced in order to guarantee that the computed Newtonian directions, for each player, are descent directions for the corresponding parameterized functions. Thus, besides favoring global convergence, our algorithm also favors true minimizers instead of maximizers or saddle points, unlike the standard Newton method, which does not consider the minimization structure of the problem in the nonconvex case. Thus, our method is more robust compared to other Jacobi-type strategies or the pure Newtonian approach, which is corroborated by our numerical experiments. We also present a proof of the well-definiteness of the algorithm under some standard assumptions, together with a preliminary analysis of its convergence properties taking into account the game dynamics.},

Meanwhile, absolute value equations (AVE) have attracted increasing interest due to their connection with the linear complementarity problem. In this paper, we investigate the application of randomized iterative methods to generalized AVE (GAVE). Our approach differs from most existing works in that we tackle GAVE with nonsquare coefficient matrices. We establish more comprehensive sufficient and necessary conditions for characterizing the solvability of GAVE and propose precise error bound conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a flexible and efficient randomized iterative algorithmic framework for solving GAVE, which employs randomized sketching matrices drawn from user-specified distributions. This framework is capable of encompassing many well-known methods, including the Picard iteration method and the randomized Kaczmarz method. Leveraging our findings on solvability and error bounds, we establish both almost sure convergence and linear convergence rates for this versatile algorithmic framework. Finally, we present numerical examples to illustrate the advantages of the new algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) are used as a decision-making framework to study the long-run performance of a stochastic system. It is well known that a stationary optimal policy of a CMDP problem under discounted cost criterion can be obtained by solving a linear programming problem when running costs and transition probabilities are exactly known. In this paper, we consider a discounted cost CMDP problem where the running costs and transition probabilities are defined using random variables. Consequently, both the objective function and constraints become random. We use chance constraints to model these uncertainties and formulate the uncertain CMDP problem as a joint chance-constrained Markov decision process (JCCMDP). Under random running costs, we assume that the dependency among random constraint vectors is driven by a Gumbel–Hougaard copula. Using standard probability inequalities, we construct convex upper bound approximations of the JCCMDP problem under certain conditions on random running costs. In addition, we propose a linear programming problem whose optimal value gives a lower bound to the optimal value of the JCCMDP problem. When both running costs and transition probabilities are random, we define the latter variables as a sum of their means and random perturbations. Under mild conditions on the random perturbations and random running costs, we construct convex upper and lower bound approximations of the JCCMDP problem. We analyze the quality of the derived bounds through numerical experiments on a queueing control problem for random running costs. For the case when both running costs and transition probabilities are random, we choose randomly generated Markov decision problems called Garnets for numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper deals with the algorithmic aspects of solving feasibility problems of semidefinite programming (SDP), aka linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Since in some SDP instances all feasible solutions have irrational entries, numerical solvers that work with rational numbers can only find an approximate solution. We study the following question: Is it possible to certify feasibility of a given SDP using an approximate solution that is sufficiently close to some exact solution? Existing approaches make the assumption that there exist rational feasible solutions (and use techniques such as rounding and lattice reduction algorithms). We propose an alternative approach that does not need this assumption. More specifically, we show how to construct a system of polynomial equations whose set of real solutions is guaranteed to have an isolated correct solution (assuming that the target exact solution is maximum-rank). This allows, in particular, for us to use algorithms from real algebraic geometry for solving systems of polynomial equations, yielding a hybrid (or symbolic-numerical) method for SDPs. We experimentally compare it with a pure symbolic method in [D. Henrion, S. Naldi, and M. Safey El Din, SIAM J. Optim., 26 (2016), pp. 2512–2539]; the hybrid method was able to certify feasibility of many SDP instances on which the aforementioned paper failed. Our approach may have further applications, such as refining an approximate solution using methods of numerical algebraic geometry for systems of polynomial equations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The -theory for nonsmooth functions and the associated space decomposition have been used for studying the smooth substructures and for developing algorithms with superlinear convergence in those settings, which are challenging for fast convergence. We extend the theory by defining a certain bivariate -Lagrangian function and partial -Hessian. Utilizing smoothness properties of the new -Lagrangian we develop the proximal gradient -method for continuous nonsmooth convex optimization and show its superlinear convergence under natural assumptions. The framework consists of a -step which is a prox-gradient step, followed by a -step which can be considered as a quasi-Newton step applied to the -Lagrangian. We show that partial -Hessians exist for most partly smooth functions. We exhibit the explicit process of constructing a basis of the -space and of calculating the -Hessian for -regularized problems. Numerical results illustrate the method’s performance.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper investigates the influence of directed networks on decentralized stochastic nonconvex optimization associated with column-stochastic mixing matrices. Surprisingly, we find that the canonical spectral gap, a widely used metric in undirected networks, is insufficient to characterize the impact of directed topology on decentralized algorithms. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel metric termed equilibrium skewness. This metric, together with the spectral gap, accurately and comprehensively captures the influence of column-stochastic mixing matrices on decentralized stochastic algorithms. With these two metrics, we clarify, for the first time, how the directed network topology influences the performance of prevalent algorithms such as Push-Sum and Push-DIGing. Furthermore, we establish the first lower bound of the convergence rate for decentralized stochastic nonconvex algorithms over directed networks. Since existing algorithms cannot match our lower bound, we further propose the MG-Push-DIGing algorithm, which integrates Push-DIGing with a multiround gossip technique. MG-Push-DIGing attains our lower bound up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating its near-optimal performance and the tightness of the lower bound. Numerical experiments verify our theoretical results.},

In this paper, we improve this commutation principle by allowing to be nonsmooth. For example, for the case of local minimizer, we show that operator commutes with some element of the limiting (Mordukhovich) subdifferential of at provided that is subdifferentially regular at satisfying a qualification condition. For the case of local maximizer, we prove that operator commutes with each element of the (Fenchel) subdifferential of at whenever this subdifferential is nonempty. As an application, we characterize local optimizers of shifted strictly convex spectral functions and norms over automorphism invariant sets.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Convex optimization encompasses a wide range of optimization problems that contain many efficiently solvable subclasses. Interior point methods are currently the state-of-the-art approach for solving such problems, particularly effective for classes like semidefinite programming, quadratic programming, and geometric programming. However, their success hinges on the construction of self-concordant barrier functions for feasible sets. In this work, we investigate and develop a homotopy-based approach to solve convex optimization problems. While homotopy methods have been considered in optimization before, their potential for general convex programs remains underexplored. This approach gradually transforms the feasible set of a trivial optimization problem into the target one while tracking solutions by solving a differential equation, in contrast to traditional central path methods. We establish a criterion that ensures that the homotopy method correctly solves the optimization problem and prove the existence of such homotopies for several important classes, including semidefinite and hyperbolic programs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach numerically outperforms state-of-the-art methods in hyperbolic programming, highlighting its practical advantages.},

In this paper, we propose a general extra-gradient scheme for solving monotone variational inequalities (VI), referred to here as the Approximation-based Regularized Extra-gradient method (ARE). The first step of ARE solves a VI subproblem, where the associated operator consists of an approximation operator satisfying a -order Lipschitz bound with respect to the original mapping, and the gradient of a -order regularization. The optimal global convergence is guaranteed by including an additional extra-gradient step, while a -order superlinear local convergence is shown to hold if the VI is strongly monotone. The proposed ARE is a broad scheme, in the sense that a variety of solution methods can be formulated within this framework as different manifestations of approximations, and their iteration complexities would follow through in a unified fashion. The ARE framework relates to the first-order methods, while opening up possibilities to developing higher-order methods specifically for structured problems that guarantee the optimal iteration complexity bounds.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Computing the regularized solution of Bayesian linear inverse problems as well as the corresponding regularization parameter is highly desirable in many applications. This paper proposes a novel iterative method, termed the Projected Newton method (PNT), that can simultaneously update the regularization parameter and solution step by step without requiring any expensive matrix inversions or decompositions. By reformulating the Tikhonov regularization as a constrained minimization problem and leveraging its Lagrangian function, a Newton-type method coupled with a Krylov subspace method is designed for the unconstrained Lagrangian function. The resulting PNT algorithm only needs solving a small-scale linear system to get a descent direction of a merit function at each iteration, thus significantly reducing computational overhead. Rigorous convergence results are proved, showing that PNT always converges to the unique regularized solution and the corresponding Lagrangian multiplier. Experimental results on both small-scale and large-scale Bayesian inverse problems demonstrate its excellent convergence property, robustness, and efficiency. Given that the most demanding computational tasks in PNT are primarily matrix-vector products, it is particularly well-suited for large-scale problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) refers to algorithms that create synthetic but realistic output. Diffusion models currently offer state-of-the-art performance in GAI for images. They also form a key component in more general tools, including text-to-image generators and large language models. Diffusion models work by adding noise to the available training data and then learning how to reverse the process. The reverse operation may then be applied to new random data in order to produce new outputs. We provide a brief introduction to diffusion models for applied mathematicians and statisticians. Our key aims are to (a) present illustrative computational examples, (b) give a careful derivation of the underlying mathematical formulas involved, and (c) draw a connection with partial differential equation (PDE) diffusion models. We provide code for the computational experiments. We hope that this topic will be of interest to advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students. Portions of the material may also provide useful motivational examples for those who teach courses in stochastic processes, inference, machine learning, PDEs, or scientific computing.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Diffusive flows, and their discrete counterparts, are ubiquitous in the physical and engineering sciences. In many important examples, the total mass is not preserved and therefore standard probabilistic models are not suitable. Examples include electrons which may be absorbed by the medium in which they travel. In population genetics, some individuals may “disappear” due to their genotype. In traffic flows over a network, some vehicles might simply exit the circulation and park. In this more general situation, where some of the mass may be lost, it is of particular interest to reconcile the observed initial and final marginal distributions with a given prior. In the case when the two marginals are probability distributions, and thus of equal mass, this problem was posed and, to a considerable extent, solved by E. Schrödinger in 1931/32. It is now known as the Schrödinger Bridge Problem (SBP). It turns out that Schrödinger’s problem can be viewed as both a modeling and a control problem. Due to the fundamental significance of this problem, interest in the SBP and in its deterministic (zero-noise limit) counterpart of optimal mass transport (OMT) has in recent years enticed scientists from a broad spectrum of disciplines, including physics, stochastic control, computer science, probability theory, and geometry. Yet, while the mathematics and applications of SBP/OMT have been developing at a considerable pace, accounting for marginals of unequal mass has received scant attention. The problem of interpolating between “unbalanced” marginals has been approached by introducing source/sink terms into the transport equations in an ad hoc manner, chiefly driven by applications in image registration. Nevertheless, as hinted at above, losses are inherent in many physical processes and, thereby, models that account for lossy transport may also need to be reconciled with observed marginals following Schrödinger’s quest, that is, to adjust the probability of trajectories of particles, including those that do not make it to the terminal observation point, so that the updated evolution represents the most likely way that particles may have been transported, or vanished, at some intermediate point. Thus, the purpose of this work is to develop such a natural generalization of the SBP for diffusive evolution with losses, whereupon particles are “killed” (jump into a coffin/extinction state) according to a probabilistic law, and thereby mass is gradually lost along their stochastically driven flow. Through a suitable embedding, which appears to be novel, we turn the problem into an SBP for stochastic processes that combine diffusive and jump characteristics. Then, following a large-deviations formalism in the style of E. Schrödinger, given a prior law that allows for losses, we ask for the most probable evolution of particles along with the most likely killing rate as the particles transition between the specified marginals. Our approach differs sharply from previous work involving a Feynman–Kac multiplicative reweighing of the reference measure. The latter, as we argue, is far from Schrödinger’s quest. An iterative scheme, generalizing the celebrated Fortet–IPF–Sinkhorn algorithm, permits the computation of the new drift and the new killing rate of the path-space solution measure. We also formulate and solve a related fluid-dynamic control problem for the flow of one-time marginals where both the drift and the new killing rate play the role of control variable. A numerical example illustrating the new theoretical results is also presented.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The committor function is a central object for quantifying transitions between metastable states in randomly perturbed dynamical systems. Recently, effective methods based on deep learning have been proposed to compute the committor function in high-dimensional systems. However, sampling training data in these methods remains a challenging task, particularly for systems with small noise. In this work, we propose a deep learning method in which the data are sampled from the equilibrium distribution of a modified potential. We introduce two such modified potentials: the first (scheme I) incorporates a bias formed by localized Gaussian functions along a one-dimensional variable constructed from the learned committor function; the second (scheme II) uses a bias involving the free energy associated with the learned committor function. We analyze the distribution of the sampled data and show that, in both schemes, the data are well spread out and effectively cover the transition tube. Both schemes enable adaptive learning of the committor function without requiring prior knowledge of the transition pathways. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated using high-dimensional examples, including the alanine dipeptide and a solvated dimer system.

In this work, we propose a balanced multicomponent and multilayer neural network (MMNN) structure to accurately and efficiently approximate functions with complex features in terms of both degrees of freedom and computational cost. The main idea is inspired by a multicomponent approach in which each component can be effectively approximated by a single-layer network, combined with a multilayer decomposition strategy to capture the complexity of the target function. Although MMNNs can be viewed as a simple modification of fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) or multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) by introducing balanced multicomponent structures, they achieve a significant reduction in training parameters, a much more efficient training process, and improved accuracy compared to FCNNs or MLPs. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MMNNs in approximating highly oscillatory functions and their ability to automatically adapt to localized features.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Classical model reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. While those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these issues, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initializing a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modeling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% fewer parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.

Without data transfers between a CPU and GPU, our implementation has achieved the elimination of a major performance bottleneck under a memory-bound situation, particularly when solving many small problems in batch. We discuss the design principles and implementation details for our kernel function and core operations. Different design choices are justified by numerical experiments. By using the application of distributed control of alternating current optimal power flow, where a large problem is decomposed into many smaller nonlinear programs using a Lagrangian approach, we demonstrate computational performance of ExaTron on the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

To treat the material interface with higher-order accuracy, we develop the balanced conditions related to spatial derivatives at material interfaces for 2D planar and axisymmetric compressible multimedium flows. We then employ these balanced conditions to describe the interfacial physical properties and disclose that these conditions cannot be satisfied for the current ghost fluid methods, resulting in a first-order temporal error occurring in the region of the interface. To fix this difficulty, a multimedium generalized Riemann problem is proposed to predict the states and the spatial derivatives along the normal direction at the interface, in which the balanced conditions are imposed. Theoretical analysis and numerical results show that the proposed 2nd-MGFM can satisfy these balanced conditions, effectively eliminate the first-order major error term, suppress numerical overheating, and improve mass conservation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose high-order compact splitting Fourier spectral methods to compute the dynamics of dipolar Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) with arbitrary-angle rotation. The Hamiltonian is split into a linear part that consists of the Laplace and rotation and a nonlinear part that includes all the remaining terms. For the linear subproblem, we factorize the linear operator into a product of simple suboperators using the exact classical-quantum correspondence and semigroups decomposition, and these suboperators are integrated exactly in either physical or phase space. Importantly, we first derive explicit formulas for the splitting coefficients originally obtained by numerically solving a nonlinear system. The nonlinear part is solved exactly in physical space, and the convolution-type nonlocal potential with a singular kernel is computed via the Far-field Smooth Approximation (FSA) method with spectral accuracy. This “compact” splitting, involving only two operators, significantly simplifies the design of high-order schemes. Our method achieves high-order temporal precision and spectral spatial accuracy with near-optimal efficiency, and it is explicit, easy to implement and unconditionally stable. In addition, we derive some dynamical properties and conduct a comprehensive investigation, including accuracy confirmation, property verification, interaction of quantized vortices, and dynamics under honeycomb potential.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose a model order reduction approach to speed up the computation of seismograms, i.e., the solution of the seismic wave equation evaluated at a receiver location, for different model parameters. This is highly relevant for seismic applications, such as full waveform inversion, seismic tomography, or monitoring tools of seismicity, that are computationally challenging, as the discretized (forward) model often has a huge number of unknowns and needs to be solved many times for different model parameters. Our approach achieves a reduction of the unknowns by a factor of approximately 1000 for various numerical experiments for a two-dimensional subsurface model of Groningen, the Netherlands (a region known for its seismic activity), even if the (known) wave speeds of the subsurface are relatively varied. Moreover, when using multiple cores to construct the reduced model, we can approximate the (time domain) seismogram in a lower wall-clock time than an implicit Newmark-beta method. To realize this reduction, we exploit the fact that seismograms are low-pass filtered for the observed seismic events. We thus consider the Laplace-transformed problem in the frequency domain and implicitly restrict ourselves to the frequency range of interest by adjusting the parameters of a source function, which is a popular model in computational seismology for the temporal response of an earthquake. Therefore, we can avoid the high frequencies that would require many reduced basis functions to reach the desired accuracy and generally make the reduced order approximation of wave problems challenging. Instead, we can prove for our ansatz that for a fixed subsurface model, the reduced order approximation converges exponentially fast in the frequency range of interest in the Laplace domain. We build the reduced model from solutions of the Laplace-transformed problem via a (proper orthogonal decomposition-)greedy algorithm targeting the construction of the reduced model to the time domain seismograms; the latter is achieved by using an a posteriori error estimator that does not require computing any time domain counterparts. Finally, we show that we obtain a stable reduced model, thus overcoming the challenge that standard model reduction approaches do not necessarily yield a stable reduced model for wave problems.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the eigenvalue problem for the magnetic Schrödinger operator and take advantage of a property called gauge invariance to transform the given problem into an equivalent problem that is more amenable to numerical approximation. More specifically, we propose a canonical magnetic gauge that can be computed by solving a Poisson problem that yields a new operator having the same spectrum but eigenvectors that are less oscillatory. Extensive numerical tests demonstrate that accurate computation of eigenpairs can be done more efficiently and stably with the canonical magnetic gauge. Reproducibility of computational results.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) is the most appropriate model for extracting thermal properties of semiconductors from state-of-the-art frequency-domain thermo-reflectance (FDTR) experimental data. However, solving the BTE is computationally expensive because of its high-dimensionality, resulting in prohibitive time-to-solution. Scalable parallelization of the BTE solver that can avail supercomputing resources is desirable. We developed an adaptive parallelization strategy for the implicit solution of the multidimensional phonon BTE in the time domain. This adaptive method minimizes load imbalance and unnecessary computations in previously used band and cell-based partitioning schemes, achieved an average speedup of compared to the nonadaptive counterpart, and maintained strong scalability at cores. This new solver was used to simulate an FDTR experiment. The results (phase lag between the probe and pulse laser signals) are validated against experimental measurements and show good agreement. Our developed strategies can be applied to other computationally challenging problems constrained by limited parallelism.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent years have witnessed the introduction and development of extremely fast rational function algorithms. Many ideas in this realm arose from polynomial-based linear-algebraic algorithms. However, polynomial approximation is occasionally ill-suited to specific challenging tasks arising in several situations. Some occasions require maximal efficiency in the number of encoding parameters while retaining the renowned accuracy of polynomial-based approximation. One application comes from promoting empirical pointwise functions to sparse matrix operators. Another is the robust representation of noisy data without overfitting. Rational function approximations provide a simple but flexible alternative (actually a superset), allowing one to capture complex nonlinearities without oscillatory artifacts. However, these come with extra challenges: i) coping with singularities and near singularities arising from a vanishing denominator, and ii) a nonuniqueness owing to the simultaneous renormalization of both numerator and denominator. We, therefore, introduce a new rational function framework using manifestly positive and normalized Bernstein polynomials for the denominator and any traditional polynomial basis (e.g., Chebyshev) for the numerator. While an expressly nonsingular approximation slightly reduces the maximum degree of compression, it keeps all the benefits of rational functions while maintaining the flexibility and robustness of polynomials, especially in noisy data scenarios. We illustrate the relevant aspects of this approach with a series of derivations and computational examples. Reproducibility of computational results.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Solving the Boltzmann-BGK equation with traditional numerical methods suffers from high computational and memory costs due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a novel accuracy-preserved tensor-train (APTT) method to efficiently solve the Boltzmann-BGK equation. A second-order finite difference scheme is applied to discretize the Boltzmann-BGK equation, resulting in a tensor algebraic system at each time step. Based on the low-rank TT representation, the tensor algebraic system is then approximated as a TT-based low-rank system, which is efficiently solved using the TT-modified alternating least-squares (TT-MALS) solver. Thanks to the low-rank TT representation, the APTT method can significantly reduce the computational and memory costs compared to traditional numerical methods. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the APTT method maintains the same convergence rate as that of the finite difference scheme. The convergence rate and efficiency of the APTT method are validated by several benchmark test cases.},

This paper is concerned with the approximation of probability distributions known up to normalization constants, with a focus on Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in scientific computing. In this context, key challenges include costly repeated evaluations of forward models, multimodality, and inaccessible gradients for the forward model. To address them, we develop a variational inference framework that combines the Fisher–Rao natural gradient with specialized quadrature rules to enable derivative free updates of Gaussian mixture variational families. The resulting method, termed derivative free Gaussian mixture variational inference (DF-GMVI), guarantees covariance positivity and affine invariance, offering a stable and efficient framework for approximating complex posterior distributions. The effectiveness of DF-GMVI is demonstrated through numerical experiments on challenging scenarios, including distributions with multiple modes, infinitely many modes, and curved modes in spaces with up to 100 dimensions. The method’s practicality is further demonstrated in a large-scale application, where it successfully recovers the initial conditions of the Navier–Stokes equations from solution data at positive times.

We introduce a novel sliding interface formulation for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) between a rotating rigid structure and incompressible fluid, improving existing methodologies with a skew-symmetric Nitsche’s stabilization term applied on an artificial sliding interface alongside a rotational arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian framework. This innovative approach not only preserves the energy-dissipating property at the continuous level but also provides a robust foundation for further advancements in FSI modeling. Our methodology includes a first-order full discretization that maintains these critical energy-dissipating properties at the discrete level, ensuring numerical stability and accuracy. While prior contributions such as the original sliding interface method introduced by Bazilevs and Hughes (Comput. Mech., 43(1):143–150, 2008) have been significant, theoretical analyses such as the inf-sup condition on nonmatching meshes have gone largely unaddressed. We fill this gap by proving the inf-sup condition within the context of the isoparametric finite element method (FEM), where meshes are not only nonmatching but also overlapping, thus extending the applicability and robustness of our approach. Leveraging this inf-sup condition along with the inherent energy-dissipating properties, we establish the unique solvability of the fully discrete scheme. Through extensive numerical experiments, we illustrate the convergence, efficiency, and energy-dissipating property of the proposed method.},

We focus on the recently proposed transform-then-solve approach, which amounts to first applying a specific algebraic transformation to the linear system of equations arising from the discretization and then solving the transformed system with an algebraic multigrid method. Promising results have been previously obtained with a two-grid variant, and here we bring two key improvements to make the approach robust in a multilevel setting. For a model problem with a constant convection field, it is shown, in a local Fourier analysis setting, that the two-grid method is convergent at any level of the hierarchy, with bounds that are independent of both the mesh size and the Reynolds number. Numerical results with a K-cycle multigrid scheme confirm the theoretical expectations for constant coefficient problems. For problems with variable convective flow, the method appears also robust with grid independence convergence, although a mild dependency with respect to the Reynolds number shows up at very low viscosity in driven cavity problems. The method is based on point coarsening and therefore, besides the system matrix, requires knowing, for each discrete unknown, which grid point it is associated with.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, a gradient flow model is presented for conducting ground state calculations in the Wigner formalism of many-body systems in the framework of density functional theory. Theoretically, an energy functional in the Wigner formalism is proposed, based on which the minimization problem is designed and analyzed for the ground state, providing a new perspective for ground state calculations of the Wigner function. Employing density functional theory, a gradient flow model is built upon the energy functional to obtain the ground state Wigner function representing the entire many-body system. Numerically, a parallelizable algorithm is developed using the operator splitting method and the Fourier spectral collocation method, whose numerical complexity of a single iteration is . Numerical experiments demonstrate the anticipated accuracy, encompassing the one-dimensional system with up to particles and the three-dimensional system with defect, showcasing the potential of our approach to large-scale simulations and computations of systems with defect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deterministic method for calculating the ground state Wigner function of the three-dimensional many-body system.},

We propose an inexact Newton linearization of the optimality conditions. Upon discretization by a finite element scheme, we obtain a sequence of large symmetric linear systems of saddle-point type. We use an augmented Lagrangian-based block triangular preconditioner in combination with the flexible GMRES method at each Newton step. The preconditioner is applied inexactly via a suitable multigrid solver. Numerical experiments indicate that the resulting method appears to be fairly robust with respect to viscosity, mesh size, and the choice of regularization parameter when applied to 2D problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a new method to jointly reduce the dimension of the input and output space of a function between high-dimensional spaces. Choosing a reduced input subspace influences which output subspace is relevant and vice versa. Conventional methods focus on reducing either the input or output space, even though both are often reduced simultaneously in practice. Our coupled approach naturally supports goal-oriented dimension reduction, where either an input or output quantity of interest is prescribed. We consider, in particular, goal-oriented sensor placement and goal-oriented sensitivity analysis, which can be viewed as dimension reduction where the most important output or, respectively, input components are chosen. Both applications present difficult combinatorial optimization problems with expensive objectives such as the expected information gain and Sobol’ indices. By optimizing gradient-based bounds, we can determine the most informative sensors and most influential parameters as the largest diagonal entries of some diagnostic matrices, thus bypassing the combinatorial optimization and objective evaluation.

In this paper, we prove that this normalized multilevel error converges to different nontrivial limiting processes with various sharp rates $u_{n,m}$ depending on the behavior of the Lévy measure around zero. Our results are consistent with those of Jacod [Ann.

Here, $f$ is an unknown signal satisfying a certain restriction $f\in\mathfrak{F}$, $\varepsilon>0$ is a given parameter, and $W(\,{\cdot}\,)$ is the standard Wiener process.

One of the main conditions in the first of the three cases we consider (this case develops the ideas of Y. S. Chow [Ann. Math. Statist., 42 (1971), pp. 393--394]) is the Cesàro uniform integrability of the summands in the spirit of T. K. Chandra's studies of 1989--2012 on LLNs for pairwise independent random variables. In this result, the pairwise dependence conditions are replaced by quite different weak dependence type conditions in the spirit of A.N. Kolmogorov's paper [Atti Accad. Naz. Lincei Rend. (6), 9 (1929), pp. 470--474]; the only difference is that, in the present paper, we impose conditions only on the first moments of some conditional expectations, rather than on their second moments. In the second case, which is based on a slightly different weak dependence condition, we use the method of telescopic expansion and the fact that the convergence in probability to a constant can be interpreted as weak convergence. In the third case, we establish an LLN for summands without finite expectations, assuming, again, that they are not necessarily identically distributed.},
