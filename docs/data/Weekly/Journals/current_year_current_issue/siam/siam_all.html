  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper discusses the control of coherent structures in turbulent flows, which has broad applications among complex systems in science and technology. Mean field games have been proved a powerful tool and are proposed here to control the stochastic Lagrangian particles as players tracking the flow and tracer fields. We derive optimal control solutions for general nonlinear fluid systems using mean-field game models and develop computational algorithms to efficiently solve the resulting coupled forward and backward mean-field system. A precise link is established for the control of passive tracer density and the scalar vorticity field based on the functional Hamilton–Jacobi equations derived from the mean field models. A new iterative numerical strategy is then constructed to compute the optimal solution with fast convergence. We verify the skill of the mean-field control models and illustrate their practical efficiency on a prototype model modified from the viscous Burgers equation under various cost functions in both deterministic and stochastic formulations. The good model performance implies potential effectiveness of the strategy for more general high-dimensional turbulent systems.},

We then develop a machine learning framework, based on tensor neural networks, to solve the derived equations, especially the high-dimensional cell problems. The proposed method offers a novel approach to designing numerical algorithms for a broader class of multiscale problems with high accuracy.

  abstract     = {Abstract. There is a well-established understanding of maximizing and minimizing local stretching associated with a map; this can be couched in terms of an eigenproblem associated with the Cauchy–Green tensor. The local eigenvalues correspond to stretching rates, while the eigenvector directions identify maximal and minimal stretching directions. Generating hyperstreamlines of these eigenvector fields has been popular; however various claims that these collections of curves correspond to global optimizers of stretching remain unsubstantiated. In this paper, a formulation in terms of restricted foliations is presented, for which these curves form a well-defined solution as the most and least unstable objects, with respect to a global definition. The theory works for any map in -dimensions, derived, for example, from repeated applications of a discrete dynamical system, or from a finite-time flow of a continuous one. Further insight is obtained into the two-dimensional situation via an elementary approach, including a simple singularity classification criterion and an understanding of numerical artifacts in foliation computations (e.g., special curves along which hyperstreamlines veer and/or do not cross). Illustrations and validations of the results to the Hénon map, the double-gyre flow, and the standard (Chirikov) map are provided.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the last decade, some algebraic tools have been successfully applied to phylogenetic reconstruction. These tools are mainly based on the knowledge of equations describing algebraic varieties associated to Markov processes of molecular substitution on phylogenetic trees, the so called phylogenetic invariants. Although the theory involved allows for the explicit determination of these equations for all equivariant models (which include some of the most popular nucleotide substitution models), practical uses of these algebraic tools have been restricted to the case of the general Markov model. Arguably, one of the reasons for this restriction is that knowledge of linear representation theory is required before making these equations explicit. With the aim of enlarging the practical uses of algebraic phylogenetics, in this paper we prove that phylogenetic invariants for equivariant models can be derived from phylogenetic invariants for the general Markov model without the need of representation theory. Our main result states that the algebraic variety corresponding to an equivariant model on a phylogenetic tree is an irreducible component of the variety corresponding to the general Markov model on intersected with the linear space defined by the model. We also prove that for any equivariant model, those phylogenetic invariants that are relevant for practical uses (e.g., tree reconstruction) can be simply deduced from a single rank constraint on the matrices obtained by flattening the joint distribution at the leaves of the tree. This condition can be easily tested from singular values of the matrices, and it allows us to extend our results from trees to phylogenetic networks.},

Rank-metric codes have been a central topic in coding theory due to their theoretical and practical significance, with applications in network coding, distributed storage, crisscross error correction, and post-quantum cryptography. Recent research has focused on constructing new families of rank-metric codes with distinct algebraic structures, emphasizing the importance of invariants for distinguishing these codes from known families and from random ones. In this paper, we introduce a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate Gabidulin codes from random ones. From a geometric perspective, this approach investigates the vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code.},

This problem models the nondestructive testing for a partially buried object from electrostatic measurements on the accessible part of the boundary. The main novelty is the extension of the linear sampling and factorization methods to an electrostatic problem with partial measurements. These methods so far have only mainly applied to recovering interior defects, which is a simpler problem. Another important aspect of this paper is in our numerics, where we derive a system of boundary integral equations to recover the mixed Green’s function needed for our inversion. With this, we are able to analytically and numerically solve the inverse shape problem. For the inverse parameter problem, we prove uniqueness and Lipschitz-stability (in a finite dimensional function space) assuming that one has the associated Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator on the accessible part of the boundary.},

Understanding the mechanisms that drive biodiversity and ecosystem resilience in a rapidly changing world requires a deeper investigation into behavioral diversity among individuals. Consistent individual differences in behavior, often referred to as animal personality, play a crucial role in shaping ecological and evolutionary dynamics, particularly in foraging behavior. Traditional approaches in behavioral and evolutionary ecology typically focus on average behavior, neglecting the significance of individual variability. This study explores the influence of consumer personality on ecological dynamics, specifically examining how variations in food availability affect behavioral strategies and ecosystem functioning. We develop a consumer-resource model that incorporates personality-dependent saturating attack rates based on the mean-field ratio of resources to consumers. The well-posedness of the model is established, and we analyze the existence and stability of all steady-state solutions. Through bifurcation analysis, we identify critical transition parameters and describe the nonlinear phenomena induced by personality-dependent attack rates. Our findings demonstrate that boldness in consumers enhances their persistence, particularly under low levels of boldness, where populations can survive even with moderate or high food supply, which was not captured in classical frameworks.},

In this paper, a model where microscopic organisms carry out the dweller-wanderer conversion is considered; the conversion occurs at microscopic time scale and is based solely on the chemical concentrations. Cells in the dweller state are modeled with zero diffusivity, while those in the wanderer state are assigned positive diffusivity, resulting in a coupled system of an ODE and a PDE. The paper demonstrates the existence and uniqueness of the system, and convergence to chemotaxis models as the time scale parameter .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many scientific questions can be framed as asking for a first passage time (FPT), which generically describes the time it takes a random “searcher” to find a “target.” The important timescale in a variety of biophysical systems is the time it takes the fastest searcher(s) to find a target out of many searchers. Previous work on such fastest FPTs assumes that all searchers are initially present in the domain, which makes the problem amenable to extreme value theory. In this paper, we consider an alternative model in which searchers progressively enter the domain at a constant “immigration” rate. In the fast immigration rate limit, we determine the probability distribution and moments of the th fastest FPT. Our rigorous theory applies to many models of stochastic motion, including random walks on discrete networks and diffusion on continuous state spaces. Mathematically, our analysis involves studying the extrema of an infinite sequence of random variables which are both not independent and not identically distributed. Our results constitute a rare instance in which extreme value statistics can be determined exactly for strongly correlated random variables.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper we use singular perturbation theory to solve the 2D narrow capture problem for a set of partially accessible targets , in a bounded domain . In contrast to previous models of narrow capture, we assume that when a searcher finds a target by attaching to the partially adsorbing surface it does not have immediate access to the resources within the target interior. Instead, the searcher remains attached to the surface for a random waiting time , after which it either gains access to the resources within (surface absorption) or detaches and continues its search process (surface desorption). We also consider two distinct desorption scenarios – either the particle continues its search from the point of desorption or rapidly returns to its initial search position. In applications to animal foraging, the latter would correspond to an animal returning to its home base whereas the resources within a target could represent food or shelter. We formulate the narrow capture problem in terms of a set of renewal equations that relate the probability density and target flux densities for absorption to the corresponding quantities for irreversible adsorption. The renewal equations, which effectively sew together successive rounds of adsorption and desorption prior to the final absorption event, provide a general probabilistic framework for incorporating non-Markovian models of desorption/absorption and different search scenarios following desorption. We solve the general renewal equations in two stages. First, we calculate the Laplace transformed target fluxes for irreversible adsorption by solving a Robin boundary value problem (BVP) in the small-target limit using matched asymptotic analysis. We then use the inner solution of the BVP to solve the corresponding Laplace transformed renewal equations for non-Markovian desorption/absorption, which leads to explicit Neumann series expansions of the corresponding target fluxes. Finally, the latter are used to determine the corresponding splitting probabilities and conditional mean FPTs for absorption.},

The quadratic autocatalytic reaction, a pivotal step in many reaction systems, is closely monitored by the complexing agent, which tracks the reaction process and locates the position of the reaction front, underscoring its significance. Thus, it is interesting to study how the complexation reaction affects traveling waves in the quadratic autocatalytic system. Two critical questions on traveling waves of a system are (1) does there exist a such that a traveling wave with speed exists if and only if and (2) if such a exists, is the minimum wave speed derived from the linearization of the system at the unstable steady state? For the quadratic autocatalytic reaction system without complexation reactions, the answers to these two questions are affirmative. However, in the presence of a complexing agent, we give sufficient conditions for linear and nonlinear minimal speed selection mechanisms in different parameter regimes. Our findings reveal that the complex agent, far from being a passive observer, plays a dynamic and active role in the wave propagation of the quadratic autocatalytic reaction system, significantly impacting its behavior.},

In the present work, we develop and analyze such a model based on harmonic functions and linear diffusion. Our general problem is known to be NP-hard and that the objective function is monotone and submodular; consequently, we can greedily approximate the solution within a constant factor. Introducing and analyzing a convex relaxation, we show that the problem can be approximately solved using smooth optimization methods. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of example networks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The study of looping dynamics is a fundamental problem in chromatin dynamics. Previous studies focused on the mean first encounter time (MFET) for the two ends of a polymer to meet, revealing mixed scaling laws between MFET and chain length. However, most functional elements of chromatin are not located at the chain ends, raising questions about analytical scaling relationships for non-end-to-end MFETs. Through the asymptotic expansion of the principal eigenvalue of the Fokker–Planck equation with absorbing boundary, we reveal a mixed scaling law between the MFET of monomer pairs deep within the polymer interior and their linear distance, and propose an approximate formula for the MFET of monomer pairs near the chain ends. Brownian simulations validate our analytical approximations. Our theoretical results highlight the differences in looping dynamics between the interior and exterior regions of polymer chains.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. When a fluid carrying a passive solute flows quickly through porous media, three key macroscale transport mechanisms occur. These mechanisms are diffusion, advection, and dispersion, all of which depend on the microstructure of the porous medium; however, this dependence remains poorly understood. For idealized microstructures, one can use the mathematical framework of homogenization to examine this dependence, but heterogeneous materials are more challenging. Here, we consider sorption of a solute by a two-dimensional microstructure comprising an array of adsorbent obstacles of smooth but arbitrary shape, the size and spacing of which can vary along the length of the porous medium. We use homogenization via the method of multiple scales to systematically upscale a microscale problem involving nonperiodic cells of varying area to obtain effective continuum equations for macroscale transport and sorption. The equations are characterized by the local porosity, an effective local adsorption rate, and an effective local anisotropic solute diffusivity. All of these macroscale properties depend nontrivially on the two degrees of microstructural geometric freedom in our problem; obstacle size, and obstacle spacing. Further, the coefficient of effective diffusivity comprises the molecular diffusivity, the suppressive effect of the presence of obstacles, and the enhancing effect of dispersion. To illustrate the mathematical model, we focus on a simple example geometry comprising circular obstacles on a hexagonal lattice, for which we numerically determine the macroscale permeability and effective diffusivity. We find a power law for the dispersive component of solute transport, consistent with classical Taylor dispersion.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this study, we obtain the exact switching time distributions between the free and bound gene states for a detailed stochastic model of an autoregulatory feedback loop with transcription, translation, mRNA, and protein decay, as well as protein-gene interactions. The analytical solution generalizes and corrects the previous ones obtained in [P. Visco, R. J. Allen, and M. R. Evans, Phys. Rev. Lett., 101 (2008), 118104] and [Z. Cao and R. Grima, Nat. Commun., 9 (2018), 3305] for a reduced model of an autoregulatory loop that ignores the mRNA dynamics. We find that when the mRNA dynamics is modelled explicitly, the holding time in the free gene state can produce three shapes of steady-state distributions (decaying, bell-shaped, and bimodal). In particular, the detailed model with both mRNA and protein descriptions can produce a distribution shape that the reduced model fails to capture—the detailed model of a negative (positive) feedback loop can display a bimodal (bell-shaped) holding time distribution, while the reduced model cannot. Interestingly, we find that an autoregulatory loop can produce a heavy-tailed holding time distribution and the origin of this phenomenon is clarified using our analytical solution. We also investigate how the distribution shape is affected by the type of feedback, the binding and unbinding rates, and the transcription rates. Finally, based on the distribution shape, we have developed a new method of inferring autoregulation using single-cell time-trace gene expression data.},

We establish a conditional Lipschitz stability of the inverse problem under a suitable a priori regularity assumption on the problem data, using a Volterra integral formulation of the problem.

Similarly, the electric field produced by a dielectric nano-particle (with positive but high permittivity) is given as a polarization of the incident magnetic field. In this work, we demonstrate that a hybrid dimer—composed of two closely coupled nano-particles, one plasmonic and the other dielectric—can polarize both the incident electric and the magnetic fields. Consequently, such hybrid dimers have the potential to modify both the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the surrounding medium. However, this dual modification occurs only when the two nano-particles share common resonant frequencies. We derive the asymptotic expansion of the fields generated by these hybrid dimers in the subwavelength regime for incident frequencies near their shared resonant frequencies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We settle the complexity of computing an equilibrium in atomic splittable congestion games with player-specific affine cost functions as we show that the computation is -complete. To prove that the problem is contained in , we develop a homotopy method that traces an equilibrium for varying flow demands of the players. A key technique for this method is to describe the evolution of the equilibrium locally by a novel block Laplacian matrix where each entry of the Laplacian is a Laplacian again. Using the properties of this matrix allows us to recompute efficiently the Laplacian after the support of the equilibrium changes by matrix pivot operations. These insights give rise to a path following formulation for computing an equilibrium where states correspond to supports that are feasible for some demands and neighboring supports are feasible for increased or decreased flow demands. A closer investigation of the block Laplacian system further allows us to orient the states giving rise to unique predecessor and successor states, thus putting the problem into . For the -hardness, we reduce from computing an approximate equilibrium of a bimatrix win-lose game. As a byproduct of our reduction we further show that computing a multiclass Wardrop equilibrium with class-dependent affine cost functions is -complete as well. As another byproduct of our -completeness proof, we obtain an algorithm that computes a continuum of equilibria parametrized by the players’ flow demand. For player-specific costs, the continuum may involve several increases and decreases of the demand and yields an algorithm that runs in polynomial space. For games with player-independent costs, only demand increases are necessary, yielding an algorithm computing all equilibria as a function of the flow demand that runs in time polynomial in the output.},

[Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson Super-logarithmic depth lower bounds via direct sum in communication complexity, in Proceedings of the Sixth Annual Structure in Complexity Theory Conference, IEEE Computer Society, Chicago, 1991, pp. 299–304] suggested approaching this problem by proving that the depth complexity of a composition of functions is roughly the sum of the depth complexities of and . They showed that the validity of this conjecture would imply that . The intuition that underlies the Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson (KRW) conjecture is that the composition should behave like a “direct-sum problem”, in a certain sense, and, therefore, the depth complexity of should be the sum of the individual depth complexities. Nevertheless, there are two obstacles toward turning this intuition into a proof: first, we do not know how to prove that must behave like a direct-sum problem; second, we do not know how to prove that the complexity of the latter direct-sum problem is indeed the sum of the individual complexities. In this work, we focus on the second obstacle. To this end, we study a notion called “strong composition”, which is the same as except that it is forced to behave like a direct-sum problem. We prove a variant of the KRW conjecture for strong composition, thus overcoming the above second obstacle. This result demonstrates that the first obstacle above is the crucial barrier toward resolving the KRW conjecture. Along the way, we develop some general techniques that might be of independent interest.},

The limit LQ-GMFGs with common noise are formulated based on the assumption that these graphs lie in a sequence converging to a limit graphon. By applying the spectral decomposition method, the existence of Nash equilibrium for the formulated limit LQ-GMFGs is derived. Moreover, based on the adequate convergence assumptions, a set of -Nash equilibrium strategies for the finite large population problem is constructed.

This stabilization problem was initiated by Mao in 2013 and has been intensively studied by many authors for the past ten years. In this paper, we will further develop an event-triggered control based on a trajectory of the state or output observations at discrete times. This is significantly different from most of the existing papers where an event-triggered mechanism for SDEs is designed based on a criterion in terms of the mathematical expectation of the system state. The novel approach in this paper is to relate the stability of the event-triggered controlled SDE to the stability of the corresponding uncertain SDE.},

We study reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of continuous-time linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems for diffusions, where states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent but volatilities of the state processes depend on both state and control variables. We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of up to a logarithmic factor, where is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.},

Part of the results, in particular those on global controllability, are specific to systems where all solutions with zero control are periodic. The associated conditions are expressed by means of pushforwards along the flow of the drift, rather than in terms of Lie brackets. It turns out that they amount to local controllability of a time-varying linear approximation with constrained controls. Global and local results are given, as well as a few illustrative examples.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In a recent paper by Chen et al. [SIAM J.

They established criteria for fundamental system-theoretic notions such as stability, reachability, and observability through tensor decomposition. Building on this new research direction, the purpose of our paper is to extend the study to continuous-time MLTI control systems. Specifically, we define Hamiltonian tensors and symplectic tensors, and we establish the Schur-Hamiltonian tensor decomposition and the symplectic tensor singular value decomposition (SVD). Based on these concepts, we propose the algebraic Riccati tensor equation (ARTE) and demonstrate that it has a unique positive semidefinite solution if the system is stabilizable and detectable. To find numerical solutions to the ARTE, we introduce a tensor-based Newton method. Additionally, we establish the tensor versions of the bounded real lemma and the small gain theorem. A first-order robustness analysis of the ARTE is also conducted. Finally, we provide a numerical example to illustrate the proposed theory and algorithms.},

The contributions of this work consist of two parts. The first one is that we set up a convergence analysis framework for the direct method and the Yau–Yau algorithm, which can show the deep connections between these two methods. They are different formulations of solving the robust DMZ equation by reducing it to solve the Yau–Yau PDE [B. Balaji, PMC Phys. A, 3 (2009), pp. 1–28]. The second one is that we prove the explicit convergence rates of the Yau–Yau algorithm with the spectral method and the direct method with Gaussian approximation, in terms of the numbers of spectral basis and time steps.},

The open-loop approach is employed to achieve optimal spatial convergence rates, while the Riccati-based closed-loop approach enhances temporal convergence rates and reduces the computational complexity.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper presents a comprehensive study of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs) in Hilbert spaces, generalizing the classic LQ MFG theory to scenarios involving agents with dynamics governed by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, both state and control processes of each agent take values in separable Hilbert spaces. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population which appears in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. Specifically, the dynamics of each agent incorporates an infinite-dimensional noise, namely a -Wiener process, and an unbounded operator. The diffusion coefficient of each agent is stochastic involving the state, control, and average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of coupled semilinear infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations establishing the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. We then specialize to -player LQ games described above and study the asymptotic behavior as the number of agents, approaches infinity. We develop an infinite-dimensional variant of the Nash certainty equivalence principle and characterize a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting MFG. Finally, we study the connections between the -player game and the limiting MFG, demonstrating that the resulting limiting best-response strategies form an -Nash equilibrium for the -player game in Hilbert spaces. This property is established by showing that the mean field approximates the empirical average state within when agents follow these strategies.},

This work introduces a general computer-assisted methodology to prove that a given linear control system with compact constraints avoids a chosen unsafe set at a chosen final time . Relying on support hyperplanes, we devise a functional such that the property of interest is equivalent to finding a point at which the functional is negative. Actually evaluating the functional first requires time discretization. We thus provide explicit, fine discretization estimates for various types of matrices underlying the control problem. Second, computations lead to roundoff errors, which are dealt with by means of interval arithmetic. The control of both error types then leads to rigorous, computer-assisted proofs of nonreachability of the unsafe set. We illustrate the applicability and flexibility of our method in different contexts featuring various control constraints, unsafe sets, types of matrices, and problem dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Zero-sum linear quadratic (LQ) games are fundamental in optimal control and can be used (i) as a dynamic game formulation for risk-sensitive or robust control and (ii) as a benchmark setting for multiagent reinforcement learning with two competing agents in continuous state-control spaces. In contrast to the well-studied single-agent linear quadratic regulator problem, zero-sum LQ games entail solving a challenging nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problem with an objective function that lacks coercivity. Recently, Zhang et al. [Adv. Neural Inf. Process. Syst., 34 (2021), pp. 2949–2964] showed that an -Nash equilibrium (NE) of finite-horizon zero-sum LQ games can be learned via nested model-free natural policy gradient algorithms with poly sample complexity. In this work, we propose a simpler nested zeroth-order (ZO) algorithm improving sample complexity by several orders of magnitude and guaranteeing convergence of the last iterate. Our main result is twofold: (i) in the deterministic setting, we establish the first global last-iterate linear convergence result for the nested algorithm that seeks NE of zero-sum LQ games; (ii) in the model-free setting, we establish an sample complexity using a single-point ZO estimator. For our last-iterate convergence results, our analysis leverages the implicit regularization property and a new gradient domination condition for the primal function. Our key improvements in the sample complexity rely on a more sample-efficient nested algorithm design and a finer control of the ZO natural gradient estimation error utilizing the structure endowed by the finite-horizon setting.},

We present a new family of logit-Q dynamics for efficient learning in stochastic games by combining the log-linear learning (also known as logit dynamics) for the repeated play of normal-form games with Q-learning for unknown Markov decision processes within the auxiliary stage-game framework. In this framework, we view stochastic games as agents repeatedly playing some stage game associated with the current state of the underlying game while the agents’ Q-functions determine the payoffs of these stage games. We show that the logit-Q dynamics presented reach (near) efficient equilibrium in stochastic teams with unknown dynamics and quantify the approximation error. We also show the rationality of the logit-Q dynamics against agents following pure stationary strategies. The key idea is to approximate the dynamics with a fictional scenario where the Q-function estimates are stationary over epochs whose lengths grow at a sufficiently slow rate. We then couple the dynamics in the main and fictional scenarios to show that these two scenarios become more and more similar across epochs due to the vanishing step size and growing epoch lengths.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Switching among affine systems under dwell-time constraints in order to steer the state as close as possible to a desired point involves the consideration of a nontrivial region into which the state is eventually driven and maintained. Suitable regions for this aim have the following property: For every point within the region, a switching law satisfying the dwell-time constraint exists so that the trajectory beginning at that point remains within the region for all future times. This paper focuses on addressing and characterizing the latter property, which is here called switching-controlled invariance (SCI) with dwell time, through a convexity-based approach. It is shown that SCI of a set is equivalent to the existence of some cover of , where each subset in the cover can be selected to share specific properties of : convexity, closedness, boundedness, and, most important, polytopic structure. Our theoretically most important result is to establish that if an SCI with dwell time set is a (closed and convex) polytope and the switched affine system has subsystems, then can be covered by subpolytopes so that the state trajectories beginning within each subpolytope are kept within during at least one dwell time without switching. This result is highly nontrivial, is not true for other geometric structures such as ellipsoids, and further motivates the consideration of polytopic sets in the control of switched affine systems with dwell time.},

Motivated by the concepts of volumetric controllability score (VCS) and average energy controllability score (AECS) proposed for linear time-invariant systems, we consider the generalization of such concepts to switched linear systems in this paper. The key step of the generalization is to build a similar link between the controllability scores and the optimization objects as in the time-invariant case. Through the link, two families of convex optimization problems, corresponding to the concepts of generalized VCS (GVCS) and generalized AECS (GAECS), respectively, are proposed. Then, we show the uniqueness of the solutions to these problems. These unique solutions are exactly the finite-time controllability scores we want, which provide a quantitative measure of the importance of each state node on controllability during each switching interval. Besides, an algorithm is provided to calculate the GVCS and GAECS based on the projected gradient method. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the generalized scores to evaluate the importance of each state node on controllability under a switched network structure.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work investigates the optimal control problem for reflected McKean–Vlasov SDEs and the viscosity solutions to Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equations on the Wasserstein space in terms of intrinsic derivative. It follows from the flow property of reflected McKean–Vlasov SDEs that the dynamic programming principle holds. Applying the decoupling method and the heat kernel estimates for parabolic equations, we show that the value function is a viscosity solution to an appropriate HJB equation on the Wasserstein space, where the characterization of absolutely continuous curves on the Wasserstein space by the continuity equations plays an important role. To establish the uniqueness of the viscosity solution, we generalize the construction of a distance-like function initiated in Burzoni et al. [SIAM J. Control Optim., 58 (2020), pp. 1676–1699] to the Wasserstein space over multidimensional space and show its effectiveness for coping with HJB equations in terms of intrinsic derivative on the Wasserstein space.},

In an influential article, Papadimitriou [On selecting a satisfying truth assignment, in Proceedings of the 32nd Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 1991, pp. 163–169] proved that a local search algorithm called WalkSAT finds a satisfying assignment of a satisfiable 2-CNF with variables in expected time. Variants of the WalkSAT algorithm have become a mainstay of practical SAT solving (see, e.g., [Hoos and Stützle, J. Autom. Reason., 24 (2000), pp. 421–481]). In the present article, we analyze the expected running time of WalkSAT on random 2-SAT instances. Answering a question raised by Alekhnovich and Ben-Sasson [SIAM J.

The dynamics of the underlying asset is modeled by the Euler scheme of a Brownian diffusion with affine drift, and convex volatility. We prove that the value function associated to the stochastic optimal control problem is a convex function of the underlying asset price. We also introduce a domination criterion offering insights into the functional monotonicity of the value function with respect to parameters of the underlying dynamics. We particularly focus on the one-dimensional setting where, by means of Stein’s formula and regularization techniques, we show that the convexity assumption for the volatility dynamics can be relaxed with a semiconvexity assumption. Finally, to validate our results, we also conduct numerical illustrations.},

It involves mapping a surface in three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional parameter space. This process allows for the systematic representation and manipulation of surfaces of complicated shapes by simplifying them into a manageable planar domain. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm for computing the parameterization of simply connected open surfaces that achieves an optimal balance between angle and area distortions. We rigorously prove the global convergence of the iteration in our algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the resulting mappings are bijective and effectively balance angular and area accuracy across various triangular meshes. Additionally, we present the practical usefulness of the proposed algorithm by applying it to represent surfaces as geometry images.},

In different regions of the -parameter plane, maximality is conjectured for the ball, the vertices of a regular simplex, or the endpoints of an interval. These cases are separated by a symmetry-breaking transition region where the shape of maximizers remains unclear. On the boundary of -parameter space, one encounters existing theorems and conjectures, including Watanabe’s theorem minimizing Riesz capacity for given volume, the classical isodiametric theorem that maximizes volume for given diameter, Szegő’s isodiametric theorem maximizing Newtonian capacity for given diameter, and the still-open isodiametric conjecture for Riesz capacity. The first quadrant of parameter space contains Pólya and Szegő’s conjecture on maximizing Newtonian over logarithmic capacity for planar sets. The maximal shape for each of these scenarios is known or conjectured to be the ball. Maximizers are quite different in the third quadrant where and are both negative. On the outer boundary of the quadrant, where one of or equals and the other is suitably negative, maximality is proved to occur when consists of the endpoints of an interval or else the vertices of a regular simplex. Considerably stronger results are shown in dimensions 1 and 2, where intervals, endpoints of intervals, and vertices of equilateral triangles provide the maximizers in large regions of the third quadrant.},

Motivated by recent interest in elastic problems in which the target space is non-Euclidean, we study a limit where local rest distances within an elastic body are incompatible, yet close to, distances within the ambient space. Specifically, we obtain, via -convergence, a limit elastic model for a sequence of elastic bodies in an ambient space , for Riemannian metrics and such that . Furthermore, we relate the minimum of the limit problem to a linearized curvature discrepancy between and , using recent results of Kupferman and Leder [Forum Math. Sigma, 13 (2025), e51]. This relation confirms a linearized version of a long-standing conjecture in elasticity regarding the relation between the elastic energy and the curvature of the underlying space. The main technical challenge, compared to other linearization results in elasticity, is obtaining the correct notion of displacement for manifold-valued configurations, using Sobolev truncations and parallel transport. We show that the associated compactness result is obtained if satisfies a quantitative rigidity property, analogous to the Friesecke–James–Müller rigidity estimate in Euclidean space, and show that this property holds when is a round sphere.},

Degenerate mean field type control problems are rarely studied in the literature. Our method is based on a lifting approach which embeds the control problem and the associated FBSDEs in Wasserstein spaces into certain Hilbert spaces. We use a continuation method to establish the solvability of the FBSDEs and that of the Gâteaux derivatives of these FBSDEs. We then explore the regularity of the value function in time and in measure argument, and we also show that it is the unique classical solution of the associated Bellman equation.

We prove exponential instability properties for the fractional Calderón problem and the conductivity formulation of the fractional Calderón problem in the regime of fractional powers . We particularly focus on two settings: First, we discuss instability properties in general domain geometries with scaling critical potentials and constant background metrics. Second, we investigate instability properties in general geometries with potentials and low regularity, variable coefficient, possibly anisotropic background metrics. In both settings, we make use of the methods introduced in Koch, Rüland, and Salo [Ars Inveniendi Anal., (2021), 7], and we deduce strong compression estimates for the forward problem. In the first setting, this is based on analytic smoothing estimates for a suitable comparison operator, while in the second setting, involving low regularity metrics, this is based on an iterated compression gain. We thus generalize the results from Rüland and Salo [Inverse Problems, 34 (2018), 045003] to generic geometries and variable coefficients and also further discuss the setting of fractional conductivity equations. In particular, this proves that the logarithmic stability estimates for the fractional Calderón problem from Rüland and Salo [Nonlinear Anal., 193 (2020), 111529] are optimal.},

For any weakly interacting particle system with bounded kernel, we give uniform-in-time estimates of the norm of correlation functions, provided that the diffusion coefficient is large enough.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, a reaction-diffusion system modeling tumor invasion is investigated. The model is proposed by renowned biologist and cancer expert Gatenby and his collaborator [R. A. Gatenby and E. T. Gawlinski, Cancer Res., 56 (1996), pp. 5745–5753]. The underlying partial differential equation system has cross-diffusion and density-dependent degenerate diffusion coefficient and involves the interactions of three quantities: tumor tissue density, acid concentration, and normal tissue density. The most challenging and interesting issue for the analysis of the current model is the existence of the traveling wave solution which signifies the invasion of tumor tissue into normal tissue. Because the diffusion of tumor tissue is influenced by the density of normal cells (cross-diffusion) and the diffusion coefficient is zero when normal cells are at the carrying capacity, this causes the diffusion coefficient of tumor tissue to be degenerate, a hallmark of the underlying partial differential equation (PDE) system. A rigorous proof of existence of traveling wave is proved for one-dimensional case.},

The fluid flow is described by quasi-static Stokes equations, and for the elastic solid, we consider linear elasticity equations, and both are coupled via continuity of the velocities and the normal stresses. The aim is to pass to the limit in the weak microscopic formulation by using multiscale techniques adapted to the simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction in continuum mechanics. The macroscopic limit model is given by a coupled Biot plate system consisting of a generalized Darcy law coupled to a Kirchhoff–Love-type plate equation including the Darcy pressure.},

We study second-order MFG PDI with convex, Lipschitz continuous, but possibly nondifferentiable, Hamiltonians, and their approximation by systems of classical MFG PDE with regularized Hamiltonians. Under very broad conditions on the problem data, we show that, up to subsequences, the solutions of the regularized problems converge to solutions of the MFG PDI. In particular, we show the convergence of the value functions in the -norm and of the densities in -norms. Under stronger hypotheses on the problem data, we also show rates of convergence between the solutions of the original and regularized problems, without requiring any higher regularity of the solutions. We give concrete examples that demonstrate the sharpness of several aspects of the analysis.},

We study formally determined inverse problems with passive measurements for one dimensional (1D) evolution equations where the goal is to simultaneously determine both the initial data as well as the variable coefficients in such an equation from the measurement of its solution at a fixed spatial point for a certain amount of time. This can be considered as a 1D model of widely open inverse problems in photo-acoustic and thermo-acoustic tomography. We provide global uniqueness results for wave and heat equations stated on bounded or unbounded spatial intervals. Contrary to all previous related results on the subject, we do not impose any genericity assumptions on the coefficients or initial data. Our proofs are based on creating suitable links to the well understood spectral theory for 1D Schrödinger operators. In particular, in the more challenging case of a bounded spatial domain, our proof for the inverse problem partly relies on the following two key ingredients, namely (i) Paley–Wiener type theorems due to Kahane [Annales de l’Institut Fourier, 7 (1957), pp. 293–314] and Remling [J. Funct. Anal., 196 (2002), pp. 323–394] that together provide a quantifiable link between support of a compactly supported function and the upper density of its vanishing Schrödinger spectral modes and (ii) a result of Gesztesy and Simon [Trans.

New developments of optical trapping techniques make it possible to confine atoms independently of their spin orientation in experiments and thus result in spinor condensates. As a continuation of our previous work [M. Li, X. Luo, J. Wei, and M. Zhen, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 56 (2024), pp. 4375–4414], we investigate physical states as well as qualitative properties describing the aggregation and extinction of atoms, of spin-1 Bose–Einstein condensate in an Ioffe–Pritchard magnetic field, through two conserved quantities, the number of atoms and the total magnetization. Unlike the related free case which is well studied in [Y. Z. Kong, Q. X. Wang, and D. Zhao, Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations, 60 (2021), 152] and our previous work, the presence of the Ioffe–Pritchard magnetic field, which competes dramatically with the harmonic trapping, requires new ideas to capture the physical states and analyze their qualitative properties.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multiphase poromechanics describes the evolution of multiphase flow in deformable porous media. Mathematical models for such multiphysics systems are inherently nonlinear, potentially degenerate, and fully coupled systems of partial differential equations. In this work, we present a thermodynamically consistent multiphase poromechanics model falling into the category of Biot equations and obeying a generalized gradient flow structure. It involves capillarity effects, degenerate relative permeabilities, and gravity effects. In addition to established models, it introduces a Lagrange multiplier associated to a bound constraint on the effective porosity in particular ensuring its positivity. We establish existence of global weak solutions under the assumption of a weak coupling strength, implicitly utilizing the gradient flow structure, as well as a twofold regularization, first, relaxing the porosity constraint to provide strong monotonicity of the underlying energy, and second, adding coercivity by mitigating the degeneracy in the relative permeability through uniform positivity. This finally enables a Faedo–Galerkin approach and compactness arguments including vanishing regularization. This comprises the first global existence result for multiphase poromechanics accounting for degeneracies that are consistent with the multiphase nature of the flow.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Plasma sheaths are inhomogeneous stationary states that form when a plasma is in contact with an absorbing wall. We prove linear and nonlinear stability of a kinetic sheath stationary state for a Vlasov–Poisson-type system in a bounded interval. Notably, in the linear setting, we obtain exponential decay of the fluctuation, provided the rate of injection of particles at equilibrium is smaller than the rate of absorption at the wall. In the nonlinear setting, we prove a similar result for a small enough equilibrium and a small localized perturbation of the equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The hard phase model describes a relativistic barotropic fluid with sound speed equal to the speed of light. In the framework of general relativity, the motion of the fluid is coupled to the Einstein equations which describe the structure of the underlying spacetime. This model with free boundary admits a 1-parameter family of steady states with spherical symmetry. In this work, for perturbations within spherical symmetry, we study the stability and instability of this family. We prove that the linearized operator around steady states with large central densities admits a growing mode, while such growing modes do not exist for steady states with small central densities. Based on the linear analysis, we further demonstrate a dynamical nonlinear instability for steady states with large central densities. The proof relies on a spectral analysis of the linearized operator and an a priori estimate on the full nonlinear free boundary problem.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present an energy method to prove finite speed of propagation (“FSOP”) for energy-dissipating solutions to stochastic thin-film equations with conservative nonlinear multiplicative noise under periodic boundary conditions. Physically, the equations under consideration correspond to weak slippage, i.e., the case of mobility exponents . Analytically, our approach relies on a new weighted decay estimate for appropriate powers of the solution which is set up in combination with Bernis inequalities and energy estimates. An intricacy related to this estimate are multiple power-type nonlinearities on the right-hand side —not occurring in previous studies for finite speed of propagation of stochastic versions of degenerate parabolic equations. They result from the different scaling behavior of the thin-film operator and the specific porous-medium operator which comes up as a correction term for Stratonovich or for Hänggi–Klimontovich noise. Combining this decay estimate with tailored filtering techniques, a qualitative result on finite speed of propagation is established.},

We show that the particle method converges as the number of particles goes to infinity towards weak measure solutions to the nonlocal equation. Such a results is proven under the assumption of initial data in the space of probability measures with finite second moment. In particular, our method is able to capture a measure-to- smoothing effect of the limit equation. Moreover, as the Morse potential is rescaled to approach a Dirac delta, corresponding to strongly localized repulsive interactions, the scheme becomes a particle approximation for the quadratic porous medium equation. We show that in the joint limit (localized repulsion and increasing number of particles) the reconstructed density converges to a weak solution of the porous medium equation. The strategy relies on various estimates performed at the particle level, including estimates and an entropy dissipation estimate, which benefit from the particular structure of our particle scheme and from the absolutely continuous reconstruction of the density from the particle locations.},

In this paper, we revisit the robustness to noise of SPA and several of its variants. In particular, when , we prove the tightness of the existing error bounds for SPA and for two more robust preconditioned variants of SPA. We also provide significantly improved error bounds for SPA, by a factor proportional to the conditioning of the vertices, in two special cases: for the first extracted vertex and when . We then provide further improvements for the error bounds of a translated version of SPA proposed by Arora et al. [Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, 2013, pp. 280–288] in two special cases: for the first two extracted vertices and when .

We derive a new explicit expression for the optimal backward error of a TLS system and relate it to the well-known result in the least squares setting. This work formally provides theoretical analysis on the feasibility of leveraging the LS information to solve the TLS problem. As for the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) subroutine, we innovate by substituting the complete Cholesky factorization with the sketching preconditioner.

In this paper, we develop the theory of perfect state transfer (PST) between real pure states with emphasis on the adjacency and Laplacian matrices as Hamiltonians of a graph representing a quantum spin network. We characterize PST between real pure states based on the spectral information of a graph and prove three fundamental results: (i) every periodic real pure state admits PST with another real pure state , (ii) every connected graph admits PST between real pure states, and (iii) for any pair of real pure states and and for any time , there exists a real symmetric matrix such that and admit PST relative to at time . We also determine all real pure states that admit PST in complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and cycles. This leads to a complete characterization of pair and plus state transfer in paths and complete bipartite graphs. We give constructions of graphs that admit PST between real pure states. Finally, using results on the spread of graphs, we prove that amongst all -vertex simple unweighted graphs, the least minimum PST time between real pure states is attained by any join graph for the Laplacian case, while it is attained by the join of an empty graph and a complete graph of appropriate sizes for the adjacency case.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Sketching-based preconditioners have been shown to accelerate the solution of dense least-squares problems with coefficient matrices having substantially more rows than columns. The cost of generating these preconditioners can be reduced by employing low precision floating-point formats for all or part of the computations. We perform finite precision analysis of a mixed precision algorithm that computes the -factor of a QR factorization of the sketched coefficient matrix. Two precisions can be chosen and the analysis allows understanding how to set these precisions to exploit the potential benefits of low precision formats and still guarantee an effective preconditioner. If the nature of the least-squares problem requires a solution with a small forward error, then mixed precision iterative refinement (IR) may be needed. For ill-conditioned problems the GMRES-based IR approach can be used, but good preconditioner is crucial to ensure convergence. We theoretically show when the sketching-based preconditioner can guarantee that the GMRES-based IR reduces the relative forward error of the least-squares solution and the residual to the level of the working precision unit roundoff. Small numerical examples illustrate the analysis.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Communication, i.e., data movement, is a critical bottleneck for the performance of classical Krylov subspace method solvers on modern computer architectures. Variants of these methods which avoid communication have been introduced, which, while equivalent in exact arithmetic, can be unstable in finite precision. In this work, we address the backward stability of -step GMRES, also known as communication-avoiding GMRES. Building upon the “modular framework” proposed in [A. Buttari et al., preprint, hal-04525918v2, 2024.], we present an improved framework for simplifying the analysis of -step GMRES, which includes standard GMRES as a special case, by isolating the effects of rounding errors in the QR factorization and the solution of the least squares problem. The key advantage of this new framework is that it is evident how the orthogonalization method affects the backward error, and it is not necessary to reevaluate anything other than the orthogonalization itself when modifying the orthogonalization used in GMRES. Using this framework, we analyze -step GMRES with popular block orthogonalization methods: block modified Gram–Schmidt and reorthogonalized block classical Gram–Schmidt algorithms. An example illustrates the resulting instability of -step GMRES when paired with the classical -step Arnoldi process and shows the limitations of popular strategies for resolving this instability. To address this issue, we propose a modified -step Arnoldi process that allows for much larger block size while maintaining satisfactory accuracy, as confirmed by our numerical experiments. An example illustrates the resulting instability of s-step GMRES when paired with the classical s-step Arnoldi process and shows the limitations of popular strategies for resolving this instability. To address this issue, we propose a modified Arnoldi process that allows for much larger block size s while maintaining satisfactory accuracy, as confirmed by our numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The notion of “stable rank” of a matrix is essential in the analysis of randomized matrix algorithms, covariance estimation, deep neural networks, and recommender systems. We compare the properties of the stable rank of a real or complex matrix and the related concept of “intrinsic dimension” of a Hermitian positive semi-semidefinite matrix to those of the classical rank. Basic proofs and examples illustrate that the stable rank does not satisfy any of the fundamental rank properties, while the intrinsic dimension satisfies a few. In particular, the stable rank and intrinsic dimension of a submatrix can exceed those of the original matrix; adding a Hermitian positive semi-semidefinite matrix can lower the intrinsic dimension of the sum; and multiplication by a nonsingular matrix can drastically change the stable rank and intrinsic dimension. We generalize the concept of stable rank to the -stable rank in a Schatten -norm, thereby unifying the concepts of stable rank and intrinsic dimension: the stable rank is the 2-stable rank, while the intrinsic dimension is the 1-stable rank of a Hermitian positive semi-semidefinite matrix. We derive sum and product inequalities for the th root of the -stable rank and show that it is well-conditioned in the norm-wise absolute sense. The conditioning improves if the matrix and the perturbation are Hermitian positive semidefinite.},

In Parts I and II of this series of papers, three new methods for the computation of eigenvalues of singular pencils were developed: rank-completing perturbations, rank-projections, and augmentation. It was observed that a straightforward structure-preserving adaption for symmetric pencils was not possible and it was left as an open question how to address this challenge. In this Part III, it is shown how the observed issue can be circumvented by using Hermitian perturbations. This leads to structure-preserving analogs of the three techniques from Parts I and II for Hermitian pencils (including real symmetric pencils) as well as for skew-Hermitian, -even, -odd, and -(anti-)palindromic pencils. It is an important feature of these methods that the sign characteristic of the given pencil is preserved.},

We develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation-maximization algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of positive definite MLR matrix is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the recursive Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities, yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement.

We propose a novel and remarkably simple minimum-norm (MN) refinement that seamlessly integrates with the final MINRES iteration, enabling us to obtain the minimum-norm solution with negligible additional computational cost. We extend our MN refinement to complex-symmetric systems, building on S.-C. Choi’s extension of MINRES for solving these systems. Given the flexibility of MINRES to accommodate singular preconditioners, we further investigate the MN refinement in preconditioned settings that involve singular preconditioners. We also provide numerical experiments to support our analysis and showcase the effects of our MN refinement.},

When is Hermitian positive definite, the Lanczos method is the standard choice of Krylov method, and despite being very simplistic in nature, it often outperforms other, more sophisticated methods. In fact, one often observes that the error of the Lanczos method behaves almost exactly as the error of the best possible approximation from the Krylov space (which is in general not efficiently computable). However, theoretical guarantees for the deviation of the Lanczos error from the optimal error are mostly lacking so far (except for linear systems and a few other special cases). We prove a rigorous bound for this deviation when belongs to the important class of Stieltjes functions (which, e.g., includes inverse fractional powers as special cases) and a related class (which contains, e.g., the square root and the shifted logarithm), thus providing a near instance optimality guarantee.

Since optimization on Riemannian manifolds relies on the chosen metric, it is appealing to know how the performance of a Riemannian optimization method varies with different metrics and how to exquisitely construct a metric such that a method can be accelerated. To this end, we propose a general framework for optimization problems on product manifolds endowed with a preconditioned metric, and we develop Riemannian methods under this metric. Generally, the metric is constructed by an operator that aims to approximate the diagonal blocks of the Riemannian Hessian of the cost function. We propose three specific approaches to design the operator: exact block diagonal preconditioning, left and right preconditioning, and Gauss–Newton type preconditioning. Specifically, we tailor new preconditioned metrics and adapt the proposed Riemannian methods to the canonical correlation analysis and the truncated singular value decomposition problems, which provably accelerate the Riemannian methods. Additionally, we adopt the Gauss–Newton type preconditioning to solve the tensor ring completion problem. Numerical results among these applications verify that a delicate metric does accelerate the Riemannian optimization methods.},

While many algorithms have been developed to optimize some of these aspects, practical ID algorithms proficient in all aspects remain absent. To fill in the gap, we introduce robust blockwise random pivoting (RBRP) that is asymptotically fast, hardware efficient, and rank-adaptive, providing accurate skeletons and interpolation matrices comparable to the best existing ID algorithms in practice.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent advances in matrix-mimetic tensor frameworks have made it possible to preserve linear algebraic properties for multilinear data analysis and, as a result, to obtain optimal representations of multiway data. Matrix mimeticity arises from interpreting tensors as operators that can be multiplied, factorized, and analyzed analogously to matrices. Underlying the tensor operation is an algebraic framework parameterized by an invertible linear transformation. The choice of linear mapping is crucial to representation quality and, in practice, is made heuristically based on expected correlations in the data. However, in many cases, these correlations are unknown and common heuristics lead to suboptimal performance. In this work, we simultaneously learn optimal linear mappings and corresponding tensor representations without relying on prior knowledge of the data. Our new framework explicitly captures the coupling between the transformation and representation using variable projection. We preserve the invertibility of the linear mapping by learning orthogonal transformations with Riemannian optimization. We provide an original theory of the uniqueness of the transformation and convergence analysis of our variable-projection-based algorithm. We demonstrate the generality of our framework through numerical experiments on a wide range of applications, including financial index tracking, image compression, and reduced order modeling.

The algorithm carefully combines methods from randomized numerical linear algebra to accelerate pivot decisions for the input matrix and the process of decomposing the pivoted matrix into the QR form. The source of the latter improvement is CholeskyQR with randomized preconditioning. Comprehensive analysis is provided in both exact and finite-precision arithmetic to characterize the algorithm’s rank-revealing properties and its numerical stability granted probabilistic assumptions of the sketching operator. An implementation of the proposed algorithm is described and made available inside the open-source RandLAPACK library, which itself relies on RandBLAS. Experiments with this implementation on an Intel Xeon Gold 6248R CPU demonstrate order-of-magnitude speedups over LAPACK’s standard function for QRCP, and comparable performance to a specialized algorithm for unpivoted QR of tall matrices, which lacks the strong rank-revealing properties of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We are concerned with efficient numerical methods for stochastic continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations (SCARE). Such equations frequently arise from the state-dependent Riccati equation approach which is perhaps the only systematic way today to study nonlinear control problems. Often, involved Riccati-type equations are of small scale, but have to be solved repeatedly in real time. A new inner-outer iterative method that combines the fixed-point strategy and the structure-preserving doubling algorithm (SDA) is proposed. It is proved that the method is monotonically convergent to the desired stabilizing solution. Previously, Newton’s method has been called to solve SCARE, but it was mostly investigated from its theoretical aspects rather than numerical aspects in terms of robust and efficient numerical implementation. For that reason, we revisit Newton’s method for SCARE, focusing on how to make Newton’s method practical. Finally numerical experiments are conducted to validate the new method and robust implementations of Newton’s method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many recent theoretical works on meta-learning aim to achieve guarantees in leveraging similar representational structures from related tasks towards simplifying a target task. The main aim of theoretical guarantees on the subject is to establish the extent to which convergence rates—in learning a common representation—may scale with the number of tasks (as well as the number of samples per task). First steps in this setting demonstrate this property when both the shared representation amongst tasks and task-specific regression functions are linear. This linear setting readily reveals the benefits of aggregating tasks, e.g., via averaging arguments. In practice, however, the representation is often highly nonlinear, introducing nontrivial biases in each task that cannot easily be averaged out as in the linear case. In the present work, we derive theoretical guarantees for meta-learning with nonlinear representations. In particular, assuming the shared nonlinearity maps to an infinite dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we show that additional biases can be mitigated with careful regularization that leverages the smoothness of task-specific regression functions, yielding improved rates that scale with the number of tasks as desired.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Adversarial attacks are usually expressed in terms of a gradient-based operation on the input data and model; this results in heavy computations every time an attack is generated. Recent empirical works exhibit attacks that can be approximated by neural networks. This work provides a general theoretical framework to represent adversarial attacks as a trainable function without further gradient computation. We first motivate that the theoretical best attacks, under proper conditions, can be represented as smooth piecewise functions (piecewise Hölder functions). Then we obtain an approximation result of such functions by a neural network. Subsequently, we emulate the ideal attack process by a neural network and reduce the adversarial training to a mathematical game between an attack network and a training model (a defense network). We also obtain convergence rates of adversarial loss in terms of the sample size for adversarial training in such a setting.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is well known that when numerically simulating solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs), achieving a strong convergence rate better than (where is the step-size) usually requires the use of certain iterated integrals of Brownian motion, commonly referred to as its “Lévy areas,” However, these stochastic integrals are difficult to simulate due to their non-Gaussian nature. and for a -dimensional Brownian motion with , no fast almost-exact sampling algorithm is known. In this paper, we propose LévyGAN, a deep-learning-based model for generating approximate samples of Lévy area conditional on a Brownian increment. Due to our “bridge-flipping” operation, the output samples match all joint and conditional odd moments exactly. Our generator employs a tailored graph neural network (GNN)-inspired architecture, which enforces the correct dependency structure between the output distribution and the conditioning variable. Furthermore, we incorporate a mathematically principled characteristic-function-based discriminator. Lastly, we introduce a novel training mechanism, termed “Chen-training,” which circumvents the need for expensive-to-generate training data-sets. This new training procedure is underpinned by our two main theoretical results. For four-dimensional Brownian motion, we show that LévyGAN exhibits state-of-the-art performance across several metrics which measure both the joint and marginal distributions. We conclude with a numerical experiment on the log-Heston model, a popular SDE in mathematical finance, demonstrating that a high-quality synthetic Lévy area can lead to high order weak convergence and variance reduction when using multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC).},

These expansions are useful in a variety of contexts such as in the development of modified equation schemes, the design of high-order accurate energy stable discretizations, and error analysis of certain finite element or finite difference schemes. Here, we provide closed form expressions for the coefficients in the series expansions for derivatives of all orders. We also provide some short recursions defining the series coefficients, and formulae for the stencil coefficients in standard difference approximations. The series expansions are used to show some useful properties of the Fourier symbols of difference approximations and to derive rules of thumb for the number of points-per-wavelength needed to achieve a given error tolerance when solving wave propagation problems involving higher spatial derivatives.},

Furthermore, we design a diagonal preconditioner to efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional linear system by reducing the condition number of the stiffness matrix. These techniques collectively contribute to the computational effectiveness of our proposed approach. Convergence analysis shows the polynomial accuracy of the proposed method.

Specifically, we prove stability, show an a priori error bound, and show parameter scalings for the TR-ROM. Our numerical investigation shows that the theoretical convergence rate and the parameter scalings with respect to the ROM dimension and filter radius are recovered numerically. In addition, the parameter scaling can be used to extrapolate the time-relaxation parameter to other ROM dimensions and filter radii. Moreover, the parameter scaling with respect to the filter radius is also observed in the predictive regime.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent work established that rank overparameterization eliminates spurious local minima in nonconvex low-rank matrix recovery under the restricted isometry property (RIP). But this does not fully explain the practical success of overparameterization, because real algorithms can still become trapped at nonstrict saddle points (approximate second-order points with arbitrarily small negative curvature) even when all local minima are global. Moreover, the result does not accommodate for noisy measurements, but it is unclear whether such an extension is even possible, in view of the many discontinuous and unintuitive behaviors already known for the overparameterized regime. In this paper, we introduce a novel proof technique that unifies, simplifies, and strengthens two previously competing approaches—one based on escape directions and the other based on the inexistence of counterexample—to provide sharp global guarantees in the noisy overparameterized regime. We show, once local minima have been converted into global minima through slight overparameterization, that near-second-order points achieve the same minimax-optimal recovery bounds (up to small constant factors) as significantly more expensive convex approaches. Our results are sharp with respect to the noise level and the solution accuracy, and hold for both the symmetric parameterization and the asymmetric parameterization under a balancing regularizer; we demonstrate that the balancing regularizer is indeed necessary.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Model update (MU) and candidate evaluation (CE) are classical steps incorporated inside many stochastic trust-region (TR) algorithms. The sampling effort exerted within these steps, often decided with the aim of controlling model error, largely determines a stochastic TR algorithm’s sample complexity. Given that MU and CE are amenable to variance reduction, we investigate the effect of incorporating common random numbers (CRN) within MU and CE on complexity. Using ASTRO and ASTRO-DF as prototype first-order and zeroth-order families of algorithms, we demonstrate that CRN’s effectiveness leads to a range of complexities depending on sample-path regularity and the oracle order. For instance, we find that in first-order oracle settings with smooth sample paths, CRN’s effect is pronounced—ASTRO with CRN achieves a.s. sample complexity compared to a.s. in the generic no-CRN setting. By contrast, CRN’s effect is muted when the sample paths are not Lipschitz, with the sample complexity improving from a.s. to and a.s. in the zeroth- and first-order settings, respectively. Since our results imply that improvements in complexity are largely inherited from generic aspects of variance reduction, e.g., finite-differencing for zeroth-order settings and sample-path smoothness for first-order settings within MU, we anticipate similar trends in other contexts.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The optimistic gradient method has seen increasing popularity as an efficient first-order method for solving convex-concave saddle point problems. To analyze its iteration complexity, a recent work [A. Mokhtari, A. E. Ozdaglar, and S. Pattathil, SIAM J. Optim., 30 (2020), pp. 3230–3251] proposed an interesting perspective that interprets the optimistic gradient method as an approximation to the proximal point method. In this paper, we follow this approach and distill the underlying idea of optimism to propose a generalized optimistic method, which encompasses the optimistic gradient method as a special case. Our general framework can handle constrained saddle point problems with composite objective functions. Moreover, we also develop a backtracking line search scheme to select the step sizes without knowledge of the smoothness coefficients. By instantiating our general framework with a second-order oracle, we propose a second-order optimistic method and prove a complexity bound of in terms of the primal-dual gap in the convex-concave setting and a complexity bound of in terms of the distance to the optimal solution in the strongly-convex-strongly-concave setting, where is the Lipschitz constant of the Jacobian, is the strong convexity parameter, and is the initial Euclidean distance to the saddle point. We also establish convergence rates in terms of the tangent residual, which generalizes the operator norm as a metric in the unconstrained setting. Moreover, our line search scheme provably only requires a constant number of calls to a subproblem solver per iteration on average.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a new numerical method for solving a generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) involving players, incorporating general constraints formulated in Hilbert spaces. These constraints may include linear equality, linear inequality, or conic constraints. Instead of handling joint constraints and nonlinear objectives directly, we reformulate the problem as an equality-constrained GNEP with separable structure and then construct a quadratic majorization augmented Lagrangian function for the resulting GNEP. A majorized augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) is then designed to solve the equivalent GNEP. Each iteration requires solving a coupled Nash equilibrium problem (NEP). To address this, we introduce a symmetric Gauss–Seidel (sGS) decomposition method to decouple the NEP into a sequence of single-objective unconstrained quadratic programs. We establish the convergence of this ALM under mild assumptions in a weak topology and prove the strong convergence of the primal sequence under additional regularity assumptions. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Monotone inclusion problems occur in many areas of optimization and variational analysis. Splitting methods, which utilize resolvents or proximal mappings of the underlying operators, are often applied to solve these problems. Bredies et al. [SIAM J. Optim., 32 (2022), pp. 2376–2401] introduced a new elegant algorithmic framework that encompasses various well-known algorithms, including Douglas–Rachford and Chambolle–Pock. They obtained powerful weak and strong convergence results, where the latter type relies on additional strong monotonicity assumptions. In this paper, we complement the analysis by Bredies et al. by relating the projections of the fixed point sets of the underlying operators that generate the (reduced and original) preconditioned proximal point sequences. We obtain a new strong convergence result when the underlying operator is a linear relation. We note that without assumptions such as linearity or strong monotonicity, one may encounter weak convergence without strong convergence. In the case of the Chambolle–Pock algorithm, we obtain a new result that yields strong convergence to the projection onto the intersection of a linear subspace and the preimage of a linear subspace. Splitting algorithms by Ryu and by Malitsky and Tam are also considered. Various examples are provided to illustrate the applicability of our results.},

In this work, we move beyond the worst-case analysis and set out to understand whether the Lovász theta function recovers clique covers for random instances that have a latent clique cover structure, possibly obscured by noise. We answer this question in the affirmative and show that for graphs generated from the planted clique model we introduce in this work, the SDP formulation of has a unique solution that reveals the underlying clique cover structure with high probability.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In pure integer linear programming it is often desirable to work with polyhedra that are full-dimensional, and it is well known that it is possible to reduce any polyhedron to a full-dimensional one in polynomial time. More precisely, using the Hermite normal form, it is possible to map a non-full-dimensional polyhedron to a full-dimensional isomorphic one in a lower-dimensional space, while preserving integer vectors. In this paper, we extend the above result simultaneously in two directions. First, we consider mixed integer vectors instead of integer vectors, by leveraging on the concept of “integer reflexive generalized inverse.” Second, we replace polyhedra with convex quadratic sets, which are sets obtained from polyhedra by enforcing one additional convex quadratic inequality. We study structural properties of convex quadratic sets, and utilize them to obtain polynomial time algorithms to recognize full-dimensional convex quadratic sets, and to find an affine function that maps a non-full-dimensional convex quadratic set to a full-dimensional isomorphic one in a lower-dimensional space, while preserving mixed integer vectors. We showcase the applicability and the potential impact of these results by demonstrating that they can be used to prove that mixed integer convex quadratic programming is fixed parameter tractable with parameter the number of integer variables. Our algorithm unifies and extends the known polynomial time solvability of mixed integer convex quadratic programming in fixed dimension and of convex quadratic programming.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A common strategy for solving an unconstrained two-player Nash equilibrium problem with continuous variables is applying Newton’s method to the system obtained by the corresponding first-order necessary optimality conditions. However, when taking into account the game dynamics, it is not clear what is the goal of each player when considering they are taking their current decision following Newton’s iterates. In this paper we provide an interpretation for Newton’s iterate as follows: instead of minimizing the quadratic approximation of the objective functions parameterized by the other player current decision (the Jacobi-type strategy), we show that the Newton iterate follows this approach but with the objective function parameterized by a prediction of the other player action. This interpretation allows us to present a new Newtonian algorithm where a backtracking procedure is introduced in order to guarantee that the computed Newtonian directions, for each player, are descent directions for the corresponding parameterized functions. Thus, besides favoring global convergence, our algorithm also favors true minimizers instead of maximizers or saddle points, unlike the standard Newton method, which does not consider the minimization structure of the problem in the nonconvex case. Thus, our method is more robust compared to other Jacobi-type strategies or the pure Newtonian approach, which is corroborated by our numerical experiments. We also present a proof of the well-definiteness of the algorithm under some standard assumptions, together with a preliminary analysis of its convergence properties taking into account the game dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Randomized iterative methods, such as the Kaczmarz method and its variants, have gained growing attention due to their simplicity and efficiency in solving large-scale linear systems. Meanwhile, absolute value equations (AVE) have attracted increasing interest due to their connection with the linear complementarity problem. In this paper, we investigate the application of randomized iterative methods to generalized AVE (GAVE). Our approach differs from most existing works in that we tackle GAVE with nonsquare coefficient matrices. We establish more comprehensive sufficient and necessary conditions for characterizing the solvability of GAVE and propose precise error bound conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a flexible and efficient randomized iterative algorithmic framework for solving GAVE, which employs randomized sketching matrices drawn from user-specified distributions. This framework is capable of encompassing many well-known methods, including the Picard iteration method and the randomized Kaczmarz method. Leveraging our findings on solvability and error bounds, we establish both almost sure convergence and linear convergence rates for this versatile algorithmic framework. Finally, we present numerical examples to illustrate the advantages of the new algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) are used as a decision-making framework to study the long-run performance of a stochastic system. It is well known that a stationary optimal policy of a CMDP problem under discounted cost criterion can be obtained by solving a linear programming problem when running costs and transition probabilities are exactly known. In this paper, we consider a discounted cost CMDP problem where the running costs and transition probabilities are defined using random variables. Consequently, both the objective function and constraints become random. We use chance constraints to model these uncertainties and formulate the uncertain CMDP problem as a joint chance-constrained Markov decision process (JCCMDP). Under random running costs, we assume that the dependency among random constraint vectors is driven by a Gumbel–Hougaard copula. Using standard probability inequalities, we construct convex upper bound approximations of the JCCMDP problem under certain conditions on random running costs. In addition, we propose a linear programming problem whose optimal value gives a lower bound to the optimal value of the JCCMDP problem. When both running costs and transition probabilities are random, we define the latter variables as a sum of their means and random perturbations. Under mild conditions on the random perturbations and random running costs, we construct convex upper and lower bound approximations of the JCCMDP problem. We analyze the quality of the derived bounds through numerical experiments on a queueing control problem for random running costs. For the case when both running costs and transition probabilities are random, we choose randomly generated Markov decision problems called Garnets for numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper deals with the algorithmic aspects of solving feasibility problems of semidefinite programming (SDP), aka linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Since in some SDP instances all feasible solutions have irrational entries, numerical solvers that work with rational numbers can only find an approximate solution. We study the following question: Is it possible to certify feasibility of a given SDP using an approximate solution that is sufficiently close to some exact solution? Existing approaches make the assumption that there exist rational feasible solutions (and use techniques such as rounding and lattice reduction algorithms). We propose an alternative approach that does not need this assumption. More specifically, we show how to construct a system of polynomial equations whose set of real solutions is guaranteed to have an isolated correct solution (assuming that the target exact solution is maximum-rank). This allows, in particular, for us to use algorithms from real algebraic geometry for solving systems of polynomial equations, yielding a hybrid (or symbolic-numerical) method for SDPs. We experimentally compare it with a pure symbolic method in [D. Henrion, S. Naldi, and M. Safey El Din, SIAM J. Optim., 26 (2016), pp. 2512–2539]; the hybrid method was able to certify feasibility of many SDP instances on which the aforementioned paper failed. Our approach may have further applications, such as refining an approximate solution using methods of numerical algebraic geometry for systems of polynomial equations.},

Utilizing smoothness properties of the new -Lagrangian we develop the proximal gradient -method for continuous nonsmooth convex optimization and show its superlinear convergence under natural assumptions. The framework consists of a -step which is a prox-gradient step, followed by a -step which can be considered as a quasi-Newton step applied to the -Lagrangian. We show that partial -Hessians exist for most partly smooth functions. We exhibit the explicit process of constructing a basis of the -space and of calculating the -Hessian for -regularized problems.

Surprisingly, we find that the canonical spectral gap, a widely used metric in undirected networks, is insufficient to characterize the impact of directed topology on decentralized algorithms. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel metric termed equilibrium skewness. This metric, together with the spectral gap, accurately and comprehensively captures the influence of column-stochastic mixing matrices on decentralized stochastic algorithms. With these two metrics, we clarify, for the first time, how the directed network topology influences the performance of prevalent algorithms such as Push-Sum and Push-DIGing. Furthermore, we establish the first lower bound of the convergence rate for decentralized stochastic nonconvex algorithms over directed networks. Since existing algorithms cannot match our lower bound, we further propose the MG-Push-DIGing algorithm, which integrates Push-DIGing with a multiround gossip technique. MG-Push-DIGing attains our lower bound up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating its near-optimal performance and the tightness of the lower bound.

For example, for the case of local minimizer, we show that operator commutes with some element of the limiting (Mordukhovich) subdifferential of at provided that is subdifferentially regular at satisfying a qualification condition. For the case of local maximizer, we prove that operator commutes with each element of the (Fenchel) subdifferential of at whenever this subdifferential is nonempty.

Interior point methods are currently the state-of-the-art approach for solving such problems, particularly effective for classes like semidefinite programming, quadratic programming, and geometric programming. However, their success hinges on the construction of self-concordant barrier functions for feasible sets. In this work, we investigate and develop a homotopy-based approach to solve convex optimization problems. While homotopy methods have been considered in optimization before, their potential for general convex programs remains underexplored. This approach gradually transforms the feasible set of a trivial optimization problem into the target one while tracking solutions by solving a differential equation, in contrast to traditional central path methods. We establish a criterion that ensures that the homotopy method correctly solves the optimization problem and prove the existence of such homotopies for several important classes, including semidefinite and hyperbolic programs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach numerically outperforms state-of-the-art methods in hyperbolic programming, highlighting its practical advantages.},

The optimal global convergence is guaranteed by including an additional extra-gradient step, while a -order superlinear local convergence is shown to hold if the VI is strongly monotone. The proposed ARE is a broad scheme, in the sense that a variety of solution methods can be formulated within this framework as different manifestations of approximations, and their iteration complexities would follow through in a unified fashion. The ARE framework relates to the first-order methods, while opening up possibilities to developing higher-order methods specifically for structured problems that guarantee the optimal iteration complexity bounds.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Computing the regularized solution of Bayesian linear inverse problems as well as the corresponding regularization parameter is highly desirable in many applications. This paper proposes a novel iterative method, termed the Projected Newton method (PNT), that can simultaneously update the regularization parameter and solution step by step without requiring any expensive matrix inversions or decompositions. By reformulating the Tikhonov regularization as a constrained minimization problem and leveraging its Lagrangian function, a Newton-type method coupled with a Krylov subspace method is designed for the unconstrained Lagrangian function. The resulting PNT algorithm only needs solving a small-scale linear system to get a descent direction of a merit function at each iteration, thus significantly reducing computational overhead. Rigorous convergence results are proved, showing that PNT always converges to the unique regularized solution and the corresponding Lagrangian multiplier. Experimental results on both small-scale and large-scale Bayesian inverse problems demonstrate its excellent convergence property, robustness, and efficiency. Given that the most demanding computational tasks in PNT are primarily matrix-vector products, it is particularly well-suited for large-scale problems.},

They can be formulated as ODEs on a Banach space of bi-infinite sequences. They may arise in various ways: some are obtained as discretizations of partial differential equations or integral equations, and others are infinite-dimensional counterparts of finite-dimensional ODE models such as the Hopfield neural network model. This book studies various kinds of LDS that might be of autonomous, nonautonomous, or random nature. It focuses on first showing that the underlying LDS induces an autonomous, nonautonomous, or random semidynamical system, then providing sufficient criteria for the existence of a global, pullback, or random attractor.},

We analyze the reasons for this behavior by studying the steady states of the model and use the theory of invariants to develop an alternative model suited for numerical simulations. Our story is intended to motivate the combining of analytical knowledge and numerical knowledge, even in those cases where the world looks fine at first sight.

Diffusion models currently offer state-of-the-art performance in GAI for images. They also form a key component in more general tools, including text-to-image generators and large language models. Diffusion models work by adding noise to the available training data and then learning how to reverse the process. The reverse operation may then be applied to new random data in order to produce new outputs. We provide a brief introduction to diffusion models for applied mathematicians and statisticians. Our key aims are to (a) present illustrative computational examples, (b) give a careful derivation of the underlying mathematical formulas involved, and (c) draw a connection with partial differential equation (PDE) diffusion models. We provide code for the computational experiments. We hope that this topic will be of interest to advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students. Portions of the material may also provide useful motivational examples for those who teach courses in stochastic processes, inference, machine learning, PDEs, or scientific computing.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {Abstract. Diffusive flows, and their discrete counterparts, are ubiquitous in the physical and engineering sciences. In many important examples, the total mass is not preserved and therefore standard probabilistic models are not suitable. Examples include electrons which may be absorbed by the medium in which they travel. In population genetics, some individuals may “disappear” due to their genotype. In traffic flows over a network, some vehicles might simply exit the circulation and park. In this more general situation, where some of the mass may be lost, it is of particular interest to reconcile the observed initial and final marginal distributions with a given prior. In the case when the two marginals are probability distributions, and thus of equal mass, this problem was posed and, to a considerable extent, solved by E. Schrödinger in 1931/32. It is now known as the Schrödinger Bridge Problem (SBP). It turns out that Schrödinger’s problem can be viewed as both a modeling and a control problem. Due to the fundamental significance of this problem, interest in the SBP and in its deterministic (zero-noise limit) counterpart of optimal mass transport (OMT) has in recent years enticed scientists from a broad spectrum of disciplines, including physics, stochastic control, computer science, probability theory, and geometry. Yet, while the mathematics and applications of SBP/OMT have been developing at a considerable pace, accounting for marginals of unequal mass has received scant attention. The problem of interpolating between “unbalanced” marginals has been approached by introducing source/sink terms into the transport equations in an ad hoc manner, chiefly driven by applications in image registration. Nevertheless, as hinted at above, losses are inherent in many physical processes and, thereby, models that account for lossy transport may also need to be reconciled with observed marginals following Schrödinger’s quest, that is, to adjust the probability of trajectories of particles, including those that do not make it to the terminal observation point, so that the updated evolution represents the most likely way that particles may have been transported, or vanished, at some intermediate point. Thus, the purpose of this work is to develop such a natural generalization of the SBP for diffusive evolution with losses, whereupon particles are “killed” (jump into a coffin/extinction state) according to a probabilistic law, and thereby mass is gradually lost along their stochastically driven flow. Through a suitable embedding, which appears to be novel, we turn the problem into an SBP for stochastic processes that combine diffusive and jump characteristics. Then, following a large-deviations formalism in the style of E. Schrödinger, given a prior law that allows for losses, we ask for the most probable evolution of particles along with the most likely killing rate as the particles transition between the specified marginals. Our approach differs sharply from previous work involving a Feynman–Kac multiplicative reweighing of the reference measure. The latter, as we argue, is far from Schrödinger’s quest. An iterative scheme, generalizing the celebrated Fortet–IPF–Sinkhorn algorithm, permits the computation of the new drift and the new killing rate of the path-space solution measure. We also formulate and solve a related fluid-dynamic control problem for the flow of one-time marginals where both the drift and the new killing rate play the role of control variable. A numerical example illustrating the new theoretical results is also presented.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The committor function is a central object for quantifying transitions between metastable states in randomly perturbed dynamical systems. Recently, effective methods based on deep learning have been proposed to compute the committor function in high-dimensional systems. However, sampling training data in these methods remains a challenging task, particularly for systems with small noise. In this work, we propose a deep learning method in which the data are sampled from the equilibrium distribution of a modified potential. We introduce two such modified potentials: the first (scheme I) incorporates a bias formed by localized Gaussian functions along a one-dimensional variable constructed from the learned committor function; the second (scheme II) uses a bias involving the free energy associated with the learned committor function. We analyze the distribution of the sampled data and show that, in both schemes, the data are well spread out and effectively cover the transition tube. Both schemes enable adaptive learning of the committor function without requiring prior knowledge of the transition pathways. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated using high-dimensional examples, including the alanine dipeptide and a solvated dimer system.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we propose a balanced multicomponent and multilayer neural network (MMNN) structure to accurately and efficiently approximate functions with complex features in terms of both degrees of freedom and computational cost. The main idea is inspired by a multicomponent approach in which each component can be effectively approximated by a single-layer network, combined with a multilayer decomposition strategy to capture the complexity of the target function. Although MMNNs can be viewed as a simple modification of fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) or multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) by introducing balanced multicomponent structures, they achieve a significant reduction in training parameters, a much more efficient training process, and improved accuracy compared to FCNNs or MLPs. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MMNNs in approximating highly oscillatory functions and their ability to automatically adapt to localized features.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Classical model reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. While those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these issues, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initializing a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modeling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% fewer parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.

Without data transfers between a CPU and GPU, our implementation has achieved the elimination of a major performance bottleneck under a memory-bound situation, particularly when solving many small problems in batch. We discuss the design principles and implementation details for our kernel function and core operations. Different design choices are justified by numerical experiments. By using the application of distributed control of alternating current optimal power flow, where a large problem is decomposed into many smaller nonlinear programs using a Lagrangian approach, we demonstrate computational performance of ExaTron on the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Our numerical results show the linear scaling with respect to the batch size and the number of GPUs and more than 35 times speedup on 6 GPUs than on 40 CPU cores available on a single node.

To treat the material interface with higher-order accuracy, we develop the balanced conditions related to spatial derivatives at material interfaces for 2D planar and axisymmetric compressible multimedium flows. We then employ these balanced conditions to describe the interfacial physical properties and disclose that these conditions cannot be satisfied for the current ghost fluid methods, resulting in a first-order temporal error occurring in the region of the interface. To fix this difficulty, a multimedium generalized Riemann problem is proposed to predict the states and the spatial derivatives along the normal direction at the interface, in which the balanced conditions are imposed. Theoretical analysis and numerical results show that the proposed 2nd-MGFM can satisfy these balanced conditions, effectively eliminate the first-order major error term, suppress numerical overheating, and improve mass conservation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose high-order compact splitting Fourier spectral methods to compute the dynamics of dipolar Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) with arbitrary-angle rotation. The Hamiltonian is split into a linear part that consists of the Laplace and rotation and a nonlinear part that includes all the remaining terms. For the linear subproblem, we factorize the linear operator into a product of simple suboperators using the exact classical-quantum correspondence and semigroups decomposition, and these suboperators are integrated exactly in either physical or phase space. Importantly, we first derive explicit formulas for the splitting coefficients originally obtained by numerically solving a nonlinear system. The nonlinear part is solved exactly in physical space, and the convolution-type nonlocal potential with a singular kernel is computed via the Far-field Smooth Approximation (FSA) method with spectral accuracy. This “compact” splitting, involving only two operators, significantly simplifies the design of high-order schemes. Our method achieves high-order temporal precision and spectral spatial accuracy with near-optimal efficiency, and it is explicit, easy to implement and unconditionally stable. In addition, we derive some dynamical properties and conduct a comprehensive investigation, including accuracy confirmation, property verification, interaction of quantized vortices, and dynamics under honeycomb potential.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose a model order reduction approach to speed up the computation of seismograms, i.e., the solution of the seismic wave equation evaluated at a receiver location, for different model parameters. This is highly relevant for seismic applications, such as full waveform inversion, seismic tomography, or monitoring tools of seismicity, that are computationally challenging, as the discretized (forward) model often has a huge number of unknowns and needs to be solved many times for different model parameters. Our approach achieves a reduction of the unknowns by a factor of approximately 1000 for various numerical experiments for a two-dimensional subsurface model of Groningen, the Netherlands (a region known for its seismic activity), even if the (known) wave speeds of the subsurface are relatively varied. Moreover, when using multiple cores to construct the reduced model, we can approximate the (time domain) seismogram in a lower wall-clock time than an implicit Newmark-beta method. To realize this reduction, we exploit the fact that seismograms are low-pass filtered for the observed seismic events. We thus consider the Laplace-transformed problem in the frequency domain and implicitly restrict ourselves to the frequency range of interest by adjusting the parameters of a source function, which is a popular model in computational seismology for the temporal response of an earthquake. Therefore, we can avoid the high frequencies that would require many reduced basis functions to reach the desired accuracy and generally make the reduced order approximation of wave problems challenging. Instead, we can prove for our ansatz that for a fixed subsurface model, the reduced order approximation converges exponentially fast in the frequency range of interest in the Laplace domain. We build the reduced model from solutions of the Laplace-transformed problem via a (proper orthogonal decomposition-)greedy algorithm targeting the construction of the reduced model to the time domain seismograms; the latter is achieved by using an a posteriori error estimator that does not require computing any time domain counterparts. Finally, we show that we obtain a stable reduced model, thus overcoming the challenge that standard model reduction approaches do not necessarily yield a stable reduced model for wave problems.

However, solving the BTE is computationally expensive because of its high-dimensionality, resulting in prohibitive time-to-solution. Scalable parallelization of the BTE solver that can avail supercomputing resources is desirable. We developed an adaptive parallelization strategy for the implicit solution of the multidimensional phonon BTE in the time domain. This adaptive method minimizes load imbalance and unnecessary computations in previously used band and cell-based partitioning schemes, achieved an average speedup of compared to the nonadaptive counterpart, and maintained strong scalability at cores. This new solver was used to simulate an FDTR experiment. The results (phase lag between the probe and pulse laser signals) are validated against experimental measurements and show good agreement. Our developed strategies can be applied to other computationally challenging problems constrained by limited parallelism.},

Our theoretical contributions include conditions for feasibility and computation of the Lagrangian dual problem for both problems and duality correspondence for the relaxed-regularized version.

A Taylor method for solving an ordinary differential equation initial-value problem , computes the Taylor series (TS) of the solution at the current point, truncated to some order, and then advances to the next point by summing the TS with a suitable stepsize. A standard ODE method (e.g., Runge–Kutta) treats function as a black box, but a Taylor solver requires to be preprocessed into a code-list of elementary operations that it interprets as operations on (truncated) TS. The trade-off for this extra work includes arbitrary order, typically enabling much larger stepsizes. For a standard function, such as , this means evaluating , where are TS. The sub-ODE method applies the ODE , obeyed by , to in-line this operation as . This gives economy of implementation: each function that satisfies a simple ODE goes into the “Taylor library” with a few lines of code—not needing a separate recurrence relation, which is the typical approach. Mathematically, however, the use of sub-ODEs generally transforms the original ODE into a differential-algebraic system, making it nontrivial to ensure a sound system of recurrences for Taylor coefficients. We prove that, regardless of how many sub-ODEs are incorporated into , this approach guarantees a sound system.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent years have witnessed the introduction and development of extremely fast rational function algorithms. Many ideas in this realm arose from polynomial-based linear-algebraic algorithms. However, polynomial approximation is occasionally ill-suited to specific challenging tasks arising in several situations. Some occasions require maximal efficiency in the number of encoding parameters while retaining the renowned accuracy of polynomial-based approximation. One application comes from promoting empirical pointwise functions to sparse matrix operators. Another is the robust representation of noisy data without overfitting. Rational function approximations provide a simple but flexible alternative (actually a superset), allowing one to capture complex nonlinearities without oscillatory artifacts. However, these come with extra challenges: i) coping with singularities and near singularities arising from a vanishing denominator, and ii) a nonuniqueness owing to the simultaneous renormalization of both numerator and denominator. We, therefore, introduce a new rational function framework using manifestly positive and normalized Bernstein polynomials for the denominator and any traditional polynomial basis (e.g., Chebyshev) for the numerator. While an expressly nonsingular approximation slightly reduces the maximum degree of compression, it keeps all the benefits of rational functions while maintaining the flexibility and robustness of polynomials, especially in noisy data scenarios. We illustrate the relevant aspects of this approach with a series of derivations and computational examples. Reproducibility of computational results.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Solving the Boltzmann-BGK equation with traditional numerical methods suffers from high computational and memory costs due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a novel accuracy-preserved tensor-train (APTT) method to efficiently solve the Boltzmann-BGK equation. A second-order finite difference scheme is applied to discretize the Boltzmann-BGK equation, resulting in a tensor algebraic system at each time step. Based on the low-rank TT representation, the tensor algebraic system is then approximated as a TT-based low-rank system, which is efficiently solved using the TT-modified alternating least-squares (TT-MALS) solver. Thanks to the low-rank TT representation, the APTT method can significantly reduce the computational and memory costs compared to traditional numerical methods. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the APTT method maintains the same convergence rate as that of the finite difference scheme. The convergence rate and efficiency of the APTT method are validated by several benchmark test cases.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with the approximation of probability distributions known up to normalization constants, with a focus on Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in scientific computing. In this context, key challenges include costly repeated evaluations of forward models, multimodality, and inaccessible gradients for the forward model. To address them, we develop a variational inference framework that combines the Fisher–Rao natural gradient with specialized quadrature rules to enable derivative free updates of Gaussian mixture variational families. The resulting method, termed derivative free Gaussian mixture variational inference (DF-GMVI), guarantees covariance positivity and affine invariance, offering a stable and efficient framework for approximating complex posterior distributions. The effectiveness of DF-GMVI is demonstrated through numerical experiments on challenging scenarios, including distributions with multiple modes, infinitely many modes, and curved modes in spaces with up to 100 dimensions. The method’s practicality is further demonstrated in a large-scale application, where it successfully recovers the initial conditions of the Navier–Stokes equations from solution data at positive times.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a novel sliding interface formulation for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) between a rotating rigid structure and incompressible fluid, improving existing methodologies with a skew-symmetric Nitsche’s stabilization term applied on an artificial sliding interface alongside a rotational arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian framework. This innovative approach not only preserves the energy-dissipating property at the continuous level but also provides a robust foundation for further advancements in FSI modeling. Our methodology includes a first-order full discretization that maintains these critical energy-dissipating properties at the discrete level, ensuring numerical stability and accuracy. While prior contributions such as the original sliding interface method introduced by Bazilevs and Hughes (Comput. Mech., 43(1):143–150, 2008) have been significant, theoretical analyses such as the inf-sup condition on nonmatching meshes have gone largely unaddressed. We fill this gap by proving the inf-sup condition within the context of the isoparametric finite element method (FEM), where meshes are not only nonmatching but also overlapping, thus extending the applicability and robustness of our approach. Leveraging this inf-sup condition along with the inherent energy-dissipating properties, we establish the unique solvability of the fully discrete scheme. Through extensive numerical experiments, we illustrate the convergence, efficiency, and energy-dissipating property of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the numerical solution of discrete Oseen problems. We focus on the recently proposed transform-then-solve approach, which amounts to first applying a specific algebraic transformation to the linear system of equations arising from the discretization and then solving the transformed system with an algebraic multigrid method. Promising results have been previously obtained with a two-grid variant, and here we bring two key improvements to make the approach robust in a multilevel setting. For a model problem with a constant convection field, it is shown, in a local Fourier analysis setting, that the two-grid method is convergent at any level of the hierarchy, with bounds that are independent of both the mesh size and the Reynolds number. Numerical results with a K-cycle multigrid scheme confirm the theoretical expectations for constant coefficient problems. For problems with variable convective flow, the method appears also robust with grid independence convergence, although a mild dependency with respect to the Reynolds number shows up at very low viscosity in driven cavity problems. The method is based on point coarsening and therefore, besides the system matrix, requires knowing, for each discrete unknown, which grid point it is associated with.},

Employing density functional theory, a gradient flow model is built upon the energy functional to obtain the ground state Wigner function representing the entire many-body system.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a new method to jointly reduce the dimension of the input and output space of a function between high-dimensional spaces. Choosing a reduced input subspace influences which output subspace is relevant and vice versa. Conventional methods focus on reducing either the input or output space, even though both are often reduced simultaneously in practice. Our coupled approach naturally supports goal-oriented dimension reduction, where either an input or output quantity of interest is prescribed. We consider, in particular, goal-oriented sensor placement and goal-oriented sensitivity analysis, which can be viewed as dimension reduction where the most important output or, respectively, input components are chosen. Both applications present difficult combinatorial optimization problems with expensive objectives such as the expected information gain and Sobol’ indices. By optimizing gradient-based bounds, we can determine the most informative sensors and most influential parameters as the largest diagonal entries of some diagnostic matrices, thus bypassing the combinatorial optimization and objective evaluation.

The explicit upper bounds for the Wasserstein distance for the central limit theorem (CLT) of the MLE are provided as $N \to \infty$ and/or $T \to \infty$. In the second part of the paper, the $N$ Fourier modes are observed at uniform time grid, $t_i = i (T/M)$, $i=0,\dots,M,$ where $M$ is the number of time grid points. The consistency and asymptotic normality are studied as $T,M,N \to +\infty$ in addition to the rate of convergence in law in the CLT.},

This result substantially extends and improves some existing related results, such as Theorem 2.1 of Yang and Wang [Extremes, 16 (2013), pp. 55--74]. We also provide some concrete examples, some interesting properties, and a construction method of a conditional dependent random vector. Finally, we apply the above Breiman's theorem to risk theory and obtain two asymptotic estimates of the finite-time ruin probability and the infinite-time ruin probability of a discrete-time risk model, in which the corresponding net loss and random discount are conditionally dependent.},

Res., 56 (2008), pp. 607--617], we study the asymptotic behavior of the normalized error process $u_{n,m}(X^n-X^{nm})$ where $X^n$ and $X^{nm}$ are, respectively, Euler approximations with time steps $1/n$ and $1/nm$ of a given stochastic differential equation driven by a pure jump Lévy process. In this paper, we prove that this normalized multilevel error converges to different nontrivial limiting processes with various sharp rates $u_{n,m}$ depending on the behavior of the Lévy measure around zero. Our results are consistent with those of Jacod [Ann. Probab., 32 (2004), pp. 1830--1872] obtained for the normalized error $u_n(X^n-X)$, as when letting $m$ tends to infinity, we recover the same limiting processes. For the multilevel error, the proofs of the current paper are challenging since, unlike Jacod's paper, we need to deal with $m$ dependent triangular arrays instead of one.},

  abstract     = {In the white Gaussian noise (WGN) model on the half-line, $dV(x)=f(x)\,dx+\varepsilon \, dW(x)$, $x>0$, minimax linear estimators of the functional $x^{1/2}_0f(x_0)$ are sought for a given $x_0>0$. Here, $f$ is an unknown signal satisfying a certain restriction $f\in\mathfrak{F}$, $\varepsilon>0$ is a given parameter, and $W(\,{\cdot}\,)$ is the standard Wiener process. With the use of the Mellin transform, it is shown that the above problem is equivalent to a similar (but better known) WGN model on the whole line, $dY(u)=g(u)\,du+\varepsilon \, dW(u)$, $-\infty<u<\infty$, where minimax linear estimators of the functional $g(u_0)$ are sought under a matching restriction $g\in \mathfrak{F}_0$, for $u_0=\log x_0.$ This demonstrates a close connection between the two models, which permits one to translate results on minimax linear estimation easily from one model to the other. In particular, it leads to minimax linear estimators on the half-line for a variety of ellipsoidal and cuboidal function classes $\mathfrak{F}$.},

  abstract     = {We propose new versions of the weak law of large numbers (LLN) for weakly dependent (nonidentically distributed, in general) summands, either assuming that each summand has finite expectation or without this assumption. One of the main conditions in the first of the three cases we consider (this case develops the ideas of Y. S. Chow [Ann. Math. Statist., 42 (1971), pp. 393--394]) is the Cesàro uniform integrability of the summands in the spirit of T. K. Chandra's studies of 1989--2012 on LLNs for pairwise independent random variables. In this result, the pairwise dependence conditions are replaced by quite different weak dependence type conditions in the spirit of A.N. Kolmogorov's paper [Atti Accad. Naz. Lincei Rend. (6), 9 (1929), pp. 470--474]; the only difference is that, in the present paper, we impose conditions only on the first moments of some conditional expectations, rather than on their second moments. In the second case, which is based on a slightly different weak dependence condition, we use the method of telescopic expansion and the fact that the convergence in probability to a constant can be interpreted as weak convergence. In the third case, we establish an LLN for summands without finite expectations, assuming, again, that they are not necessarily identically distributed.},
