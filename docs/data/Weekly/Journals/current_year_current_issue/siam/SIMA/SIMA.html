  abstract     = {Abstract. We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler-alignment system with nonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the -Euler-alignment system. This model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a density-weighted fractional -Laplacian when the singularity parameter exceeds the spatial dimension . Our primary goal is to establish the existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions and compactly supported initial conditions. We construct solutions as mean-field limits of empirical measures from a kinetic variant of the -Euler-alignment system. Specifically, we show that a sequence of empirical measures converges to a finite Radon measure whose local density and velocity satisfy the -Euler-alignment system. Our results are the first to prove the existence of solutions to this system in multidimensional settings without significant initial data restrictions, covering both nonlinear and linear cases. Additionally, we establish global existence, uniqueness, and collision avoidance for the corresponding particle ODE system under noncollisional initial conditions, extending previous results for . This analysis supports our mean-field limit argument and contributes to understanding alignment models with singular communication.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We prove that any sequence of vanishing viscosity Leray–Hopf solutions to the periodic two-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations does not display anomalous dissipation if the initial vorticity is a measure with positive singular part. A key step in the proof is the use of the Delort–Majda concentration-compactness argument to exclude formation of atoms in the vorticity measure, which in particular implies that the limiting velocity is an admissible weak solution to Euler. This is the first result proving absence of dissipation in a class of solutions in which the velocity kinematically fails to be strongly compact in , putting two-dimensional turbulence in sharp contrast with respect to that in three dimensions. Moreover, our proof reveals that the amount of energy dissipation can be bounded by the vorticity measure of a disk of size , matching the two-dimensional Kolmogorov dissipative length scale which is expected to be sharp.},

We consider in particular the asymptotic of the number of collisions per particle and per unit of time and show it exhibits a phase transition in the joint limit in which the number of particles N and the time interval [0,T] diverge. More precisely, due to the existence of Lu–Wennberg solutions, the corresponding limiting rate function vanishes for subtypical values of the number of collisions. We also analyze the second order large deviations showing that the probability of subtypical fluctuations is exponentially small in N, independently of T.

In different regions of the -parameter plane, maximality is conjectured for the ball, the vertices of a regular simplex, or the endpoints of an interval. These cases are separated by a symmetry-breaking transition region where the shape of maximizers remains unclear. On the boundary of -parameter space, one encounters existing theorems and conjectures, including Watanabe’s theorem minimizing Riesz capacity for given volume, the classical isodiametric theorem that maximizes volume for given diameter, Szegő’s isodiametric theorem maximizing Newtonian capacity for given diameter, and the still-open isodiametric conjecture for Riesz capacity. The first quadrant of parameter space contains Pólya and Szegő’s conjecture on maximizing Newtonian over logarithmic capacity for planar sets. The maximal shape for each of these scenarios is known or conjectured to be the ball. Maximizers are quite different in the third quadrant where and are both negative. On the outer boundary of the quadrant, where one of or equals and the other is suitably negative, maximality is proved to occur when consists of the endpoints of an interval or else the vertices of a regular simplex. Considerably stronger results are shown in dimensions 1 and 2, where intervals, endpoints of intervals, and vertices of equilateral triangles provide the maximizers in large regions of the third quadrant.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Motivated by recent interest in elastic problems in which the target space is non-Euclidean, we study a limit where local rest distances within an elastic body are incompatible, yet close to, distances within the ambient space. Specifically, we obtain, via -convergence, a limit elastic model for a sequence of elastic bodies in an ambient space , for Riemannian metrics and such that . Furthermore, we relate the minimum of the limit problem to a linearized curvature discrepancy between and , using recent results of Kupferman and Leder [Forum Math. Sigma, 13 (2025), e51]. This relation confirms a linearized version of a long-standing conjecture in elasticity regarding the relation between the elastic energy and the curvature of the underlying space. The main technical challenge, compared to other linearization results in elasticity, is obtaining the correct notion of displacement for manifold-valued configurations, using Sobolev truncations and parallel transport. We show that the associated compactness result is obtained if satisfies a quantitative rigidity property, analogous to the Friesecke–James–Müller rigidity estimate in Euclidean space, and show that this property holds when is a round sphere.},

Consequently, the diffuse interface is located in an neighborhood of the sharp interface, and becomes nearly flat at infinity. This generalizes all the results for the triple junction solution with symmetry hypotheses to the nonsymmetric case. The proof relies on refined sharp energy lower and upper bounds, alongside a precise estimate of the diffuse interface location.},

The required nondegeneracy condition is expressed in terms of the derivative of the apsidal angle with respect to the angular momentum: in this way, tools from the theory of time-maps of nonlinear oscillators can be used to verify it in concrete problems.

Degenerate mean field type control problems are rarely studied in the literature. Our method is based on a lifting approach which embeds the control problem and the associated FBSDEs in Wasserstein spaces into certain Hilbert spaces. We use a continuation method to establish the solvability of the FBSDEs and that of the Gâteaux derivatives of these FBSDEs. We then explore the regularity of the value function in time and in measure argument, and we also show that it is the unique classical solution of the associated Bellman equation. We also study the higher regularity of the linear functional derivative of the value function, and thereby, we obtain the classical solution of the mean field type master equation.},

We prove exponential instability properties for the fractional Calderón problem and the conductivity formulation of the fractional Calderón problem in the regime of fractional powers . We particularly focus on two settings: First, we discuss instability properties in general domain geometries with scaling critical potentials and constant background metrics. Second, we investigate instability properties in general geometries with potentials and low regularity, variable coefficient, possibly anisotropic background metrics. In both settings, we make use of the methods introduced in Koch, Rüland, and Salo [Ars Inveniendi Anal., (2021), 7], and we deduce strong compression estimates for the forward problem. In the first setting, this is based on analytic smoothing estimates for a suitable comparison operator, while in the second setting, involving low regularity metrics, this is based on an iterated compression gain. We thus generalize the results from Rüland and Salo [Inverse Problems, 34 (2018), 045003] to generic geometries and variable coefficients and also further discuss the setting of fractional conductivity equations. In particular, this proves that the logarithmic stability estimates for the fractional Calderón problem from Rüland and Salo [Nonlinear Anal., 193 (2020), 111529] are optimal.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, a reaction-diffusion system modeling tumor invasion is investigated. The model is proposed by renowned biologist and cancer expert Gatenby and his collaborator [R. A. Gatenby and E. T. Gawlinski, Cancer Res., 56 (1996), pp. 5745–5753]. The underlying partial differential equation system has cross-diffusion and density-dependent degenerate diffusion coefficient and involves the interactions of three quantities: tumor tissue density, acid concentration, and normal tissue density. The most challenging and interesting issue for the analysis of the current model is the existence of the traveling wave solution which signifies the invasion of tumor tissue into normal tissue. Because the diffusion of tumor tissue is influenced by the density of normal cells (cross-diffusion) and the diffusion coefficient is zero when normal cells are at the carrying capacity, this causes the diffusion coefficient of tumor tissue to be degenerate, a hallmark of the underlying partial differential equation (PDE) system. A rigorous proof of existence of traveling wave is proved for one-dimensional case.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study incompressible fluid flow through a thin poroelastic layer and rigorously derive a macroscopic model when the thickness of the layer tends to zero. Within the layer, we assume a periodic structure, and both the periodicity and the thickness of the layer are of order , which is small compared to the length of the layer. The fluid flow is described by quasi-static Stokes equations, and for the elastic solid, we consider linear elasticity equations, and both are coupled via continuity of the velocities and the normal stresses. The aim is to pass to the limit in the weak microscopic formulation by using multiscale techniques adapted to the simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction in continuum mechanics. The macroscopic limit model is given by a coupled Biot plate system consisting of a generalized Darcy law coupled to a Kirchhoff–Love-type plate equation including the Darcy pressure.},

We study second-order MFG PDI with convex, Lipschitz continuous, but possibly nondifferentiable, Hamiltonians, and their approximation by systems of classical MFG PDE with regularized Hamiltonians. Under very broad conditions on the problem data, we show that, up to subsequences, the solutions of the regularized problems converge to solutions of the MFG PDI. In particular, we show the convergence of the value functions in the -norm and of the densities in -norms. Under stronger hypotheses on the problem data, we also show rates of convergence between the solutions of the original and regularized problems, without requiring any higher regularity of the solutions. We give concrete examples that demonstrate the sharpness of several aspects of the analysis.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study formally determined inverse problems with passive measurements for one dimensional (1D) evolution equations where the goal is to simultaneously determine both the initial data as well as the variable coefficients in such an equation from the measurement of its solution at a fixed spatial point for a certain amount of time. This can be considered as a 1D model of widely open inverse problems in photo-acoustic and thermo-acoustic tomography. We provide global uniqueness results for wave and heat equations stated on bounded or unbounded spatial intervals. Contrary to all previous related results on the subject, we do not impose any genericity assumptions on the coefficients or initial data. Our proofs are based on creating suitable links to the well understood spectral theory for 1D Schrödinger operators. In particular, in the more challenging case of a bounded spatial domain, our proof for the inverse problem partly relies on the following two key ingredients, namely (i) Paley–Wiener type theorems due to Kahane [Annales de l’Institut Fourier, 7 (1957), pp. 293–314] and Remling [J. Funct. Anal., 196 (2002), pp. 323–394] that together provide a quantifiable link between support of a compactly supported function and the upper density of its vanishing Schrödinger spectral modes and (ii) a result of Gesztesy and Simon [Trans.

Soc., 352 (1999), pp. 2765–2787] on partial data inverse spectral problems for reconstructing an unknown potential in a 1D Schrödinger operator from the knowledge of only a fraction of its spectrum.},

Unlike the related free case which is well studied in [Y. Z. Kong, Q. X. Wang, and D. Zhao, Calc. Var.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multiphase poromechanics describes the evolution of multiphase flow in deformable porous media. Mathematical models for such multiphysics systems are inherently nonlinear, potentially degenerate, and fully coupled systems of partial differential equations. In this work, we present a thermodynamically consistent multiphase poromechanics model falling into the category of Biot equations and obeying a generalized gradient flow structure. It involves capillarity effects, degenerate relative permeabilities, and gravity effects. In addition to established models, it introduces a Lagrange multiplier associated to a bound constraint on the effective porosity in particular ensuring its positivity. We establish existence of global weak solutions under the assumption of a weak coupling strength, implicitly utilizing the gradient flow structure, as well as a twofold regularization, first, relaxing the porosity constraint to provide strong monotonicity of the underlying energy, and second, adding coercivity by mitigating the degeneracy in the relative permeability through uniform positivity. This finally enables a Faedo–Galerkin approach and compactness arguments including vanishing regularization. This comprises the first global existence result for multiphase poromechanics accounting for degeneracies that are consistent with the multiphase nature of the flow.},

In this work, for perturbations within spherical symmetry, we study the stability and instability of this family. We prove that the linearized operator around steady states with large central densities admits a growing mode, while such growing modes do not exist for steady states with small central densities. Based on the linear analysis, we further demonstrate a dynamical nonlinear instability for steady states with large central densities. The proof relies on a spectral analysis of the linearized operator and an a priori estimate on the full nonlinear free boundary problem.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present an energy method to prove finite speed of propagation (“FSOP”) for energy-dissipating solutions to stochastic thin-film equations with conservative nonlinear multiplicative noise under periodic boundary conditions. Physically, the equations under consideration correspond to weak slippage, i.e., the case of mobility exponents . Analytically, our approach relies on a new weighted decay estimate for appropriate powers of the solution which is set up in combination with Bernis inequalities and energy estimates. An intricacy related to this estimate are multiple power-type nonlinearities on the right-hand side —not occurring in previous studies for finite speed of propagation of stochastic versions of degenerate parabolic equations. They result from the different scaling behavior of the thin-film operator and the specific porous-medium operator which comes up as a correction term for Stratonovich or for Hänggi–Klimontovich noise. Combining this decay estimate with tailored filtering techniques, a qualitative result on finite speed of propagation is established.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper we investigate the stress concentration problem that occurs when two convex rigid particles are closely immersed in a fluid flow. The governing equations for the fluid flow are the stationary incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. We establish precise upper bounds for the gradients and second-order derivatives of the fluid velocity as the distance between particles approaches zero, in dimensions two and three. The optimality of these blow-up rates of the gradients is demonstrated by deriving corresponding lower bounds. New difficulties arising from the nonlinear term in the Navier–Stokes equations is overcome. Consequently, the blow-up rates of the Cauchy stress are studied as well.},

On the quantum many-body level, the quintic nonlinearity corresponds to a three-body interaction. This is a continuation of our previous work [A. Rout and V. Sohinger, Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 48 (2023), pp. 1008–1055]. In the aforementioned work, we studied the cubic problem, which corresponds to a two-body interaction on the quantum many-body level. In our setup, we truncate the mass of the classical free field in the classical setting and the rescaled particle number in the quantum setting. Our methods are based on a perturbative expansion previously developed in the work of Fröhlich, Knowles, Schlein, and the second author [Comm. Math. Phys., 356 (2017), pp. 883–980]. We prove results in both the time-independent and the time-dependent setting.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a deterministic particle method for a one-dimensional nonlocal equation with interactions through the repulsive Morse potential. We show that the particle method converges as the number of particles goes to infinity towards weak measure solutions to the nonlocal equation. Such a results is proven under the assumption of initial data in the space of probability measures with finite second moment. In particular, our method is able to capture a measure-to- smoothing effect of the limit equation. Moreover, as the Morse potential is rescaled to approach a Dirac delta, corresponding to strongly localized repulsive interactions, the scheme becomes a particle approximation for the quadratic porous medium equation. We show that in the joint limit (localized repulsion and increasing number of particles) the reconstructed density converges to a weak solution of the porous medium equation. The strategy relies on various estimates performed at the particle level, including estimates and an entropy dissipation estimate, which benefit from the particular structure of our particle scheme and from the absolutely continuous reconstruction of the density from the particle locations.},
