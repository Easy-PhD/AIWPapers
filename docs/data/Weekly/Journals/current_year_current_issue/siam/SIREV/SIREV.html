They can be formulated as ODEs on a Banach space of bi-infinite sequences. They may arise in various ways: some are obtained as discretizations of partial differential equations or integral equations, and others are infinite-dimensional counterparts of finite-dimensional ODE models such as the Hopfield neural network model. This book studies various kinds of LDS that might be of autonomous, nonautonomous, or random nature. It focuses on first showing that the underlying LDS induces an autonomous, nonautonomous, or random semidynamical system, then providing sufficient criteria for the existence of a global, pullback, or random attractor.},

Targeting undergraduate students with basic knowledge of dynamical systems and numerical methods for ordinary differential equations, we explore a model from mathematical biology where numerical methods fail badly due to catastrophic floating point errors. We analyze the reasons for this behavior by studying the steady states of the model and use the theory of invariants to develop an alternative model suited for numerical simulations. Our story is intended to motivate the combining of analytical knowledge and numerical knowledge, even in those cases where the world looks fine at first sight. We have set up an online repository containing an interactive notebook with all the numerical experiments in this article to make this study fully reproducible and useful for classroom teaching.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) refers to algorithms that create synthetic but realistic output. Diffusion models currently offer state-of-the-art performance in GAI for images. They also form a key component in more general tools, including text-to-image generators and large language models. Diffusion models work by adding noise to the available training data and then learning how to reverse the process. The reverse operation may then be applied to new random data in order to produce new outputs. We provide a brief introduction to diffusion models for applied mathematicians and statisticians. Our key aims are to (a) present illustrative computational examples, (b) give a careful derivation of the underlying mathematical formulas involved, and (c) draw a connection with partial differential equation (PDE) diffusion models. We provide code for the computational experiments. We hope that this topic will be of interest to advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students. Portions of the material may also provide useful motivational examples for those who teach courses in stochastic processes, inference, machine learning, PDEs, or scientific computing.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {Abstract. Diffusive flows, and their discrete counterparts, are ubiquitous in the physical and engineering sciences. In many important examples, the total mass is not preserved and therefore standard probabilistic models are not suitable. Examples include electrons which may be absorbed by the medium in which they travel. In population genetics, some individuals may “disappear” due to their genotype. In traffic flows over a network, some vehicles might simply exit the circulation and park. In this more general situation, where some of the mass may be lost, it is of particular interest to reconcile the observed initial and final marginal distributions with a given prior. In the case when the two marginals are probability distributions, and thus of equal mass, this problem was posed and, to a considerable extent, solved by E. Schrödinger in 1931/32. It is now known as the Schrödinger Bridge Problem (SBP). It turns out that Schrödinger’s problem can be viewed as both a modeling and a control problem. Due to the fundamental significance of this problem, interest in the SBP and in its deterministic (zero-noise limit) counterpart of optimal mass transport (OMT) has in recent years enticed scientists from a broad spectrum of disciplines, including physics, stochastic control, computer science, probability theory, and geometry. Yet, while the mathematics and applications of SBP/OMT have been developing at a considerable pace, accounting for marginals of unequal mass has received scant attention. The problem of interpolating between “unbalanced” marginals has been approached by introducing source/sink terms into the transport equations in an ad hoc manner, chiefly driven by applications in image registration. Nevertheless, as hinted at above, losses are inherent in many physical processes and, thereby, models that account for lossy transport may also need to be reconciled with observed marginals following Schrödinger’s quest, that is, to adjust the probability of trajectories of particles, including those that do not make it to the terminal observation point, so that the updated evolution represents the most likely way that particles may have been transported, or vanished, at some intermediate point. Thus, the purpose of this work is to develop such a natural generalization of the SBP for diffusive evolution with losses, whereupon particles are “killed” (jump into a coffin/extinction state) according to a probabilistic law, and thereby mass is gradually lost along their stochastically driven flow. Through a suitable embedding, which appears to be novel, we turn the problem into an SBP for stochastic processes that combine diffusive and jump characteristics. Then, following a large-deviations formalism in the style of E. Schrödinger, given a prior law that allows for losses, we ask for the most probable evolution of particles along with the most likely killing rate as the particles transition between the specified marginals. Our approach differs sharply from previous work involving a Feynman–Kac multiplicative reweighing of the reference measure. The latter, as we argue, is far from Schrödinger’s quest. An iterative scheme, generalizing the celebrated Fortet–IPF–Sinkhorn algorithm, permits the computation of the new drift and the new killing rate of the path-space solution measure. We also formulate and solve a related fluid-dynamic control problem for the flow of one-time marginals where both the drift and the new killing rate play the role of control variable. A numerical example illustrating the new theoretical results is also presented.},

We begin with a detailed introduction to SDDP, with special focus on its motivation, complexity, and required assumptions.
