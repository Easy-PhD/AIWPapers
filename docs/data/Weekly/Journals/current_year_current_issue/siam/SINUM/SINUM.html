  abstract     = {Abstract. This work analyzes the sensitivities of the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and a corresponding quantity of interest (QoI) to perturbations in a state-dependent component function that appears in the governing ODEs. This extends existing ODE sensitivity results, which consider the sensitivity of the ODE solution with respect to state-independent parameters. It is shown that with Carathéodory-type assumptions on the ODEs, the implicit function theorem can be applied to establish continuous Fréchet differentiability of the ODE solution with respect to the component function. These sensitivities are used to develop new estimates for the change in the ODE solution or QoI when the component function is perturbed. In applications, this new sensitivity-based bound on the ODE solution or QoI error is often much tighter than classical Gronwall-type error bounds. The sensitivity-based error bounds are applied to a trajectory simulation for a hypersonic vehicle.},

We apply the proposed spherical zone -designs to numerical integration, hyperinterpolation and sparse approximation on the spherical zone. Theoretical approximation error bounds are presented.

Convergence and compactness properties of approximate solutions to elliptic partial differential equations computed with the hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) scheme of Cockburn, Gopalakrishnan, and Sayas (Math. Comp., 79 (2010), pp. 1351–1367) are established. While it is known that solutions computed using this scheme converge at optimal rates to smooth solutions, this does not establish the stability of the method or convergence to solutions with minimal regularity. The compactness and convergence results show that the HDG scheme can be utilized for the solution of nonlinear problems and linear problems with nonsmooth coefficients on domains with reentrant corners.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The formulation of finite difference approximations is a classical problem in numerical analysis. In this article, we consider difference approximations that are based on a series expansion in powers of the second undivided difference. Each additional term in the series increases the order of accuracy by two. These expansions are useful in a variety of contexts such as in the development of modified equation schemes, the design of high-order accurate energy stable discretizations, and error analysis of certain finite element or finite difference schemes. Here, we provide closed form expressions for the coefficients in the series expansions for derivatives of all orders. We also provide some short recursions defining the series coefficients, and formulae for the stencil coefficients in standard difference approximations. The series expansions are used to show some useful properties of the Fourier symbols of difference approximations and to derive rules of thumb for the number of points-per-wavelength needed to achieve a given error tolerance when solving wave propagation problems involving higher spatial derivatives.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this study, we address the challenge of solving elliptic equations with quasiperiodic coefficients. To achieve accurate and efficient computation, we introduce the projection method, which enables the embedding of quasiperiodic systems into higher-dimensional periodic systems. To enhance the computational efficiency, we propose a compressed storage strategy for the stiffness matrix by its multilevel block circulant structure, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, we design a diagonal preconditioner to efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional linear system by reducing the condition number of the stiffness matrix. These techniques collectively contribute to the computational effectiveness of our proposed approach. Convergence analysis shows the polynomial accuracy of the proposed method. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach through a series of numerical examples. Moreover, we apply our method to achieve a highly accurate computation of the homogenized coefficients for a quasiperiodic multiscale elliptic equation.},

In this paper, we take a step in this direction and conduct numerical analysis of the recently introduced time-relaxation ROM (TR-ROM), which uses spatial filtering to stabilize ROMs for convection-dominated flows. Specifically, we prove stability, show an a priori error bound, and show parameter scalings for the TR-ROM. Our numerical investigation shows that the theoretical convergence rate and the parameter scalings with respect to the ROM dimension and filter radius are recovered numerically. In addition, the parameter scaling can be used to extrapolate the time-relaxation parameter to other ROM dimensions and filter radii. Moreover, the parameter scaling with respect to the filter radius is also observed in the predictive regime.},
