We show that, with an appropriate normalization, the distribution of the time when the process attains its maximum converges to the inverse gamma distribution whenever the random walk attains a rare small value of the maximum. Similar results are also obtained in the nonlattice case. The present study supplements the earlier work by the author on a similar problem for rare high value of the maximum.},

The explicit upper bounds for the Wasserstein distance for the central limit theorem (CLT) of the MLE are provided as $N \to \infty$ and/or $T \to \infty$. In the second part of the paper, the $N$ Fourier modes are observed at uniform time grid, $t_i = i (T/M)$, $i=0,\dots,M,$ where $M$ is the number of time grid points. The consistency and asymptotic normality are studied as $T,M,N \to +\infty$ in addition to the rate of convergence in law in the CLT.},

We also provide some concrete examples, some interesting properties, and a construction method of a conditional dependent random vector.

In this paper, we prove that this normalized multilevel error converges to different nontrivial limiting processes with various sharp rates $u_{n,m}$ depending on the behavior of the LÃ©vy measure around zero. Our results are consistent with those of Jacod [Ann. Probab., 32 (2004), pp. 1830--1872] obtained for the normalized error $u_n(X^n-X)$, as when letting $m$ tends to infinity, we recover the same limiting processes. For the multilevel error, the proofs of the current paper are challenging since, unlike Jacod's paper, we need to deal with $m$ dependent triangular arrays instead of one.},

  abstract     = {In the white Gaussian noise (WGN) model on the half-line, $dV(x)=f(x)\,dx+\varepsilon \, dW(x)$, $x>0$, minimax linear estimators of the functional $x^{1/2}_0f(x_0)$ are sought for a given $x_0>0$. Here, $f$ is an unknown signal satisfying a certain restriction $f\in\mathfrak{F}$, $\varepsilon>0$ is a given parameter, and $W(\,{\cdot}\,)$ is the standard Wiener process. With the use of the Mellin transform, it is shown that the above problem is equivalent to a similar (but better known) WGN model on the whole line, $dY(u)=g(u)\,du+\varepsilon \, dW(u)$, $-\infty<u<\infty$, where minimax linear estimators of the functional $g(u_0)$ are sought under a matching restriction $g\in \mathfrak{F}_0$, for $u_0=\log x_0.$ This demonstrates a close connection between the two models, which permits one to translate results on minimax linear estimation easily from one model to the other. In particular, it leads to minimax linear estimators on the half-line for a variety of ellipsoidal and cuboidal function classes $\mathfrak{F}$.},

  abstract     = {We propose new versions of the weak law of large numbers (LLN) for weakly dependent (nonidentically distributed, in general) summands, either assuming that each summand has finite expectation or without this assumption. One of the main conditions in the first of the three cases we consider (this case develops the ideas of Y. S. Chow [Ann. Math. Statist., 42 (1971), pp. 393--394]) is the CesÃ ro uniform integrability of the summands in the spirit of T. K. Chandra's studies of 1989--2012 on LLNs for pairwise independent random variables. In this result, the pairwise dependence conditions are replaced by quite different weak dependence type conditions in the spirit of A.N. Kolmogorov's paper [Atti Accad. Naz. Lincei Rend. (6), 9 (1929), pp. 470--474]; the only difference is that, in the present paper, we impose conditions only on the first moments of some conditional expectations, rather than on their second moments. In the second case, which is based on a slightly different weak dependence condition, we use the method of telescopic expansion and the fact that the convergence in probability to a constant can be interpreted as weak convergence. In the third case, we establish an LLN for summands without finite expectations, assuming, again, that they are not necessarily identically distributed.},
