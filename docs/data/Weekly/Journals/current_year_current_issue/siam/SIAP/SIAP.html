  abstract     = {Abstract. Accurately modeling the evolution of the borehole surface around the bit plays a crucial role in understanding the mechanism of self-excited vibrations in drilling processes. This paper studies the evolution of the bottom-hole surface under given axial-torsional-lateral bit motions. It is shown that the evolution of the bottom-hole surface geometry is governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) in the form of a conservation law with source terms. Scaling of the PDE is conducted to determine the dominant parameters influencing the evolution of the borehole surface. The scaled PDE is solved numerically using a finite-volume algorithm. A study of typical drilling modes demonstrates that the PDE model not only predicts the depth of cut ahead of cutting blades more accurately than classical time delay models but also reconstructs wellbore surface comparable to published simulation and experimental results. This PDE formulation shows a promising potential for the modeling of drill bit vibrations, especially bit whirl.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recreational fisheries, often recognized as fishing activities undertaken by individuals for sport and leisure, can be conceptualized as integrated systems where changes in human activities have significant implications for the interconnected components of the fishery ecosystems. These systems often exhibit nonlinear dynamics and are susceptible to abrupt and irreversible shifts in function and structure, referred to as critical transitions. Most existing studies on critical transitions in fishery ecosystems focus on the magnitude of changes in fishing practices. In this study, we examine a recreational fishery model that incorporates the prey and its predators, both of which are subject to fishing by anglers. Our analysis demonstrates that the fishery ecosystem is sensitive not only to the magnitude of changes in fishing pressure but also to the rate at which these changes are implemented. Surprisingly, for fixed fishing pressure of predators, a slow increase in fishing pressure of the prey, even when aiming at a relatively high fishing target, can sustain the prey fish stock at a sustainable biomass level, while a fast increase in fishing pressure can lead to the collapse of prey population. Additionally, we identify critical thresholds for the rate of increase in fishing pressure for different initial population sizes and accordingly assign warning levels to these values. Furthermore, to evaluate the risk of rate-induced tipping, we introduce two key notions of tipping time and rate-tipping probability. Interestingly, we find that as the rate of change of fishing pressure increases, the tipping probability first increases rapidly, then slowly, and finally saturates, while tipping time decreases gradually, that is, the increase of accelerates the collapse of prey population. The scenario in which the fishing pressures of the prey and predators vary synchronously is also considered. Our study offers valuable insights for fisheries management decision-making, not only emphasizing the importance of considering the magnitude of management adjustments but also highlighting the temporal dynamics of implementing these changes to achieve desired outcomes.},

This problem models the nondestructive testing for a partially buried object from electrostatic measurements on the accessible part of the boundary. The main novelty is the extension of the linear sampling and factorization methods to an electrostatic problem with partial measurements. These methods so far have only mainly applied to recovering interior defects, which is a simpler problem. Another important aspect of this paper is in our numerics, where we derive a system of boundary integral equations to recover the mixed Green’s function needed for our inversion. With this, we are able to analytically and numerically solve the inverse shape problem. For the inverse parameter problem, we prove uniqueness and Lipschitz-stability (in a finite dimensional function space) assuming that one has the associated Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator on the accessible part of the boundary.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Understanding the mechanisms that drive biodiversity and ecosystem resilience in a rapidly changing world requires a deeper investigation into behavioral diversity among individuals. Consistent individual differences in behavior, often referred to as animal personality, play a crucial role in shaping ecological and evolutionary dynamics, particularly in foraging behavior. Traditional approaches in behavioral and evolutionary ecology typically focus on average behavior, neglecting the significance of individual variability. This study explores the influence of consumer personality on ecological dynamics, specifically examining how variations in food availability affect behavioral strategies and ecosystem functioning. We develop a consumer-resource model that incorporates personality-dependent saturating attack rates based on the mean-field ratio of resources to consumers. The well-posedness of the model is established, and we analyze the existence and stability of all steady-state solutions. Through bifurcation analysis, we identify critical transition parameters and describe the nonlinear phenomena induced by personality-dependent attack rates. Our findings demonstrate that boldness in consumers enhances their persistence, particularly under low levels of boldness, where populations can survive even with moderate or high food supply, which was not captured in classical frameworks.},

In this paper, a model where microscopic organisms carry out the dweller-wanderer conversion is considered; the conversion occurs at microscopic time scale and is based solely on the chemical concentrations. Cells in the dweller state are modeled with zero diffusivity, while those in the wanderer state are assigned positive diffusivity, resulting in a coupled system of an ODE and a PDE. The paper demonstrates the existence and uniqueness of the system, and convergence to chemotaxis models as the time scale parameter .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many scientific questions can be framed as asking for a first passage time (FPT), which generically describes the time it takes a random “searcher” to find a “target.” The important timescale in a variety of biophysical systems is the time it takes the fastest searcher(s) to find a target out of many searchers. Previous work on such fastest FPTs assumes that all searchers are initially present in the domain, which makes the problem amenable to extreme value theory. In this paper, we consider an alternative model in which searchers progressively enter the domain at a constant “immigration” rate. In the fast immigration rate limit, we determine the probability distribution and moments of the th fastest FPT. Our rigorous theory applies to many models of stochastic motion, including random walks on discrete networks and diffusion on continuous state spaces. Mathematically, our analysis involves studying the extrema of an infinite sequence of random variables which are both not independent and not identically distributed. Our results constitute a rare instance in which extreme value statistics can be determined exactly for strongly correlated random variables.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper we use singular perturbation theory to solve the 2D narrow capture problem for a set of partially accessible targets , in a bounded domain . In contrast to previous models of narrow capture, we assume that when a searcher finds a target by attaching to the partially adsorbing surface it does not have immediate access to the resources within the target interior. Instead, the searcher remains attached to the surface for a random waiting time , after which it either gains access to the resources within (surface absorption) or detaches and continues its search process (surface desorption). We also consider two distinct desorption scenarios – either the particle continues its search from the point of desorption or rapidly returns to its initial search position. In applications to animal foraging, the latter would correspond to an animal returning to its home base whereas the resources within a target could represent food or shelter. We formulate the narrow capture problem in terms of a set of renewal equations that relate the probability density and target flux densities for absorption to the corresponding quantities for irreversible adsorption. The renewal equations, which effectively sew together successive rounds of adsorption and desorption prior to the final absorption event, provide a general probabilistic framework for incorporating non-Markovian models of desorption/absorption and different search scenarios following desorption. We solve the general renewal equations in two stages. First, we calculate the Laplace transformed target fluxes for irreversible adsorption by solving a Robin boundary value problem (BVP) in the small-target limit using matched asymptotic analysis. We then use the inner solution of the BVP to solve the corresponding Laplace transformed renewal equations for non-Markovian desorption/absorption, which leads to explicit Neumann series expansions of the corresponding target fluxes. Finally, the latter are used to determine the corresponding splitting probabilities and conditional mean FPTs for absorption.},

The quadratic autocatalytic reaction, a pivotal step in many reaction systems, is closely monitored by the complexing agent, which tracks the reaction process and locates the position of the reaction front, underscoring its significance. Thus, it is interesting to study how the complexation reaction affects traveling waves in the quadratic autocatalytic system. Two critical questions on traveling waves of a system are (1) does there exist a such that a traveling wave with speed exists if and only if and (2) if such a exists, is the minimum wave speed derived from the linearization of the system at the unstable steady state? For the quadratic autocatalytic reaction system without complexation reactions, the answers to these two questions are affirmative. However, in the presence of a complexing agent, we give sufficient conditions for linear and nonlinear minimal speed selection mechanisms in different parameter regimes. Our findings reveal that the complex agent, far from being a passive observer, plays a dynamic and active role in the wave propagation of the quadratic autocatalytic reaction system, significantly impacting its behavior.},

In the present work, we develop and analyze such a model based on harmonic functions and linear diffusion. Our general problem is known to be NP-hard and that the objective function is monotone and submodular; consequently, we can greedily approximate the solution within a constant factor. Introducing and analyzing a convex relaxation, we show that the problem can be approximately solved using smooth optimization methods. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of example networks.},

However, most functional elements of chromatin are not located at the chain ends, raising questions about analytical scaling relationships for non-end-to-end MFETs. Through the asymptotic expansion of the principal eigenvalue of the Fokker–Planck equation with absorbing boundary, we reveal a mixed scaling law between the MFET of monomer pairs deep within the polymer interior and their linear distance, and propose an approximate formula for the MFET of monomer pairs near the chain ends. Brownian simulations validate our analytical approximations. Our theoretical results highlight the differences in looping dynamics between the interior and exterior regions of polymer chains.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. When a fluid carrying a passive solute flows quickly through porous media, three key macroscale transport mechanisms occur. These mechanisms are diffusion, advection, and dispersion, all of which depend on the microstructure of the porous medium; however, this dependence remains poorly understood. For idealized microstructures, one can use the mathematical framework of homogenization to examine this dependence, but heterogeneous materials are more challenging. Here, we consider sorption of a solute by a two-dimensional microstructure comprising an array of adsorbent obstacles of smooth but arbitrary shape, the size and spacing of which can vary along the length of the porous medium. We use homogenization via the method of multiple scales to systematically upscale a microscale problem involving nonperiodic cells of varying area to obtain effective continuum equations for macroscale transport and sorption. The equations are characterized by the local porosity, an effective local adsorption rate, and an effective local anisotropic solute diffusivity. All of these macroscale properties depend nontrivially on the two degrees of microstructural geometric freedom in our problem; obstacle size, and obstacle spacing. Further, the coefficient of effective diffusivity comprises the molecular diffusivity, the suppressive effect of the presence of obstacles, and the enhancing effect of dispersion. To illustrate the mathematical model, we focus on a simple example geometry comprising circular obstacles on a hexagonal lattice, for which we numerically determine the macroscale permeability and effective diffusivity. We find a power law for the dispersive component of solute transport, consistent with classical Taylor dispersion.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this study, we obtain the exact switching time distributions between the free and bound gene states for a detailed stochastic model of an autoregulatory feedback loop with transcription, translation, mRNA, and protein decay, as well as protein-gene interactions. The analytical solution generalizes and corrects the previous ones obtained in [P. Visco, R. J. Allen, and M. R. Evans, Phys. Rev. Lett., 101 (2008), 118104] and [Z. Cao and R. Grima, Nat. Commun., 9 (2018), 3305] for a reduced model of an autoregulatory loop that ignores the mRNA dynamics. We find that when the mRNA dynamics is modelled explicitly, the holding time in the free gene state can produce three shapes of steady-state distributions (decaying, bell-shaped, and bimodal). In particular, the detailed model with both mRNA and protein descriptions can produce a distribution shape that the reduced model fails to capture—the detailed model of a negative (positive) feedback loop can display a bimodal (bell-shaped) holding time distribution, while the reduced model cannot. Interestingly, we find that an autoregulatory loop can produce a heavy-tailed holding time distribution and the origin of this phenomenon is clarified using our analytical solution. We also investigate how the distribution shape is affected by the type of feedback, the binding and unbinding rates, and the transcription rates. Finally, based on the distribution shape, we have developed a new method of inferring autoregulation using single-cell time-trace gene expression data.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We know that the electric field generated by a plasmonic nano-particle (with negative permittivity) is given as a polarization of the incident electric field. Similarly, the electric field produced by a dielectric nano-particle (with positive but high permittivity) is given as a polarization of the incident magnetic field. In this work, we demonstrate that a hybrid dimer—composed of two closely coupled nano-particles, one plasmonic and the other dielectric—can polarize both the incident electric and the magnetic fields. Consequently, such hybrid dimers have the potential to modify both the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the surrounding medium. However, this dual modification occurs only when the two nano-particles share common resonant frequencies. We derive the asymptotic expansion of the fields generated by these hybrid dimers in the subwavelength regime for incident frequencies near their shared resonant frequencies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the time-harmonic Maxwell equations set on a domain made of two subdomains and , such that represents a magnetic conductor and represents a nonmagnetic material, and the relative magnetic permeability between the two materials is very high. Assuming smoothness for the interface between the subdomains and regularity of the data, the electric field solution of the Maxwell equations possesses an asymptotic expansion in powers of the parameter with profile terms rapidly decaying inside the magnetic conductor. We make explicit the first terms of this expansion. As an application of the asymptotic expansion we obtain the asymptotic behavior of a skin depth function that allows one to measure the boundary layer phenomenon at large relative permeability. As another application of this expansion we give elements of proof for the derivation of impedance boundary conditions (IBCs) up to the third order of approximation with respect to the parameter , and we prove error estimates for the IBCs.},
