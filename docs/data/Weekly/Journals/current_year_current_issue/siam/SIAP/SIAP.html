  abstract     = {Abstract. The study of looping dynamics is a fundamental problem in chromatin dynamics. Previous studies focused on the mean first encounter time (MFET) for the two ends of a polymer to meet, revealing mixed scaling laws between MFET and chain length. However, most functional elements of chromatin are not located at the chain ends, raising questions about analytical scaling relationships for non-end-to-end MFETs. Through the asymptotic expansion of the principal eigenvalue of the Fokker–Planck equation with absorbing boundary, we reveal a mixed scaling law between the MFET of monomer pairs deep within the polymer interior and their linear distance, and propose an approximate formula for the MFET of monomer pairs near the chain ends. Brownian simulations validate our analytical approximations. Our theoretical results highlight the differences in looping dynamics between the interior and exterior regions of polymer chains.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. When a fluid carrying a passive solute flows quickly through porous media, three key macroscale transport mechanisms occur. These mechanisms are diffusion, advection, and dispersion, all of which depend on the microstructure of the porous medium; however, this dependence remains poorly understood. For idealized microstructures, one can use the mathematical framework of homogenization to examine this dependence, but heterogeneous materials are more challenging. Here, we consider sorption of a solute by a two-dimensional microstructure comprising an array of adsorbent obstacles of smooth but arbitrary shape, the size and spacing of which can vary along the length of the porous medium. We use homogenization via the method of multiple scales to systematically upscale a microscale problem involving nonperiodic cells of varying area to obtain effective continuum equations for macroscale transport and sorption. The equations are characterized by the local porosity, an effective local adsorption rate, and an effective local anisotropic solute diffusivity. All of these macroscale properties depend nontrivially on the two degrees of microstructural geometric freedom in our problem; obstacle size, and obstacle spacing. Further, the coefficient of effective diffusivity comprises the molecular diffusivity, the suppressive effect of the presence of obstacles, and the enhancing effect of dispersion. To illustrate the mathematical model, we focus on a simple example geometry comprising circular obstacles on a hexagonal lattice, for which we numerically determine the macroscale permeability and effective diffusivity. We find a power law for the dispersive component of solute transport, consistent with classical Taylor dispersion.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this study, we obtain the exact switching time distributions between the free and bound gene states for a detailed stochastic model of an autoregulatory feedback loop with transcription, translation, mRNA, and protein decay, as well as protein-gene interactions. The analytical solution generalizes and corrects the previous ones obtained in [P. Visco, R. J. Allen, and M. R. Evans, Phys. Rev. Lett., 101 (2008), 118104] and [Z. Cao and R. Grima, Nat. Commun., 9 (2018), 3305] for a reduced model of an autoregulatory loop that ignores the mRNA dynamics. We find that when the mRNA dynamics is modelled explicitly, the holding time in the free gene state can produce three shapes of steady-state distributions (decaying, bell-shaped, and bimodal). In particular, the detailed model with both mRNA and protein descriptions can produce a distribution shape that the reduced model fails to capture—the detailed model of a negative (positive) feedback loop can display a bimodal (bell-shaped) holding time distribution, while the reduced model cannot. Interestingly, we find that an autoregulatory loop can produce a heavy-tailed holding time distribution and the origin of this phenomenon is clarified using our analytical solution. We also investigate how the distribution shape is affected by the type of feedback, the binding and unbinding rates, and the transcription rates. Finally, based on the distribution shape, we have developed a new method of inferring autoregulation using single-cell time-trace gene expression data.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we investigate the generalized bathtub model, a nonlocal transport equation for describing network trip flows served by privately operated vehicles inside a road network. First, we establish the well-posedness of the mathematical model for both classical and weak solutions. Then we consider an inverse source problem of the model with model parameters embodying particular traffic situations. We establish a conditional Lipschitz stability of the inverse problem under a suitable a priori regularity assumption on the problem data, using a Volterra integral formulation of the problem. Inspired by the analysis, we develop an easy-to-implement numerical method for reconstructing the flow rates, and we provide the error analysis of the method. Further we present several numerical experiments to complement the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We know that the electric field generated by a plasmonic nano-particle (with negative permittivity) is given as a polarization of the incident electric field. Similarly, the electric field produced by a dielectric nano-particle (with positive but high permittivity) is given as a polarization of the incident magnetic field. In this work, we demonstrate that a hybrid dimer—composed of two closely coupled nano-particles, one plasmonic and the other dielectric—can polarize both the incident electric and the magnetic fields. Consequently, such hybrid dimers have the potential to modify both the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the surrounding medium. However, this dual modification occurs only when the two nano-particles share common resonant frequencies. We derive the asymptotic expansion of the fields generated by these hybrid dimers in the subwavelength regime for incident frequencies near their shared resonant frequencies.},

We consider the time-harmonic Maxwell equations set on a domain made of two subdomains and , such that represents a magnetic conductor and represents a nonmagnetic material, and the relative magnetic permeability between the two materials is very high. Assuming smoothness for the interface between the subdomains and regularity of the data, the electric field solution of the Maxwell equations possesses an asymptotic expansion in powers of the parameter with profile terms rapidly decaying inside the magnetic conductor. We make explicit the first terms of this expansion. As an application of the asymptotic expansion we obtain the asymptotic behavior of a skin depth function that allows one to measure the boundary layer phenomenon at large relative permeability. As another application of this expansion we give elements of proof for the derivation of impedance boundary conditions (IBCs) up to the third order of approximation with respect to the parameter , and we prove error estimates for the IBCs.},
