  abstract     = {Abstract. The committor function is a central object for quantifying transitions between metastable states in randomly perturbed dynamical systems. Recently, effective methods based on deep learning have been proposed to compute the committor function in high-dimensional systems. However, sampling training data in these methods remains a challenging task, particularly for systems with small noise. In this work, we propose a deep learning method in which the data are sampled from the equilibrium distribution of a modified potential. We introduce two such modified potentials: the first (scheme I) incorporates a bias formed by localized Gaussian functions along a one-dimensional variable constructed from the learned committor function; the second (scheme II) uses a bias involving the free energy associated with the learned committor function. We analyze the distribution of the sampled data and show that, in both schemes, the data are well spread out and effectively cover the transition tube. Both schemes enable adaptive learning of the committor function without requiring prior knowledge of the transition pathways. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated using high-dimensional examples, including the alanine dipeptide and a solvated dimer system.

In this work, we propose a balanced multicomponent and multilayer neural network (MMNN) structure to accurately and efficiently approximate functions with complex features in terms of both degrees of freedom and computational cost. The main idea is inspired by a multicomponent approach in which each component can be effectively approximated by a single-layer network, combined with a multilayer decomposition strategy to capture the complexity of the target function. Although MMNNs can be viewed as a simple modification of fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) or multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) by introducing balanced multicomponent structures, they achieve a significant reduction in training parameters, a much more efficient training process, and improved accuracy compared to FCNNs or MLPs. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MMNNs in approximating highly oscillatory functions and their ability to automatically adapt to localized features.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Classical model reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. While those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these issues, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initializing a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modeling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% fewer parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present an efficient and scalable algorithm for performing matrix-vector multiplications (matvecs) for block Toeplitz matrices. Such matrices, which are shift-invariant with respect to their blocks, arise in the context of solving inverse problems governed by autonomous systems, and time-invariant systems in particular. In this article, we consider inverse problems that infer unknown parameters from observational data of a linear time-invariant dynamical system given in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs). Matrix-free Newton-conjugate-gradient methods are often the gold standard for solving these inverse problems, but they require numerous actions of the Hessian on a vector. Matrix-free adjoint-based Hessian matvecs require solution of a pair of linearized forward/adjoint PDE solves per Hessian action, which may be prohibitive for large-scale inverse problems. Time invariance of the forward PDE problem leads to a block Toeplitz structure of the discretized parameter-to-observable (p2o) map defining the mapping from inputs (parameters) to outputs (observables) of the PDEs. This block Toeplitz structure enables us to exploit two key properties: (1) compact storage of the p2o map and its adjoint, and (2) efficient fast Fourier transform–based Hessian matvecs. The proposed algorithm is mapped onto large multi-GPU clusters and achieves more than 80% of peak bandwidth on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Excellent weak scaling is shown for up to 48 A100 GPUs. For the targeted problems, the implementation executes Hessian matvecs within fractions of a second, which is orders of magnitude faster than can be achieved by conventional matrix-free Hessian matvecs via forward/adjoint PDE solves.

Since the appearance of curved interfaces, the coarse and finest meshes have no nested property, which leads to the low-dimensional finite element space not being a subset of the one defined on the finest mesh. Even though there is no nested property, the nonnested augmented subspace method can transfer the solution of the Poisson–Boltzmann equation on the finest mesh to solving a linear equation on the same mesh and a small scale semilinear problem on a low-dimensional augmented subspace.

Without data transfers between a CPU and GPU, our implementation has achieved the elimination of a major performance bottleneck under a memory-bound situation, particularly when solving many small problems in batch. We discuss the design principles and implementation details for our kernel function and core operations. Different design choices are justified by numerical experiments. By using the application of distributed control of alternating current optimal power flow, where a large problem is decomposed into many smaller nonlinear programs using a Lagrangian approach, we demonstrate computational performance of ExaTron on the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

To treat the material interface with higher-order accuracy, we develop the balanced conditions related to spatial derivatives at material interfaces for 2D planar and axisymmetric compressible multimedium flows. We then employ these balanced conditions to describe the interfacial physical properties and disclose that these conditions cannot be satisfied for the current ghost fluid methods, resulting in a first-order temporal error occurring in the region of the interface. To fix this difficulty, a multimedium generalized Riemann problem is proposed to predict the states and the spatial derivatives along the normal direction at the interface, in which the balanced conditions are imposed. Theoretical analysis and numerical results show that the proposed 2nd-MGFM can satisfy these balanced conditions, effectively eliminate the first-order major error term, suppress numerical overheating, and improve mass conservation.},

The Hamiltonian is split into a linear part that consists of the Laplace and rotation and a nonlinear part that includes all the remaining terms. For the linear subproblem, we factorize the linear operator into a product of simple suboperators using the exact classical-quantum correspondence and semigroups decomposition, and these suboperators are integrated exactly in either physical or phase space. Importantly, we first derive explicit formulas for the splitting coefficients originally obtained by numerically solving a nonlinear system. The nonlinear part is solved exactly in physical space, and the convolution-type nonlocal potential with a singular kernel is computed via the Far-field Smooth Approximation (FSA) method with spectral accuracy. This “compact” splitting, involving only two operators, significantly simplifies the design of high-order schemes. Our method achieves high-order temporal precision and spectral spatial accuracy with near-optimal efficiency, and it is explicit, easy to implement and unconditionally stable. In addition, we derive some dynamical properties and conduct a comprehensive investigation, including accuracy confirmation, property verification, interaction of quantized vortices, and dynamics under honeycomb potential.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose a model order reduction approach to speed up the computation of seismograms, i.e., the solution of the seismic wave equation evaluated at a receiver location, for different model parameters. This is highly relevant for seismic applications, such as full waveform inversion, seismic tomography, or monitoring tools of seismicity, that are computationally challenging, as the discretized (forward) model often has a huge number of unknowns and needs to be solved many times for different model parameters. Our approach achieves a reduction of the unknowns by a factor of approximately 1000 for various numerical experiments for a two-dimensional subsurface model of Groningen, the Netherlands (a region known for its seismic activity), even if the (known) wave speeds of the subsurface are relatively varied. Moreover, when using multiple cores to construct the reduced model, we can approximate the (time domain) seismogram in a lower wall-clock time than an implicit Newmark-beta method. To realize this reduction, we exploit the fact that seismograms are low-pass filtered for the observed seismic events. We thus consider the Laplace-transformed problem in the frequency domain and implicitly restrict ourselves to the frequency range of interest by adjusting the parameters of a source function, which is a popular model in computational seismology for the temporal response of an earthquake. Therefore, we can avoid the high frequencies that would require many reduced basis functions to reach the desired accuracy and generally make the reduced order approximation of wave problems challenging. Instead, we can prove for our ansatz that for a fixed subsurface model, the reduced order approximation converges exponentially fast in the frequency range of interest in the Laplace domain. We build the reduced model from solutions of the Laplace-transformed problem via a (proper orthogonal decomposition-)greedy algorithm targeting the construction of the reduced model to the time domain seismograms; the latter is achieved by using an a posteriori error estimator that does not require computing any time domain counterparts. Finally, we show that we obtain a stable reduced model, thus overcoming the challenge that standard model reduction approaches do not necessarily yield a stable reduced model for wave problems.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) is the most appropriate model for extracting thermal properties of semiconductors from state-of-the-art frequency-domain thermo-reflectance (FDTR) experimental data. However, solving the BTE is computationally expensive because of its high-dimensionality, resulting in prohibitive time-to-solution. Scalable parallelization of the BTE solver that can avail supercomputing resources is desirable. We developed an adaptive parallelization strategy for the implicit solution of the multidimensional phonon BTE in the time domain. This adaptive method minimizes load imbalance and unnecessary computations in previously used band and cell-based partitioning schemes, achieved an average speedup of compared to the nonadaptive counterpart, and maintained strong scalability at cores. This new solver was used to simulate an FDTR experiment. The results (phase lag between the probe and pulse laser signals) are validated against experimental measurements and show good agreement. Our developed strategies can be applied to other computationally challenging problems constrained by limited parallelism.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the past decade, tensors have shown their potential as valuable tools for various tasks in numerical linear algebra. While most of the research has been focusing on how to compress a given tensor in order to maintain information as well as reducing the storage demand for its allocation, the solution of linear tensor equations is a less explored venue. Even if many of the routines available in the literature are based on alternating minimization schemes (ALS), we pursue a different path and utilize Krylov methods instead. The use of Krylov methods in the tensor realm is not new. However, these routines often turn out to be rather expensive in terms of computational cost, and ALS procedures are preferred in practice. We enhance Krylov methods for linear tensor equations with a panel of diverse randomization-based strategies which remarkably increase the efficiency of these solvers, making them competitive with state-of-the-art ALS schemes. The up-to-date randomized approaches we employ range from sketched Krylov methods with incomplete orthogonalization and structured sketching transformations to streaming algorithms for tensor rounding. The promising performance of our new solver for linear tensor equations is demonstrated by many numerical results. Reproducibility of computational results.

We propose a model of optimal parallel transport between vector fields on a connection graph, which consists of a weighted graph along with a map from its edges to an orthogonal group. Inspired by the well-known equivalence of 1-Wasserstein distance and minimum cost flows on standard graphs, we consider two versions of this problem: a minimum norm vector-valued flow problem with divergence constraints reflective of the connection structure of the graph, and a modified version which incorporates both quadratic regularization and a relaxation of the divergence constraint. Our theoretical contributions include conditions for feasibility and computation of the Lagrangian dual problem for both problems and duality correspondence for the relaxed-regularized version. Example applications of the model including transport between color images, vector field interpolation, and unsupervised clustering of vector field-valued data (in this case hurricane trajectory data) are also considered.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A Taylor method for solving an ordinary differential equation initial-value problem , computes the Taylor series (TS) of the solution at the current point, truncated to some order, and then advances to the next point by summing the TS with a suitable stepsize. A standard ODE method (e.g., Runge–Kutta) treats function as a black box, but a Taylor solver requires to be preprocessed into a code-list of elementary operations that it interprets as operations on (truncated) TS. The trade-off for this extra work includes arbitrary order, typically enabling much larger stepsizes. For a standard function, such as , this means evaluating , where are TS. The sub-ODE method applies the ODE , obeyed by , to in-line this operation as . This gives economy of implementation: each function that satisfies a simple ODE goes into the “Taylor library” with a few lines of code—not needing a separate recurrence relation, which is the typical approach. Mathematically, however, the use of sub-ODEs generally transforms the original ODE into a differential-algebraic system, making it nontrivial to ensure a sound system of recurrences for Taylor coefficients. We prove that, regardless of how many sub-ODEs are incorporated into , this approach guarantees a sound system. We introduce our sub-ODE-based MATLAB ODE solver and show that its performance compares favorably with solvers from the MATLAB ODE suite.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent years have witnessed the introduction and development of extremely fast rational function algorithms. Many ideas in this realm arose from polynomial-based linear-algebraic algorithms. However, polynomial approximation is occasionally ill-suited to specific challenging tasks arising in several situations. Some occasions require maximal efficiency in the number of encoding parameters while retaining the renowned accuracy of polynomial-based approximation. One application comes from promoting empirical pointwise functions to sparse matrix operators. Another is the robust representation of noisy data without overfitting. Rational function approximations provide a simple but flexible alternative (actually a superset), allowing one to capture complex nonlinearities without oscillatory artifacts. However, these come with extra challenges: i) coping with singularities and near singularities arising from a vanishing denominator, and ii) a nonuniqueness owing to the simultaneous renormalization of both numerator and denominator. We, therefore, introduce a new rational function framework using manifestly positive and normalized Bernstein polynomials for the denominator and any traditional polynomial basis (e.g., Chebyshev) for the numerator. While an expressly nonsingular approximation slightly reduces the maximum degree of compression, it keeps all the benefits of rational functions while maintaining the flexibility and robustness of polynomials, especially in noisy data scenarios. We illustrate the relevant aspects of this approach with a series of derivations and computational examples. Reproducibility of computational results.

In this paper, we propose a novel accuracy-preserved tensor-train (APTT) method to efficiently solve the Boltzmann-BGK equation. A second-order finite difference scheme is applied to discretize the Boltzmann-BGK equation, resulting in a tensor algebraic system at each time step. Based on the low-rank TT representation, the tensor algebraic system is then approximated as a TT-based low-rank system, which is efficiently solved using the TT-modified alternating least-squares (TT-MALS) solver. Thanks to the low-rank TT representation, the APTT method can significantly reduce the computational and memory costs compared to traditional numerical methods. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the APTT method maintains the same convergence rate as that of the finite difference scheme. The convergence rate and efficiency of the APTT method are validated by several benchmark test cases.},

This paper is concerned with the approximation of probability distributions known up to normalization constants, with a focus on Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in scientific computing. In this context, key challenges include costly repeated evaluations of forward models, multimodality, and inaccessible gradients for the forward model. To address them, we develop a variational inference framework that combines the Fisher–Rao natural gradient with specialized quadrature rules to enable derivative free updates of Gaussian mixture variational families. The resulting method, termed derivative free Gaussian mixture variational inference (DF-GMVI), guarantees covariance positivity and affine invariance, offering a stable and efficient framework for approximating complex posterior distributions. The effectiveness of DF-GMVI is demonstrated through numerical experiments on challenging scenarios, including distributions with multiple modes, infinitely many modes, and curved modes in spaces with up to 100 dimensions. The method’s practicality is further demonstrated in a large-scale application, where it successfully recovers the initial conditions of the Navier–Stokes equations from solution data at positive times.

We introduce a novel sliding interface formulation for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) between a rotating rigid structure and incompressible fluid, improving existing methodologies with a skew-symmetric Nitsche’s stabilization term applied on an artificial sliding interface alongside a rotational arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian framework. This innovative approach not only preserves the energy-dissipating property at the continuous level but also provides a robust foundation for further advancements in FSI modeling. Our methodology includes a first-order full discretization that maintains these critical energy-dissipating properties at the discrete level, ensuring numerical stability and accuracy. While prior contributions such as the original sliding interface method introduced by Bazilevs and Hughes (Comput. Mech., 43(1):143–150, 2008) have been significant, theoretical analyses such as the inf-sup condition on nonmatching meshes have gone largely unaddressed. We fill this gap by proving the inf-sup condition within the context of the isoparametric finite element method (FEM), where meshes are not only nonmatching but also overlapping, thus extending the applicability and robustness of our approach. Leveraging this inf-sup condition along with the inherent energy-dissipating properties, we establish the unique solvability of the fully discrete scheme. Through extensive numerical experiments, we illustrate the convergence, efficiency, and energy-dissipating property of the proposed method.},

We focus on the recently proposed transform-then-solve approach, which amounts to first applying a specific algebraic transformation to the linear system of equations arising from the discretization and then solving the transformed system with an algebraic multigrid method. Promising results have been previously obtained with a two-grid variant, and here we bring two key improvements to make the approach robust in a multilevel setting. For a model problem with a constant convection field, it is shown, in a local Fourier analysis setting, that the two-grid method is convergent at any level of the hierarchy, with bounds that are independent of both the mesh size and the Reynolds number. Numerical results with a K-cycle multigrid scheme confirm the theoretical expectations for constant coefficient problems. For problems with variable convective flow, the method appears also robust with grid independence convergence, although a mild dependency with respect to the Reynolds number shows up at very low viscosity in driven cavity problems. The method is based on point coarsening and therefore, besides the system matrix, requires knowing, for each discrete unknown, which grid point it is associated with.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms integrated projection-free techniques with accelerated gradient flows to minimize bending energies for nonlinear plates with nonconvex metric constraints. We discuss the stability and constraint consistency in a semidiscrete setting for both bilayer and prestrained plates. The proposed algorithms exhibit substantial improvements in efficiency and accuracy compared to the current state-of-the-art methods based on gradient flows.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, a gradient flow model is presented for conducting ground state calculations in the Wigner formalism of many-body systems in the framework of density functional theory. Theoretically, an energy functional in the Wigner formalism is proposed, based on which the minimization problem is designed and analyzed for the ground state, providing a new perspective for ground state calculations of the Wigner function. Employing density functional theory, a gradient flow model is built upon the energy functional to obtain the ground state Wigner function representing the entire many-body system. Numerically, a parallelizable algorithm is developed using the operator splitting method and the Fourier spectral collocation method, whose numerical complexity of a single iteration is . Numerical experiments demonstrate the anticipated accuracy, encompassing the one-dimensional system with up to particles and the three-dimensional system with defect, showcasing the potential of our approach to large-scale simulations and computations of systems with defect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deterministic method for calculating the ground state Wigner function of the three-dimensional many-body system.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We address the solution of the distributed control problem for the steady, incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. We propose an inexact Newton linearization of the optimality conditions. Upon discretization by a finite element scheme, we obtain a sequence of large symmetric linear systems of saddle-point type. We use an augmented Lagrangian-based block triangular preconditioner in combination with the flexible GMRES method at each Newton step. The preconditioner is applied inexactly via a suitable multigrid solver. Numerical experiments indicate that the resulting method appears to be fairly robust with respect to viscosity, mesh size, and the choice of regularization parameter when applied to 2D problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a new method to jointly reduce the dimension of the input and output space of a function between high-dimensional spaces. Choosing a reduced input subspace influences which output subspace is relevant and vice versa. Conventional methods focus on reducing either the input or output space, even though both are often reduced simultaneously in practice. Our coupled approach naturally supports goal-oriented dimension reduction, where either an input or output quantity of interest is prescribed. We consider, in particular, goal-oriented sensor placement and goal-oriented sensitivity analysis, which can be viewed as dimension reduction where the most important output or, respectively, input components are chosen. Both applications present difficult combinatorial optimization problems with expensive objectives such as the expected information gain and Sobol’ indices. By optimizing gradient-based bounds, we can determine the most informative sensors and most influential parameters as the largest diagonal entries of some diagnostic matrices, thus bypassing the combinatorial optimization and objective evaluation.
