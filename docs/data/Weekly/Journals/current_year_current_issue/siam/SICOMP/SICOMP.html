  abstract     = {Abstract. The polynomial method by Beals, Buhrman, Cleve, Mosca, and de Wolf (FOCS 1998; [J. ACM, 48 (2001), pp. 778–797]) and the adversary method by Ambainis (STOC 2000; [J. Comput. System Sci., 64 (2002), pp. 750–767]) and the compressed oracle method by Zhandry [Proceedings of the 39th CRYPTO, 2019, pp. 239–268] have been shown to be powerful in proving quantum query lower bounds for a wide variety of problems. In this paper, we propose a new method for proving quantum query lower bounds by a quantum sample-to-query lifting theorem, which is from an information theory perspective. Using this method, we obtain the following new results: (1) A quadratic relation between quantum sample and query complexities regarding quantum property testing, which is optimal and saturated by quantum state discrimination. Here, the sample complexity is measured given sample access to the quantum state to be tested, while the query complexity is measured given query access to an oracle that block-encodes the quantum state. (2) A matching lower bound for quantum Gibbs sampling at inverse temperature ( suppresses logarithmic factors), showing that the quantum Gibbs sampler by Gilyén, Su, Low, and Wiebe [Proceedings of the 51st STOC, 2019, pp. 193–204] is optimal. (3) A new lower bound for the entanglement entropy problem with gap , which was recently studied by She and Yuen [Proceedings of the 14th ITCS, 2023, pp. 96:1–96:17]. (4) A series of quantum query lower bounds for matrix spectrum testing, based on the sample lower bounds for quantum state spectrum testing by O’Donnell and Wright (STOC 2015; [Comm. Math. Phys., 387 (2021), pp. 1–95]). In addition, we provide unified proofs for some known lower bounds that have been proven previously via different techniques, including those for phase/amplitude estimation and Hamiltonian simulation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We settle the complexity of computing an equilibrium in atomic splittable congestion games with player-specific affine cost functions as we show that the computation is -complete. To prove that the problem is contained in , we develop a homotopy method that traces an equilibrium for varying flow demands of the players. A key technique for this method is to describe the evolution of the equilibrium locally by a novel block Laplacian matrix where each entry of the Laplacian is a Laplacian again. Using the properties of this matrix allows us to recompute efficiently the Laplacian after the support of the equilibrium changes by matrix pivot operations. These insights give rise to a path following formulation for computing an equilibrium where states correspond to supports that are feasible for some demands and neighboring supports are feasible for increased or decreased flow demands. A closer investigation of the block Laplacian system further allows us to orient the states giving rise to unique predecessor and successor states, thus putting the problem into . For the -hardness, we reduce from computing an approximate equilibrium of a bimatrix win-lose game. As a byproduct of our reduction we further show that computing a multiclass Wardrop equilibrium with class-dependent affine cost functions is -complete as well. As another byproduct of our -completeness proof, we obtain an algorithm that computes a continuum of equilibria parametrized by the players’ flow demand. For player-specific costs, the continuum may involve several increases and decreases of the demand and yields an algorithm that runs in polynomial space. For games with player-independent costs, only demand increases are necessary, yielding an algorithm computing all equilibria as a function of the flow demand that runs in time polynomial in the output.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. One of the major open problems in complexity theory is proving superlogarithmic lower bounds on the depth of circuits (i.e., ). [Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson Super-logarithmic depth lower bounds via direct sum in communication complexity, in Proceedings of the Sixth Annual Structure in Complexity Theory Conference, IEEE Computer Society, Chicago, 1991, pp. 299–304] suggested approaching this problem by proving that the depth complexity of a composition of functions is roughly the sum of the depth complexities of and . They showed that the validity of this conjecture would imply that . The intuition that underlies the Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson (KRW) conjecture is that the composition should behave like a “direct-sum problem”, in a certain sense, and, therefore, the depth complexity of should be the sum of the individual depth complexities. Nevertheless, there are two obstacles toward turning this intuition into a proof: first, we do not know how to prove that must behave like a direct-sum problem; second, we do not know how to prove that the complexity of the latter direct-sum problem is indeed the sum of the individual complexities. In this work, we focus on the second obstacle. To this end, we study a notion called “strong composition”, which is the same as except that it is forced to behave like a direct-sum problem. We prove a variant of the KRW conjecture for strong composition, thus overcoming the above second obstacle. This result demonstrates that the first obstacle above is the crucial barrier toward resolving the KRW conjecture. Along the way, we develop some general techniques that might be of independent interest.},
