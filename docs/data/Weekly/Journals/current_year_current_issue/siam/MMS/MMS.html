  abstract     = {Abstract. When auditing a redistricting plan, a persuasive method is to compare the plan with an ensemble of neutrally drawn redistricting plans. Ensembles are generated via algorithms that sample distributions on balanced graph partitions. To audit the partisan difference between the ensemble and a given plan, one must ensure that the nonpartisan criteria are matched so that we may conclude that partisan differences come from bias rather than, for example, levels of compactness or differences in community preservation. Certain sampling algorithms allow one to explicitly state the policy-based probability distribution on plans; however, these algorithms have shown poor mixing times for large graphs (i.e., redistricting spaces) for all but a few specialized measures. In this work, we generate a multiscale parallel tempering approach that makes local moves at each scale. The local moves allow us to adopt a wide variety of policy-based measures. We examine our method in the state of Connecticut and succeed at achieving fast mixing on a policy-based distribution that has never before been sampled at this scale. Our algorithm shows promise to expand to a significantly wider class of measures that will (i) allow for more principled and situation-based comparisons and (ii) probe for the typical partisan impact that policy can have on redistricting.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent work of three of the authors showed that the operator which maps the local density of states of a one-dimensional untwisted bilayer material to the local density of states of the same bilayer material at nonzero twist, known as the twist operator, can be learned by a neural network. In this work, we first provide a mathematical formulation of that work, making precise the relevant models and operator learning problem. We then prove that the operator learning problem is well-posed for a family of one-dimensional models. To do this, we first prove existence and regularity of the twist operator by solving an inverse problem. We then invoke the universal approximation theorem for operators to prove the existence of a neural network capable of approximating the twist operator.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose a tensor neural network–based machine learning method for solving elliptic multiscale problems. Leveraging the special structure of tensor neural networks, we can perform direct and highly accurate high-dimensional integration without relying on Monte Carlo methods. Within the framework of the homogenization method, the original multiscale problem is reformulated as several cell problems and a homogenized equation with reasonable accuracy. We then develop a machine learning framework, based on tensor neural networks, to solve the derived equations, especially the high-dimensional cell problems. The proposed method offers a novel approach to designing numerical algorithms for a broader class of multiscale problems with high accuracy. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a graph random walk (GRW) method for the study of charge transport properties of complex molecular materials in the time-of-flight regime. The molecules forming the material are represented by the vertices of a directed weighted graph, and the charge carriers are random walkers. The edge weights are rates for elementary jumping processes for a charge carrier to move along the edge and are determined from a combination of the energies of the involved vertices and interaction strength. Exclusions are built into the random walk to account for the Pauli exclusion principle. In time-of-flight experiments, charge carriers are injected into the material, and the time until they reach a collecting electrode is recorded. In this setting, our GRW approach allows direct evaluation of the expected hitting time of the collecting nodes in the graph in terms of a typically sparse linear system, thereby avoiding numerically cumbersome and potentially fluctuations-prone methods based on explicit time evolution from solutions of a high-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations (the master equation) or from kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). We validate the GRW approach by conducting numerical studies on charge dynamics of single and multiple carriers in diffusive and drift-diffusive (due to an external electric field) regimes using a surrogate lattice model of a realistic material whose properties have been simulated within a multiscale model framework combining quantum-mechanical and molecular-mechanics methods. The surrogate model allows varying types and strengths of energetic disorder from the reference baseline. A comparison with results from the master equation confirms the theoretical equivalence of both approaches also in numerical implementations. We further show that KMC results indicate substantial deviations due to inadequate sampling. All in all, we find that the GRW method provides a powerful alternative to the more commonly used methods without sampling issues and with the benefit of using sparse matrix methods.},
