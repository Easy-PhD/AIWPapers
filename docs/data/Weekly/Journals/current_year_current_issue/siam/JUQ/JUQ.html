  abstract     = {Abstract. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is widely used for inferring functions from noisy data. GPR crucially relies on the choice of a kernel, which might be specified in terms of a collection of hyperparameters that must be chosen or learned. Fully Bayesian GPR seeks to infer these kernel hyperparameters in a Bayesian sense, and the key computational challenge in sampling from their posterior distribution is the need for frequent determinant evaluations of large kernel matrices. This paper introduces a gradient-based, determinant-free approach for fully Bayesian GPR that combines a Gaussian integration trick for avoiding the determinant with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling. Our framework permits a matrix-free formulation and reduces the difficulty of dealing with hyperparameter gradients to a simple automatic differentiation. Our implementation is highly flexible and leverages GPU acceleration with linear-scaling memory footprint. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method’s ability to scale gracefully to both high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces and large kernel matrices.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper discusses the control of coherent structures in turbulent flows, which has broad applications among complex systems in science and technology. Mean field games have been proved a powerful tool and are proposed here to control the stochastic Lagrangian particles as players tracking the flow and tracer fields. We derive optimal control solutions for general nonlinear fluid systems using mean-field game models and develop computational algorithms to efficiently solve the resulting coupled forward and backward mean-field system. A precise link is established for the control of passive tracer density and the scalar vorticity field based on the functional Hamilton–Jacobi equations derived from the mean field models. A new iterative numerical strategy is then constructed to compute the optimal solution with fast convergence. We verify the skill of the mean-field control models and illustrate their practical efficiency on a prototype model modified from the viscous Burgers equation under various cost functions in both deterministic and stochastic formulations. The good model performance implies potential effectiveness of the strategy for more general high-dimensional turbulent systems.},
