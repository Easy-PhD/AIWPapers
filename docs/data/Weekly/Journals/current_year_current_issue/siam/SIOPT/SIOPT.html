  abstract     = {Abstract. We revisit a formulation technique for inequality constrained optimization problems that has been known for decades: the substitution of squared variables for nonnegative variables. Using this technique, inequality constraints are converted to equality constraints via the introduction of a squared-slack variable. Such formulations have the superficial advantage that inequality constraints can be dispensed with altogether. But there are clear disadvantages, not least being that first-order optimal points for the squared-variable reformulation may not correspond to first-order optimal points for the original problem because the Lagrange multipliers may have the wrong sign. Extending previous results, this paper shows that points satisfying approximate second-order optimality conditions for the squared-variable reformulation also, under certain conditions, satisfy approximate second-order optimality conditions for the original formulation and vice versa. Such results allow us to adapt complexity analysis of methods for equality constrained optimization to account for inequality constraints. On the algorithmic side, we examine squared-variable formulations for several interesting problem classes, including bound-constrained quadratic programming, linear programming, and nonnegative matrix factorization. We show that algorithms built on these formulations are surprisingly competitive with standard methods. For linear programming, we also examine the relationship between the squared-variable approach and primal-dual interior-point methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper concerns foundations of sensitivity and stability analysis in optimization and related areas, being primarily addressed constrained systems. We consider general models, which are described by multifunctions between Banach spaces and concentrate on characterizing their well-posedness properties that revolve around Lipschitz stability and metric regularity relative to sets. Invoking tools of variational analysis and generalized differentiation, we introduce new robust notions of relative contingent coderivatives. The novel machinery of variational analysis leads us to establishing complete characterizations of the relative well-posedness properties and developing basic rules of variational calculus interrelated with the obtained characterizations of well-posedness. Most of our results valid in general infinite-dimensional settings are also new in finite dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The use of quantum computing to accelerate complex optimization problems is a burgeoning research field. This paper applies Quantum Linear System Algorithms (QLSAs) to Newton systems within Interior Point Methods (IPMs) to take advantage of quantum speedup in solving Linear Optimization (LO) problems. Due to their inexact nature, QLSAs can be applied only to inexact variants of IPMs. Existing IPMs with inexact Newton directions are infeasible methods due to the inexact nature of their computations. This paper proposes an Inexact-Feasible IPM (IF-IPM) for LO problems, using a novel linear system to generate inexact but feasible steps. We show that this method has iteration complexity, analogous to the best exact IPMs, where is the number of variables and is the binary length of the input data. Moreover, we examine how QLSAs can efficiently solve the proposed system in an iterative refinement (IR) scheme to find the exact solution without excessive calls to QLSAs. We show that the proposed IR-IF-IPM can also be helpful to mitigate the impact of the condition number when a classical iterative method, such as a Conjugate Gradient method or a quantum solver is used at iterations of IPMs. After applying the proposed IF-IPM to the self-dual embedding formulation, we implement it and present illustrative numerical results.},
