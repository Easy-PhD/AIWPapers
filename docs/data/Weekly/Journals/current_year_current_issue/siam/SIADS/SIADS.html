  abstract     = {Abstract. In this article, we study a prototypical system of reaction-diffusion equations in which the diffusivities are widely separated. We report on the discovery of families of spatially periodic canard solutions that emerge from singular Turing bifurcations. We show that the small-amplitude, spatially periodic solutions that emerge from the Turing bifurcations form families of spatially periodic canards that oscillate about the homogeneous equilibrium. The emergence of these spatially periodic canards asymptotically close to the Turing bifurcations, which are reversible 1:1 resonant Hopf bifurcations in the spatial ODE system, is an analog in spatial dynamics of the emergence of limit cycle canards in the canard explosions that occur asymptotically close to Hopf bifurcations in time-dependent ODEs. We also find families of large-amplitude, spatially periodic canards. These have a “fast-slow” spatial structure, with segments of steep gradients and segments of gradual variation. In this prototypical PDE, we also show that for most parameter values under study the Turing bifurcation is sub-critical, and we present the results of numerical simulations showing that several types of spatial canard patterns are attractors in the PDE. To support the main numerical discoveries, we use the method of geometric desingularization and geometric singular perturbation theory on the spatial ODE system to demonstrate the existence of these families of spatially periodic canards. Crucially, in the singular limit, we study a novel class of reversible folded singularities of the spatial ODE system. In particular, there are two reversible folded saddle-node bifurcations of type II (RFSN-II), each occurring asymptotically close to a Turing bifurcation. We derive analytical formulas for these singularities and show that their canards play key roles in the observed families of small-amplitude and large-amplitude spatially periodic canard solutions. Then, for an interval of values of the bifurcation parameter further below the Turing bifurcation and RFSN-II point, the spatial ODE system also has spatially periodic canard patterns; however, these are created by a reversible folded saddle (instead of the RFSN-II). It also turns out that there is an interesting scale invariance, so that some components of some spatial canards exhibit nearly self-similar dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the numerical study of dynamical systems, there are applications where equations or good initial guesses are not available, and a data-driven approach based on a set of observations of the system is useful. These observations take the form of a cloud of points in phase space. The observations lie on a smooth manifold in several important situations like stable invariant manifolds, some attractors, and parts of bifurcation surfaces. This paper describes an algorithm, based on multiparameter continuation methods, for finding a smooth manifold from a cloud of points that samples the manifold. The algorithm represents the manifold as an atlas of charts, with the distance between chart centers controlled by a local length scale. It is iterative, selecting a point from the boundary of the atlas at each step to add a new chart. Three variations are described, which use different definitions of the boundary of a set of points: nearest neighbor continuation, which is used by most manifold learning algorithms; shell continuation; and polyhedral continuation. Part of the result is chart adjacency information, which can be used to construct a mesh on the manifold with the chart centers as mesh. The results are also in a form that allows traditional manifold learning techniques for constructing low dimensional embeddings to be applied. There are many parallels between continuation and machine learning. This viewpoint provides a context for thinking about manifold learning.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In response to climate change caused largely by the industrial development of humans, a lot of species may have to change their residential habitats and living habits to survive. Meanwhile, it has been well known that networks (like roads, rivers, and seismic lines, etc.) have deep impacts on the spread of pandemics, invasive species, plant pathogens, and so on. Motivated by the recent work of Berestycki and his research group, in this paper, we study the joint influence of a road-field diffusive system coupled with climate changes on the dynamical behaviors of two competitive populations in the case of one of which is assumed to be home territory. Viewed as one of the most important phenomena in propagation dynamics, forced traveling wave solution (TWS) is first investigated and we find that its existence is relevant to the values of the shift speed with which the climate changes. When and only when ( is a threshold shifting speed and its value is related to the ratio of the two diffusion coefficients—on the road and in the field), one can establish the forced TWS for the system. Moreover, we show that the forced TWS is locally stable by using a squeezing result. Finally, to draw a complete figure of the propagation dynamics, we investigate the global spreading behaviors in the case . In such a case, the spatial domain for the extinction of both populations are established, and can be interpreted as gap formation for the two biological species.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. There is a well-established understanding of maximizing and minimizing local stretching associated with a map; this can be couched in terms of an eigenproblem associated with the Cauchy–Green tensor. The local eigenvalues correspond to stretching rates, while the eigenvector directions identify maximal and minimal stretching directions. Generating hyperstreamlines of these eigenvector fields has been popular; however various claims that these collections of curves correspond to global optimizers of stretching remain unsubstantiated. In this paper, a formulation in terms of restricted foliations is presented, for which these curves form a well-defined solution as the most and least unstable objects, with respect to a global definition. The theory works for any map in -dimensions, derived, for example, from repeated applications of a discrete dynamical system, or from a finite-time flow of a continuous one. Further insight is obtained into the two-dimensional situation via an elementary approach, including a simple singularity classification criterion and an understanding of numerical artifacts in foliation computations (e.g., special curves along which hyperstreamlines veer and/or do not cross). Illustrations and validations of the results to the Hénon map, the double-gyre flow, and the standard (Chirikov) map are provided.},
