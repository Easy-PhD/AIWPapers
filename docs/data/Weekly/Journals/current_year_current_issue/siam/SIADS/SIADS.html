  abstract     = {Abstract. There is a well-established understanding of maximizing and minimizing local stretching associated with a map; this can be couched in terms of an eigenproblem associated with the Cauchy–Green tensor. The local eigenvalues correspond to stretching rates, while the eigenvector directions identify maximal and minimal stretching directions. Generating hyperstreamlines of these eigenvector fields has been popular; however various claims that these collections of curves correspond to global optimizers of stretching remain unsubstantiated. In this paper, a formulation in terms of restricted foliations is presented, for which these curves form a well-defined solution as the most and least unstable objects, with respect to a global definition. The theory works for any map in -dimensions, derived, for example, from repeated applications of a discrete dynamical system, or from a finite-time flow of a continuous one. Further insight is obtained into the two-dimensional situation via an elementary approach, including a simple singularity classification criterion and an understanding of numerical artifacts in foliation computations (e.g., special curves along which hyperstreamlines veer and/or do not cross). Illustrations and validations of the results to the Hénon map, the double-gyre flow, and the standard (Chirikov) map are provided.},
