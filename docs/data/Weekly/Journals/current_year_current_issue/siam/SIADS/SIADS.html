  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce and analyze a quasilinear size-structured population model with nonlinearities accounting for nonlocal interactions between individuals. The recruitment (immigration), growth, and death rates are inhomogeneous in time and/or space and depend on weighted averages of the density. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of globally bounded weak solutions using the characteristic curves and Banach fixed point theorem after transforming the partial differential equation (PDE) into an equivalent system of integral equations. We then investigate the long-time behavior of the PDE in the case when the growth rate is separable. Applying a classical time-scaling transformation, the problem boils down to a PDE with linear growth rate and nonlinear inflow boundary condition, entering the theoretical framework of abstract semilinear Cauchy problems. We can then perform a bifurcation analysis which reveals the richness of the model behavior. Depending on the ratio of the recruitment to the growth rate, the model can exhibit multistability and stable oscillatory solutions emanating, respectively, through saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations. We illustrate these theoretical results on the biological application motivating this work, oogenesis, the process of production and maturation of female gametes (oocytes) that is critical to reproductive fitness.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Uncertainty propagation is a critical component in various applications such as stochastic optimal control, optimal transport, probabilistic inference, and filtering. This paper frames uncertainty propagation of a dynamical system whose domain is the torus through the lens of advecting a probability density through a vector field via the continuum equation. This equation exhibits two conservation laws of interest: positivity and mass conservation. This article constructs a novel sparse spectral discretization technique that conserves these invariants while simultaneously qualitatively improving spectral convergence rates. Specifically, densities are transformed into their corresponding half-densities and it is shown that the advection of these half-densities corresponds to a unitary evolution. A hyperbolic cross approximation is implemented to provide sub-exponential complexity with respect to system dimension. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated in several numerical experiments and outperforms a standard spectral scheme. The convergence rate and error bounds of the proposed approach are likewise derived.},

The main objects of our investigation are matrices associated to bicolored graphs known as -diagrams, which correspond possibilities for infinitude of central configurations. Our previous work determines 86 possible -diagrams for the planar six-body problem, and for each -diagram we determine possible orders of positions, separations, and distance variables. The aim of the present paper is to show that many of them are impossible, except for some special masses. We generate these mass relations through elimination theory and symbolic computations. For the planar six-body problem, we show that there are at most 85 -diagrams; 61 of them are impossible, except for masses in some co-dimension 1 variety in the mass space. We will also discuss the difficulties of remaining cases.},

We study bifurcations of the completely synchronized state in a continuum limit (CL) for the Kuramoto model (KM) of identical oscillators with two-mode interaction depending on two graphs. Here one of the graphs is uniform but may be deterministic dense, random dense, or random sparse, and the other is a deterministic finite nearest neighbor. We use the center manifold reduction technique, which is a standard one in dynamical systems, and prove that the CL suffers bifurcations at which the one-parameter family of completely synchronized state becomes unstable and a stable two-parameter family of -humped sinusoidal shape stationary solutions appears. This contrasts the author’s recent result on the classical KM for which bifurcation behavior in its CL is very different from ones in the KM and difficult to explain by standard techniques in dynamical systems such as the center manifold reduction. Moreover, similar bifurcation behavior is shown to occur in the KM, based on the previous fundamental results. The occurrence of such bifurcations were suggested by numerical simulations for the deterministic graphs in a previous study. We also demonstrate our theoretical results by numerical simulations for the KM with the zero natural frequency.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Any autonomous nonlinear dynamical system can be viewed as a superposition of infinitely many linear processes, through the so-called Koopman mode decomposition. Its data-driven approximation, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), has been extensively developed and deployed across a plethora of fields. In this work, we study the effect of subtracting the temporal mean on the DMD approximation for observables possessing only a finite number of Koopman modes. Preprocessing time-sequential training data by removing the temporal mean has been a point of contention in the companion matrix formulation of DMD. This stems from the potential of said preprocessing to render DMD equivalent to a temporal discrete Fourier transform (DFT). We prove that this equivalence is impossible when the training data is linearly consistent and the order of the DMD model exceeds the number of Koopman modes. Since model order and training set size are synonymous in this variant of DMD, the parity of DMD and DFT can, therefore, be indicative of inadequate training data.},

Despite that, in a time-invariant framework, sensitivity analysis has been successfully employed to assess the overall effects stemming from sustained changes in species growth rates on the equilibrium values of other, indirectly related species, and its generalization to the time-varying case has remained elusive. Our accomplishments were based on two classical topics of ODEs: (i) the smoothness of solutions with respect to parameters and (ii) the properties of exponential dichotomy and admissibility, which were combined with recent advances in the theory of nonautonomous dynamical systems inspired by the new concept of nonautonomous equilibrium and its local properties. Specifically, we derive the sensitivity matrix as the solution of a nonhomogeneous linear matrix differential equation, which can be explicitly computed by using results from exponential dichotomy and admissibility. In addition, time averaging provides alternative characterizations for the sensitivity matrix in terms of the community one.},

We introduce conditions on the dynamics and the observations under which the estimation error remains small in the long time horizon. Our theory covers a wide class of partially observed chaotic dynamical systems, which includes the Navier–Stokes equations and Lorenz models.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The border-collision normal form is a piecewise-linear family of continuous maps that describe the dynamics near border-collision bifurcations. Most prior studies assume each piece of the normal form is invertible, as is generic from an abstract viewpoint, but in applied problems one piece of the map often has degenerate range, corresponding to a zero determinant. This provides simplification, yet even in two dimensions the dynamics can be incredibly rich. The purpose of this paper is to determine broadly how the dynamics of the two-dimensional border-collision normal form with a zero determinant differs for different values of its parameters. We identify parameter regions of period-adding, period-incrementing, mode-locking, and component doubling of chaotic attractors, and characterize the dominant bifurcation boundaries. The intention is for the results to enable border-collision bifurcations in mathematical models to be analyzed more easily and effectively, and we illustrate this with a flu epidemic model and two stick-slip friction oscillator models. We also discuss the robustness of the dynamics and describe three novel bifurcation structures that remain to be explored.},

The body of the crawler consists of a chain of point masses, joined by active elastic links and subject to smooth friction forces, so that the dynamics is described by a system of second-order differential equations. Our main result is of Massera type, namely we show that the existence of a bounded solution implies the existence of the global periodic attractor for the reduced dynamics. In establishing this result, a contractive property of the dynamics of our model plays a central role. We then prove sufficient conditions on the friction forces for the existence of a bounded solution, and therefore of the attractor. We also provide an example showing that if we consider more general friction forces, such as smooth approximations of dry friction, bounded solutions may not exist.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study a multicluster flocking for the Motsch–Tadmor (MT) model. The MT model can be regarded as the normalized counterpart of the Cucker–Smale (CS) flocking model by replacing communication weight by its normalization one. This normalization makes the communication weight nonsymmetric so that the corresponding kinetic energy is not monotonically decreasing any more. Thus, the MT model loses all nice properties of the CS model. Despite the lack of symmetry in a communication weight, we present a sufficient framework leading to multicluster flocking asymptotically. Our proposed framework is formulated in terms of initial data and system parameters. Under the proposed framework, we derive an augmented system of differential inequalities for cluster diameters and separation speed of clusters, and then we use this system of differential inequalities and continuous induction argument to derive a multicluster flocking.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular algorithm for minimizing objective functions that arise in machine learning. For constant step-sized SGD, the iterates form a Markov chain on a general state space. Focusing on a class of separable (nonconvex) objective functions, we establish a “Doeblin-type decomposition,” in that the state space decomposes into a uniformly transient set and a disjoint union of absorbing sets. Each of the absorbing sets contains a unique invariant measure, with the set of all invariant measures being the convex hull. Moreover, the set of invariant measures are shown to be global attractors to the Markov chain with a geometric convergence rate. The theory is highlighted with examples that show (1) the failure of the diffusion approximation to characterize the long-time dynamics of SGD; (2) the global minimum of an objective function may lie outside the support of the invariant measures (i.e., even if initialized at the global minimum, SGD iterates will leave); and (3) bifurcations may enable the SGD iterates to transition between two local minima. Key ingredients in the theory involve viewing the SGD dynamics as a monotone iterated function system and establishing a “splitting condition” of Dubins and Freedman [Ann. Math. Statist., 37 (1966), pp. 837–848] and Bhattacharya and Lee [Ann. Probab., 16 (1988), pp. 1333–1347].},
