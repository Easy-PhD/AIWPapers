  abstract     = {We initiate the study of state complexity for continuous-variable quantum systems. Concretely, we consider a setup with bosonic modes and auxiliary qubits, where available operations include Gaussian one- and two-mode operations and single- and two-qubit operations as well as qubit-controlled phase-space displacements. We define the (approximate) complexity of a bosonic state by the minimum size of a circuit that prepares an approximation to the state in trace distance. We propose a new circuit which prepares an approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state | G K P κ , Δ ⟩ . Here, κ − 2 is the variance of the envelope, and Δ 2 is the variance of the individual peaks. We show that the circuit accepts with constant probability and—conditioned on acceptance—the output state is polynomially close in ( κ , Δ ) to the state | G K P κ , Δ ⟩ . The size of our circuit is linear in ( log 1 / κ , log 1 / Δ ) . To our knowledge, this is the first protocol for GKP-state preparation with fidelity guarantees for the prepared state. We also show converse bounds, establishing that the linear circuit-size dependence of our construction is optimal. This fully characterizes the complexity of GKP states.},

  abstract     = {The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and determines the ultimate limits of precision. With artificial neural networks gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher information through an artificial neural network performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information and that training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training—eliminating the need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.},

In this work, we investigate the anticoncentration of random Clifford circuits toward the overlap distribution of random stabilizer states. Using exact analytical techniques and extensive numerical simulations based on Clifford replica tensor networks, we demonstrate that random Clifford circuits fully anticoncentrate in logarithmic circuit depth; namely, higher-order moments of the overlap distribution converge to those of random stabilizer states. Moreover, we investigate the effect of introducing a controlled number of non-Clifford (magic) resources into Clifford circuits. We show that inserting a polylogarithmic in qudit number of T states is sufficient to drive the overlap distribution toward the Porter-Thomas statistics, effectively recovering full quantum randomness. In short, this fact presents doped tensor networks and shallow Clifford circuits as pseudomagic quantum states. Our results clarify the interplay between Clifford dynamics, magic-state injection, and quantum complexity, with implications for quantum circuit sampling, many-body quantum physics, and the benchmarking of quantum computational advantage.},

While the molecular underpinnings may be complex, the resulting phenomenon, in which a cell decides between one fate or another, is relatively simple. A body of work—rooted in dynamical systems theory—has formalized this notion of cellular decision making as flow in a Waddington-like landscape, in which cells evolve according to gradientlike dynamics within a potential that changes shape in response to a number of signals. We present a framework leveraging neural networks as universal function approximators to infer such a parametrized landscape from gene expression data. Inspired by the success of physics-informed machine learning in data-limited contexts, we enforce principled constraints motivated not by physical laws but by this phenomenological understanding of differentiation. Our data-driven approach infers a governing landscape atop a manifold situated within expression space, thereby describing the dynamics of interest in a biologically meaningful context. The resulting system provides an intuitive, visualizable, and interpretable model of cellular differentiation dynamics.},

Unlike in the lowest Landau level, where charge motion is confined into cyclotron orbits, the charged excitations in the FQAH occupy Bloch states with well-defined crystal momenta. At a nonzero doping density, this feature enables the formation of itinerant states of the doped anyons just beyond the FQAH plateau region. Focusing on the vicinity of , we describe a few possible itinerant states, including a topological superconductor with chiral neutral fermion edge modes as well as a more exotic pair density wave (PDW) superconductor with non-Abelian topological order. A Fermi liquid metal with a doping-induced period-3 charge density wave also occurs naturally in our analysis. This Fermi liquid (as well as the PDW) arises from pairing instabilities of a composite Fermi liquid metal that can emerge near filling . Though inspired by the theory of anyon superconductivity, we explain how our construction is qualitatively different. At a general Jain filling , the same analytical framework leads to a wider variety of phases, including higher-charge superconductors and generalized composite Fermi liquids. We predict unusual physical signatures associated with each phase and analyze the crossover between different temperature regimes. These results provide a proof-of-principle that exotic itinerant phases can be stabilized by correlations intrinsic to the FQAH setup.},

Many biological processes also depend on time estimation by nanoscale clocks, whose performance can be significantly impacted by random fluctuations. In this work, we formulate the problem of optimal time estimation for Markovian stochastic processes, and present its general solution in the asymptotic (longtime) limit. Specifically, we obtain a tight upper bound on the precision of any time estimate constructed from sustained observations of a classical, Markovian jump process. This bound is controlled by the mean residual time, i.e., the expected wait before the first jump is observed. As a consequence, we obtain a universal bound on the signal-to-noise ratio of arbitrary currents and counting observables in the steady state. This bound is similar in spirit to the kinetic uncertainty relation but provably tighter, and we explicitly construct the counting observables that saturate it. Our results establish ultimate precision limits for an important class of observables in nonequilibrium systems and demonstrate that the mean residual time, not the dynamical activity, is the measure of freneticity that tightly constrains fluctuations far from equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {The Středa formula establishes a fundamental physical connection between the topological invariants characterizing the bulk of topological matter and the presence of gapless edge modes. In this work, we extend the Středa formula to periodically driven systems, providing a rigorous framework to elucidate the unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet systems while offering a physically grounded link between Floquet winding numbers and tractable response functions. Using the Sambe representation of periodically driven systems, we analyze the response of the unbounded Floquet density of states to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-Středa response is regularized through Cesàro summation, yielding a well-defined, quantized result within spectral gaps. The response features two physically distinct contributions: a quantized charge flow between edge and bulk and an anomalous energy flow between the system and the drive, offering new insight into the nature of anomalous edge states. This fundamental result rigorously connects Floquet winding numbers to the orbital magnetization density of Floquet states and holds broadly, from clean to disordered and inhomogeneous systems. This is further supported by providing a real-space formulation of the Floquet-Středa response, which introduces a local topological marker suited for periodically driven settings. In translationally invariant systems, the framework yields a remarkably simple expression for Floquet winding numbers involving geometric properties of Floquet-Bloch bands. A concrete experimental protocol is proposed to extract the Floquet-Středa response via particle-density measurements in systems coupled to engineered baths. Finally, by expressing the topological invariants through the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, this approach opens a promising route toward the topological characterization of interacting driven phases.},

In these systems, topological phases emerge when ABSs depend on at least three superconducting phase differences, resulting in a three-dimensional (3D) energy spectrum characterized by Weyl nodes at zero energy. Here, we realize a four-terminal JJ in a hybrid heterostructure, where ABSs form a synthetic 3D band structure. We probe the energy spectrum using tunneling spectroscopy and identify spectral features associated with the formation of a tri-Andreev molecule, a bound state whose energy depends on three superconducting phases and, therefore, is able to host topological ABSs. The experimental observations are well described by a numerical model. The calculations predict the appearance of four Weyl nodes at zero energy within a gap smaller than the experimental resolution. These topological states are theoretically predicted to remain stable within an extended region of the parameter space, well accessible by our device. These findings establish an experimental foundation to study high-dimensional synthetic band structures in multiterminal JJs and to realize topological Andreev bands.},

Highly precise predictions can be made using standard techniques, both in the continuum and in the lattice frameworks. However, classical methods have limitations, particularly when attempting to extrapolate the continuum limit from the study of lattice gauge theories. Complementing classical computations or combining them with quantum computational methods, to improve the predictions toward the continuum limit with current quantum resources, is a formidable open challenge. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient method to compute the running of the coupling in non-Abelian gauge theories beyond one spatial dimension. We first represent the Hamiltonian on periodic lattices in terms of loop variables and conjugate loop electric fields, exploiting the Gauss law to retain the gauge-independent ones. Then, we identify a local basis for small and large loops variationally to minimize the truncation error while computing the running of the coupling on small tori. Our method enables computations at arbitrary values of the bare coupling and lattice spacing with current quantum computers, simulators, and tensor-network calculations, in regimes otherwise inaccessible.},

  abstract     = {“Strange” metals that do not follow the predictions of Fermi liquid theory are prevalent in materials that feature superconductivity arising from electron interactions. In recent years, it has been hypothesized that spatial randomness in electron interactions must play a crucial role in strange metals for their hallmark linear-in-temperature ( ) resistivity to survive down to low temperatures where phonon and umklapp processes are ineffective, as is observed in experiments. However, a clear picture of how this happens has not yet been provided in a realistic model free from artificial constructions, such as large- limits and replica tricks. We study a realistic model of two-dimensional metals with spatially random antiferromagnetic interactions in a nonperturbative regime, using numerically exact high-performance, large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo simulation and exact averages over the quenched spatial randomness. Our simulations reproduce strange metals’ key experimental signature of linear-in- resistivity with a universal “Planckian” transport scattering rate that is independent of coupling constants. We further find that strange metallicity in these systems is not associated with a quantum critical point and, instead, arises from a phase of matter with gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations that lacks long-range correlations and spans an extended region of parameter space: A feature that is also observed in several experiments. These gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations take the form of spatially localized overdamped modes, whose presence could possibly be detected using recently developed nanoscale magnetometry methods. Our work paves the way for an eventual microscopic understanding of the role of spatial disorder in determining important properties of correlated-electron materials.},

  abstract     = {Recent progress in tabletop experiments offers the opportunity to show, for the first time, that gravity is not compatible with a classical description. In all current experimental proposals, such as the generation of gravitationally induced entanglement between two quantum sources of gravity, gravitational effects can be explained solely with the Newton potential, namely, in a regime that is consistent with the weak-field limit of general relativity and does not probe the field nature of gravity. Hence, the Newtonian origin of the effects is a limitation to the conclusions on the nature of gravity that can be drawn from these experiments. Here, we identify two effects that overcome this limitation: They cannot be reproduced using the Newton potential, and they are independent of graviton emission. First, we show that the interaction between two generic quantum sources of gravity, e.g., in wide Gaussian states, cannot be reproduced with the Newton potential nor with a known classical theory of gravity. Second, we show that the quantum commutator between the gravitational field and its canonically conjugate momentum appears as an additional term in the relative phase of a generic quantum source interacting with a test particle. Observing these two effects would give further quantitative information and stronger evidence, compared to experiments only involving the Newton potential, to show that gravity is nonclassical. More broadly, identifying stronger quantum aspects of gravity than those reproducible with the Newton potential is crucial to prove the nonclassicality of gravity and to plan a new generation of experiments testing quantum aspects of gravity in a broader sense than what has been proposed so far.},

Such modulated angular spectra arise as a result of the direct interaction between the ultrarelativistic electron beam and the laser driver in the presence of the wakefield. A constrained theoretical model for the coupled oscillator, assisted by a genetic algorithm, can recreate the experimental electron spectra and, thus, fully reconstructs the longitudinal phase-space distribution of the electron beam with a temporal resolution of approximately 1.3 fs. In particular, it reveals the slice energy spread of the electron beam, which is important to measure for applications such as x-ray free electron lasers. In our experiment, the root-mean-square slice energy spread retrieved is bounded at 9.9 MeV, corresponding to a 0.9%–3.0% relative spread, despite the overall GeV energy beam having approximately 100% relative energy spread.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical properties of biological materials are spatially heterogeneous. Typical tissues are made up of a spanning fibrous extracellular matrix in which various inclusions, such as living cells, are embedded. While the influence of embedded inclusions on the stiffness of common elastic materials such as rubber has been studied for decades and can be understood in terms of the volume fraction and shape of inclusions, the same is not true for disordered filamentous and fibrous networks. Recent work has shown that, in isolation, such networks exhibit unusual viscoelastic behavior indicative of an underlying mechanical phase transition controlled by network connectivity and strain. How this behavior is modified when inclusions are present is unclear. Here, we present a theoretical and computational study of the influence of rigid inclusions on the mechanics of disordered elastic networks near the connectivity-controlled central-force rigidity transition. Combining scaling theory and coarse-grained simulations, we predict and confirm an anomalously strong dependence of the composite stiffness on inclusion volume fraction, beyond that seen in ordinary composites. This stiffening exceeds the well-established volume-fraction-dependent stiffening expected in conventional composites, e.g., as an elastic analog of the classic volume-fraction-dependent increase in the viscosity of liquids first identified by Einstein. We show that this enhancement is a consequence of the interplay between interparticle spacing and an emergent correlation length, leading to an effective finite-size scaling imposed by the presence of inclusions. We outline the expected scaling of the linear shear modulus and strain fluctuations with the inclusion volume fraction and network connectivity, confirm these predictions in simulations, and discuss potential experimental tests and implications for our predictions in real systems.},
