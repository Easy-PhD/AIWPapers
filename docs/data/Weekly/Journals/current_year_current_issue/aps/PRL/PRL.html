From impact to escape, the net applied forces depend on the curvature of the wall and increase in the presence of concave features. Here we systematically investigate the forces exerted by swimming bacteria on microfabricated structures, where the radii of curvature can be varied parametrically. We find that these microsails are propelled with a speed that scales linearly with curvature and is directed from concave to convex side along the axis of symmetry. By solving the collision problem for microswimmers subject to aligning torques at the wall, we show that, despite bacteria rapidly aligning with the surface plane, the resulting force law reduces to that of spherical active particles, with the wall-induced reorientation rate effectively replacing rotational diffusion.},

We simulate a single, freely jointed passive chain in two-dimensional active turbulence. Active flows advect the polymer, producing a substantially enhanced diffusivity. Our results reveal that the dimensionless diffusivity obeys scaling laws governed by the Péclet, Weissenberg, and Ericksen numbers, which paves the way for designing active/polymeric hybrid materials with predictable properties that differ significantly from those of nondeformable inclusions.},

This commonly accepted view is rooted in the studies of monovalent cation transport. Divalent cations, however, have significantly higher desolvation costs, requiring considerably larger pores to enable retention of the first hydration shell and subsequently transport. We show that this scenario gives rise to a strong enthalpy-entropy competition. Specifically, the first hydration shell is shown to undergo rotational ordering inside the pore, resulting in a tight transition state. Our results shed light on the basic mechanisms of transport barrier formation for aqueous divalent cations permeating nanoporous 2D membranes.},

  abstract     = {Characterizing the statistical properties of classical interacting particle systems is a long-standing question. For Brownian particles, the microscopic density obeys a stochastic evolution equation, known as the Dean-Kawasaki equation. This equation remains mostly formal and linearization (or higher-order expansions) is required to obtain explicit expressions for physical observables, with a range of validity not easily defined. Here, by combining macroscopic fluctuation theory with equilibrium statistical mechanics, we provide a systematic alternative to the Dean-Kawasaki framework to characterize large-scale correlations. This approach enables us to obtain explicit and exact results for the large-scale behavior of dynamical observables such as tracer cumulants and bath-tracer correlations in one dimension, both in and out of equilibrium. In particular, we reveal a generic nonmonotonic spatial structure in the response of the bath following a temperature quench. Our approach applies to a broad class of interaction potentials and extends naturally to higher dimensions.},

We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean-squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation D ∝ exp ( α c 1 + c 2 ) for which we provide the exact expression. We compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.

  abstract     = {We present a theory for the relaxation time of the octupole order parameter in nanoscale chiral antiferromagnets (AFMs) coupled to thermal baths and spin injection sources. Using stochastic spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the octupole moment relaxes through two distinct mechanisms—escape over a barrier and precessional dephasing—as the barrier for octupole fluctuations is lowered relative to the thermal energy. Notably, the octupole moment relaxes orders of magnitude faster than the typical dipolar order parameters, reaching picosecond timescales. By combining Langer’s theory with an effective low-energy description of octupole dynamics in chiral AFMs, we derive analytical expressions for the relaxation times. We find that relaxation in chiral AFMs parallels dipole relaxation in magnets, with exchange fields serving the role of the dipole fields. Further, by drawing on the analogy between order parameter dynamics in magnets under spin injection and current-biased Josephson junctions, we propose a new scheme for electrically tuning the octupole relaxation times. Our Letter offers fundamental insights for the development of next-generation spintronic devices that harness octupole order parameters for information encoding.},

Its sign and strength often determine crucial properties of magnetic objects, like their topology or how they can be manipulated with currents. A few experimental techniques are currently available to measure DMI quantitatively, based on the study of domain walls, spin waves, or spin-orbit torques. In this Letter, we propose a qualitative variant of spin wave methods. We rely on magnetic noise from confined thermal spin waves in domain walls and skyrmions in perpendicularly magnetized thin films, which we probe with scanning nitrogen-vacancy center relaxometry. We show both numerically and experimentally that the sign of the DMI can be inferred from the amplitude of the detected noise, which is affected by the nonreciprocity in the spin wave dispersion. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the noise distribution around the contour of magnetic skyrmions reveals their Néel or Bloch nature, giving therefore also insight into the strength of DMI involved in their stabilization.},

In this work, we investigate the transport properties of CrSBr, a van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor, over a wide range of carrier densities modulated by gate voltage. We observe a drastic contrast in magnetoresistance behavior between the low- and high-carrier density regimes. Through a combination of experiment and modeling, we identify magnetically driven carrier concentration modulation and mobility modulation as the dominant mechanisms governing magnetoresistance in the respective regimes. These findings advance the understanding of magnetoelectric transport in antiferromagnets and suggest promising routes for energy-efficient spintronic technologies in memory, logic, and sensing applications.},

The advent of higher-order topology has generalized this principle to a hierarchical chain, enabling topological states to appear at ( D − 2 ) or even lower-dimensional boundaries. To date, all known realizations of topological systems must require a topologically nontrivial bulk to initiate the chain of action for bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, in an acoustic crystal platform, we experimentally demonstrate an exception to this paradigm—embedded topology in a trivial bulk—where the bulk-boundary correspondence originates from a trivial bulk. Rather than relying on global symmetries, we employ projective crystal symmetry, which induces nontrivial topology not at the outset in the D -dimensional bulk, but midway through the correspondence hierarchy in lower-dimensional boundaries. We further realize a three-dimensional system exhibiting embedded topology that supports zero-dimensional topological states, achieving the longest possible chain of action for such an unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence in physical space. Our Letter experimentally establishes a new form of bulk-boundary correspondence initiated from a trivial bulk, opening additional degrees of freedom for the design of robust topological devices.},

Moreover, we provide exact K -theoretical classifications of topological insulators over these platycosms by the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, and formulate a complete set of topological invariants for their identification. Topological phase transitions are generically characterized by Weyl semimetals, adhering to the generalized Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem: the total chirality number over a Brillouin platycosm is even (zero) if the platycosm is nonorientable (orientable).

  abstract     = {Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this Letter, we introduce Gutzwiller projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS) to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the t − J model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states on lattices as large as 10 × 10 sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with an inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.},

  abstract     = {Recently, exotic superconductivity emerging from a spin-and-valley-polarized metallic phase has been discovered in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. To explain this observation, we study the role of electron-electron interactions in driving flavor symmetry breaking, using the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation, and in stabilizing superconductivity mediated by repulsive interactions. Though mean-field HF correctly predicts the isospin flavors and reproduces the experimental phase diagram, it overestimates the band renormalization near the Fermi energy and suppresses superconducting instabilities. To address this, we introduce a physically motivated scheme that includes internal screening in the HF calculation. Using this formalism, we find superconductivity arising from the spin-valley polarized phase, on the electron-doped side, for a range of electric fields and electron dopings. Our findings reproduce the experimental observations and reveal a p -wave, finite-momentum, time-reversal-symmetry-broken superconducting state, encouraging further investigation into exotic phases in graphene multilayers.},

  abstract     = {Using the time-dependent Lanczos method, we study the nonequilibrium dynamics of the half-filled one-dimensional ionic Hubbard model, deep within the Mott insulating regime, under the influence of a transient laser pulse. In equilibrium, increasing the staggered potential in the Mott regime reduces the Mott gap and broadens the Hubbard bands, creating favorable conditions for impact ionization. After laser excitation, impact ionization is observed, with its occurrence depending on both the staggered potential and the laser pump frequency. By analyzing the time evolution of the kinetic, ionic, and Coulomb interaction energies, we identify a novel mechanism for impact ionization, in which excess ionic potential energy is converted into additional double occupancy—distinct from the conventional mechanism where excess kinetic energy drives this process. We further reveal that impact ionization arises from interference between excited states driven by photon excitations of the same order. These results present a new pathway for realizing impact ionization in strongly correlated electron systems.},

  abstract     = {Halide perovskites are known for their rich phase diagram and superior performance in diverse optoelectronics applications. The latter property is often attributed to the long electron-hole recombination time, whose underlying physical mechanism has been a long-standing controversy. In this Letter, we investigate the transport and localization properties of electron and hole carriers in a prototypical halide perovskite ( CsPbBr 3 ), through ab initio tight-binding nonadiabatic dynamics approach for large-scale (tens of nm size) supercell calculations, to simulate electron and ion dynamics on the same footing. We found distinct structural, lattice polarization, and electron-phonon coupling properties at low (below 100 K) and high temperatures, consistent with experimental observations. In particular, at low temperature we find spontaneous formation of polar grain boundaries in the nonpolar bulk systems, which result in two-dimensional polarization patterns that serve to localize and separate electrons and holes. We reveal phonon-assisted variable-range hopping mostly responsible for low-temperature transport, and their characteristic frequency correlates with temperature-dependent phonon power spectrum and energy oscillation frequency in nonadiabatic dynamics. We answer the critical questions of long electron-hole recombination lifetime at low temperature and offer the correlation among polarization domains, electron-phonon couplings, and photocarrier dynamics.},

For single molecules in mechanically controlled break junctions or in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), vibronic excitations are typically described by a double-barrier tunneling junction model. In this model, a homogeneous electric field is considered and the atomic structure of the metal contacts is neglected. Here, we report experimental STM data of a new nonplanar organometallic complex, [ Mo ( CO ) 3 ( Pyridine 3 S 3 ) ], on Ag(111). Spatially resolved maps of the vibronic excitations show several features related to the reordering of the occupied molecular orbitals due to the rapidly decaying potential of the tip apex. Such rearrangement leads to a significant shift in the vibronic levels as the tip position is changed. These observations, together with our modelling results, demonstrate that the molecular orbitals can be controlled by the field of the STM tip, whose atomic-scale variation deserves more attention in studies of nonplanar molecules.},

Analysis of BQPI at the subgap YSR energy shows that only a selective subset of normal-state scattering processes contributes to Cooper pair formation, indicating interband mixing.

Such SSP beams have the potential to generate high-energy structured photon beams and open a new avenue for research on relativistic structured particle beams, especially in nuclear physics, high-energy physics, materials science, and atomic physics.},

Leveraging integrated photonics and laser self-injection locking, compact microcombs can be constructed via hybrid integration of a semiconductor laser with a chip-based microresonator. While the current linear self-injection locking theory has successfully addressed the linear coupling between the laser cavity and the external microresonator, it fails to describe the complicated nonlinear processes, especially for dark-pulse microcomb formation. Here, we investigate—theoretically, numerically, and experimentally—the Kerr-thermal dynamics of a semiconductor laser self-injection locked to an integrated silicon nitride microresonator. We unveil intriguing yet universal dark-pulse formation and switching behavior with discrete steps, and establish a theoretical model scrutinizing the synergy of laser-microresonator mutual coupling, Kerr nonlinearity, and photothermal effect. Numerical simulation confirms the experimental result and identifies the origins. Exploiting this unique phenomenon, we showcase an application on low-noise photonic microwave generation with phase noise purified by 23.5 dB.

  abstract     = {Chaos enables randomness-based applications, particularly in photonic systems. Integrated optical frequency combs (microcombs) have previously been observed in either chaotic modulation instability or stable, low-noise dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) regimes. In this Letter, we demonstrate a new microcomb state where a single DKS exhibits chaotic behavior. By phase modulating the Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) between a DKS and an externally injected reference laser, we observe chaotic group velocity hopping of the soliton, causing random transitions of the repetition rate. Using a chip-integrated octave-spanning microcomb, we experimentally validate the second-order Adler equation describing KIS, allowing us to predict and demonstrate this chaotic DKS hopping. This Letter connects nonlinear dynamics with optical soliton physics, providing a deterministic framework for triggering microcomb chaos in the solitonic state.},

  abstract     = {Over the last few decades, the predominant strategies for controlling spontaneous emission have involved tailoring the spatial surroundings of quantum emitters or atoms to create resonant or spatially periodic photonic structures. However, the rise of time-varying photonics has prompted a reevaluation of spontaneous emission in dynamically changing environments, especially within photonic time crystals, where optical properties undergo time-periodic modulation. Here, we apply classical light-matter interaction theory together with Floquet analysis to reveal a substantial enhancement of the spontaneous emission decay rate at the momentum gap frequency in photonic time crystals. Moreover, our findings suggest that photonic time crystals enable a nonequilibrium light-matter interaction process: the spontaneous excitation of an atom from its ground state to an excited state, accompanied by the concurrent emission of a photon, referred to as spontaneous emission excitation.},

  abstract     = {The superradiant phenomenon, usually described by the Dicke model, is a hallmark of strong light-matter interaction. We explore how matter-matter interactions influence this phenomenon by performing ground-state simulations of Dicke-like models with both isotropic and anisotropic interactions. We find that Ising-type interactions produce two qualitatively distinct phase boundaries, one of which gives rise to an antiferromagnetic-normal phase connected to the superradiant regime via a first-order phase transition. Under anisotropic couplings, we uncover a strongly correlated phase where in-plane spin order coexists with superradiance, exhibiting sublinear scaling of the photon occupation per site and power-law decay of spin correlations. Furthermore, superradiance is strengthened by tuning either isotropic or anisotropic interactions, highlighting the role of intrinsic many-body correlations in shaping light-matter quantum phases.},

  abstract     = {Here, we propose a platform based on ultracold fermionic molecules trapped in optical lattices to simulate nonadiabatic effects, as they appear in certain molecular dynamical problems. The idea consists of a judicious choice of two rotational states as the simulated electronic or nuclear degrees of freedom, in which their dipolar interactions induce the required attractive or repulsive interactions between them. We benchmark our proposal by studying the scattering of an electron or a proton against a hydrogen atom, showing the effect of electronic exchange and inelastic ionization as the mass ratio between the simulated nuclei and electrons—a tunable experimental parameter in our simulator—becomes comparable. These benchmarks illustrate how the simulator can qualitatively emulate phenomena like those appearing in molecular dynamical problems even if the simulated interaction occurs in two dimensions with a dipolar scaling. Beyond the molecular implementation proposed here, our proposal can be readily extrapolated to other atomic platforms, e.g., based on fermionic Rydberg atoms.},

We perform high-resolution trap-loss spectroscopy on ultracold Li 6 atoms to resolve this splitting with sub-milligauss precision. By comparing electron-spin-polarized ( | m S | = 1 ) and electron-spin-mixture ( m S = 0 ) configurations of the triplet state, we observe a clear spin-dependent reversal in the splitting structure, confirmed via momentum-resolved absorption imaging. This behavior directly reflects the interplay between electron spin projection m S and orbital angular momentum m ℓ in the molecular states. Our results provide a stringent benchmark for dipole-dipole interaction models and lay the groundwork for controlling the pairing in p -wave superfluid systems.},

  abstract     = {The question of whether there are enough superfluid neutrons in the inner crust of neutron stars to explain pulsar glitches remains a topic of debate. Previous band structure calculations suggest that the entrainment effect significantly reduces the superfluid density. In this Letter, a new derivation of the BCS expression for the superfluid density is given. We compute it in the superfluid band theory framework through linear response theory, for a small relative velocity between superfluid and normal components, under the assumption that the pairing gap in the rest frame of the superfluid is constant and not affected by the perturbation. Our result suggests that a formula extensively used in neutron star physics is incomplete. Numerical evaluations for two realistic configurations reveal that the previously neglected contribution drastically alters the picture of the superfluid reservoir in the inner crust of neutron stars, suggesting that about 90% of the neutrons are effectively superfluid.},

  abstract     = {The polarization of the Λ and Λ ¯ hyperons along the beam direction has been measured in proton-lead ( p -Pb ) collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 8.16 TeV. The data were obtained with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 186.0 ± 6.5 nb − 1 . A significant azimuthal dependence of the hyperon polarization, characterized by the second-order Fourier sine coefficient P z , s 2 , is observed. The P z , s 2 values decrease as a function of charged particle multiplicity, but increase with transverse momentum. A hydrodynamic model that describes the observed P z , s 2 values in nucleus-nucleus collisions by introducing vorticity effects does not reproduce either the sign or the magnitude of the p -Pb results. These observations pose a challenge to the current theoretical implementation of spin polarization in heavy ion collisions and offer new insights into the origin of spin polarization in hadronic collisions at LHC energies.},

  abstract     = {The leading-order perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions for nucleon electromagnetic form factors were first made in late 1970s. In this Letter, for the first time, we accomplish the calculation of the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to nucleon Dirac form factors at large momentum transfer to leading-twist accuracy in the collinear factorization approach, specifically within the Krankl and Manashov renormalization scheme. The effect of NLO perturbative corrections turns out to be positive and substantial. Taking the nucleon leading-twist light-cone distribution amplitudes determined from the recent lattice simulations as input, we find that the state-of-the-art pQCD predictions significantly underestimate the available nucleon Dirac form factors in both spacelike and timelike domains. This nuisance indicates that some additional soft nonfactorizable contribution might be called for to account for the measured nucleon electromagnetic form factor data up to Q 2 ≈ 30 GeV 2 .},

  abstract     = {Two decades ago the χ c 1 ( 3872 ) state was discovered in the hadron spectrum with two heavy quarks. The discovery fueled a surge in experimental research, uncovering dozens of so called X Y Z exotics states lying outside the conventional quark model, as well as theoretical investigations into new forms of matter, such as quark-gluon hybrids, tetraquarks, and pentaquarks, with the potential of disclosing new information about the fundamental strong force. Among the X Y Z s , the χ c 1 ( 3872 ) and T c c + ( 3875 ) states stand out for their striking characteristics and unleashed many discussions about their nature. Here, we address this question using the Born-Oppenheimer effective field theory (BOEFT) and show how QCD settles the issue of their composition. Not only do we describe well the main features of the χ c 1 ( 3872 ) and T c c + ( 3875 ) states, but we also obtain predictions in the bottomonium sector. This opens the way to systematic applications of BOEFT to all X Y Z s .},

By minimizing an information-theoretic quantity subject to constraints, our reweighted Monte Carlo incorporates systematic uncertainties absent in individual Monte Carlo predictions, achieving consistency with the theory input in precision and its estimated systematic uncertainties. Our method can be applied to arbitrary observables known from precision calculations, including multiple observables simultaneously. It generates strictly positive weights, thus offering a clear path to statistically powerful and theoretically precise computations for current and future collider experiments. As a proof of concept, we apply our technique to event-shape observables at electron-positron colliders, leveraging existing precision calculations of thrust. Our analysis highlights the importance of logarithmic moments of event shapes, which have not been previously studied in the collider physics literature.},

  abstract     = {Inelastic dark matter models that have two dark matter particles and a massive dark photon can reproduce the observed relic dark matter density without violating cosmological limits. The mass splitting between the two dark matter particles χ 1 and χ 2 , with m ( χ 2 ) > m ( χ 1 ) , is induced by a dark Higgs field and a corresponding dark Higgs boson h ′ . We present a search for dark matter in events with two vertices, at least one of which must be displaced from the interaction region, and missing energy. Using a 365 fb − 1 data sample collected at Belle II, which operates at the SuperKEKB e + e − collider, we observe no evidence for a signal. We set upper limits on the product of the production cross section σ ( e + e − → h ′ χ 1 χ 2 ) , and the product of branching fractions B ( χ 2 → χ 1 e + e − ) × B ( h ′ → x + x − ) , where x + x − indicates μ + μ − , π + π − , or K + K − , as functions of h ′ mass and lifetime at the level of 10 − 1 fb . We set model-dependent upper limits on the dark Higgs mixing angle at the level of 10 − 5 and on the dark photon kinetic mixing parameter at the level of 10 − 3 .

In this Letter, we propose the extension of hidden zeros to one-loop order in Tr ( ϕ 3 ) theory and the NLSM using the “surface integrand” technology introduced by Arkani-Hamed et al. We demonstrate that, under the assumption of locality, one-loop integrands in Tr ( ϕ 3 ) are unitary if and only if they satisfy these loop hidden zeros. We also present strong evidence that the hidden zeros themselves contain the constraints from locality, leading us to conjecture that the one-loop Tr ( ϕ 3 ) integrand can be fixed by hidden zeros from a generically nonlocal, nonunitary Ansatz . Near the one-loop zeros, we uncover a simple factorization behavior and conjecture that NLSM integrands are fixed by this property, also assuming neither locality nor unitarity. This Letter represents the first extension of such uniqueness results to loop integrands, demonstrating that locality and unitarity emerge from other principles even beyond leading order in perturbation theory.},

  abstract     = {In the last decade, the first law of binary black hole mechanics played an important unifying role in the gravitational two-body problem. More recently, binary black hole scattering and the application of high-energy physics methods have provided a new avenue into this classical problem. In this Letter, we connect these two themes by extending the first law to the case of scattering orbits. We present derivations based on classical S-matrix, Hamiltonian, and pseudo-Hamiltonian methods, the last of which allows us to include dissipative effects for the first time. Finally, a “boundary to bound” map links this first law to the traditional bound-orbit version. Through this map a little-known observable for scatter orbits, the elapsed proper time, is mapped to the Detweiler redshift for bound orbits, which is an invariant building block in gravitational waveform models.},

  abstract     = {The detection of cosmic antideuterons ( D ¯ ) at kinetic energies below a few GeV / n could provide a smoking gun signature for dark matter (DM). However, the theoretical uncertainties of coalescence models have represented so far one of the main limiting factors for precise predictions of the D ¯ flux. In this Letter, we present a novel calculation of the D ¯ source spectra, based on the Wigner formalism, for which we implement the Argonne v 18 antideuteron wave function that does not have any free parameters related to the coalescence process. We show that the Argonne-Wigner model excellently reproduces the D ¯ multiplicity measured by ALEPH at the Z -boson pole, which is usually adopted to tune the coalescence models based on different approaches. Our analysis is based on the p ythia 8 Monte Carlo event generator and the state-of-the-art shower algorithm. We succeed, with our model, to reduce the current theoretical uncertainty on the prediction of the D ¯ source spectra to a few percent, for D ¯ kinetic energies relevant to DM searches with the General Antiparticle Spectrometer and Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, and for DM masses above a few tens of GeV. This result implies that the theoretical uncertainties due to the coalescence process are no longer the main limiting factor in the predictions. We provide the tabulated source spectra for all the relevant DM annihilation and decay channels and DM masses between 5 and 100 TeV, on the CosmiXs GitHub repository.},

In this architecture, the nonlocal quantum gates are the building blocks; until now, it has remained challenging for practical applications to implement a nonlocal quantum gate with the memory modules under deterministic and room-temperature conditions, due to intrinsic probability and hardware complexity. Here, we propose and demonstrate a scheme to deterministically implement a nonlocal quantum gate between the room-temperature memory modules. The key technologies include cavity-enhanced atomic modules, two of which are connected by a single pair of distributed entangled optical modes and real-time mutual feedforward controls. The nonlocal quantum nondemolition gate between two room-temperature memory modules is deterministically demonstrated with different input coherent states, and the quantum nature is confirmed by outputting entangled atomic modules. Our results illustrate the functionality and feasibility of nonlocal quantum gate and may have potential applications in modular quantum information processing.},

In this Letter, we present an experimental demonstration, based on an improved theoretical framework showing that one-way local operations and classical communication (1-LOCC) can significantly outperform purely local measurements in detecting quantum entanglement. By casting the entanglement detection problem as a semidefinite program, we derive protocols that minimize false negatives at fixed false-positive rates. A variational generative machine-learning algorithm efficiently searches over high-dimensional parameter spaces, identifying states and measurement strategies that exhibit a clear 1-LOCC advantage. Experimentally, we realize a genuine event-ready protocol on a three-dimensional photonic entanglement source, employing fiber delays as short-lived quantum memories. We implement rapid, field-programmable gate array-based sampling of the optimized probabilistic instructions, allowing Bob’s measurement settings to adapt to Alice’s outcomes in real time. Our results validate the predicted 1-LOCC advantage in a realistic noisy setting and reduce the experimental trials needed to certify entanglement. These findings mark a step toward scalable, adaptive entanglement detection methods crucial for quantum networks and computing, paving the way for more efficient generation and verification of high-dimensional entangled states.},

Given a code, we explicitly define the corresponding resource state and derive an error-recovery operation based on all Bell measurement outcomes. Our approach offers deeper insights into the impact of resource state noise on repeater performance while also providing strategies for efficient preparation and fault-tolerant preservation of resource states. As an application, we propose a measurement-based repeater protocol based on quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, enabling constant-yield Bell state distribution over arbitrary distances. Numerical simulations identify a fault-tolerant threshold on the total physical error per repeater segment—including errors on resource states, remotely generated Bell states, and Bell measurements—and confirm that increasing the QLDPC code size further suppresses the logical error while maintaining a fixed encoding rate.

Using tools from quantum metrology and quantum control may overcome this limit, yet the full advantage afforded by entanglement so far remains elusive. Here we map the problem of frequency measurement to that of estimating a global dephasing quantum channel. In this way, we determine the ultimate quantum limits of frequency estimation in stochastic ac sensing. We find exact quantum Fisher information bounds for estimating frequency and frequency differences of stochastic fields. In particular, given two close signals with frequency separation ω r , we find that the quantum Fisher information for the separation estimation is approximately 2 / ω r 2 , i.e., inversely proportional to the separation parameter. The bounds are achievable in certain regimes by superpositions of Dicke states. GHZ states are suboptimal but improve precision over unentangled states, achieving Heisenberg scaling in the low-bandwidth limit.

Interestingly, this approach yields bounds tighter than the state of the art also for uncorrelated channels. We apply the bounds to study the limits for the most general adaptive phase estimation models in the presence of temporally correlated dephasing. We consider dephasing both parallel (no Heisenberg scaling) and perpendicular (Heisenberg scaling possible) to the signal. In the former case our new bounds show that negative correlations are beneficial; for the latter we show evidence that the bounds are tight.

In addition to its simple implementation, recent studies have revealed that its error and cost can be reduced if the initial state is closed in the low-energy subspace. However, the improvement by the low-energy property diminishes rapidly as the Trotter order grows in the previous studies, and thus, it is mysterious whether there exists a genuine advantage of low-energy initial states. In this Letter, we resolve this problem by proving the optimal error bound and cost of Trotterization for low-energy initial states. For generic local Hamiltonians composed of positive-semidefinite terms, we show that the Trotter error is at most linear in the initial state energy and polylogarithmic in the system size . As a result, the computational cost becomes substantially small for low-energy states with compared to the one for arbitrary initial states, where denotes the energy per site and means the whole-system energy. Our error bound and cost of Trotterization achieve the theoretically best scaling in the initial state energy . In addition, they can be partially extended to weakly correlated initial states having low-energy expectation values, which are not necessarily closed in the low-energy subspace. Our results will pave the way for fast and accurate simulations of low-energy states, which are one of the central targets in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.},

This is accomplished via a second drive tone near the leakage transition such that we cancel the leakage caused by the main drive. Furthermore, we describe a measurement sequence that can be used to calibrate the parameters of this leakage cancellation drive. Finally, we apply the technique to superconducting transmon qubits and achieve leakage suppression by up to a factor of 20 when compared to pulses shaped with the standard derivative removal by adiabatic gate technique. This results in a coherence-limited gate infidelity of 7.5 × 10 − 5 with leakage below 10 − 5 level, for a 10 ns π / 2 gate and 196 MHz qubit anharmonicity.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel tensor-network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in ( 2 + 1 ) D for both ground-state and real-time dynamics. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form of gauge-invariant tensor-network states, which already simplifies existing algorithms for ( 1 + 1 ) D LGTs. The second key is to employ the gauge canonical form of a projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining with variational Monte Carlo, enabling efficient computations for ( 2 + 1 ) D LGTs. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate ground-state simulation of pure Z 2 , Z 3 , and Z 4 gauge theory, odd- Z 2 gauge theories, and Z 2 gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to 32 × 32 . Furthermore, we demonstrate that it allows for accurate simulations of real-time dynamics up to long time, exemplified by the dynamics of elementary excitations of the deconfined Z 2 gauge field at 10 × 10 . This is also the first example of simulating the real-time dynamics of PEPS with variational Monte Carlo, whose impact may extend beyond gauge theory. Our Letter establishes gauge-invariant PEPS as a powerful approach for both ground-state and dynamical simulations, opening up a new avenue for nonperturbatively studying ( 2 + 1 ) D LGTs.},
