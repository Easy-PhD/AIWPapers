  abstract     = {Active movement is essential for the survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae, and unicellular parasites. In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. One such case are malaria parasites gliding through 3D hydrogels, for which we find that the internal correlation time for the stochastic process generating propulsion is similar to the time taken for one helical turn. Motivated by this experimental finding, here we theoretically analyze the case of finite internal correlation time for microorganisms with helical trajectories as chiral active particles with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for torque. We present an analytical solution which is in very good agreement with computer simulations. We then show that, for this type of internal noise, chirality and rotation increase the persistence of motion and results in helical trajectories that have a larger long-time mean squared displacement than straight trajectories at the same propulsion speed. Finally, we provide experimental evidence for this prediction for the case of malaria parasites.},

While nonmotile bacteria partition exclusively into the DEX-rich phase in all conditions tested, we observed that motile bacteria penetrate the soft DEX-PEG interface and partition variably among the two phases. For our model organism Bacillus subtilis , the fraction of motile bacteria in the DEX-rich phase increased from 0.58 to 1 as we increased the DEX composition within the two-phase region. We hypothesized that the chemical affinity between DEX and the bacteria cell wall acts to weakly confine the bacteria within the DEX-rich phase; however, motility can generate sufficient mechanical forces to overcome the soft confinement and propel the bacteria into the PEG-rich phase. Using optical tweezers to drag a bacterium across the DEX-PEG interface, we demonstrate that the overall bacteria partitioning is determined by a competition between the interfacial forces and bacterial propulsive forces. Our measurements are supported by a theoretical model of dilute active rods embedded within a periodic soft confinement potential.},

We develop a theory for the deformations of a class of twisted non-Euclidean sheets, which have a symmetry based on the celebrated Bonnet isometry. We show that nonorientability is an obstruction to realizing the symmetry globally, and it induces a geometric phase that captures a memory analogous to a previously identified one in 2D metamaterials. However, we show that orientable ribbons can also obstruct realizing the symmetry globally. This new obstruction is mediated by how the unit normal vector winds around the centerline of the ribbon and provides conditions for constructing soft modes of deformation compatible with the topology of multiply twisted connected ribbons.},

  abstract     = {Activation volume is a crucial concept in mechanochemistry because it describes how the applied mechanical energy facilitates chemical reactions. The activation volume can be determined readily from the load dependence of a chemical reaction based on the stress-assisted thermal activation theory (also known as the Bell model), but it is still very challenging to fully understand what activation volume means physically and how to compute it. Here, by introducing a concept of inherent stress difference ( σ T ) between the initial and transition states, which is associated with the displacement of reacting atoms, a universal formula of activation volume ( Δ V * ) for the interfacial reactions is derived, that is, Δ V * = ( V eff σ T / E ) , where E and V eff refer to the Young’s modulus and the volume influenced by reaction, respectively. This formula implicates that Δ V * is related to the volume change from the initial to transition states. Then, the first-principles calculation was used to confirm the validity of the proposed definition in diverse types of chemical reactions. This Letter provides clear physical insight into how a chemical reaction that is unlikely to occur under thermal conditions is facilitated by mechanical stress, explaining the core principle of mechanochemistry.},

  abstract     = {Stabilizing thermodynamically unstable phases in many-body systems, such as suppressing pathological neuronal synchronization in Parkinson’s disease or maintaining magnetic order across broad temperature ranges, remains a persistent challenge. In traditional approaches, such phases are stabilized through intervening in the dynamics of all system constituents or introducing additional interactions. Here, we offer a hitherto-unexplored alternative, namely, subsystem resetting, whereby intervention in the dynamics of only a part of the system, and that too only occasionally in time, is implemented through resetting its state to a reset configuration. Just playing with a few parameters, e.g., the nature of the reset configuration and the size of the reset subsystem, one achieves a remarkable and robust control over the phase diagram of the bare dynamics. We demonstrate that these universal effects span a wide variety of scenarios, including equilibrium and nonequilibrium, mean-field and non-mean-field dynamics, with and without quenched disorder. Despite the challenges posed by memory effects, we obtain explicit analytical predictions, validated by simulations.},

These algorithms all feature a nonthermal velocity distribution. They are exemplified by the lifted totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (lifted TASEP), a one-dimensional lattice reduction of event-chain Monte Carlo. We analyze its dynamics in terms of a velocity trapping that arises from correlations between the local density and the particle velocities. This allows us to formulate a conjecture for its out-of-equilibrium mixing timescale, and to rationalize its equilibrium superdiffusive timescale. Both scales are faster than for the (unlifted) TASEP. They are further justified by our analysis of the lifted TASEP in terms of many-particle realizations of true self-avoiding random walks. We discuss velocity trapping beyond the case of one-dimensional lattice models and in more than one physical dimensions. Possible applications beyond physics are pointed out.},

Herein, using ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy, we discover a coherent 4.2 THz optical phonon mode that emerges only upon photoexcitation in FeTe/FeSe/ or FeTe/ heterostructures, but is absent in bare Nb-doped under identical subgap pumping. Atomic-scale electron energy loss spectroscopy in scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies this mode as out-of-plane oxygen vibrations localized at double terminated interface. Crucially, the phonon amplitude in FeTe/FeSe/ is more than twice as large as that in FeTe/ , which can be attributed to higher electron doping that strengthens dipole moments penetrating the FeSe layer, thereby resulting in an enhanced interfacial EPC. Temperature-dependent dynamics further highlight the unique electronic nature of monolayer FeSe in sustaining this robust coupling. These findings provide direct evidence for dipole-mediated interfacial EPC as a critical mechanism of interfacial superconductivity in .},

Here, we demonstrate far-field nonreciprocal thermal Fizeau drag radiation around asymmetric exceptional points (EPs) by drifting electrons in graphene sheets on dielectric periodic nanostructures. First, the generation and evolution mechanisms of symmetric scattering EP pairs have been unveiled in parameter spaces (i.e., w − θ space, w and θ are filling ratio of gratings and incident angle respectively). The EP pairs are connected by bulk Fermi arc along the θ axis whose length can be tuned over the whole angular range by modifying dielectric optical index. Drifting electrons contribute to asymmetrically redistributing EPs with specific angular and spectral positions at low drifting velocities due to Fizeau drag effects. These nonreciprocal behaviors of EPs in angle space have been used to shape magnet-free infrared nonreciprocal emissivity and absorptivity with different numbers of resonant peaks, resulting in more than an order of magnitude increase in wavelength-integrated thermal nonreciprocity. The physics that underpins the synergy between nonreciprocity and EPs offers new insights into areas such as non-Hermitian physics, nonreciprocal optics, and nonreciprocal thermal photonics.},

Here we report the full control over AFM states by voltage pulses in the insulating Co 3 O 4 spinel well below its Néel temperature. We show that the strong linear magnetoelectric effect is fully governed by the orientation of the Néel vector. As a unique feature of Co 3 O 4 , the magnetoelectric energy can easily overcome the weak magnetocrystalline anisotropy; thus, the Néel vector can be manipulated on demand, either rotated smoothly or reversed suddenly, by combined electric and magnetic fields. We achieve the nonvolatile switching within a few tens of nanoseconds between time-reversed AFM states in macroscopic volumes by voltage pulses. These observations render quasicubic antiferromagnets, like Co 3 O 4 , an ideal platform for the ultrafast (picosecond to nanosecond) manipulation of microscopic AFM domains and may pave the way for the realization of AFM spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Current-induced spin-orbit torques (SOTs) can electrically switch magnetic films. The thickness of these films is usually limited to a few tenths of nanometers. Toward stable spintronic nanodevices, it is important to explore the upper thickness limit and to identify the associated SOT switching mechanism, if it is different from standard models. Here, we experimentally show that the SOT switching could occur in trilayers with a thickness of ferrimagnetic films up to 200 nm, all at room temperature. The contributions from the Oersted field, bulk SOTs, and thermal activation induced by Joule heating are also discussed. Through performing atomistic spin simulations, we identify the critical role of nucleation and propagation of vertical magnetic solitons along the thickness direction, which could explain such unprecedented SOT switching behaviors in extremely thick ferrimagnets. The revelation of the vertical soliton-assisted SOT switching of the extremely thick ferrimagnets can be used for miniaturizing spintronic devices.},

Despite its significance across various open classical and quantum systems, the influence of nonlinearity has remained largely unclear. Here, we reveal the Hopf bifurcation of the nonlinear skin effect as a critical phenomenon unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that nonlinearity destabilizes skin states and instead gives rise to the emergence of delocalized states associated with limit cycles in phase space. We also uncover the algebraically localized critical skin effect precisely at the Hopf bifurcation point. We illustrate this behavior in a nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model in both continuum and lattice. Our Letter shows a significant role of nonlinearity in the skin effect and uncovers rich phenomena arising from the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity.},

Here we show that such intriguing chiral phonons can also be induced in nonmagnetic Kagome lattices that lack atomic structural chirality but harbor electronic chirality rooted in the presence of loop current order. This central finding is demonstrated using two types of loop current order, the restricted chiral flux phase characterized by a pure imaginary charge bond order and the more generalized chiral flux phase characterized by a complex charge bond order, as typified in layered ( , Rb, K). At a mechanistic level, the time-reversal symmetry breaking caused by the electronic chirality is shown to pronouncedly influence their vibrational properties through electron-phonon coupling. The electronic chirality in either chiral flux phase is accompanied by a nonzero molecular Berry curvature, which in turn manifests as a nonlocal effective magnetic field of vectorial nature acting on the phonons. Consequently, the double degeneracy at each Brillouin zone corner is lifted, empowering chirality to the phonon modes. This Letter provides an indispensable component toward a more complete understanding of various chiral collective electronic phenomena in such structurally achiral systems.},

Consequently, the disorder induces a phase disconnected from the simple clean limit of the topological insulator, which is achieved via an impurity resonance inducing additional bands with Chern number 2. Thus, we call this impurity induced phase a genuine topological Anderson insulator. In seeming contradiction to the expectation that mass disorder is an irrelevant perturbation to the Dirac semimetal, the tricritical point separating these two Chern insulating phases and a thermal metal phase is located at zero impurity density and connected to the appearance of a zero energy bound state in the continuum that corresponds to a perfectly resonant mass impurity.

Traditionally, TBICs of different dimensions are observed separately in distinct systems. Here, we report the experimental discovery of the coexistence of two-dimensional surface TBICs and one-dimensional hinge TBICs in a single three-dimensional phononic crystal system. Such an unprecedented dimensional hierarchy of TBICs is triggered by the mechanism of separability and protected by the valley Chern numbers. Notably, these TBICs inherit dispersive propagation characteristics from valley topology and can propagate robustly against defects without leakage.

With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg array quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of nonbipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, “hidden” vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [X. Ran et al. , Hidden orders and phase transitions for the fully packed quantum loop model on the triangular lattice, Commun. Phys. 7 , 207 (2024) ] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of “remnants of fractionalization” at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter—the plaquette loop resonance—and its constituent—the vison field—exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a three-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.},

  abstract     = {A magnetic impurity in a BCS superconductor induces the formation of a Shiba state and drives a local quantum phase transition. We generalize this concept to a one-dimensional superconductor with fractionalized excitations, where the dominant instability is superconducting. In this framework, conduction electrons fractionalize into gapless charge and gapped spin excitations. We show that magnetic impurity interacts exclusively with the spin degrees of freedom and induces a quantum phase transition. Furthermore, charge excitations influence dynamical observables, giving rise to the phenomenon we term the “fractionalized Shiba state.” At zero temperature, the tunneling spectrum exhibits universal power-law scaling with an exponent of at half filling, stemming from the gapless charge modes that form a standard Luttinger liquid. Extending this analysis to finite temperatures reveals that the spectral features retain universal behavior at the critical point.},

  abstract     = {Charged defect scattering of electrons plays a critical role in determining a wide range of material properties. However, there is a lack of an accurate method to calculate the scattering, as all the existing methods require assuming a specific distribution for unscreened (i.e., bare) excess charge carried by the defect, which limits their accuracy. Here we develop a first-principles method to determine the bare charge distribution, which thus enables accurate calculations of the scattering. Using this method, we accurately calculate the electron mobility of 2D under the scattering of charged sulfur vacancies and compare with that of charge-neutral oxygen substitutes of sulfur. Interestingly, we find that the charged defect-limited mobility exhibits a strong temperature dependence at low temperature and carrier concentration, in contrast to the neutral defect and the conventional belief that the defect-limited mobility is less sensitive to the temperature. This behavior arises from the free carrier screening of the long-range scattering potential of the charged defect. Our work offers new insights into the transport mechanism, and opens access to accurate calculation, understanding, and prediction of charged defect scattering and a broad range of associated properties.},

Our work proposes and validates a “twist-on-twist” paradigm to realizing unidirectional propagation and robust magic angle at arbitrary directions of the elastic out-of-plane wave. Our elastic metasurface not only exhibits a twisted configuration between the stacked bilayer but also significantly enhances out-of-plane symmetry breaking by further twisting meta-atoms in one constituent layer.

Entropy provides insights into the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of both ground and excited states beyond transport measurements. For the one-carrier regime, the obtained entropy shows that the ground state has a twofold degeneracy lifted by an out-of-plane magnetic field. This observation is in agreement with previous direct transport measurements and confirms the applicability of this novel method. For the two-carrier regime, the extracted entropy indicates a nondegenerate ground state at zero magnetic field, contrary to previous studies suggesting a threefold degeneracy. We attribute the degeneracy lifting to the effect of Kane-Mele-type spin-orbit interaction on the two-carrier ground state, which has not been observed before. Our Letter demonstrates the validity and efficacy of entropy measurements as a unique, supplementary experimental tool to investigate the degeneracy of the ground state in quantum devices built in materials such as graphene. This technique, applied to exotic systems with fractional ground state entropies, will be a powerful tool in the study of quantum matter.},

However, even in mechanically exfoliated and hexagonal boron nitride encapsulated samples that are expected to maintain the most intrinsic properties, shallow defect states are still unavoidable. Here, we reported a method for eliminating the defect states in monolayer WSe 2 by coupling it with a c-plane sapphire surface. We found that the defect-relevant photoluminescence peaks at cryogenic temperatures can be completely suppressed in WSe 2 on c-plane sapphire, resulting in intrinsic exciton radiation, prolonged lifetime, and increased diffusion length. Ab initio calculations revealed that the surface of c-plane sapphire is much more active than other planes, where oxygen atoms preferentially transfer to WSe 2 to repair selenium vacancy defects. Our Letter provides a new platform for defect engineering, which will promote the development of high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices based on 2D materials.},

Using a completely harmonic description we show that the hybridization of the local nonphononic vibrational excitations with the waves leads to a low-frequency DOS, in excess to the Debye one, which varies linearly with frequency up to a certain crossover frequency, and then becomes constant. The actual value of the crossover depends of the ratio between the local stresses and the shear modulus. This excess DOS leads to a low-temperature specific heat with an apparent temperature exponent, which is between one and two, as observed experimentally. We discuss how these findings may be utilized for the characterization of glassy materials. We further compare our findings, which only rely on harmonic interactions, with the predictions of other theories, which invoke anharmonic interactions and tunneling for explaining the low-temperature behavior of the specific heat.},

Here, we introduce a tensor decomposition to efficiently compress IFCs for arbitrary order . Using tensor learning, we find optimal low-rank approximations of IFCs by solving the resulting optimization problem. Our approach reveals the inherent low dimensionality of phonon-phonon interactions and allows compression of the three- and four-IFC tensors by factors of up to while retaining high accuracy in calculations of phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity. Calculations of thermal conductivity using the compressed IFCs achieve a speedup by nearly 3 orders of magnitude with accuracy relative to the reference uncompressed solution. These calculations include both three- and four-phonon scattering and are shown for a diverse range of materials (Si, HgTe, MgO, TiNiSn, and ).

  abstract     = {We investigate the occurrence of genuine quantum effects and beyond mean-field physics in the balanced and unbalanced open Dicke models with a large yet finite number of atoms . Such driven and dissipative quantum many-body systems have recently been realized in experiments involving ultracold gases inside optical cavities and are known to obey mean-field predictions in the thermodynamic limit . Here we show quantum effects that survive for large but finite , by employing a novel open-system dynamics method that allows us to obtain numerically exact quantum dynamical results for atom numbers up to a mesoscopic . While we find that beyond-mean-field effects vanish quickly with increasing in the balanced Dicke model, we are able to identify parameter regimes in the unbalanced Dicke model that allow genuine quantum effects to persist even for mesoscopic . They manifest themselves in a strong squeezing of the steady state and a modification of the steady-state phase diagram that cannot be seen in a mean-field description. This is due to the fact that the steady-state limit and thermodynamic limit do not commute.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity is among the most important problems in physics, one for which quantum simulation can provide new insights. However, it remains challenging to characterize superconductivity in existing cold-atom quantum simulation platforms. Here, we introduce a protocol for measuring a broad class of observables in fermionic quantum gas microscopes, including long-range superconducting pairing correlations (after a repulsive-to-attractive mapping). The protocol only requires global controls followed by site-resolved particle number measurements—capabilities that have been already demonstrated in multiple experiments—and is designed by analyzing the Hilbert space of fermions on two sites. The protocol is sample-efficient and we further optimize our pulses for robustness to experimental imperfections such as lattice inhomogeneity. Our Letter introduces a general tool for manipulating quantum states on optical lattices, enhancing their ability to tackle problems such as high-temperature superconductivity.},

We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model does not require postselection and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.},

Our analysis predicts nuclear clock frequencies for various solid-state and trapped ion platforms: , and . We also determine the nuclear transition energy for the bare nucleus to be .

We performed a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation by taking into account all sources of systematic errors. A detailed discussion of our lattice calculation, demonstrating that inclusive semileptonic decays can nowadays be studied on the lattice at a phenomenologically relevant level of accuracy, is the subject of a companion paper [A. De Santis et al. , Inclusive semileptonic decays of the meson: A first-principles lattice QCD calculation, Phys. Rev. D 112 , 054503 (2025)]. Here, we focus on the phenomenological implications of our results. Using the current best estimates of the relevant Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements, our theoretical predictions for the decay rate and for the first two lepton-energy moments are in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental measurements. We also argue that, while the inclusive channel is not yet competitive with the exclusive channels in the determination, the situation can be significantly improved in the near future.},

Central to the prescription is a presentation of random matrix theory in Mellin space, which lifts to two dimensions via the spectral decomposition employed in previous work. As a demonstration we perform the explicit lift of two-point correlations of the GUE Airy model. We propose that in pure gravity, semiclassical amplitudes for off-shell -boundary torus wormholes with topology are given by the lift of JT gravity wormhole amplitudes. For the three-boundary case, we identify a gravity calculation which matches the result.},

This “universality class of the first levels” is realized in the majority of “synthetic” random matrix models but, for all we know, in only one microscopically defined system: low-dimensional gravity. We discuss the physical properties of these states, notably their exceptional rigidity against external perturbations, as quantified by the so-called quantum state fidelity. Examining these structures through the lenses of random matrix and string theory, we highlight their relevance to the physics of low-dimensional holographic principles.},

One possible source of such ultrahigh-energy particles is the rapid emission of energetic Hawking radiation from a primordial black hole (PBH) near the end of its evaporation lifetime. The mass distribution for PBHs features a power-law tail for small masses; a small subset of PBHs would be undergoing late-stage evaporation today. We find that recent high-energy neutrino events detected by the IceCube and KM3NeT Collaborations, with energies O ( 1 − 10 2 ) PeV , are consistent with event-rate expectations if a significant fraction of the dark matter consists of PBHs.},

COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112 were designed to test the claim directly using the same target material. COSINE-100, located at Yangyang Underground Laboratory in South Korea, and ANAIS-112, located at Canfranc Underground Laboratory in Spain, have been taking data since 2016 and 2017, respectively. Each experiment published its respective results independently. In this Letter, we present the results of an annual modulation search as a test of the signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA with the first three respective years of data from COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we find best fit values for modulation amplitude of − 0.0002 ± 0.0026 cpd / kg / keV in the 1–6 keV and 0.0021 ± 0.0028 cpd / kg / keV in the 2–6 keV energy regions. These results are not compatible with DAMA/LIBRA’s assertion for their observation of annual modulation at 3.7 σ and 2.6 σ , respectively. Performing a simple combination of the newly released 6-year datasets from both experiments finds values consistent with no modulation at 0.0005 ± 0.0019 cpd / kg / keV in the 1–6 keV and 0.0027 ± 0.0021 cpd / kg / keV in the 2–6 keV energy regions with 4.7 σ and 3.5 σ respective exclusions of the DAMA/LIBRA signal.},

Notably, these observations feature a distinctive dark shadow—primarily arising from faint jet emissions—surrounded by a bright photon ring. Anticipated upgrades of the EHT promise substantial improvements in dynamic range, enabling deeper exploration of low-background regions, particularly the inner shadow defined by the lensed equatorial horizon. Our analysis shows that observations of these regions transform supermassive black holes into powerful probes for annihilating dark matter, which is expected to accumulate densely in their vicinity. By analyzing the black hole image morphology and performing electron-positron propagation calculations in realistic plasma backgrounds derived from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we set stringent constraints on dark matter annihilation, requiring contributions below the astrophysical emission. These constraints, derived from both current EHT observations and projections for future upgraded arrays, exclude a substantial region of previously unexplored parameter space and remain robust against astrophysical uncertainties, including black hole spin and plasma temperature variations.},

Here, we propose an enhanced gravity-sensing protocol for a nanodiamond levitated in a linear ion trap, which improves the sensing sensitivity and further reduces device size. By introducing gravitational acceleration into the vibrational state through transient free fall, we achieve a square-accelerated relative phase accumulation, yielding higher sensitivity than the linear accumulation process. The sensitivity reaches the standard quantum limit for a nanodiamond containing multiple nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) centers. Besides, by using phonon-mediated one-axis twisting dynamics induced by magnetic field gradient to squeeze the initial spin state, the sensitivity can further surpass the standard quantum limit as a scaling law of . To fully assess the protocol performance, we further analyze the effects of decoherence and control errors, which are negligible under experimentally achievable conditions. Specifically, the sensitivity reaches for the nanodiamond containing only one N-V center over a free-fall distance of , while exceeds for 100 N-V centers. Our results will further facilitate research on compact and high-sensitivity gravimeters.},

However, fully harvesting this advantage typically requires complex entangling measurements, which are challenging to implement and scale with the system’s size. In this Letter, we consider a natural quantum information primitive known as a random access code in which the message to be communicated is selected stochastically. We introduce a protocol that leverages high-dimensional entanglement to perform this task perfectly, without requiring quantum interference between particles at the measurement station. We experimentally demonstrate how this unlocks implementation in the high-dimensional regime through an optical setup using eight-dimensional entanglement and multioutcome detection, providing a practical solution for stochastic communication and a robust method for certifying the dimensionality of entanglement in communication experiments.},

We also investigated the enhancement of the incoherent noise due to the impedance-matched cavity and characterized the quantum memory performance, showing a two-way transfer from excited to spin states and back of up to 83%. Finally, we confirmed the quantum nature of our memory by storing nonclassical states of light, i.e., a heralded single photon from a nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, and achieved nonclassical correlations between the heralding and the stored-and-retrieved photon. These results demonstrate that impedance-matched AFC spin-wave quantum memories with on-demand readout can be used for experiments involving the storage of photonic quantum states.

Specifically, we propose a novel technique called nondiagonal density matrix encoding, which leverages the inherent nonunitary dynamics of Lindbladians to encode general linear ODEs into the nondiagonal blocks of density matrices. This framework enables us to design quantum algorithms with both theoretical simplicity and high performance. Combined with the state-of-the-art quantum Lindbladian simulation algorithms, our algorithm can outperform all existing quantum ODE algorithms and achieve near-optimal dependence on all parameters under a plausible input model.

Recently, superradiant self-organized phases for ultracold atomic gases inside a cavity, pumped by a blue detuned optical lattice, have been observed. Here, we explore the formation of quantum many-body phases of bosonic atoms inside an optical cavity, subject to transverse blue detuned pumping. We investigate the strongly interacting regime, which can be reached by tuning the -wave scattering length using external fields. We analyze the interplay between superradiant self-organization with superfluid and Mott insulator phases, without the need of including higher lying bands, as the Wannier functions are dynamically linked to the cavity light via backaction. We observe different kinds of structural phase transitions driven by the light inside the cavity and the interplay with atomic collisions. We observe the mode softening at the critical points in the quantum phase transitions which can be measured in future experiments. We obtain our results within a full self-consistent theoretical framework, the light-matter density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), which employs the computation of light dependent Wannier functions for the full quantum optical lattice in combination with DMRG for the atomic dynamics. The methods introduced here can be used to analyze the effects of strong quantum correlations in strongly interacting light-matter systems.},

We demonstrate that, regardless of the connection rules, geometrical loops, constructed by piercing excited plaquettes percolate precisely at the thermal critical point , with critical exponents coinciding with those of the loop representation of the dual 3D Ising model. Further, we construct Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters in a random-cluster representation, showing that they also percolate at , enabling access to all thermal critical exponents. Strikingly, the Binder cumulants of the percolation order parameters for both loops and FK clusters reveal a pseudo-first-order transition.
