Forcibly rotated by another motor F o , F 1 catalyzes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis by converting mechanical work into chemical free energy stored in the molecule ATP. The details of how F o drives F 1 are not fully understood; however, evaluating efficient ways to rotate F 1 could provide fruitful insights into this driving since there is a selective pressure to improve efficiency. Here, we show that rotating F 1 with an angle clamp is significantly more efficient than a constant torque. Our experiments, combined with theory and simulation, indicate that the angle clamp significantly suppresses the nonequilibrium variation that contributes to the futile dissipation of input work.},

  abstract     = {As with many motile microalgae, the freshwater species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can detect light sources and adapt its motile behavior in response. Here, we show that suspensions of photophobic cells can be unstable to density fluctuations, as a consequence of shading interactions mediated by light absorption. In a circular illumination geometry, this mechanism leads to the complete phase separation of the system into transient branching patterns, providing experimental evidence of finite wavelength selection through a motility-induced phase separation mechanism. The finite wavelength selection is a consequence of a vision-based interaction length scale which is fixed by the illumination geometry. A simple drift-diffusion framework allows us to understand how the wavelength depends on global cell density, light intensity, and medium viscosity. Finally, we show that this active phase separation shields individual cells from the deleterious effects of high light intensity, demonstrating that phototaxis can efficiently contribute to photoprotection through collective behaviors on short timescales.},

We demonstrate that topologically protected modes, inherently robust against perturbations, localize along lattice discontinuities and govern the mechanical response. By precisely engineering the microstructure, we direct these modes to control stress distributions and trigger predictable, controlled damage. Our findings, validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and experiments, advance our understanding of nontrivial mechanical responses in Maxwell lattices and establish a clear framework for designing materials with improved fracture energy.

To derive the dynamic theory for the droplet size distribution, we consider a minimal ternary emulsion with one active reaction, leading to one conserved quantity. Even for cases where single droplets constantly grow, coupling many droplets via the conserved density in the far field leads to a self-organized reversal of ripening and, thus, a monodisperse emulsion. For late times, we find a scaling ansatz leading to the collapse of the rescaled size distributions, different from the LSW theory. This scaling behavior arises from a stable fixed point in the single droplet dynamics and may capture the late-time behavior of many active matter systems exhibiting reversed ripening.},

  abstract     = {Accurately quantifying the energy loss rate of proton beams in liquid water is crucial for the precise application and improvement of proton therapy, whereas the slowing down of protons in water ices also plays an important role in astrophysics. However, precisely determining the electronic stopping power, particularly for the liquid phase, has been elusive so far. Experimental techniques are difficult to apply to volatile liquids, and the availability of sufficient reliable measurements has been limited to the solid and vapor phases. The accuracy of current models is typically limited to proton energies just above the energy loss maximum, making it difficult to predict radiation effects at an energy range of special relevance. We elucidate the phase differences in proton energy loss in water in a wide energy range ( 0.001 − 10 MeV ) by means of real-time time-dependent density functional theory combined with the Penn method. This nonperturbative model, more computationally efficient than current approaches, describes the phase effects in water in excellent agreement with available experimental data, revealing clear deviations around the maximum of the stopping power curve and below. As an important outcome, our calculations reveal that proton stopping quantities of liquid water and amorphous ice are identical, in agreement with recent similar observations for low-energy electrons, pointing out this equivalence for all charged particles. This could help to overcome the limitation in obtaining reliable experimental information for the biologically relevant liquid water target.},

A basic question with practical applications is how likely and under what conditions such walks return to the origin (the identity rotation), which means that the physical system returns to its initial state. In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3) or SU(2), even a very complicated one, will preferentially return to the origin simply by traversing the walk twice in a row and uniformly scaling all rotation angles. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return, and comment on the problem in higher dimensions.},

We consider prototypical spin systems, the transverse Ising model, and the XYZ model in the D -dimensional lattice with a finite exponent α > D which guarantees the thermodynamic extensivity. In one dimension, both normal and anomalous diffusion are observed, where the anomalous diffusion is attributed to anomalous enhancement of the amplitude of the equilibrium current correlation. We prove the power-law clustering property of arbitrary orders of joint cumulants in general dimensions. Applying this theorem to equal-time current correlations, we further prove several theorems leading to the statement that the sufficient condition for normal diffusion in one dimension is α > 3 / 2 regardless of the models. The fluctuating hydrodynamics approach consistently explains Lévy diffusion for α < 3 / 2 , which implies that the condition is optimal. In higher dimensions of D ≥ 2 , normal diffusion is indicated as long as α > D .},

Here we report what we believe to be the first experimental study of hyperbolic surface exciton polaritons (HSEPs). We study the intensity and phase response of HSEPs in the J-aggregate TDBC (a type-II natural hyperbolic material). HSEPs can be used to generate phase singularities; the behavior of these phase singularities is a consequence of the hyperbolic nature of TDBC. The combined intensity and phase response of nonhyperbolic and hyperbolic SPs suggests that they are topologically distinct. We predict analogous effects for hyperbolic surface phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride. Our Letter suggests that organic materials can provide a new platform for the exploration of hyperbolic surface polaritonics at visible frequencies.},

Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous giant excitonic photoluminescence (PL) enhancement and unidirectional emission from a two-dimensional InSe film integrated with an asymmetric plasmonic nanocavity. A 3500-fold PL enhancement is achieved by engineering spatial, spectral, and orientational overlap between cavity modes and out-of-plane excitons in InSe. Symmetry breaking within the nanocavity ensures precise control of emission interference, yielding a record-high directivity exceeding 15 dB. The design achieves a high coupling efficiency of 24% and supports guided light propagation of 140 μ m .

Specifically, nonequilibrium band structure mapping and valley-resolved ultrafast population dynamics in semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide 2 H − MoTe 2 reveal band-gap renormalizations and reduced population lifetimes as photoexcited carrier densities increase.

We first classify magnetic point groups enabling pure piezospintronic effects. A novel first-principles method is developed to compute the spin dipole moments and coefficients of the piezospintronic effect. Integrating these methodologies with high-throughput screening, we identify FeOOH, Cr 2 O 3 , and NaMn X ( X = As , Bi, P, Sb) with significant pure piezospintronic effects. Interestingly, we reveal that the ionic displacement contribution dominates the piezospintronic effect, in contrast to the piezoelectric effect.

However, there is a discrepancy between theory prediction and experimental observation, which suggests some underlying mechanism that intrinsically suppresses the expected experimental signatures, like the thermal Hall current. Many-body interactions that are not accounted for in the noninteracting quasiparticle picture are most often identified as the reason for the absence of the topological edge modes. Here we report persistent bosonic edge modes at the boundaries of a ladder quantum paramagnet with gapped triplon excitations in the presence of the full many-body interaction. We use tensor network methods to resolve topological edge modes in the time-dependent spin-spin correlations and the dynamical structure factor, which is directly accessible experimentally. We further show that signatures of these edge modes survive even when the noninteracting quasiparticle theory breaks down; we discuss the topological phase diagram of the model, demonstrate the fractionalization of its low-lying excitations, and propose potential material candidates.},

  abstract     = {Quantum Monte Carlo is a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body physics, yet its efficacy is often curtailed by the notorious sign problem. In this Letter, we introduce a novel criterion for the “intrinsic” sign problem in two-dimensional bosonic topological orders, which cannot be resolved by local basis transformations or adiabatic deformations of the Hamiltonian. Specifically, we find that the positivity of higher Gauss sums is a necessary condition for a two-dimensional bosonic topological order to be realized by a stoquastic Hamiltonian, and hence “sign-problem-free.” Equivalently, a nonpositive higher Gauss sum for a given topological order indicates the presence of an intrinsic sign problem. This condition not only aligns with prior findings but significantly broadens their scope. Using this new criterion, we examine the Gauss sums of all 405 bosonic topological orders classified up to rank 12, and strikingly find that 398 of them exhibit intrinsic sign problems. We also uncover intriguing links between the intrinsic sign problem, the gappability of boundary theories, and time-reversal symmetry, suggesting that sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulation may fundamentally rely on both time-reversal symmetry and gapped boundaries. These results highlight the deep connection between the intrinsic sign problem and fundamental properties of topological phases, offering valuable insights into their classical simulability.},

In this Letter, by combining high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of the trilayer nickelate superconductor La 4 Ni 3 O 10 at ambient pressure. We reveal a dichotomy in the electronic band renormalizations of La 4 Ni 3 O 10 in comparison to cuprate superconductors. At a high energy scale of hundreds of meV, its band structure is strongly renormalized by an electron correlation effect enhanced by Hund’s coupling. The resultant waterfall-like dispersions resemble the high-energy kinks in cuprate superconductors. However, at low-energy scales of tens of meV, the dispersive bands are nearly featureless and devoid of any resolvable electron-boson interactions, in drastic contrast to the low-energy kinks observed in cuprates and other correlated 3 d transition-metal compounds. The dichotomic band renormalizations highlight the disparity between nickelate and cuprate superconductors and emphasize the importance of strong electron correlation in the superconductivity of Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates.},

  abstract     = {Helical trilayer graphene realizes a versatile moiré system for exploring correlated topological states emerging from high Chern bands. Motivated by recent experimental observations of anomalous Hall effects at fractional fillings of magic-angle helical trilayers, we focus on the higher Chern number | C band | = 2 band and explore gapped many-body Hall states beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm. Through extensive exact diagonalization, we predict novel phases unattainable in a single | C band | = 1 band. At filling ν = 2 / 3 and ν = 1 / 3 , a 3 × 3 charge-ordered quantum Hall crystal and a Halperin fractional Chern insulator with Hall conductance | σ H | = 2 e 2 / 3 h are predicted, respectively, indicating strong particle-hole asymmetry of the system. At half-filling ν = 1 / 2 , an extensively degenerate pseudospin Hall ferromagnet featuring emergent SU(2) symmetry is found without the band being flat. Inspired by striking robustness of the ferromagnetic degeneracy, we develop a method to unveil and quantify the emergent symmetry via pseudospin operator construction in the presence of band dispersion and Coulomb interaction and demonstrate persistence of the SU(2) quantum numbers even far away from the chiral limit. Incorporating spin-valley degrees of freedom, we identify an optimal filling regime ν total = 3 + ν for realizing the above states. Notably, interflavor interactions renormalize the bandwidth and stabilize all the gapped phases even in realistic sublattice corrugation parameter regimes.},

By applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with low-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millhenry scale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These domains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon current reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing voltage. This emergent inductance defies classical models, occurs without superconductivity or engineered nanostructures, and opens a new frontier in orbital-based quantum functionality and device concepts.},

Characterizing the orbital character and propagation of these electronic excitations is crucial for understanding and controlling their behavior; however, this information is challenging to access. High resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering is a momentum-resolved technique that can address these crucial questions. We present measurements collected at the Cr L 3 -edge which show a rich spectrum of excitations with a variety of spin-orbital characters. While most of these excitations appear to be localized, the dispersion of the lowest energy dark exciton indicates that it is able to propagate along both the a and b directions within the planes of the crystal. This two-dimensional character is surprising as it contrasts with electrical conductivity and the behavior of the bright exciton, both of which are strongly one dimensional. The discovery of this propagating dark exciton highlights an unusual coexistence of one- and two-dimensional electronic behaviors in CrSBr.},

This theorem provides (i) supporting evidence for various conjectured gapped phases and (ii) a sufficient criterion for identifying gapless spin chains.

Through particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we identify the J × B force at the front edge as the primary mechanism for injecting electrons into the SPW, where they are further accelerated.

However, perpetual bouncing is yet to be demonstrated on a vibrating rigid solid, where the control of the drop’s motion is not limited by the bath dynamics. Here we show that vibration of an atomically smooth mica surface prolongs a drop’s hovering state by several orders of magnitude, increasing the time to wet from less than a second to several minutes. The excitation of the second spherical harmonic mode determines a transition between a bouncing state with high-amplitude rebounds, and a bound state, where the drop’s motion is locked onto the vibrating solid above a thin air layer. We further develop a coupled linear spring model, accounting for the drop’s deformation, that predicts bouncing trajectories without fitting parameters. Our results extend the scope of bouncing drop studies beyond the liquid bath and highlight the potential for precision manipulation of small liquid quantities in air.},

However, integrated OAM-based information technology is an open challenge, because OAM modes are always generated in pairs with opposite topological charges due to their degeneracy. Here, we observe locking of the OAM and linear momentum of light by using a chiral optical waveguide with an Archimedean cross section to induce the orbit-orbit interaction. This OAM-momentum locking enables the deterministic and robust generation of on-demand OAM vortex light beam in a photonic chip.

The total radiated power transitions from subradiant suppression under weak pumping to superradiant enhancement at stronger pumping, while exhibiting directional emission confined to a narrow spatial angle. At the same time multiple independent spectral emission lines below the lasing threshold merge toward a single narrow spectral line at high pump power. The most substantial enhancement and line narrowing occur when a fraction of unpumped atoms is present.

  abstract     = {Understanding the equation of state (EOS) of pure neutron matter is necessary for interpreting multimessenger observations of neutron stars. Reliable data analyses of these observations require well-quantified uncertainties for the EOS input, ideally propagating uncertainties from nuclear interactions directly to the EOS. This, however, requires calculations of the EOS for a prohibitively larger number of nuclear Hamiltonians, solving the nuclear many-body problem for each one. Quantum Monte Carlo methods, such as auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC), provide precise and accurate results for the neutron matter EOS, but they are very computationally expensive, making them unsuitable for the fast evaluations necessary for uncertainty propagation. Here, we employ parametric matrix models to develop fast emulators for AFDMC calculations of neutron matter and use them to directly propagate uncertainties of coupling constants in the Hamiltonian to the EOS. As these uncertainties include estimates of the effective field theory truncation uncertainty, this approach provides robust uncertainty estimates for use in astrophysical data analyses. This Letter will enable novel applications such as using astrophysical observations to put constraints on coupling constants for nuclear interactions.},

  abstract     = {A stringent test of C P symmetry in hyperon decays is performed using 1.0 × 10 10 J / ψ events and 2.7 × 10 9 ψ ( 3686 ) events collected by the BESIII experiment. The C P asymmetry in the two-body nonleptonic weak decays Σ + → p π 0 and Σ ¯ − → p ¯ π 0 is determined to be A C P = − 0.0118 ± 0.0083 ( stat ) ± 0.0028 ( syst ) , consistent with C P conservation. The average decay parameter ⟨ α 0 ⟩ = − 0.9869 ± 0.0011 ( stat ) ± 0.0016 ( syst ) represents the most precise measurement in the baryon sector to date. A model-independent analysis of the hyperon polarization is performed for the first time at J / ψ and ψ ( 3686 ) resonances, revealing a clear sign reversal and offering new insight into SU(3) symmetry breaking and baryon internal structure. These results provide the most stringent constraints on C P violation in Σ decays and establish a benchmark for future precision studies.},

We performed long-term ( ≈ 15 orbits) fully relativistic simulations of a merger of two highly and retrogradely spinning neutron stars. The resonance window of the f mode is extended by self-interaction, and the nonlinear resonance continues up to the final plunging phase. We observe that the quasicircular orbit is maintained throughout since the dissipation of orbit motion due to the resonance is coherent with that due to gravitational waves. The f -mode resonance causes a variation in the stellar spin of ≳ 6.3 % in the linear regime and much more as ∼ 33 % during the later nonlinear regime. At the merger, a phase shift of ≲ 40 rad is rendered in the gravitational waveform as a consequence of the angular momentum and energy transfers into the neutron star oscillations.},

  abstract     = {Classically, the causal order of two timelike separated events A and B is fixed—either A before B or B before A . This is no longer true in quantum theory, where it is possible to encounter superpositions of causal orders. The quantum switch is one of the most prominent processes with indefinite causal order. Optical realizations of the quantum switch have been successfully implemented in experiments, but some argue that this merely simulates a process with indefinite causal order and that a superposition of spacetime metrics is required for a true realization. Here, we provide a relativistic definition of causal order between operationally defined events that defines a meaningful observable in both the general relativistic and quantum mechanical sense. Importantly, this observable does not distinguish between the indefinite causal order implemented on an optical bench and the gravitational quantum switch, a gedanken experiment where the indefinite causal order is achieved by a quantum superposition of gravitational fields. Therefore, our results support the thesis that the optical quantum switch is just as much a realization of indefinite causal order as its gravitational counterpart, which makes use of the quantum mechanical behavior of spacetime.},

This constraint surpasses current ground-based experimental limits, studying previously unexplored regions of the axion-photon coupling parameter space up to masses of m a ≲ 3.4 × 10 − 4 eV .

Such constraints are natural and practical control parameters for semi-device-independent certification in optical platforms. To analyse these scenarios, we show how semidefinite programming relaxations for noncommutative polynomial optimization can be used to bound the set of quantum correlations under restrictions on the photon-number distribution. The practicality of this method is demonstrated by computing optimal performance bounds on several well-known communication tasks. We then apply the method to the certification of semi-device-inpependent random number generation protocols and show how to bound the conditional Shannon entropy. We showcase this versatile tool by improving randomness extraction in established protocols based on coherent states and homodyne measurements.},

  abstract     = {Extensive research has been dedicated to the asymptotic theory of quantum metrology, where the goal is to determine the ultimate precision limit of quantum channel estimation when many accesses to the channel are allowed. The ultimate limit has been well established, but in general, a noiseless and controllable ancilla is required for attaining it. Little is known about the metrological performance without noiseless ancillae, which is more relevant in practical circumstances. In this Letter, we present a novel theoretical framework to address this problem, bridging quantum metrology and the asymptotic theory of quantum channels. Leveraging this framework, we prove sufficient conditions for achieving the Heisenberg limit with repeated applications of the channel to be estimated both with and without applying interleaved unitary control operations. For the latter case, we design an algorithm to identify the control operation explicitly.},

  abstract     = {We present a general approach to error detection of bosonic quantum error-correction codes via an adaptive quantum phase estimation algorithm assisted by a single ancilla qubit. The approach is applicable to a broad class of bosonic codes whose error syndromes are described by symmetry or stabilizer operators, including the rotation-symmetric codes and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. The detection precision scales inversely with the total evolution time and thus reaches the Heisenberg limit. We numerically demonstrate the approach for several examples, such as detecting bosonic excitation loss errors in high-order cat or binomial codes and displacement errors in finite-energy GKP codes. We also extend the approach to efficiently generate arbitrary Fock states. Our schemes are feasible in present-day experiments.},

  abstract     = {We utilize the symmetry groups of regular tessellations on two-dimensional surfaces of different constant curvatures, including spheres, Euclidean planes, and hyperbolic planes to encode a qubit or qudit into the physical degrees of freedom on these surfaces, which we call tessellation codes. We show that tessellation codes exhibit decent error correction properties by analysis via geometric considerations and the representation theory of the isometry groups on the corresponding surfaces. Interestingly, we demonstrate how this formalism enables the implementation of certain logical operations through geometric rotations of surfaces in real space, opening a new approach to logical quantum computation. We provide a variety of concrete constructions of such codes associated with different tessellations, which give rise to different logical groups. This formalism sheds a new light on quantum code and logical operation construction.},

  abstract     = {Mpemba effects occur after a sudden quench of control parameters if, for “far” (or “hot”) initial states with respect to a final target state, the relaxation time toward the target state is shorter than for “close” (or “cold”) initial states. Following a strategy of fishermen in Pontus described by Aristotle, we introduce the Pontus-Mpemba effect as a two-step protocol that includes the time needed for preparing the system in the “far” initial state that can now be an arbitrary nonequilibrium state. Our protocol needs no parameter distance concept and applies to general (classical or quantum) systems. We find that all possible Pontus-Mpemba effects fall into three classes and illustrate the theory for open Markovian two-state quantum systems.},
