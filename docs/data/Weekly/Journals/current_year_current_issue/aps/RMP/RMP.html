  abstract = {Internal conversion is a vital vibronic loss mechanism that competes with all other photophysical mechanisms, and a plethora of information on the subject is available in the literature. However, these data are often difficult to penetrate owing to their complexity. In addition, owing to the sheer number of methods, it is often difficult to understand which method is better for certain systems. This comprehensive review on the state of the art explores the history of internal conversion and provides context to its evolution up to modern quantum chemistry. The most prevalent methods used to study atomic systems, as well as where they rise and they fall, are highlighted. Each method and the corresponding results are noted in a simplified manner, and information is threaded together to elucidate how everything is related. This tapestry illustrating the ups and downs of internal conversion will aid researchers in their study of new and innovative materials and provides a vital comparison of methods not easily gained.},

  abstract = {In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, like our Sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton ( )-chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. The relevant reactions of solar and stellar hydrogen burning are reviewed here from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, general recommendations are also formed.},
