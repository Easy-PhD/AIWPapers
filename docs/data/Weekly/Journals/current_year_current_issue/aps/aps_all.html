  abstract     = {The two-body contact is a fundamental quantity of a dilute Bose gas that relates the thermodynamics to the short-distance two-body correlations. For a Bose gas in an optical lattice, near the superfluid–Mott-insulator transition, we show that a “universal” contact can be defined from the singular part of the pressure ( is the pressure of the Mott insulator). Its expression coincides with that of a dilute Bose gas provided we consider the effective “scattering length” of the quasiparticles at the quantum critical point (QCP) rather than the scattering length in vacuum, and the excess density of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. Close to the transition, we find that the singular part of the momentum distribution exhibits a high-momentum tail of the form over a broad region of the Brillouin zone, where is the quasiparticle weight of the elementary excitations at the QCP. Our results demonstrate that the notion of contact extends to strongly correlated lattice bosons, and we argue that the contact can be measured in state-of-the-art experiments on Bose gases in optical lattices and magnetic insulators.},

We consider the dynamical response to the perturbation for a single coherent state and for Schrödinger cat states constructed as both balanced and imbalanced superpositions of two coherent states. For individual coherent states, we demonstrate that a weak parametric drive yields a long-lived sequence of classical echoes. Cat states are found to exhibit distinct quantum echoes that are sensitive to the initial relative phase and weights of the coherent states in superposition. We examine the effect of dissipation on quantum echoes and quantum revivals of cat states. We demonstrate that, even when dissipation suppresses quantum revivals, quantum echoes can be recovered by properly tuning the timing and strength of the perturbation. These results may be useful for characterizing and mitigating errors of cat qubits.},

The natural framework for this platform is measurement-based quantum computation, where fault-tolerant graph states supersede traditional quantum error-correcting codes. However, the existing formalism for foliation—the construction of fault-tolerant graph states—does not reveal how certain properties, such as single-shot error correction, manifest in the measurement-based setting. We introduce the fault complex, a representation of dynamic quantum error-correction protocols particularly well suited to describe foliation. Our approach enables precise computation of fault tolerance properties of foliated codes and provides insights into circuit-based quantum computation. Analyzing the fault complex yields improved thresholds for three- and four-dimensional toric codes, a generalization of stability experiments, and the existence of single-shot lattice surgery with higher-dimensional topological codes.},

Through a comprehensive analysis of the system's dynamics, we reveal the cooperative interactions that drive coherent-stimulated emission in both the magnonic (spin-wave) and photonic (electromagnetic) domains. The model outlines a scalable configuration in which NV centers, excited via optical pumping, couple efficiently to the magnon modes of the YIG sphere placed inside the microwave cavity. Numerical simulations based on experimentally accessible parameters confirm the feasibility of dual-domain lasing.

  abstract     = {Light-matter strong coupling has been the subject of much attention in recent decades, giving optical systems unique features. However, properties of a system with strong coupling are determined by the properties of its components and are thus difficult to control. Here, we propose Floquet engineering, a technique of controlling the energy levels of a quantum system using external fields, as a method of manipulating a hybrid system of a molecule strongly coupled to a single-mode resonator. We show that an external field can change the relative positions of levels in an open strongly coupled system, leading to a change in the rates of transitions between them. We demonstrate that if the frequency of the pumping wave is close to polariton transitions in the hybrid system, nonmonotonic dependence of fluorescence and scattering amplitudes on pump intensity with a narrow resonance-like response occurs. We show that this phenomenon occurs due to hybridization of the lower and upper polaritons with substantially different excitation numbers caused by the pumping affecting polariton states of the system. This occurs when the Rabi interaction with the coherent field is comparable to the field-matter coupling constant, which in turn needs to be sufficient for the manifestation of strong coupling. This nonmonotonic dependence of the fluorescence and scattering amplitudes on pump rate intensity paves the way for the creation of nonlinear optical devices.},

The bosonic nature of the dipole oscillators as well as the reservoir modes allows an exact numerical simulation of the dynamics for arbitrary coupling strengths. At weak coupling, apart from essentially recovering the dynamics expected from a Markovian Lindblad master equation, we also obtain non-Markovian effects for spatially separated two-level emitters. In the so-called ultrastrong coupling regime, we find the dynamics and steady state depends on the choice of the reservoir which is chosen as either an ideal cavity with equispaced, unbounded dispersion or a cavity array with a bounded dispersion. Moreover, at even higher coupling strengths, we find a decoupling between the light and matter degrees of freedom attributable to the increased importance of the diamagnetic term in the Hamiltonian. In this regime we find that the dependence of the dynamics on the separation between the dipoles is not important and the dynamics is dominated by the occupation of the polariton mode of lowest energy.},

This steady-state entanglement is created by purely dissipative dynamics, unlike the superradiance of permutationally symmetric two-level atoms, whose steady state is the ground state. Furthermore, we show that the entanglement is significantly enhanced near critical points in the superradiance potential because of the extremely high two-mode squeezing factor between two atomic ensembles. We also discuss spin squeezing in each atomic ensemble in the vicinity of specific critical points in the potential. These findings may play an important role in the generation of correlations immune to dissipation in separated atomic modes.},

We show that under appropriate conditions, an effective Hamiltonian for nondegenerate parametric down-conversion involving the two mechanical oscillators and the cavity field can be engineered. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that the cavity dissipation drives the mechanical oscillators into a steady-state non-Gaussian entangled state. The properties of the mechanical state, including non-Gaussianity, Wigner negativity, entanglement, and quantum steering, are investigated in detail. We further reveal that through the non-Gaussian mechanical entanglement, the remote preparation of the Schrödinger cat states of one mechanical oscillator can be achieved by coupling the other one to an auxiliary probe cavity and homodyning the output of the probe cavity. We also discuss the robustness of the mechanical states against thermal fluctuations. Our scheme provides a feasible approach for the dissipative and remote preparation of non-Gaussian mechanical nonclassical states.},

However, due to the interaction with the external environment, it leads to decoherence and thus reduces both the lifetime and the charging efficiency of QB. Here, we propose suppressing the environmental dissipation in the energy-storage process of the QB by exploiting both the electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT) effect and bound states. By constructing a hybrid system composed of a four-level atom and a coupled-cavity array, two bound states are formed in the system when the energy of the QB is in the energy band of the cavity array. Environmental dissipation is significantly inhibited due to the bound state and EIT effects, which extends the lifetime of the QB. We show that the charging efficiency of the QB is optimal when the energy of the QB is in resonance with the cavity. In addition, there is an optimal coupling strength between the two adjacent cavities, which helps to improve the performance of the QB. Our research has achieved the realization of long-term energy storage while improving the charging efficiency of QB, which has practical implications for the realization of QB.},

This setup corresponds to the quantum Rabi model (QRM) with a purely imaginary bias on the qubit, exhibiting parity-time ( P T ) symmetry. In this work, we first solve the P T -symmetric QRM using the Bogoliubov operator approach. We derive the transcendental function responsible for the exact solution, which can also be used to precisely identify exceptional points. The adiabatic approximation previously used can be easily formulated within this approach by considering transitions between the same manifolds in the space of Bogoliubov operators. By further considering transitions between the nearest-neighboring manifolds, we can analytically obtain more accurate eigensolutions. Moreover, these simple corrections can capture the main features of the dynamics, where the adiabatic approximation fails. Furthermore, the rich characteristics of the vacuum Rabi splitting in the emission spectrum are predicted. The width of the peaks increases with the coupling strength and the imaginary biases, reflecting the nature of open quantum systems. Additionally, we identify a quantum-criticality-enhanced effect by calculating the quantum Fisher information. Near the exceptional points, the quantum Fisher information in the P T -symmetric QRM is significantly higher than that of the non-Hermitian qubit component. This may open a new avenue for enhancing quantum sensitivity in non-Hermitian systems by incorporating coupling with an additional degree of freedom, enabling more precise parameter estimation.},

When driven on two-photon resonance, the atom is excited into its highest energy state | f 〉 by absorbing two photons simultaneously. The atom then de-excites via a cascaded decay | f 〉 → | e 〉 → | g 〉 . Here we present a theoretical study of the atomic fluorescence spectrum where, upon strong coherent driving, the spectrum exhibits seven distinct frequencies corresponding to transitions among the atomic dressed states. We characterize the quantum statistics of the emitted photons by investigating the second-order correlation functions of the emitted field. We do so by considering the total field emitted by the atom and focusing on each of the dressed-state components, taking in particular a secular-approximation and deriving straightforward, transparent analytic expressions for the second-order auto- and cross-correlations.},

The anomalous-dispersion phase matching (ADPM), though demonstrated in gases and liquids, has not been established in crystals due to the parasitic material absorption that induces the anomalous dispersion in the first place. This absorption bottleneck can be overcome by a crystal possessing an additional spectral gap in its absorption spectrum, beyond the regular band gap, which we term the “hypergap”. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate such a hypergap and the ADPM-enabled third harmonic generation in potassium chromate K 2 CrO 4 . Our results introduce a class of nonlinear optical materials that do not rely on lattice anisotropy or periodic poling.},

It has traditionally been regarded as a fully coherent structure. Here, through comprehensive simulations, we show that DSRs can exhibit partial coherence, characterized by stochastic temporal and spectral dynamics. Under appropriate saturation power of a nonmonotonic saturable absorber, the pulse develops a strong nonlinear chirp induced by self-phase modulation, which, in conjunction with normal dispersion, gives rise to wave-breaking-induced temporal fringes and the chaotic proliferation and decay of dark solitons. Concurrently, spatiotemporal intermittency emerges across the pulse plateau in the form of irregular patterns. These dynamics lead to stochastic temporal evolution and the degradation of spectral coherence, quantified by the decay of first-order spectral coherence between successive pulses. Nevertheless, the partially coherent DSR still exhibits characteristics similar to those of the coherent DSR, such as constant power and a pulse duration that increases with pump strength. Our results provide new physical insight into the coherence properties of DSRs and offer practical criteria for experimentally identifying the widely observed flat-top square pulses.},

Circular dichroism is typically observed in chiral atoms, molecules (such as DNA), and optically asymmetric materials.

Meanwhile, negative-refractive-index materials offer exotic applications in optics and photonics, including superresolution imaging, invisibility cloaking, and subwavelength imaging. Here we identify a route to achieving birefringence and dichroism in a left-handed system. We investigate the optical activity of an atomic left-handed medium, analyzing the interaction of left- and right-circularly polarized light with different atomic states while incorporating local field corrections. Notably, our results demonstrate simultaneous left-handedness for both polarization states. Furthermore, we find that electric birefringence and dichroism are significantly enhanced with increasing control field strength, while magnetic birefringence and dichroism can be fully controlled via strong laser coupling. These findings have promising implications in fields at the interface of left-handedness and dichroism.},

Because SOIs become significant at subwavelength scale, they have largely been explored in the context of inhomogeneous materials exhibiting wavelength-scale structures and notably metamaterials. Here we demonstrate that spin-orbit interactions can in fact analogously emerge in moving matter through the well-known light-dragging effects. SOIs in moving media are shown to manifest through a Berry phase induced by vorticity, which then leads to a rotation of the wave's polarization. In bringing together electrodynamics of moving media and SOIs of light, our work not only paves the way for the discovery of fundamental effects but also uncovers alternative means to harness SOIs to control light.},

Intriguingly, by adiabatically tuning the nonlinear susceptibilities along the fiber, the Stokes vector on the Poincaré sphere accumulates a nonintegrable phase known as the Hannay angle—the classical counterpart to the Berry phase—which exhibits the same geometric gauge structure, including conic singularities in parameter space, as those associated with quantum phase transitions in systems like Bose-Einstein condensates.

  abstract     = {This article presents a comprehensive three-dimensional canonical quantization to treat quantum plasmonics for finite metallic or dielectric media of arbitrary shape. We use a microscopic model for the dissipative and dispersive medium coupled with the electromagnetic field, which is justified by the fact that if one integrates the degrees of freedom of the medium, one obtains the macroscopic Maxwell equations. Its quantization features a Hamiltonian formulation having the form of two infinite harmonic oscillators characterized by a double continuum. The diagonalized Hamiltonian is quantized by the correspondence principle, introducing creation-annihilation operators in a bosonic Fock space. The diagonal quantum Hamiltonian is the sum of two terms corresponding to the two continua. The physical observables, such as the electric field, are also the sum of two terms corresponding to the two continua, one of which had been omitted in the literature geared for an infinite bulk medium. In a second step, we show that the electric field operator can by written as linear combinations of the creation-annihilation operators with coefficients that satisfy integral equations of Fredholm type. We show that the solution of these equations can be expressed in terms of the classical Green tensor of the medium satisfying the Sommerfeld radiation condition. Finally, we consider the Purcell effect for the spontaneous emission of an atom close to the medium. We show that through an exact compensation of some terms, the Purcell factor for the system with the double continuum is proportional to the imaginary part of the Green tensor, which defines the local density of states. This result has the same form as the one obtained in the literature for bulk systems that involve a single continuum and a small dissipative background extending to infinity, and can be seen as a justification of this approach.},

First, we derive the effective potential for two polar molecules in the presence of (i) an elliptical polarization field alone, (ii) combined elliptical and linear polarization fields, and (iii) combined elliptical polarization and static fields. The effective potential is then expressed as a sum of a zero-range contact interaction and a long-range dipolar interaction under the Born approximation. We find that the methods (i) and (ii) only partially suppress attractive interactions, while the method (ii) allows for the construction of bound states with different polarization shapes.

  abstract     = {The present contribution explores phase transitions that occur in the ground state (GS) of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) under the action of gradient magnetic fields. By solving the corresponding linearized system in an exact fashion, we identify the conditions under which the GS phase transitions occur, thus transforming excited states into GSs. The study of the full nonlinear system, including both density-density and spin-spin interactions, is numerically analyzed. For the case of repulsive spin-spin interactions, the results resemble the linear case, while attractive spin-spin interactions lead to the formation of mixed states near the GS phase-transition points. Additionally, higher-order vortex states are found to be stable even in the nonlinear regime. These findings demonstrate that arbitrary winding numbers corresponding to stable GSs can be achieved, thus contributing to the understanding of topological properties in SOC BECs.},

  abstract     = {We present a strong-coupling expansion of the Bose-Hubbard model based on a mean-field treatment of the hopping term, while onsite fluctuations are taken into account exactly. This random phase approximation describes the universal features of the generic Mott-insulator–superfluid transition (induced by a density change) and the superfluid state near the phase transition. The critical quasiparticles at the quantum critical point have a quadratic dispersion with an effective mass and their mutual interaction is described by an effective -wave scattering length . The singular part of the pressure takes the same form as in a dilute Bose gas, provided we replace the boson mass and the scattering length in vacuum by and , and the density by the excess density of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. We define a universal two-body contact that controls the high-momentum tail of the singular part of the momentum distribution. We also apply the strong-coupling RPA to a lattice model of hard-core bosons and find that the high-momentum distribution is controlled by a universal contact, in complete agreement with the Bose-Hubbard model. Finally, we discuss a continuum model of bosons in an optical lattice and define two additional two-body contacts: a short-distance universal contact which controls the high-momentum tail of at scales larger than the inverse lattice spacing, and a full contact , which controls the high-momentum tail of the full-momentum distribution .},

Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we establish that the impurity velocity exhibits exponential decay asymptotically. When the impurity velocity is much lower than the thermal velocity of the gas atoms, the relaxation time τ is governed entirely by the self-energy evaluated at zero momentum and zero frequency, Σ ( p = 0 ; ω = 0 ) . Furthermore, via virial expansion theory, τ admits a systematic expansion in powers of the fugacity z ≡ e β μ .

Interestingly, the localization is mutually induced by both components for the quasiperiodic confinement, whereas for a harmonic trap the localization is induced in the potential-free component by interaction with that confined in the potential. Further, we explore the condensate dynamics by implementing a periodic driving of the Rabi frequency, where various frequency-dependent delocalization patterns, such as double- (triple)-minima, treelike (parquetlike), and frozen distributions with a correlated propagation of different spin populations are observed in the condensate density. These features pave the way to control the condensate mass and spin density patterns, both in the stationary and dynamical realizations.},

We identify additional terms not part of the textbook Kondo problem, mostly ignored in previous works and giving rise to a direct competition between spin and charge correlations, strongly suppressing Kondo physics. We show that the Kondo effect can be restored by locally adjusting the chemical potential on the impurity site, and we identify realistic parameter regimes and preparation protocols suited to current experiments with AEA arrays.

  abstract     = {We investigate theoretically high-order harmonic generation (HHG) and its ellipticity in gapped graphene, driven by a femtosecond short-pulse laser at various orientation angles, employing the two-band density-matrix equations within the tight-binding approximation. The orientation-dependent harmonic spectra exhibit pronounced enhancement of specific harmonics, which we attribute to the caustic effect. Using the recombination trajectory model, we reveal that the orientation dependence of these enhanced harmonics originates from the distinct band structures encountered by electrons ionized from the two inequivalent points. Moreover, we focus on the ellipticity of the enhanced harmonics at specific angles and demonstrate that it primarily depends on the phase difference between the parallel and perpendicular components, which can be accurately predicted by our recombination trajectory model. Based on these insights, we propose a two-color (fundamental plus second-harmonic) field scheme to generate isolated elliptically polarized attosecond pulses (IEAPs) in gapped graphene and discuss the dependence of IEAPs on the laser parameters and gap energy. Our findings may provide a promising pathway for generating IEAPs in gapped graphene or transition-metal dichalcogenides.},

In this article we examine multibody fragmentation of formic acid dications, produced by ultrashort intense laser pulses, using coincidence momentum imaging and deuterium tagging to distinguish the hydrogen sites. Our measurements indicate that double hydrogen elimination leads to three- and four-body breakup, specifically H + D + CO 2 2 + and H + D + O + + CO + , respectively. We find that the latter breakup channel also proceeds via the CO 2 2 + metastable dication, but with shorter lifetimes than the CO 2 2 + dications detected intact. This intriguing sequential breakup is identified using native frames analysis and simulations to confirm the signature of this process in spite of the inferior momentum resolution associated with breakup channels for which not all fragments are detected. In addition to the fragmentation channel above, we found no evidence of sequential breakup for single hydrogen elimination, H + CO + + OD + . The elimination of three atoms, H + D + O + C + + O + , shows evidence of both concerted fragmentation and sequential breakup via metastable intermediate CO 2 + ions.

As long as the assumptions of the underlying model are satisfied, the proposed approach is robust against variations in the laser parameters, band dispersion, and hidden errors in the input data.

While the behaviors of the concerted pathway and the sequential pathway involving initial H + emission are comparable in both systems, the sequential pathway with H + emission in the second step exhibits distinct dynamics, with a higher relative branching ratio for ( NH 3 ) 2 . These differences arise from the stronger hydrogen bonds in ( H 2 O ) 2 promoting proton transfer and the weaker hydrogen bonds in ( NH 3 ) 2 favoring hydrogen bond breaking.

  abstract     = {We have applied a semiclassical impact-parameter close-coupling method to calculate the state-resolved excitation cross sections in proton collisions with the ground state of helium. Using both correlation-configuration and frozen-core two-electron basis functions, we construct a large number of helium pseudostates to use in the expansion of the total scattering wave function. Extensive convergence studies show that the present results are accurate to within a few percent. The present cross sections for transitions from the ground state into all states for the , and symmetries agree very well with experimental data where available. This work serves to provide a comprehensive set of excitation cross sections that were previously available only in narrow energy regions and for some channels. Furthermore, we present elastic-scattering, total excitation, and total electron-loss cross sections from 2 to . We conclude that with modern supercomputer technology, a single-center method can accurately model collisions through implicit inclusion of the electron-capture process via coupling to the large number of positive-energy pseudostates representing the continuum.},

The measurements led to absolute uncertainties of 750 kHz in the two-photon transition wave numbers for the five dominant isotopes of Xe, e.g., 80 118.982 918(27) cm − 1 for Xe 136 .

The analysis indicates that the natural-abundance-weighted ionization energy of Xe should be revised by − 0.023 cm − 1 to 97 833.7641(20) cm − 1 . Large fluctuations in the UV-laser pulse intensities were exploited to characterize intensity-dependent shifts of the observed two-photon transition frequencies. Shifts of up to − 20 MHz were observed and attributed to frequency shifts arising from chirps in the amplification and up-conversion of the laser radiation rather than to the ac-Stark effect.},

  abstract     = {Radio frequency antennas based on highly excited Rydberg atom vapors can in principle reach sensitivities beyond those of any conventional wire antenna, especially at lower frequencies where very long wires are needed to accommodate the growing wavelength. Conventional Rydberg sensors are based on individual atom response, with increased signal resolution relying on the O ( 10 3 ) electric dipole moment enhancement, scaling as the square of the Rydberg-state principal quantum number N ∼ 50 . However, despite more than 30 years of steady advances, beyond-classical signal sensitivity has yet to be demonstrated. More recently, the optical bistability effect, a many-body nonequilibrium phase transition occurring at somewhat higher vapor densities, has been exploited for an order of magnitude or more increased sensitivity for some setups through tuning into the critical region. However, the results fall significantly short of those using more advanced “conventional” Rydberg sensor setups—which achieve even greater enhancement by exploiting resonant interaction between a pair of nearby Rydberg levels. This paper seeks to combine the many-body and resonant enhancement effects by extending the bistable phase analysis to include a pair of resonant Rydberg levels, supported by an exact treatment of the atom velocity thermal average. A dynamic linear response formalism is developed as well to explore the trade-off between measurement sensitivity and finite-bandwidth signals. We demonstrate regions of the phase diagram which could be exploited for record breaking, beyond-classical sensitivity. Of course, only a limited number of vapor parameters are under full experimental control, and experiments will be needed to quantitatively constrain the effective mean-field interaction parameters appearing in the theory and thereby define the accessible regions of the phase diagram.},

The convergence of QED perturbative expansion is improved by using the extended Furry picture, which starts from the Dirac equation with a local screening potential. An ab initio treatment is accomplished for one- and two-photon electron-structure QED effects and the one-photon screening of the self-energy and vacuum-polarization corrections. This is complemented with an approximate treatment of the two-photon QED screening and higher-order (three or more photon) electron-structure effects. As a result, the obtained theoretical predictions improve upon the accuracy achieved in previous calculations. Comparison with available experimental data shows a good agreement between theory and experiment. In most cases, the theoretical values surpass the experimental results in precision with only a few exceptions. In the case of uranium and bismuth, the comparison provides one of the most stringent tests of bound-state QED in the strong-field regime. Alternatively, the obtained results can be employed for high-precision determinations of nuclear charge radii.},

Meanwhile, such mechanics will increase the crosstalk between atoms and enhance the decoherence. In this paper, we propose a new scheme to realize the controlled-phase gate without Rydberg blockade. The scheme works effectively with large atomic spacings and is insensitive to the thermal motions of atoms. The proposal is robust against random noises due to the geometric characteristic and operates fast based on the nonadiabatic evolution. The proposed gate is actually a geometric gate that consolidates the nonadiabatic holonomic control and the unconventional geometric control simultaneously. The interference between two different types of geometric phases can be investigated in the proposal. Furthermore, we show that the actuating quantity (the product of interaction strength and the evolution time) of the proposed scheme is 90 times smaller than the present Rydberg blockade scheme. Therefore, our proposal provides a fast and robust way to realize geometric quantum control, and it may trigger the discoveries of new geometric gates in high-dimensional Hilbert space.},

We introduce the Time-Rescaled Feedback-Based Quantum Algorithm (TR-FQA) and Time-Rescaled Feedback-Based Algorithm for Quantum Optimization (TR-FALQON), time-rescaled versions of FQA and FALQON, respectively. The method is applied to two representative problems: the MaxCut combinatorial optimization problem and ground-state preparation in the axial next-nearest neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model. The results show that TR-FALQON accelerates convergence toward the optimal solution in the circuit's early layers and outperforms the standard version in low-depth regimes. In the context of state preparation, TR-FQA requires fewer layers than the original algorithm. These findings suggest that time rescaling can reduce the number of layers needed to reach a high-quality solution, even if the exact ground state is not obtained.},

We then demonstrate that the entanglement of two SPP modes can serve as a useful resource for quantum communication of continuous-variable light signals over a long distance, mediated by concatenated swap operations. The teleportation fidelity of an unknown coherent state has strong robustness to loss and imperfect detection at relatively strong effective optical-microwave coupling.

Previous work [D. M. Long et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 128 , 183602 (2022) ] proposed that such a pump could be realized with a strongly driven superconducting qubit coupled to a cavity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy of energy scales and drive frequencies can be realized using a transmon qubit. We develop an experimental toolkit to realize the adiabatic driving field required for energy pumping using coordinated frequency modulation of the transmon and amplitude modulation of an applied resonant microwave drive. With this toolkit, we measure adiabatic evolution of the qubit under the applied field for times comparable to T 1 , which far exceed the bare qubit dephasing time. This result paves the way for direct experimental observation of topological energy pumping.},

In the original framework of evolution symmetrization, a DD sequence was shown to enforce a symmetry on the unwanted Hamiltonian, thereby suppressing it if the symmetry was inaccessible. In this work, we show how symmetries already present in the undesired Hamiltonian can be harnessed to reduce the complexity of decoupling sequences and to construct nested protocols that correct dominant errors at shorter timescales using the factorization of DD symmetry groups into a product of its subgroups. We provide many relevant examples in various spin systems, using the Majorana constellation and point-group factorization to identify and exploit symmetries in the interaction Hamiltonian. Our framework recovers tailored pulse sequences developed in the context of NMR, including the classical Lee-Goldburg protocol, and further produces novel short and robust sequences capable of suppressing on-site disorder, dipole-dipole interactions, and more exotic many-body interactions in spin ensembles.},

To address quantum steering detection in isotropic states, partially entangled states, and random states, we explore, respectively, the most tailored feature and classifier. Given that the SDP method provides only a sufficient condition for steerability detection, we establish the first rigorously constructed, accurately labeled dataset based on theoretical foundations. This dataset enables models to exhibit outstanding accuracy and generalization capabilities, independent of the choice of features. As applications, we investigate the steerability boundaries of isotropic states and partially entangled states, discover new steerable states, and determine their parameter ranges.

Within this framework, we introduce PAM witnesses that can distinguish stabilizer from nonstabilizer states, and we provide analytical proofs that threshold violations of these witnesses certify nonstabilizerness. In the simplest setting—three preparations, two measurements, and qubit systems—surpassing a specific threshold guarantees that at least one prepared state lies outside the stabilizer polytope, while a stronger violation can certify at least two. We extend this approach by linking it to quantum random access codes, also generalizing our results to qutrit systems and introducing a necessary condition for certifying nonstabilizerness based on state overlaps (Gram matrices).

To address these challenges, we present a scalable fault-tolerant method for preparing encoded k -uniform states and we illustrate our approach using surface and color codes. We first present a technique to determine k uniformity of stabilizer states directly from their stabilizer tableau. We then identify a family of Clifford circuits that ensures both fault tolerance and scalability in preparing these states. Building on the encoded k -uniform states, we introduce a hybrid physical-logical strategy that retains some of the error-protection benefits of logical qubits while lowering the overhead for implementing arbitrary gates compared to fully logical algorithms. We show that this hybrid approach can outperform fully physical implementations for resource-state preparation, as demonstrated by explicit constructions of k -uniform states.},

  abstract     = {Graph kernels are essential for learning the properties of graph data, a fundamental task in the analysis of such data. However, a major limitation of current graph kernel methods is their high computational cost, which becomes prohibitive when dealing with large-scale graphs. In order to address this bottleneck, we propose a quantum algorithm designed to analyze the intrinsic structural information within graph data through an efficient quantum kernel method. The core idea of our kernel method involves encoding pertinent information from graphs into quantum states, utilizing quantum kernel functions to represent the similarities among various graphs. This process is facilitated through the application of quantum walks and quantum signal processing techniques. Building upon this framework, we propose a quantum kernel ridge regression algorithm that consists of two key steps. First, we employ our quantum kernel method to prepare a quantum state, in which the amplitudes encode the kernel functions. Second, we implement quantum feature mapping in parallel to encode the corresponding kernel matrix into the quantum circuit. Crucially, we demonstrate that the computational complexity of our regression algorithm scales primarily as O ( M 3 / 2 ) with respect to the size of the graph set M . This suggests that our quantum kernel method could process graph data with resource requirements scaling approximately as O ( poly log ( N ) ) , where N denotes the number of nodes in the graph. Accordingly, this underscores the advantage of our approach over classical methods in the context of large-scale graph analysis. To validate our approach, we conduct numerical experiments on chemical molecular datasets, demonstrating the method's effectiveness and advantages. In summary, this work represents a significant advancement in quantum graph learning, enhancing its potential for analyzing large-scale graph data.},

While ideal quantum teleportation requires maximally entangled states as resources, real-world implementations inevitably face environmental noise and decoherence effects. In this work, we investigate quantum teleportation in nonequilibrium environments with different temperatures or chemical potentials. We employ the Bloch-Redfield equation to characterize the nonequilibrium dynamics in both bosonic and fermionic reservoirs. Our analysis reveals that nonequilibrium conditions, namely, the temperature difference and chemical potential difference, can significantly enhance the teleportation fidelity beyond what is achievable in equilibrium scenarios. Notably, under certain nonequilibrium conditions, the fidelities for all input states converge to the same value. We term this behavior the teleportation with a fixed-point fidelity. Importantly, at this fixed point, fidelity can be further enhanced by tuning the nonequilibrium parameters. These findings offer crucial insights for the implementation of quantum communication protocols in realistic environments, demonstrating that nonequilibrium conditions not only improve the fidelity but also present a promising avenue for simplifying practical quantum teleportation schemes.},

Rev. A 73 , 064302 (2006) ], we find that the threshold temperature of quantum entanglement decreases with increasing spin j and completely disappears in the limit j → ∞ . In the ground state of systems with highly symmetric interactions, the discord-type quantum correlations can exist even for arbitrarily large spin. Such correlations turn out to be unstable and are destroyed by small perturbations that violate the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The stable quantum correlations gradually degrade as the spin j grows and eventually vanish when the classical limit is reached.},

This represents the optimal (2-2-2) Bell nonlocality for this kind of systems. The work generalizes the well-known Horodeckis result for a qubit-qubit setup. We also give simple lower and upper bounds on that violation. We apply our general results to address a number of issues, namely, we obtain a bound on the degree of purity required in a system to exhibit nonlocality and study the statistics of nonlocality in random density matrices. In addition, we show the impossibility of improving the amount of CHSH violation by embedding the qudit in a Hilbert space of larger dimension. Finally, the general result is illustrated with a family of density matrices in the context of a qubit-qutrit system.},

In this paper, we present a general procedure for constructing error-correcting qudit codes through the irreducible representations of SU ( d ) for any odd integer d ≥ 3 . Using the Weyl character formula and inner product of characters, we deduce the relevant branching rules, through which we identify the physical Hilbert spaces that contain valid code spaces. We then discuss how two forms of permutation invariance and the Heisenberg-Weyl symmetry of su ( d ) can be exploited to simplify the construction of error-correcting codes. Finally, we use our procedure to construct an infinite class of error-correcting codes encoding a logical qudit into ( d − 1 ) 2 physical qudits.},

Moreover, the 6 s n g G 4 1 Rydberg state has strong dipole-dipole interaction due to small Förster defect with nearby Rydberg states and possesses long radiative lifetime. These can benefit quantum computing based on individually trapped neutral atoms and can enable long-lived Rydberg polaritons in atomic media, which brings fresh opportunities in all-optical quantum information.},

Here we consider directed acyclic graphs each of which contains both nodes representing observed variables as well as nodes representing latent or hidden variables. When comparing distinct causal structures, a natural question to ask is if they can explain distinct sets of observable distributions or not. Statisticians have developed a great variety of tools for resolving such questions under the assumption that latent nodes are interpreted classically. Here we highlight how the change to a quantum interpretation of the latent nodes induces distinctions between causal scenarios that would be classically indistinguishable. We especially concentrate on quantum scenarios containing latent nodes with at least one latent parent, a.k.a. possessing intermediate latents . This initial survey demonstrates that many such quantum processes can be operationally distinguished by considerations related to monogamy of nonlocality, especially when computationally aided by a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations which we tailor for the study of such scenarios. We conclude by clarifying the challenges that prevent the generalization of this work, calling attention to open problems regarding observational (in)equivalence of quantum causal structures with intermediate latents.},

Here we propose a wireless transfer scheme with parity-time symmetry to efficiently extract the energy stored in non-Hermitian QBs to consumption hubs. For linear cases, the transfer energy oscillates periodically in the unbroken symmetry region and grows hyperbolically in the broken region. For nonlinear cases, the transfer energy eventually reaches and remains steady-state values arising from the feedback mechanism of the nonlinear saturable gain. The non-Hermitian QBs with gains can persistently absorb energy and store it in batteries while transfering it to consumption hubs, thus exhibiting more considerable robustness in the large detuning regime and significant enhancement in the weak coupling regime than those in partial deep-strong coupling regime. Furthermore, we also introduce a classical simulator and demonstrate some counterintuitive advantages of the non-Hermitian QBs. Our work overcomes energy bottlenecks of wireless transfer schemes in QBs and may provide inspirations for practical applications of QBs.},

This assumption, however, is not always guaranteed in realistic scenarios and several theoretical approaches to characterize initially correlated dynamics have been introduced. For the uncorrelated scenario, stochastic unravelings are a powerful tool to simulate the dynamics. So far they have not been used in the most general case in which correlations are initially present since they cannot be applied to nonpositive operators or noncompletely positive maps. In our work, we employ the bath positive or one-sided positive decomposition (OPD) formalism as a starting point to generalize stochastic unraveling in the presence of initial correlations. Noticeably, our approach does not depend on the particular unraveling technique, but holds for both piecewise deterministic and diffusive unravelings. This generalization allows not only for more powerful simulations for the reduced dynamics, but also for a deeper theoretical understanding of open system dynamics.},

Combining fidelity and renormalization group, we identify the scaling behavior of the transverse magnetization that simultaneously exhibits quantum coherence and statistical properties. In addition, we adapt generalized correlation functions in quantum chemistry protocols to visualize the effective light cone of quantum mutual information, demonstrating the importance of the coherence propagation to DQPTs.

  abstract     = {The spontaneous switching of a quantum particle between the wells of a double-well potential is a phenomenon of general interest to physics and chemistry. It was broadly believed that the switching rate decreases steadily as a function of the size of the energy barrier. This view was challenged by a recent experiment on a driven superconducting Kerr nonlinear oscillator (often called the Kerr-cat qubit or the Kerr parametric oscillator ), whose energy barrier can be continuously increased by ramping up the drive. Remarkably, as the drive amplitude increases, the switching rate exhibits a steplike decrease termed the “staircase.” The view challenged by the experimental staircase demands a deep review of our understanding of the role of quantum effects in double wells. In this work, we use a Lindbladian model of dissipation to derive a semianalytical formula for the switching rate, resolving a continuous transition between tunneling-dominated dynamics and dissipation-dominated dynamics. These two dynamics are observed respectively in the flat part and the steep part of each step in the staircase. Our formula exposes two distinct dissipative processes that limit tunneling: the dephasing of interwell superpositions freezes tunneling via the quantum Zeno effect, and the decay from one excited state to another limits the time during which tunneling can be attempted. This physical understanding allows us to pinpoint the critical drive amplitude that separates the flat and steep part of each step using an equation involving the rates of the two dissipative processes and the tunnel splitting. In addition, analyzing the transition matrix elements in the formula shows that in the regime of a few ( ≲ 10 ) states in the well and under moderate to low temperatures, highly excited states are populated predominantly via cascaded and direct thermal heating rather than quantum heating. At very low temperatures, we find that the perturbation induced by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian part of the Lindbladian model becomes increasingly important and facilitates a form of quantum heating that has not been identified before. We numerically map the activation mechanism as a function of drive amplitude, damping rate, and temperature. Our theory deepens the understanding of switching dynamics between metastable quantum states, highlights the importance of a general interplay between tunneling and dissipation, and identifies a novel quantum regime in activated transitions.},

In this work, we advance in this direction, demonstrating that the IC is enough to ensure DI security on quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Security is proven for a range of theoretically quantum-attainable parameters against individual attacks by a potentially postquantum eavesdropper. This result follows as a consequence of a strong form of monogamy of Bell's inequality violations, which we prove to be implied by the recently proposed multipartite formulation for IC . Additionally, we demonstrate that the original bipartite formulation of IC fails to imply monogamy relations, and hence, ensure security of DIQKD, thus stressing the necessity of the multipartite framework.},

We also include cohesinlike factors that extrude chromatin loops that are important for the physiological folding of chromosomes. We find that transcription factor binding creates spatiotemporal patterning and a highly variable correlation time in transcriptional dynamics, which is linked to the cell-to-cell variation in gene expression. Loop extrusion also contributes to noise, as the stochastic nature of this process leads to different networks of cohesin loops in different cells in our model. Our results could be tested with single-cell experiments and provide a pathway to understanding the principles underlying transcriptional plasticity in vivo .},

Such activity may also result in motility-induced crystallization into clusters with an inner crystalline structure. We derive a higher-order active phase-field-crystal model and employ it to study the interplay of passive (i.e., thermodynamic) and active (i.e., motility-induced) condensation or evaporation and crystallization or melting. Stability and morphological phase diagrams indicate the various occurring phase coexistences and transitions, e.g., the destruction of passive clusters in the case of a density-independent effective velocity and the possible creation of active clusters in the case of a density-dependent effective velocity. Finally, simple and complex rotating crystallites are discussed, including states of time-periodic chirality.},

Through molecular dynamics simulations of physically cross-linked networks composed of semiflexible polymers, we identify a previously unexplored class of self-similar aging. The network undergoes ultraslow coarsening characterized by a logarithmically growing mesh size, which governs the spatial organization, cohesive and bending energies, and the aging dynamics of the system. This single time-dependent length scale defines an internal clock, giving rise to spatiotemporal self-similarity of both structure and dynamics—offering a perspective on aging in soft and disordered materials.},

By measuring the amplitude and phase of the optical field in a recirculating loop, we determine the spectral distribution of SGs at various propagation distances. We demonstrate that a SG, initially prepared as a soliton condensate with a Weyl distribution, undergoes significant changes in its spectral distribution due to dissipation. Specifically, weak gain leads to the emergence of a bichromatic SG, while weak damping results in a SG with a semicircular spectral distribution at long propagation distances. These observed dissipation-driven changes in the SG’s spectral characteristics are not explained by existing hydrodynamic or kinetic theories.},

Here, we argue that a change of the electronic mass exceeding 10% of its bare value may serve as such a definition. We propose a quantitative computational scheme for obtaining the electronic mass in relation to its bare vacuum value and show that coupling to surface polariton modes can induce such mass changes.

In particular, we discover a low-energy FE silicon film merely above its antiferroelectric (AFE) ground state. Both phases are confirmed to be dynamically and mechanically stable semiconductors with indirect band gaps of approximately 1.3 eV. Although the ground state exhibits AFE ordering, our simulations with the machine learning model remarkably reveal a robust FE hysteresis loop above room temperature, characterized by a low coercive field of about . An effective Hamiltonian model analysis indicates that this anomalous FE behavior arises from weak AFE coupling between the top and bottom surfaces of the silicon film.

Although it is well established that a pair of spinons can emerge from a magnon via deconfinement, controlled manipulation of individual spinons and direct observation of their deconfinement remain elusive. We propose an artificial gauge field scenario that enables the engineering of specific excited states in quantum spin models. This generates spatially localized individual spinons with high controllability. By applying time-dependent gauge fields, we realize adiabatic braiding of these spinons, as well as their dynamical evolution in a controllable manner. These results not only provide the first direct visualization of individual spinons localized in the bulk, but also point to new possibilities to simulate their confinement process. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our scenario in Rydberg atoms, which suggests an experimentally viable direction-gauge-field engineering of correlated phenomena in excited states.},

  abstract     = {Ta 2 NiSe 5 undergoes a phase transition characterized by the opening of an energy gap and a reduction in its crystal symmetry below T c = 326 K . The primary cause of this transition is debated to be either electron-hole correlations, in line with the excitonic insulator hypothesis, or structural instability. The chain structure of Ta 2 NiSe 5 enables effective control over its electronic and lattice properties by applying uniaxial strain. In this study, we utilize polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy to demonstrate that the electronic and structural order parameters respond differently to uniaxial pressure applied along the Ta-Ni chains. Compressive strain reduces monoclinic distortions while enhancing excitonic fluctuations. Such disparate behavior suggests that many-body effects may significantly amplify exciton fluctuations even when monoclinic distortions are minimized, thereby supporting the excitonic nature of the phase transition.},

  abstract     = {Rhombohedral graphene (RG) has emerged as a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, such as quantum magnetism, unconventional superconductivity, and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects. Despite its potential, atomic-scale investigations of RG remain limited, hindering a detailed microscopic understanding of the origins of these correlated states. In this Letter, we employ scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy to probe the intrinsic electronic states in trilayer and tetralayer RG. We identify a correlated insulating state with a gap up to 19 meV at the charge neutrality point in tetralayer RG, which is absent in the trilayer RG and Bernal stacking tetralayer. This gap is suppressed by applying a perpendicular magnetic field or doping the charge carrier density and does not exhibit intervalley coherence patterns. We attribute this phenomenon to a symmetry-broken layer antiferromagnetic state, characterized by ferrimagnetic ordering in the outermost layers and antiferromagnetic coupling between them. To further investigate this magnetic correlated state, we conduct local scattering experiments. Within the correlated regime, a threefold symmetric pattern emerges around a possible nonmagnetic impurity, suggesting that nonmagnetic doping may induce a spin texture in the ferrimagnetic surface layers. Outside the correlated regime, Friedel oscillations are observed, allowing precise determination of the band dispersion in tetralayer RG. These findings provide atomic-scale evidences of zero-field correlations in RG and may be extended to study other exotic phases in RG.},

However, experimental studies have produced inconsistent and even contradictory conclusions regarding the vdW transparency of 2D materials. Here, we employ colloidal atomic force microscopy with a geometrically well-defined probe to measure pull-off and pull-in forces in a model system: graphene on silicon dioxide ( SiO 2 ). Our results reveal that the total vdW force deviates significantly from the naive sum of contributions from graphene and its substrate. Intriguingly, the measured pull-off forces indicate that the effective surface energy of a suspended graphene monolayer can exceed that of its substrate-supported counterpart. Furthermore, our measurements of pull-in forces in substrate-supported systems suggest that graphene of 1–5 layers screens 15%–50% of the intrinsic solid-solid vdW interaction, consistent with Lifshitz theory calculations.},

The in situ characterization confirms key aspects of the dealloying mechanism based on macroscopic characterizations and simulations, including dissolution by repeated step flow and vacancy-cluster nucleation as well as ligament and pore bifurcation. It also separates the step flow kinetics from that of VPD, revealing that a bond energy difference between the alloy constituents can determine the dealloying kinetics and affect the morphology.

This type of frustrated frustration manifests as a beating pattern of the dc resistance, with state configurations at the resistance dips gradually changing between the conventional zero- and half-flux states.

However, the significant dispersion of low-energy electron pulses during transport poses a critical challenge to achieving high temporal resolution in time-resolved experiments. In this Letter, we present an at-the-source compression method for low-energy electron pulses using terahertz surface waves on a micrometer-sized tip cathode. Simultaneous electron acceleration and compression have been achieved directly at the emitter surface within a few tens of micrometers. A low-energy (1.5 keV) electron beam with near femtocoulomb charge is temporally compressed by a factor of 3.5, producing 74-femtosecond (FWHM) electron bunches. The quality of the compressed electron bunches is validated through high-quality diffraction patterns of few-layer graphene and projection imaging of a copper mesh. Furthermore, the compressed electrons are applied to investigate the transient electric field propagation generated by photoexcited charged particles on metal surfaces, demonstrating the enhanced temporal resolution. This advancement presents the most compact solution for an electron gun that integrates electron generation, acceleration, and compression into a unified system, paving the way for investigating surface dynamics and complex material phenomena with unprecedented precision.},

To address this challenge, we propose a high-efficiency plasma-based compressor utilizing highly ionized noble gas plasma. Exploiting strong refractive index dispersion near ionic resonances, this scheme achieves over 70% transmission efficiency around 5.2 nm and is extendable to other highly charged ions for operation across the soft x-ray to vacuum ultraviolet range. Simulations demonstrate that a 25 fs FEL pulse can be compressed to 1.4 fs with peak power boosted to over 100 GW, while maintaining high-energy throughput.

  abstract     = {When a drop contacts and absorbs in a thin porous surface, it can wick radially outward. This phenomenon is exploited in cooling textiles, but also complicates forensic stain analysis. The distance that the liquid spreads and the time it takes to evaporate are coupled, yet the consequence of this coupling on the wicking dynamics is not well understood. Here we measure and model how evaporation can reverse the direction of the liquid front so that the wetted patch shrinks after reaching a maximum diameter. We show that both this maximum diameter and the time to fully evaporate can be predicted with a single dimensionless parameter based on the substrate and liquid properties. Yet regardless of the system properties, we uncover a universal dynamic in which drops expand for approximately 1 / 4 of their lifetime and shrink for the rest. Counterintuitively, we find that neither the evaporative cooling nor the stain area scales linearly with the initial droplet volume.},

  abstract     = {We present an experimental study of the flow regime and vortex structure in bulk polymeric turbulence through three-dimensional velocity measurements with unprecedented high spatial resolution. We demonstrate that, as the polymer concentration increases, the effect of polymers on the fluid energy dissipation rate can be categorized into two distinct regimes: the dissipation reduction regime and the maximum dissipation reduction (MDR) regime, and in the latter the effect of the polymers saturates. We reveal that the MDR regime occurs when the scale range affected by the polymer additives extends up to the integral length scale, rather than the generally accepted Lumley scale. This finding enables us to map out the phase diagram of the flow regimes of polymeric turbulence on the Reynolds number and Weissenberg number. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the MDR regime, sheetlike vortex and strain structures dominate, which is traced to the fact that polymer stress stabilizes shear layers and reduces perturbation to shear instability. These results suggest that the MDR regime is a universal flow state in bulk polymeric turbulence and is the counterpart of the maximum drag reduction regime in wall-bounded flows. Our findings emphasize the significance of sheetlike vortex structures and offer new insights into predicting the critical conditions for the emergence of various flow regimes in viscoelastic fluids.},

Scanning dual-NV magnetometry is first demonstrated by simultaneously imaging multiple field projections of a ferrimagnetic racetrack device. Then, we record the two-point covariance of spatially correlated field fluctuations across a current-carrying wire.

Here, we investigate the probability of generating strongly correlated photons in a chain of N qubits coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. We found that disorder in the transition frequencies can induce photon antibunching and especially nearly perfect photon blockade events in the transmission and reflection outputs. As a comparison, in ordered chains, strongly correlated photons cannot be generated in the transmission output, and only weakly antibunched photons are found in the reflection output. The occurrence of nearly perfect photon blockade events stems from the disorder-induced nearly completely destructive interference of photon scattering paths. Our Letter highlights the impact of disorder on photon correlation generation and suggests that disorder can enhance the potential for achieving strongly correlated photons.},

By carefully tuning the phase and amplitude of the intracavity field, we achieve a π -phase shift between two dipole states, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio.

In practical implementations, it is important to achieve this manipulation with high speeds, low loss, and low noise. In this Letter, we propose the use of terahertz electric fields as a pump source for electro-optic modulation of single photons in bulk media. We demonstrate spectral modulations of single photons in the form of frequency translation and bandwidth manipulations as the terahertz field imparts linear and quadratic phases on the photons at various time delays within 1 ps. Our results show frequency translations exceeding 500 GHz at multi-THz modulation speeds and loss levels of ≈ 1 dB , complementing the current state-of-the-art electro-optic modulation techniques limited to speeds up to 100 GHz. The proposed approach leverages recent developments in terahertz generation techniques, introducing new avenues to manipulate nonclassical light in an unexplored regime for quantum photonics.},

We demonstrate that for a coherent laser drive, either unsqueezed or squeezed in a frequency-independent manner, optomechanical entanglement is destroyed after a threshold that depends only on the environmental noises—independent of the coherent coupling between the oscillator and the optical field, or the squeeze factor. In this way, we have found a universal entangling-disentangling transition.

At large light intensity, the low-energy dynamics is restricted to the dark state, leading to an effective continuum model with a Landau-level-like structure. This structure is dramatically different from that of usual topological optical lattices, which lead to discrete models in the tight-binding limit. For well-chosen atomic species, the proposed system is essentially immune to heating due to photon scattering, making it a highly promising way to emulate the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect.},

Our calculations predict the formation of self-bound quantum droplets at interaction strengths lower than previous estimates for molecular condensates. Strikingly, we observe that, for stronger interactions, the oblate quantum droplet transitions to a two-dimensional sheet or superfluid membrane with a thickness of a single molecule. As interactions are increased further the system continually loses superfluidity while correlations develop, and is eventually found to undergo a transition to a crystalline monolayer that remains self-bound without external confinement. The spontaneous formation of such two-dimensional phases from a three-dimensional quantum gas is traced back to the peculiar anisotropic form of the dipole-dipole interaction generated by microwave dressing of rotational molecular states. For sufficiently large particle numbers, crystallization takes place for comparably low interaction strengths that do not promote two-body bound states and should thus be observable in ongoing experiments without limitations from three-body recombination.},

We report here precision mass measurements at around Mo 84 that conclude the issue regarding the possibility of the cycle. The experiment was conducted using the multireflection time-of-flight spectrograph at RIKEN Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory, and the masses of Y 79 , Nb 83 , Mo 84 , Ru 88 , and an isomer in Y 78 were measured. For Mo 84 , Ru 88 , and the isomeric state of Y 78 , their masses were experimentally determined for the first time with uncertainties of δ m ≈ 20 keV / c 2 . The mass precisions of Y 79 and Nb 83 were improved to 13 and 9.6 keV / c 2 , respectively. The new α -separation energy of Mo 84 , 1.434(83) MeV, unambiguously rules out the possibility of forming the ZrNb cycle. The x-ray burst simulation with the new masses shows that our measurements effectively remove the large final abundance uncertainties in the A = 80 – 90 mass region.

The observation of sequential neutron emission is used to extract the relative population of the i 13 / 2 state, which was found to be much smaller than the predictions of the statistical model. The experiment was possible because of the innovative use of a neutron array with neutron discrimination and interaction tracking capabilities. This is the first study of the details of the two-neutron emission for a nucleus, which belongs to the r -process path. Understanding β -delayed two-neutron emission probabilities is essential to validate models used in astrophysical r -process nucleosynthesis calculations. Observing two-neutron emissions in β − decay paves the way for new experiments to study energy and angular correlations for β -delayed multineutron emitters.},

  abstract     = {Nucleon structure functions, as measured in lepton-nucleon scattering, have historically provided a critical observable in the study of partonic dynamics within the nucleon. However, at very large parton momenta, it is both experimentally and theoretically challenging to extract parton distributions due to the probable onset of nonperturbative contributions and the unavailability of high-precision data at critical kinematics. Extraction of the neutron structure and the d quark distribution have been further challenging because of the necessity of applying nuclear corrections when utilizing scattering data from a deuteron target to extract the free neutron structure. However, a program of experiments has been carried out recently at the energy-upgraded Jefferson Lab electron accelerator aimed at significantly reducing the nuclear correction uncertainties on the d quark distribution function at large partonic momentum. This allows leveraging the vast body of deuterium data covering a large kinematic range to be utilized for d quark parton distribution function extraction. In this Letter, we present new data from experiment E12-10-002, carried out in Jefferson Lab Experimental Hall C, on the deuteron to proton cross section ratio at large Bjorken x . These results significantly improve the precision of existing data and provide a first look at the expected impact on quark distributions extracted from parton distribution function fits.},

  abstract     = {Using data samples with a total integrated luminosity of collected by the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII collider, the differential cross sections of inclusive and production, as a function of the momentum and normalized by the total hadronic cross section, are measured at center-of-mass energies from 2.000 to 3.671 GeV. The measured cross sections are consistent with the previously reported cross sections by BESIII, while the cross sections are systematically higher than the cross sections by a factor of approximately 1.4. These new results are in agreement with state-of-the-art QCD analyses at next-to-next-to-leading-order accuracy, particularly in the large hadron momentum region at energy scales down to 3 GeV. These findings support the validity of isospin symmetry in parton fragmentation processes.},

  abstract     = {A search for an invisible particle, with a mass between 0 and , is performed in the process using events collected with the BESIII detector from 2017 to 2019. The meson is fully reconstructed and an efficient veto of photons and neutral and charged hadrons up to twice the mass is applied to the rest of the event and the recoil mass against the is obtained precisely from the kinematic constraint in the event. No significant signal over the expected background is observed in the investigated region and the upper limit on the inclusive branch fraction of is determined to be at 90% confidence level. Upper limits at a 90% confidence level are also given for this branch fraction as a function of the invisible particle mass, varying from to over the investigated mass range. Additionally, a 90% confidence level upper limit on the branch fraction of is determined to , which improves the previous best results by more than 4 times. The analysis technique in this Letter offers a clean window to search for sub-GeV invisible particles, which can be adapted for other decays and direct annihilation experiments in future studies, and improve the sensitivity by orders of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {A search for the rare decay is reported using proton-proton collision events at collected by the CMS detector in 2022–2023, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of . This is the first analysis to use a newly developed inclusive dimuon trigger, expanding the scope of the CMS flavor physics program. The search uses mesons obtained from decays. No significant excess is observed. A limit on the branching fraction of at 95% confidence level is set. This is the most stringent upper limit set on any flavor changing neutral current decay in the charm sector.},

  abstract     = {The T2K Collaboration presents the first measurement of electron neutrino-induced charged-current pion production on a predominantly carbon target in a restricted kinematical phase space. This is performed using data from the 2.5° off-axis near detector, ND280. The differential cross sections with respect to the outgoing electron and pion kinematics, in addition to the total flux-integrated cross section, are obtained. Comparisons between the measured and predicted cross-section results using the n eut, g enie, and n u w ro Monte Carlo event generators are presented. The measured total flux-integrated cross section is [ 2.52 ± 0.52 ( stat ) ± 0.30 ( syst ) ] × 10 − 39 cm 2 nucleon − 1 , which is lower than the event generator predictions.},

The analysis uses a data sample recorded at the center-of-mass energy of the resonance. One of the mesons produced in the process is fully reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode, while its companion meson is required to decay into a and two leptons of opposite charge. The leptons are reconstructed in final states with a single electron, muon, charged pion or charged meson, and additional neutrinos. We set an upper limit on the branching fraction of at the 90% confidence level, which is the most stringent constraint reported to date.},

  abstract     = {One of the important open problems in quantum black hole physics is a dual interpretation of holographic complexity proposals. To date the only quantitative match is the equality between the Krylov spread complexity in the triple-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and the complexity volume proposal in classical Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Our Letter utilizes the recent connection between the double-scaled SYK model and sine dilaton gravity to show that the quantitative relation between Krylov spread complexity and complexity volume extends to finite temperatures and to full quantum regime on the gravity side at disk level. Furthermore, we isolate the first quantum correction to the complexity volume proposal and propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. The key lesson from our Letter is that gravity demands to assign complexity also to Euclidean state preparation.},

  abstract     = {It is shown that both standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the nonrelativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective. A brief discussion on current exclusion (for the first time) of very long axion-cloud lifetimes, through comparison of our results with current LIGO data, as well as potential detection of such effects in future interferometers is also given.},

  abstract     = {We study the dynamical response of viscous materials to gravitational waves, in the context of a fully relativistic theory of fluid dynamics. For the first time, we calculate oscillation modes and scattering properties of viscous stars. Viscous stars absorb high-frequency radiation, following a dispersion relation introduced by Press. In the extremely large viscosity regime, stars would become reflectors of waves, but this regime appears to be forbidden by causality bounds. In the context of black hole mimickers, we show how maximally viscous stars on the threshold of stability mimic the absorption of a black hole with the same mass. Our results suggest that rotating viscous stars will amplify incoming radiation.},

  abstract     = {In electromagnetism, linearized general relativity, and other contexts, previous work has shown that the laws of motion which govern compact, self-interacting bodies can be obtained by applying “Detweiler-Whiting prescriptions” to the laws of motion that govern test bodies. These prescriptions replace any field that appears in a test-body law of motion with a certain effective field which is a quasilocal functional of the physical variables—a functional that can be interpreted as a regularization procedure in a point-particle limit. We generalize these results, presenting a formalism that allows Detweiler-Whiting prescriptions to be be directly derived for extended bodies, even in nonlinear field theories. If a generating functional with particular properties can be constructed, we find effective linear and angular momenta which evolve via Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations involving appropriate effective fields. These equations implicitly incorporate all self-force, self-torque, and extended-body effects. Although our main focus is on bodies coupled to nonlinear scalar fields, we also remark on the gravitational case.},

Although generation of multipartite entanglement within a small set of individual qubits has been demonstrated, further scale-up in system size requires the connection of smaller entangled states into a larger state in a scalable and modular manner. Here, we achieve this goal by implementing memory-enhanced fusion of two multipartite entangled states via photonic interconnects. Through asynchronous preparation of two tripartite -state entanglements in two spatially separated modules of atomic quantum memories and on-demand fusion via single-photon interference, we demonstrate the creation of a four-partite -state entanglement shared by two remote quantum memory modules in a heralded way. We also demonstrate memory-enhanced scaling in efficiencies in the entanglement fusion. The demonstrated scalable generation and fusion of multipartite entangled states pave the way toward realization of large-scale distributed quantum information processing in the future.},

In this Letter, we report an experimental demonstration of this protocol using high-fidelity polarization-entangled photon pairs in a star topology. For a three-user network, we obtain secure key rates of 21.18, 4.69, and 1.71 kbps under single-user channel losses of 7.6, 10.9, and 12.9 dB respectively. Furthermore, under conditions of equal channel loss per user, we achieve secure key rates of 6.97, 6.46, and 5.88 kbps for three-, four-, and five-user scenarios respectively. These results demonstrate the advantageous independence of the key rate from the number of users. Our Letter paves the way for large-scale deployment of SI QSS in multiuser quantum networks.},

  abstract     = {The Hadamard test is one of the pillars on which quantum algorithm development rests and, at the same time, is naturally suited for the intermediate regime between the current era of noisy quantum devices and complete fault tolerance. Its applications use measurements of the auxiliary qubit to extract information but disregard the system register completely. Concomitantly, but independently of this development, advances in quantum learning theory have enabled the efficient representation of quantum states via classical shadows. This Letter shows that, strikingly, putting both lines of thought into a new context results in substantial improvements to the Hadamard test on a single auxiliary readout qubit, by suitably exploiting classical shadows on the remaining n -qubit work register. We argue that this combination inherits the best of both worlds and discuss statistical phase estimation as a vignette application. At the same time, the framework is more general and applicable to a wide range of other algorithms. There, we can use the Hadamard test to estimate energies on the auxiliary qubit, while classical shadows on the system register provide access to additional features such as (i) the fidelity of the initial state with certain pure quantum states, (ii) the initial state’s energy, and (iii) how pure and how close the initial state is to an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Finally, we also discuss how anticontrolled unitaries can further augment this framework and explain how this Letter settles the exploitation of the Hadamard test for intermediate applications.},

Leveraging the sum-over-paths formalism, we obtain a classical algorithm for estimating quantum transition amplitudes, the complexity of which scales with path coherence. As path coherence relates to the hardness of classical estimation of quantum transition amplitudes, it provides a new perspective on the role of coherence in quantum computational advantage. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have practical applications for simulating large classes of quantum computations with classical computers.},

Its complexity class is harder than that of finding the ground state of a k -local Hamiltonian. Very few methods can efficiently count the degeneracy of ground state while many are known for finding the ground state. This Letter proposes an algorithm for mapping the problem of counting ground state degeneracy into one for finding a special ground state of a k -local super Hamiltonian in an enlarged system with twice as many qubits or spins. We show that all traditional methods, designed for finding the ground state by evolution under a function of a Hamiltonian, can be employed to find the special ground state of the super Hamiltonian from a well-designed initial state and thus can be used to count the ground degeneracy. We combine our algorithm with the power method, the Lanczos method, and the quantum imaginary time evolution method for selective examples to illustrate the detection of phase boundaries, competition between frustration and quantum fluctuation, and potential implementation with quantum circuits.},

Crucially, this acceleration persists even when the slowest decaying Lindbladian modes form complex-conjugate pairs. Unlike previous approaches, which typically target a single mode, our protocol may suppress multiple relaxation modes simultaneously.

  abstract     = {Beginning with high- T c cuprate materials, it has been observed that many superconductors exhibit so-called “Homes scaling,” in which the zero-temperature superfluid density ρ s 0 is proportional to the product of the normal-state dc conductivity and the superconducting transition temperature σ dc T c . For conventional, s -wave superconductors, such scaling has been shown to be a natural consequence of elastic-scattering disorder, not only in the extreme dirty limit, but across a broad range of scattering parameters. Here we show that when an analogous calculation is carried out for elastic scattering in d -wave superconductors, a stark contrast emerges, with ρ s 0 ∝ ( σ dc T c ) 2 in the dirty limit, in apparent violation of Homes scaling. Within a simple approximate Migdal-Eliashberg treatment of inelastic scattering, we show how the observed Homes scaling is recovered. The normal-state behavior of near-optimally-doped cuprates is dominated by inelastic scattering, but significant deviations from Homes scaling occur for disorder-dominated cuprate systems, such as underdoped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.333 and overdoped La 2 − x Sr x CuO 4 , and in very clean materials with little inelastic scattering, such as Sr 2 RuO 4 . We present a revised analysis where both axes of the original Homes scaling plot are normalized by the Drude plasma weight ω p , D 2 and show that a new universal scaling emerges, in which the superfluid fractions of dirty s -wave and dirty d -wave superconductors coalesce to a single point at which normal-state scattering is occurring at the Planckian bound. The combined result is a new tool for classifying superconductors in terms of order parameter symmetry, as well as scattering strength and character. Although our model starts from a Fermi-liquid assumption, it describes underdoped cuprates surprisingly well.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of a new, reaction channel in deuteron-deuteron (DD) fusion at very low energies might have major implications for understanding primordial and stellar nucleosynthesis, where electron-positron reaction channels are typically not considered. It could also enable research on metal hydride fusion, potentially paving the way for the design and construction of next-generation fusion energy sources. Following the first experimental indications of electron emission, we present here an extensive experimental study confirming emission of high-energy electrons from DD reaction at very low energy. A simultaneous use of Si charged particle detectors of different thicknesses and large-volume NaI(Tl) and HPGe detectors has allowed the determination of the branching ratios between emitted protons, neutrons, and pairs for deuteron energies down to 5 keV. The high-energy positrons could be unambiguously detected by their bremsstrahlung spectra and annihilation radiation, supported by the g eant4 Monte Carlo simulations. The theoretical calculations, based on a destructive interference between the threshold resonance and the known broad resonance in , agree very well with experimentally observed increase of branching ratios for lowering projectile energies. The partial width of the threshold resonance for the internal pair creation should be at least 10 times larger than that of the proton channel.},

  abstract     = {The ability to distribute heralded entanglement between distant matter nodes is a primitive for the implementation of large-scale quantum networks. Some of the most crucial requirements for future applications include high heralding rates at telecom wavelengths, multiplexed operation, and on-demand retrieval of stored excitations for synchronization of separate quantum links. Despite tremendous progress in various physical systems, the demonstration of telecom-heralded entanglement between quantum nodes featuring both multiplexed operation and on-demand retrieval remains elusive. In this work, we combine narrow band parametric photon-pair sources and solid-state quantum memories based on rare-earth doped crystals to demonstrate telecom-heralded entanglement between spatially separated spin-wave quantum memories with fully adjustable recall time and temporal multiplexing of 15 modes. In a first experiment, the storage in the spin state is conditioned on the entanglement heralding. We take advantage of the control over readout pulse phase to achieve feedforward conditional phase shifts on the stored photons depending on which heralding detector clicked. We exploit this effect to double the entanglement heralding rate for a given quantum state up to 510 counts / s , with an associated detection rate of 0.32 counts / s and measured positive concurrence by up to 6 standard deviations. In a second experiment, we simulate the communication time of a long-distance link by implementing an unconditional storage scheme with a dead time of 100 μ s . We take advantage of temporal multiplexing to increase the entanglement rates by a factor of 15 with respect to single mode storage, reaching a value of 22 counts / s per heralding detector. These results establish our architecture as a prime candidate for the implementation of scalable high-rate quantum network links.},

  abstract     = {Electrons trapped on the surface of cryogenic substrates (liquid helium, solid neon, or hydrogen) are an emerging platform for quantum information processing made attractive by the inherent purity of the electron environment, the scalability of trapping devices, and the predicted long lifetime of electron spin states. Here we demonstrate the spatial control and detection of single electrons above the surface of liquid helium at temperatures above 1 K. A superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator is used to read out the charge state of an electron trap defined by gate electrodes beneath the helium surface. Dispersive frequency shifts are observed as the trap is loaded with electrons, from several tens down to single electrons. These frequency shifts are in good agreement with our theoretical model that treats each electron as a classical oscillator coupled to the cavity field. This sensitive charge readout scheme can aid efforts to develop large-scale quantum processors that require the high cooling powers available in cryostats operating above 1 K.},

  abstract     = {Probabilistic computing with p-bits is emerging as a computational paradigm for machine learning and for facing combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with the so-called probabilistic Ising machines (PIMs). From a hardware point of view, the key elements that characterize a PIM are the random number generation, the nonlinearity, the network of coupled probabilistic bits, and the energy-minimization algorithm. Regarding the energy-minimization algorithm in this work we show that PIMs using the simulated quantum annealing (SQA) schedule exhibit better performance as compared to simulated annealing and parallel tempering in solving a number of COPs, such as maximum satisfiability problems, the planted Ising problem, and the traveling salesman problem. Additionally, we design and simulate the architecture of a fully connected CMOS-based PIM that is able to run the SQA algorithm having a spin-update time of 8 ns with a power consumption of 0.22 mW. Our results also show that SQA increases the reliability and the scalability of PIMs by compensating for device variability at an algorithmic level enabling the development of their implementation combining CMOS with different technologies such as spintronics. This work shows that the characteristics of the SQA are hardware agnostic and can be applied in the codesign of any hybrid analog-digital Ising machine implementation. Our results open a promising direction for the implementation of a new generation of reliable and scalable PIMs.},

  abstract = {Internal conversion is a vital vibronic loss mechanism that competes with all other photophysical mechanisms, and a plethora of information on the subject is available in the literature. However, these data are often difficult to penetrate owing to their complexity. In addition, owing to the sheer number of methods, it is often difficult to understand which method is better for certain systems. This comprehensive review on the state of the art explores the history of internal conversion and provides context to its evolution up to modern quantum chemistry. The most prevalent methods used to study atomic systems, as well as where they rise and they fall, are highlighted. Each method and the corresponding results are noted in a simplified manner, and information is threaded together to elucidate how everything is related. This tapestry illustrating the ups and downs of internal conversion will aid researchers in their study of new and innovative materials and provides a vital comparison of methods not easily gained.},

  abstract = {In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, like our Sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton ( )-chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. The relevant reactions of solar and stellar hydrogen burning are reviewed here from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, general recommendations are also formed.},
