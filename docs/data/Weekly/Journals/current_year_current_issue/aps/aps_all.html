  abstract     = {While the special properties of exceptional points (EPs) may improve application relevant features such as hypersensing, often their realization requires a precise fine-tuning of parameters. Here we report the robust formation of EP chains in coupled optical microcavities over intercavity distances on the order of the cavity size. We find that coupling, or more generally, the availability of an outer (coupling) channel, is sufficient to induce EPs in the parameter space spanned by the refractive index along with . This occurs even at of several wavelengths, yielding a network of EPs in parameter space with a periodicity of the order of the wavelength in the direction. Upon the increase of , we observe a sharp transition in the sign of the chirality measured in one of the cavities that further structures the system properties. While the details of the Riemannian surfaces associated with the formation of exceptional points are mode dependent and allow for a variety of single-cavity chiralities, we find the underlying mechanism to be universal, robust, applicable to other and more general coupled systems, and promising for potential applications such as optical measurements of pressure, voltages, or distances.},

By imposing a local particle sink with strong loss, we induce a convergent radial flow with a spatially bounded supersonic region, forming an acoustic analog of a black-hole horizon and an inner horizon around the sink. The observed superflow appears to be modulated by quasiperiodic bursts of superluminal signals. We measure their frequencies and find agreement with numerical simulations of the frequencies of ring soliton oscillations within the black-hole horizon. The solitons seen in the simulations are emitted from the region between the two horizons in a process that we attribute to the Landau instability. The presented experiment demonstrates a new method for creating supersonic flows in atomic superfluids, which may find applications in quantum simulations of curved spacetime, supersonic turbulence, and self-oscillating dynamics in dissipative many-body systems.},

We characterize an intrinsic comagnetometer that is available in crystals, which can be used to suppress spurious magnetic-field effects through comparing sets of ions related by spatial reflection symmetry.

Instead of exhibiting energy-conserving persistent coherent motion, the dynamics of such open systems feature, in most cases, a steady state, which is approached in the long-time limit from all initial conditions. This can, in fact, be advantageous as it offers a mechanism for the creation of robust quantum correlations on demand without the need for fine-tuning. Here, we show this for a system consisting of two coherently coupled bosonic modes, which is a paradigmatic scenario for the realization of quantum resources such as squeezed entangled states. Rather counterintuitively, the mere addition of incoherent hopping, which results in a statistical coupling between the bosonic modes, leads to steady states with robust quantum entanglement and enables the emergence of persistent coherent nonstationary behavior.},

We perform an exhaustive search for triangle-local models, and from it we infer analytic expressions for the boundaries of the set of distributions that admit such models, which we conjecture to be all the tight Bell inequalities for the scenario.

This approach allows us to accurately estimate assemblages without assuming uniform detection efficiency on the untrusted party's side. Using an evidence-based framework grounded in the Akaike information criterion, we demonstrate faithful reconstructions while balancing model complexity.

Under this scenario, we investigate the task of frequency estimation in the presence of a non-Markovian environment. We design a control strategy and prove that it outperforms any control-free strategies, recovering the optimal Heisenberg limit up to a small error term that is intrinsic to this model. We further demonstrate the advantage of our control strategy via experiments on a nuclear magnetic resonance platform.

In the quantum regime, current approaches to smoothing either give unphysical outcomes, due to the noncommutativity of the measurements at different times, or require assumptions about how the environment is measuring the system, which with current technology is unverifiable. We propose a novel definition of the smoothed quantum state based on quantum Bayesian retrodiction, which mirrors the classical retrodictive approach to smoothing. This approach always yields physical results and does not require any assumption on the environment. We show that this smoothed state has, on average, greater purity than the state reconstructed using just the prior information. Finally, we make a connection with the smoothing theory of Guevara and Wiseman in a well-studied regime, and describe from a purely quantum perspective how it conditions on the posterior information.},

The principle asserts the sufficiency of local measurements for achieving a tomographic characterization of any bipartite state. In this work, we explore the meaning of the principle of tomographic locality by developing a simple scheme for generating a wide variety of theories that violate the principle. In this scheme, one starts with a tomographically local theory—which can be classical, quantum, or postquantum—and a physical symmetry, and one restricts the processes in the theory to all and only those that are covariant with respect to the collective action of that symmetry. We refer to the resulting theories as twirled worlds . We show that failures of tomographic locality are ubiquitous in twirled worlds. From the possibility of such failures in classical twirled worlds, we argue that the failure of tomographic locality (i.e., tomographic non locality) does not imply ontological holism. Our results also demonstrate the need for researchers seeking to axiomatize quantum theory to take a stand on the question of whether there are superselection rules that have a fundamental status.},

  abstract     = {Quantum optics routinely uses beam splitters to generate entanglement, including in pioneering experiments conducted by Hanbury-Brown and Twiss and Hong, Ou, and Mandel. The quantum interference at beam splitters lies at the heart of what makes boson sampling hard to emulate by classical computers and is a vital component of quantum computation with light. Yet, despite overwhelming positive evidence, the conjecture that beam splitters with equal reflection and transmission probabilities generate the most entanglement for any state interfered with the vacuum has remained unproven for almost two decades [Asbóth et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 , 173602 (2005) ]. We prove this conjecture for ubiquitous entanglement monotones including mixed-state generalizations of entanglement entropy and purity by uncovering monotonicity and convexity with respect to photon loss for these monotones. At the same time, we highlight an infinite class of lesser-used monotones for which the conjecture fails. Because beam splitters are so fundamental, our results yield numerous corollaries for quantum optics, including proof of a recent conjecture for the evolution of a measure of quantumness through loss and a more efficient computational strategy for optimizing entanglement generation over linear optics. These results justify the value of seeking mathematical rigor behind commonly accepted facts and the danger of trusting them unconditionally.},

In a linear dielectric medium with refractive index n , the momentum is predicted to be smaller by a factor of n according to Abraham and larger by the same factor according to Minkowski. By studying the coupled dynamics of electromagnetic waves and dipoles in a dielectric medium, we show that the change in momentum of the dipole, expressed by the Lorentz force, corresponds to the Abraham momentum and is given by the expectation value of the spin-projected momentum vector. On the other hand, the Minkowski momentum is obtained as the magnitude of the spin-projected momentum vector from the energy-momentum dispersion relation derived by diagonalizing the coupled Hamiltonian and determines the direction of refraction in accordance with Snell's law. Our model also predicts a zitterbewegung -like oscillation due to helicity mixing between left- and right-handed wave components, mediated by dipole oscillation. These internal wave dynamics may be observable via wave-packet motion or polarization-sensitive measurements.},

We find that for relatively large free-space decay rates, the population dynamics of each qubit features Rabi oscillations, while for smaller decay rates it exhibits a complex behavior, which nevertheless can be understood by semianalytical expressions using the sub- and superradiant states of the system. Additionally, we observe phenomena, such as population and entanglement trapping, induced by the strong interaction of the qubits with the graphene nanodisk, with trapping values depending solely on the initial conditions of the two qubits.

  abstract     = {Systems in contact with an environment provide a ubiquitous challenge in quantum dynamics. Many fascinating phenomena can arise if the coupling is strong, leading to non-Markovian dynamics of the system, or collective, where the environment can become highly excited. We introduce a significant improvement of the hierarchy of pure states (HOPS) approach, which is able to efficiently deal with such highly excited, non-Markovian environments in a nearly unitary way. As our method relies on quantum trajectories, we can obtain dynamics efficiently, also for large system sizes, by (1) avoiding the quadratic scaling of a density matrix and (2) exploiting the localization properties of the trajectories with an adaptive basis. We provide the derivation of the nuHOPS (nearly unitary hierarchy of pure states) method, compare it to the original HOPS, and discuss numerical subtleties based on an illustrative dephasing model. Finally, we show its true power using the Dicke model as the paradigmatic example of many emitters decaying superradiantly inside a cavity. We reach numerically exact solutions for up to 1000 emitters. We apply our method to study emerging higher-order correlations in the emitter system or the cavity mode environment and their scaling with the number of emitters.},

In our model, the pump and probe fields coherently drive the first mirror, whereas the second mirror has mechanical oscillation due to the radiation pressure. We show that the right- and left-circular polarization components of the Gaussian probe field striking at an arbitrary incident angle become spatially separate along a direction orthogonal to the plane of incidence. Photonic SHE can be coherently controlled by adjusting the optomechanical interaction, cavity field, and G-mode phonon coupling, as well as G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction. The findings of photonic SHE are equally valid for standard optomechanical systems in the absence of cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and electronic state interaction. The cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling broadened the detuning range of the probe field to observe the dominant photonic SHE. Adding G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction generates enhanced photonic SHE at three different probe field detunings due to optomechanical-induced transparency being split into three windows. We show that asymmetric photonic SHE can be controlled through cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction when probe field detuning is nonzero. The photonic SHE in bilayer graphene integrated with an optomechanical cavity may enable further studies of spin-dependent photonic effects and quantum sensing applications.},

The system, modeled as a Rice-Mele chain using a double-well lattice and facilitating giant-atom-like nonlocal interaction, exhibits intriguing phenomena such as subradiance and superradiance. We demonstrate that APBSs with tunable chirality can be realized in the bound states in the continuum (BICs) and quasi-BICs and support the decoherence-free interaction via two distinct schemes. We also reveal the dynamical mechanisms for the topologically protected SAP, where the chiral-APBS fidelity during the adiabatic transfer is highly sensitive to the topology. These findings open possibilities for quantum simulation and information processing with cold atoms, particularly through the integration of topologically protected controllable mechanisms.},

In this formalism, the electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric object has two contributions, one taking into account the polarization current fluctuations of the object and the other taking into account the vacuum field fluctuations scattered by the object. The combined effect of these fields on the dynamics of a quantum emitter is described via two independent continuous bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each characterized by its own spectral density and initial quantum state. For initial thermal states of the two reservoirs at different temperatures, the standard approach based on the knowledge of the dyadic Green's function of the dielectric object at the quantum emitter position cannot be employed. We map the two reservoirs to a single equivalent reservoir with a temperature-dependent effective spectral density and initially in its vacuum state, focusing on the case of a homogeneous dielectric sphere. We derive analytical expressions for the medium-assisted, scattering-assisted, and effective spectral densities in this setting. We then study the dynamics of the quantum emitter for initial thermal states of the two reservoirs, adopting a nonperturbative approach.},

To our knowledge, the impacts of BICs on the single-photon purity and brightness in the blockade process remain less explored. Here, we put forward a scheme to simultaneously enhance both the purity and brightness of single-photon emission in one cavity mode of such an integrated microresonator-waveguide system, while the other cavity mode is considered to be an active mode, modeled as incoherent-pumping (gain)-like laser production. Physically, this enhancement is achieved through BICs produced by quantum destructive interference between different dissipative pathways. We demonstrate that BICs enable the improvement of emission brightness by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, accompanied by high single-photon purity of 0.98 (or strong photon blockade of 0.02) compared with the BIC-free configuration. As a check, the full numerical results for the second-order correlation function and the average photon number of the emission cavity mode, which respectively determine the purity and brightness of single-photon emission, are in excellent agreement with the semianalytical solutions. Our BICs-based work offers a promising avenue for constructing single-photon sources with high purity and high brightness.},

  abstract     = {How environments affect the dynamics of quantum systems remains a central question in understanding transitions between quantum and classical phenomena and optimizing quantum technologies. A paradigm model to address the above question is the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model, in which a two-level particle is coupled to its environment modeled by a continuum of boson modes. Previous analytic solutions show that, starting from the initial condition that the particle is in its excited state and the boson modes are in their vacuum state, the time evolution of the probability that the particle occupies the excited state exhibits a dynamical transition as the system-environment coupling varies; when the coupling is weak, the probability decays to zero monotonically, while a finite weight of the particle is localized in the excited state when the coupling is sufficiently strong. Here we study the dynamical transition for the case that particles are initially excited with the boson modes in their vacuum state. The boson modes are assumed to follow a spectral function up to a cutoff frequency with . In particular, we access the effects of an all-to-all Ising type interaction we introduce between the particles. Our calculation is carried out by the nonperturbative numerical renormalization group method. We find that the value of the critical coupling for the transition exhibits a maximum at a finite and decreases with sufficiently large , and is suppressed (enlarged) by a ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) Ising interaction. Our results enrich understanding of environmental effects on interacting quantum systems.},

The multiphoton JCHM MI phases are classified according to a conserved quantity associated with the total number of excited atoms and photons. When this conserved quantity diverges toward positive infinity, this system enters the forbidden phase. By analyzing the system, we observe MI, superfluid, and forbidden phases in both the single- and two-photon JCHMs, although the MI phases in the two-photon case are confined to subspaces with small values of the conserved quantity. In contrast, only the superfluid and forbidden phases appear in the three- and four-photon JCHMs, with no MI phase observed.},

This was seen through the study of the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian superoperator that describes the joint effect of drive and cooperativity. The cooperative decay depends on the nature of the reservoir correlations. If the reservoir correlations have phase-sensitive behavior, then the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian will be different. We investigate the time-crystal behavior of the nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions under the influence of a squeezed vacuum reservoir. We analyze the steady-state phase diagram as a function of the control parameter and demonstrate that increasing the squeezing strength sharpens the dissipative phase transition. Spectral analysis of the Liouvillian reveals gap closings and the emergence of purely imaginary eigenvalues in the thermodynamic limit, indicating the time-crystal phase. We find that the real parts of subleading eigenvalues exhibit nonmonotonic behavior with increasing squeezing, reflecting the sensitivity of relaxation dynamics to the reservoir properties. Time-domain simulations confirm that the oscillation frequencies correspond to the imaginary parts of the Liouvillian eigenvalues. We also present results on quantum fluctuations in the time-crystal phase. Our results call attention to the study of time crystals in models of cooperativity based on engineered environments.},

While significant progress has been made in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of enantiomer selectivity, many existing studies focus on perfectly chiral cavities that contain only one type of enantiomer. Here, we investigate a scenario of imperfect cavities containing varying mixtures of enantiomers. Using a generalized Hopfield-type model, we systematically explore how the degree of enantiomeric mixing and cavity imperfections affect chiral selectivity. Our analysis includes both an examination of the cavity's eigenmode structure and a quantitative assessment of differential energy transfer into specific enantiomeric species. We demonstrate that both cavity imperfections and the presence of enantiomer mixtures profoundly modify the polaritonic dispersion. We also highlight that pushing the system into the deep strong coupling regime—by increasing molecular concentration—can decrease the efficiency of energy transfer to matter modes. These findings emphasize that precise cavity design and detailed consideration of enantiomeric composition are essential for achieving optimal chiral selectivity in practical cavity QED systems.},

  abstract     = {Optical down-conversion is widely used for generating photon pairs, squeezed and entangled states of light, making it an indispensable tool in quantum optics and quantum information. In the regime where the pump is much stronger than the generated field, the standard parametric approximation treats the pump amplitude as a fixed parameter of the model. This approximation has a limited domain of validity since it assumes a nondepleted and nonentangled pump. By finding an approximate solution to the Schrödinger equation of the down-conversion process, we obtain an improved analytical model beyond the parametric one, which accounts for pump depletion and pump-signal entanglement. Our model is advantageous, first, because it allows one to compute averages of field operators far beyond the domain of validity of the parametric approximation, and second, because it allows one to establish error-specific limits of the latter domain. For a given pump amplitude, we find a maximum squeezing parameter, up to which the approximation remains valid within a specified acceptable error. Our results confirm that recent experiments on Gaussian boson sampling, with a squeezing parameter of and a coherent pump amplitude of , can still be accurately described by the standard parametric approximation. However, we observe a sharp decline in validity as the squeezing parameter increases. For pump amplitudes of , the parametric approximation breaks down when the squeezing parameter exceeds , whereas the new approximation remains valid up to with an acceptable error of 1%.},

This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for -function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.},

Specifically, we show how one can access higher moments of the mode operators, crucial for detecting entanglement of non-Gaussian states, using a single beamsplitter with variable phase and photon-number-resolving detectors. We demonstrate that the use of an entangled state paired with a suitable reference state is sufficient to detect entanglement in, e.g., two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON states, and mixed entangled cat states.

The phases of coupling strengths between the giant molecule and waveguides are considered. Using a real-space method, we obtain the exact analytical expressions for the single-photon scattering coefficients, which are valid both in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. It is shown that the transmission spectra strongly depend on phases, including the phases accumulated by photons traveling between coupling points and the phase difference between two coupled channels of the giant-molecule upper (lower) waveguide. Under the Markovian limit, we find that by selecting appropriate accumulated phases and local phase difference, targeted routing and asymmetrical scattering of photons can be achieved without breaking the symmetry in the coupling configuration between the giant molecule and waveguides. Moreover, all the optimal phase combinations for implementing single-photon routing have been summarized. In the non-Markovian regime, the scattering spectra show more complicated line shapes with multiple staggered peaks and dips. More interestingly, the scattering spectrum exhibits periodic changes during the transition from the Markovian to the non-Markovian regime, which makes one obtain a means to control photon routing in addition to phases.

We also explore the possibilities offered by such a system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the SaS scattering depends on parameters such as the Stokes–anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry, and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.},

The non-Gaussianity evolution during the coupling process is quantitatively analyzed via quantum relative entropy, and the entanglement between the two output modes is confirmed from an entropic perspective. Furthermore, the entanglement properties of the zero-phase and -phase positive Wigner squeezed states at the third- and sixth-order moments are revealed by applying the partial transpose positive criterion based on the higher-order covariance matrix. In particular, it is found that the steerability of the two output modes at the third- and sixth-order moments can be dynamically controlled by adjusting the intensity of the input light and the transmission of the beam splitter.

Our results reveal a transition from anomalous to normal in the ellipticity dependence as the laser frequency increases. Simultaneously, the structure of the orientation dependence undergoes a transformation. By analyzing the conduction-band electron populations, we attribute these changes to the transformation of the dominant excitation mechanism. At low frequencies, tunneling ionization dominates, whereas at high frequencies, multiphoton ionization prevails. Furthermore, the limitation of the solid Keldysh parameter is discussed. These findings underscore the crucial role of the dominant excitation mechanism in solid high-order harmonic generation.},

  abstract     = {Singular optics is an important and meaningful subject that has attracted widespread attention. The famous vortex beam and vector beam carrying different singularities have found broad applications, and there are four kinds of optical singularities including one kind of phase singularity and three kinds of polarization singularities. However, the classification of optical singularities remains incomplete, as the polarization singularity with indeterminate ellipticity and determinate orientation has not been defined. Here, we propose a kind of E -point singularity, where the ellipticity of polarization is indeterminate and the orientation is determinate. The amount, positions, and topological charges of the E -point singularities can be theoretically and experimentally manipulated on the wave front of the beam. It is found that the E -point singularity has a function of polarization purification in propagation, and the E -point singularity acts like catalyst when achieving pure transverse spin angular momentum (SAM) in tight focusing process. The proposed E -point singularity not only supplements the theoretical framework of singular optics, but also enables SAM manipulation during propagation and focusing processes, demonstrating broad application potential across various regions.},

This allows for a powerful numerical solution of optomechanical resonances without any perturbative approximations for the mechanical motion. The scaled population (excitation) dynamics of the Lorentz oscillators are investigated as well as the emitted radiation and electromagnetic spectra, which demonstrates how the usual dipole-dipole resonances couple to the underlying Floquet states, yielding multiple spectral peaks that are separated from the superradiant and subradiant states by an integer number of the mechanical oscillation frequency. Moreover, we observe that when the mechanical amplitude and frequency are sufficiently large, these additional spectral peaks undergo further modification, including spectral splitting, spectral squeezing, or shifting. These observations are fully corroborated by a theoretical Floquet analysis conducted on two coupled harmonic oscillators.},

While non-Hermitian effects have been widely addressed in two-dimensional (2D) systems, we focus on realistic three-dimensional devices. To this end we generalize established phase-space methods from mesoscopic optics and introduce Husimi functions for three-dimensional systems that deepen the insight and access to the mode morphology and their dynamics. We illustrate that four-dimensional Husimi functions can be represented using a specific projection on two dimensions and illustrate it for (conical) cylindrical cavities. The non-Hermitian character of the intrinsically open photonic systems is in particular revealed when examining the transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarization character of the resonance modes. Unlike the 2D case, polarization is not conserved in three-dimensional cavities, and we use generalized Husimi function to represent the interaction of polarization modes. We find their dynamics to be ruled by a network of exceptional points in the parameter space spanned by the refractive index and the cavity geometry tilt angle. This approach not only enhances our understanding of cavity modes but also aids in the design of more efficient photonic devices and systems.},

This approach exploits parity-asymmetric interactions between chiral particles and the metasurface-engineered needle-like optical field, eliminating the need for complex background structures. Leveraging the field manipulation versatility of spin-decoupled metasurfaces, we demonstrate enantiomer separation across thousands of particle diameters—exceeding previous works by an order of magnitude in terms of particle-scale displacement. Furthermore, by tuning the chirality density of the field, directional control of particle motion can be achieved, underscoring its potential for large-scale chiral sorting and enantioselective drug purification.},

It involves two coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations for the forward and backward propagating fields, alongside a single equation governing the acoustic oscillation. Under the standard assumptions for the mean-field approach (high finesse, weak nonlinearity, and weak dispersion) we demonstrate that our model closely matches the original system. The simplified and elegant mathematical structure of our equation provides valuable physical insights. As a key example, we derive an expression for the growth rate of harmonic perturbations to the steady states. Additionally, our model facilitates fast and accurate numerical simulations using standard Fourier split-step methods.

Superscattering, induced by degenerate resonances, allows the scattering cross section of subwavelength structures to surpass the fundamental single-channel limit. However, most existing superscattering techniques depend on complex multilayered structures and primarily aim to enhance scattering magnitudes. In this work, we propose a single-layer plasmonic core-shell nanoparticle that achieves superdirectional scattering without relying on high-permittivity materials and magnetic resonances. We demonstrate that for nanoparticles with a thin plasmonic nanoshell, both dielectric dipolar and quadrupolar resonances occur at nearly the same frequency, where the permittivity of the plasmonic shell approaches zero (degenerate epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) resonances), enabling superscattering in this simple nanoparticle. Furthermore, by tuning the amplitudes of these ENZ resonances, we show that both zero-backward and super-forward scattering can be realized. This approach, relying solely on pure electric ENZ modes in a simple core-shell nanoparticle, offers a new pathway for achieving superdirectional scattering and holds significant potential for applications in photovoltaic devices, biosensors, and nanoantennas.},

Here we utilize the conservation of optical chirality to connect the parity and time-reversal symmetries of the intrinsic excitational eigenmodes of a material to those of their associated electromagnetic eigenfields as dictated by Maxwell's equations. To make this connection explicit, we theoretically examine the Born-Kuhn (BK) system, composed of a pair of plasmonic nanorods of variable separation, as a prototypical material model that is both geometrically chiral in its static structure and truly excitationally chiral in its eigenexcitations and eigenfields. By relaying optical chirality metrics of the BK eigenfields back to their underlying sourcing material degrees of freedom, we derive a unique mechanical chirality measure that is related to, but distinct from, other pseudoscalar metrics recently discussed in the literature. Beyond analysis in the absence of sources, we further derive optical chiral extinction, scattering, and absorption cross sections under external drive and discuss their rigorous connection to more common circular dichroism measurements as well as their limitations in comparison to eigenfield chirality metrics. Finally, we investigate the conversion of achiral linearly polarized light into chiral elliptically polarized light through interaction with the BK system, illustrating the conservation of optical chirality in the interaction between light and matter through an analytically tractable example.},

In this work, we systematically investigate the multiple-order differential imaging based on two types of topological singularity in 1D photonic crystals (PhCs). For both oblique and normal incidences, we conduct a detailed investigation of differential imaging effect. For the oblique incident cases, the first type of topological singularities support first-order differential imaging in both x and y directions. Meanwhile, based on the second type of topological singularities, ∂ 2 / ∂ x ∂ y -type differential imaging can be achieved. For the normal incident cases, the first type of topological singularities can support radial second-order and fourth-order differential imaging and the second type of topological singularities can support radial fourth-order differential imaging without the need for fine-tuning of the structural parameters. We further demonstrate the realization of these differential imaging effects in the deep-subwavelength region by shifting the first type of topological singularities into this region. This research connects the topological properties of PhCs with optical differential imaging, paving the way for the development of multiple-order differential imaging devices with improved robustness and functionality.},

We have also derived analytical expressions for the STLG mode with an arbitrary radial and angular indices propagating in the isotropic media. The propagation dynamics can be understood as a unitary transformation generated by a conserved quantity, where the rotation angle is exactly the intermodal Gouy phase of the spatiotemporal modes in the same order subspace. This spatiotemporal Gouy phase depends on the ellipticity of the wave packets and the group velocity dispersion of the media. The phase, as a function of propagation distance, is categorized into three distinct regimes: normal dispersion, anomalous dispersion, and zero dispersion. Interestingly, in the regime of anomalous dispersion, the nonmonotonic behavior induces both distortion and revival of the intensity distribution, thereby establishing a phase-locked mechanism that is analogous to the Talbot effect.},

Starting from the linearized quantum Langevin equations, we derive the drift matrix and confirm system stability by verifying that all eigenvalue real parts remain negative. We then analyze the probe transmission spectrum under two complementary control mechanisms. First, with collisional interactions suppressed, increasing the OPA gain within the stability region transforms the standard Lorentzian cavity response into a tunable Fano-like profile, accompanied by asymmetric dispersive line shapes and pronounced group delays. Second, with the OPA turned off, including atomic collisions yields an intrinsically narrow Bogoliubov excitation that interferes with the cavity continuum, reproducing Fano resonances, “S-shaped” phase dispersion, slow- and fast-light windows, and positive Goos-Hänchen shifts. By examining both absorptive (real) and dispersive (imaginary) components of the transmitted field, we establish direct links between destructive interference pathways, steep phase slopes, and enhanced optical delays. Our results demonstrate that parametric amplification and collisional nonlinearities are equally versatile tools for engineering quantum interference in cavity QED with ultracold atoms, opening prospects for reconfigurable slow-light buffers, Fano-switchable photonic routers, and atom-integrated delay lines.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the focusing characteristics of scalar and vector beams within an atomic medium. An active-Raman-gain configuration is employed to achieve significant Kerr nonlinearity in a four-state atomic system. The probe beams can attain focusing within the medium through careful selection of input beam intensities and the spatial profile of the control field. We analytically derive the linear and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities for both scalar and vector probe beams. Our observations indicate that, in addition to the energy transfer from the control beam to the probe beam, the giant cross-Kerr nonlinearity facilitates the focusing of the scalar probe beam into a significantly smaller spot size. Conversely, the vector probe beams exhibit gain-induced narrowing. Furthermore, we evaluate the state of polarization for the vector beam at the minimum beam waist, observing a polarization rotation and a change in ellipticity during propagation. Through the mechanism of focusing, we achieve a reduced spot size for the probe beam, which may have substantial implications for resolution enhancement in microscopy applications.},

Moving beyond conventional linearized approximations, we derive analytical expressions for both the second-order sideband efficiency and mass-sensing sensitivity using a perturbation approach. Our scheme enables mass detection by monitoring shifts in the second-order sideband generation efficiency when a target mass is deposited on the dielectric membrane. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we identify the maximum achievable efficiency of the second-order upper sideband and its corresponding optimal sensitivity. Remarkably, with the aid of a gain cavity, both the sideband efficiency and mass sensitivity are significantly enhanced—particularly near the exceptional point, where improvements exceeding three orders of magnitude are demonstrated. This work provides a promising approach to high-precision mass measurement, advancing and complementing existing methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are electromagnetic eigenstates that theoretically exhibit infinite quality factors. However, scattering losses induced by manufacturing defects inevitably affect the confinement performance of BICs. Studies have shown that combining multiple BICs can enhance their robustness against such defects. Currently, approaches to merging BICs at off- points typically rely on altering the geometry of the central structure, which not only increases the complexity of device design but also potentially raises costs. Based on this, we propose a scheme that maintains the central structure while introducing specific defect holes to break the in-plane symmetry of the system, thereby inducing the splitting of the higher-order BIC and forming multiple off- BICs. Subsequently, these split BICs, along with the accidental BICs, will merge at the off- point as the structural parameters are varied. The proposed concept not only enhances optical confinement but also enables flexible control over the splitting direction of the higher-order BIC by manipulating the spatial positions of the defect apertures. More importantly, by rationally designing the positions of defects, we can construct merging BICs at arbitrary wave vectors through manipulations of split BICs and accidental BICs. Furthermore, even in the presence of manufacturing defects, the merging BICs demonstrate exceptional robustness. This provides new insights for the flexible control of BICs in diversified applications while also expanding their potential in a broader momentum space.},

In this study, we present a tunable bilayer optical matter motor controlled by distance-modulated electromagnetic interlayer coupling. Using the generalized Lorentz-Mie scattering theory for multispheres and the Langevin dynamics method, we investigate the dynamics of the bilayer motor during light-driven self-organization and rotation. Through the modulation of the interlayer distance to tune coupling effects, we demonstrate the capacity to selectively manipulate the rotation modes of the motor—both layers can rotate clockwise (receiving negative optical torque), rotate anticlockwise, or counterrotate. These modes arise from changes in the relative contributions of excited electric and magnetic multipoles, offering an intuitive understanding of interlayer coupling from the perspective of multipoles. The bilayer motor exhibits stable rotation across a wide range of coupling distances due to strong long-range electromagnetic coupling, and demonstrates excellent robustness to both the polarization of the incident light and structural offset from the beam center, facilitating experimental implementation. Our structural stability analysis indicates that bilayer optical matter motors constructed from equilateral triangular units maintain remarkable stability during light-driven self-organization and rotation, even with varying interlayer coupling. This research enhances our understanding of light-matter interactions in the dynamics of bilayer optical matter systems while providing theoretical foundations for novel micromotor design.},

Here, we propose a scheme for realizing the classical non-Abelian braiding of coupled modes in photonic waveguides system. The Hamiltonian of the designed system is built via the interplay between two sub-Hamiltonians, where one of them enables the non-Abelian braiding, while the other one generates the coupled modes. In this way, the non-Abelian braiding of coupled modes of arbitrarily high order can be realized. We carry out numerical simulations to verify the concept for coupled modes with an order of four, including the mode switching behavior as well as the non-Abelian geometric phase. The proposed concept may lead to on-chip applications including mode division multiplexing non-Abelian braiding.},

As an illustrative example, we employ a cosine-Gaussian correlated Schell-model pulse to conduct in-depth analyses. Our numerical results reveal that the obstructed pulses, with the help of the source degree of coherence, exhibit outstanding self-reconstruction properties in the nonlinear Kerr media. Although the nonlinearity can to some extent impair the self-reconstruction ability of pulses, ultrastrong self-reconstruction of the pulses can be achieved by reducing the optical coherence.

In this work, we propose an integrated and tunable transducer that combines a coplanar waveguide microwave resonator with a magno-optomechanical microcavity via flip-chip bonding. Benefiting from the broad frequency tunability of the magnon mode, the working frequency range can be tuned over several gigahertz. Through optimization of the geometry and pump powers, our design achieves a theoretical microwave-to-optical photon conversion efficiency exceeding 50% using experimentally achievable parameters, alongside a bandwidth greater than 10 kHz. An added noise near the quantum limit is achievable at 10 mK using lower pump powers at the cost of conversion efficiency or a pulsed-pump protocol.

PSS rises as increases, reaching a maximum of roughly 300 and 120 for the transverse and longitudinal shift values, respectively.

The first is independent of the tunneling parameter and emerges when the steady-state frequency of the mode is resonant with the TLS transition. This resembles lasing in uncoupled MCs and relies on population inversion. The second scenario arises from the nonreciprocal nature of dissipative tunneling and enables lasing of nonresonant modes even at vanishingly small population inversion, owing to energy redistribution across the network. In the latter case, interference effects along graph paths induce node-dependent frequency shifts and nonreciprocal photon transmission. We further propose a renormalization-group hypothesis for the PN to explain the observed spectral features. We analyze the phase structure of photonic modes in the scale-free RL and discuss its relevance for photonic Ising machines operating under the minimum power dissipation principle.},

Here, we study the quantum optical signatures of high-harmonic generation (HHG) from solid-state material driven by squeezed coherent states. We find that squeezed coherent states can either enhance or suppress the HHG yields compared to that driven by coherent light, depending on the photon bunching or antibunching characteristics of driving light. The analysis on semiclassical trajectories indicates that the amplitude fluctuation alters the recombination energy, while the phase fluctuation affects the birth and recombination time of electron-hole pairs. By calculating the Husimi Q distributions of HHG, we demonstrate that the squeezing of the two conjugate quadratures of driving light asymmetrically influence the squeezing phase of harmonics. Surprisingly, we find that even under coherent driving, the harmonics still exhibit squeezing due to the highly nonlinear response of solid-state HHG, which was overlooked previously. Numerical calculations of the Mandel parameter are performed to characterize the photon statistics of emitted HHG arising from different microscopic mechanisms. The results indicate that intraband radiation can exhibit a super-Poissonian distribution, while interband emission exhibits sub-Poissonian distribution under coherent driving.},

  abstract     = {Single-mode semiconductor lasers support fast nonlinear dynamics for investigating extreme events. Although one laser subject to perturbation is sufficient for yielding extreme events, multiple lasers with mutual interactions have yet to be considered. Here, extreme events are found experimentally using two detuned lasers under delayed mutual injection. The mutually injected lasers each emit an intensity that exhibits locking to a constant, except for interruptions by intermittent pulses, including very strong ones as extreme events. Such extreme eruptions from a constant background under mutual injection are different from the continual chaotic oscillations usually obtained under unidirectional injections. By varying the detuning frequency between the lasers, the intermittent pulsations with extreme events are found in a route that involves regular switching between constant and periodic oscillatory intensities. By adopting space-time representation, the extreme events are observed to emerge stochastically, together with some partial repetitions of pulses corresponding to a slightly lengthened round trip. By optimizing the detuning, the maximal normalized occurrence of extreme events reaches 0.8%, which is relatively high among approaches on lasers without external modulations for excitations. On average, about six extreme events are yielded within one round trip of 130 ns, while their short pulse widths are of the order of 0.1 ns. Applicable to generating strong random electrical pulses, the experiments point to the importance of mutual interactions in single-mode lasers for extreme events.},

The Photon extra-bunching effect, as a special class of the superbunching effect ( ), describes the enhanced photon correlation ( ) through the interference of bright twin beams produced in the spontaneous parametric down-conversion. In this work, we report that this effect can exist in classical beams and that can approach 4 in some extended extreme models. We experimentally demonstrate the nontrivial extra-bunching correlation ( gain) in pairwise-generated holographic thermal light beams with a Dove prism-embedded balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The interaction of such a pair of conjugated thermal light beams can generate a pair of uncorrelated superthermal light beams, enabling ghost imaging and Young's intensity interference with enhanced visibility. The quantum-inspired interference-induced spatial extra-bunching effect provides novel insights into inducing superbunching correlation in classical light and holds the potential for application in the coherent two-photon Lidar system to enhance sensitivity.},

In the dynamic equilibrium, the spot size, pulse duration, wave-front curvature, phase, and chirp evolve self-consistently along the propagation path. Significant intensity enhancement at remote distances is achieved by tailoring the laser parameters in such a way that the transverse and longitudinal focal points nearly coincide. In addition, the hybrid filamentation-modulation instability is analyzed and simulated, indicating that the beam breaks up transversely and longitudinally.

We have studied our levitated system over a wide range of trapping parameters and determined four distinct dynamical states of the trapped particle motion, which are associated with the retaining force and drag force nonlinearities. Like any other nonlinear system, the considered one possesses a phase transition in its behavior that demarcates linear and nonlinear regimes of motion. The nonlinear regime manifests itself as the formation of a specific limit cycle of the trapped particle motion also known as an extended orbit . We have shown that the birth of the extended orbits is foretold by the appearance of half-integer trapping frequency multiples in the particle motion oscillation. These half-integer multiples are highly sensitive to trapping parameters and external perturbation. We have demonstrated that the phase transition is a continuous process over a range of system parameters and can be exploited to detect small influences on the levitated system. We have tested the system response in the transient state to the external optical perturbation. The strong sensitivity to perturbation laser power has been shown for both the spectral composition of the trapped particle translational oscillations and extended orbit formation point. We believe in the potential to apply the nonlinear state of the levitodynamic system with massive particles to the field of precision measurements and nonequilibrium physics investigation.},

Using the same analytical approach, we then discuss the applicability of the quench spectroscopy to non-Hermitian quantum lattice models by considering the sudden global quench dynamics of the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain confined in the paramagnetic phase. We finally generalize this spectroscopy method to isolated Hermitian quantum lattice models characterized by a quadratic fermionic or bosonic Hamiltonian. For this purpose, we consider the case study of the Hermitian version of the latter one-dimensional lattice model.

  abstract     = {In the low-energy limit, nonrelativistic particles with short-range interactions exhibit universal behavior that is largely independent of microscopic details. This universality is typically described by effective field theory, in which the two-body interaction is renormalized to a single parameter—the scattering length. For systems of identical bosons, the three-body problem reveals the Efimov effect, a novel phenomenon proposed that necessitates the introduction of an additional three-body parameter. However, the exact relation between this three-body parameter, the coupling constants in the effective field theory, and the binding energies of Efimov states remains unresolved. In this work, we address this question through a comprehensive analysis of the Skorniakov–Ter-Martirosian equation with a finite cutoff. We establish an exact renormalization relation for the three-body parameter and determine its connection to the energies of Efimov bound states. These results are validated through high-precision numerical simulations. We expect our findings to be of fundamental interest across various fields, including atomic, nuclear, condensed matter, and particle physics, and to have broad applications in both few-body and many-body physics.},

We employ two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a new Ansatz for vortex cores in planar quantum fluids that enhances analytic integrability. This Ansatz yields closed-form expressions for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions. Using it, we identify distinct signatures of short- and long-range velocity correlations corresponding to vortex dipoles and vortex pairs, respectively. Second, we analyze the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton. By applying the asymptotic high-velocity wave function, we derive analytic expressions for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the soliton characteristic length scale. We validate our analytical results for the homogeneous system against numerical treatment of a large trapped system, finding close quantitative agreement.

Any tilt of the Raman lasers with respect to the vertical direction introduces systematic errors in gravity measurements. In this work, we report a determination of the tilt of Raman lasers, where the fringe of the atom interferometer is scanned by varying the tilt, rather than the phase, of the Raman lasers. Unlike the periodic cosine fringes typically used in atom interferometers, the fringe obtained by changing the tilt, referred to as the tilt-scanned fringe, is aperiodic in tilt and exhibits a shift due to the presence of a nonzero tilt. The tilt-scanned fringe is highly sensitive to the tilt-caused shift, enabling convenient and precise determination of the Raman laser tilt in atom gravimeters. We demonstrate that one tilt-scanned fringe, corresponding to a tilt measurement sampling time of 13 s, can determine the tilt with a typical precision of about in our developed atom gravimeter. The short-term sensitivity and measurement accuracy of the tilt-scanned fringe method were evaluated, demonstrating performance comparable to conventional tilt determination techniques.

Novel phases are identified at moderate interaction strengths for both densities, and their robustness is investigated in the presence of flavor imbalance. Furthermore, we provide microscopic explanations of the phases found and their stability. Analysis of thermal ensembles of random mean-field solutions indicate that, at temperatures accessible in state-of-the-art cold atom experiments, some spin orders are hard for conventional scattering or local observable measurements to detect, but can be more accessible with quantum gas microscopy in optical lattice experiments. This work also shows that nesting and Mottness, intertwined in the usual SU(2) Hubbard model in stark contrast to generic materials, can be tuned in the SU(3) model and play distinct roles. The resulting phase diagrams not only deepen our understanding of Fermi-Hubbard models but also inform future experimental search for new phases.},

  abstract     = {We investigate three kinds of instabilities in binary immiscible homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, considering rubidium isotopes and confined in two-dimensional circular box. Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability types are studied under strong perturbations. Without external perturbation, instabilities are also probed by immiscible-to-miscible quenching transition, under two different initial configurations. Our numerical simulations show that all such instability dynamics are dominated by large vortex production and sound-wave (phonon) propagation. For long-term propagation, vortex dynamics become dominant over sound waves in the KH instability, while sound-wave excitations predominate in the other cases. For all the dynamical simulations, the emergence of possible scaling laws are investigated for the compressible and incompressible parts of the kinetic energy spectra, in terms of the wave number . The corresponding results are compared with the classical Kolmogorov scalings, and , for turbulence, which are observed in the kinetic energy spectra at some specific time intervals.},

  abstract     = {The most sensitive direct neutrino mass searches today are based on measurement of the end point of the spectrum of tritium to infer limits on the mass of the unobserved neutrino. To avoid the smearing associated with the distribution of molecular final states in the T-He molecule, the next generation of these experiments will need to employ atomic (T) rather than molecular tritium sources, at currents of at least atoms per second. Following production, atomic T can be trapped in gravitational and/or magnetic bottles for spectrum experiments, if and only if it can first be cooled to millikelvin temperatures. Accomplishing this cooling presents substantial technological challenges. The Project 8 collaboration is developing a technique based on magnetic evaporative cooling along a beamline (MECB) for the purpose of cooling T to feed a magnetogravitational trap that also serves as a cyclotron radiation emission spectroscope. Initial tests of the approach are planned in a pathfinder apparatus using atomic Li. This paper presents a method for analyzing the dynamics of the MECB technique and applies these calculations to the design of systems for cooling and slowing of atomic Li and T. A scheme is outlined that could provide a current of T at the millikelvin temperatures required for the Project 8 neutrino mass search.},

Invoking an ensemble-average formalism and assuming spatial translation symmetry, we show that the dynamics can be described by a Lindblad master equation with an interpolated coherent Hamiltonian. In the classical limit, the interpolation Hamiltonian leads to a set of nonlinear equations of motion, where limit cycles can emerge in the long-time dynamics. In the quantum limit, by contrast, the system approaches a ferromagnetic steady state at long times. In between the two extremes, the discrete spatial translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken, as an antiferromagnetic steady state emerges, bridging the classical and quantum regimes. In particular, we illustrate how the classical limit-cycle behavior gradually disappears with the increase of quantum correlation. Since our model in the two extremes respectively applies to a dissipative Rydberg gas in the high- and zero-temperature limits, we expect it to provide a qualitatively correct description of dissipative Rydberg gases at interim temperatures and shed light on the fate of limit cycles in a quantum open system.},

When the dipole frequencies along the three symmetric axes of the harmonic trap are degenerate, the dipole motion can decompose into two coupled transverse modes in the plane perpendicular to the synthetic magnetic field, and another decoupled longitudinal mode, enabling controllable Foucault-like precession or biconical trajectories depending on the excitation protocol. Furthermore, quenching the orientation of the synthetic magnetic field excites multiple coupled quadrupole modes. We develop a hydrodynamic theory whose predictions match well with Gross-Pitaevskii simulations.

Moreover, it highlights the relevance of energy damping, the number-conserving scattering between thermal and coherent atoms. We analyze the equilibrium properties and near-equilibrium relaxation of a homogeneous BEC in one, two, and three dimensions at high phase-space density and calculate the autocorrelation function and power spectrum of the density and phase fluctuations. Simulations of the full nonlinear SPGPE are in close agreement and extend our arguments beyond the linear regime.

We solve the Schrödinger equation for a fermionic system across a broad range of attractive and repulsive interactions by constructing the system's wave function as a superposition of two-coboson states. We determine key observables such as particle density profiles and two-body correlations. The density profiles calculated agree with both the Tonks-Girardeau and Lieb-Liniger limits and provide a portrait of the transition between those regimes. In the strong repulsive regime, the ansatz captures the Fridel-Wigner transition characterized by a doubling of the peaks in the density profiles. Additionally, we compute the low-lying energy spectrum and estimate the pairing gap. Our results highlight the usefulness of the coboson superposition ansatz for exploring quantum phenomena in strongly correlated few-body systems.},

The dynamical phase diagram in nonlinear parameter space is presented, identifying oscillation regions with different skewed sinusoidal dependence, and diffusion regions with irreversible soliton spreading due to instability of the barrier.

In a two-dimensional (2D) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at zero temperature, in addition to the vortex drift-out process from the boundary, a vortex-antivortex pair can annihilate in bulk, but controversy remains on the number of vortices involved in the annihilation process. We find that a dynamic crossover exists from four-body to three-body vortex annihilation processes with time evolution in decaying 2D quantum turbulence of a boundary-less uniform quasi-2D BEC. Such a dynamical crossover depends on the initial vortex pair density and occurs when the sound waves generated in the vortex annihilation process surpass a threshold energy. As the confinement along the third direction is relaxed in a quasi-2D BEC, the threshold sound wave energy decreases due to the three-dimensional (3D) vortex line curve and reconnection, shifting the dynamical crossover to the early time. Our work reveals an elementary mechanism for the dissipation of vortex energy that may help understand exotic matter and dynamics in quantum liquids.},

The origin of spin squeezing is attributed to the interaction between the nuclear quadrupole moment and the electric-field gradients in the molecular environment. The formal description of the nonlinear operators responsible for spin squeezing is achieved using the spin angular momentum representation via the one-axis twisting mechanism. This approach provides a framework for quantum control and metrology over the spin squeezing process while accounting for the influence of relaxation phenomena. Non-Cartesian angular momentum operators are proposed, with their variance products catching the quantum effects during the dynamics. An upper bound for the squeezing parameter and the Heisenberg uncertainty at steady state are also predicted for any spin quantum number.},

The technique relies on optical pumping in Autler Townes configuration, whose efficiency is controlled by the presence or absence of a Rydberg excitation. Taking rubidium atoms as an example, we give realistic estimates for the achievable fidelities and parameters. However, our protocol can be transferred to any other atomic species that features multiple stable states.

The corresponding ab initio simulations reveal a characteristic “knee” in the ionization yield at lower field intensities than in comparable two-electron systems. To understand the origin of this shift, a quantitative semianalytic model for double ionization of a three-electron atom has been created. In this model, ionization is treated as a combination of different scenarios and channels. Each channel is simulated with either quantitative rescattering theory (QRS) or a two-electron ab initio model. Analysis of the semianalytical results indicates that the shifted part of the “knee” is dominated by a recollision-excitation channel in which the rescattering electron initially escapes the parent atom from an inner orbital. This counterintuitive phenomenon is then discussed and explained.},

This work incorporates dephasing effects in the theoretical simulations of HHG from topological insulators described by finite-size tight-binding models. This is done by formulating a density-matrix approach in both length and velocity gauges within dipole approximation, with a gauge-invariant treatment of dephasing properly introduced such that the HHG response of a sufficiently large solidlike system is consistent with the periodic limit obtained using semiconductor Bloch equations. Applying the approach to Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains reveals how dephasing affects the impact of topological edge states on the HHG spectra. It is found that dephasing can either weaken or strengthen the spectral contrast between the topological and trivial phases, depending on which of the intra- and interband mechanisms is dominant for a specific harmonic in the trivial phase.},

We consider the photoeffect in which the ejected photoelectron is described by a vortex scattering state and characterized by a definite projection of its angular momentum on a given vortex axis. Although the plane-wave and vortex transition matrix elements can be expressed in terms of each other, the corresponding cross sections cannot. We develop a theory of the molecular photoeffect with vortex photoelectrons, which includes the introduction and analysis of various vortex photoionization observables and their averaging over molecular orientations. The averaging is essential for treating photoionization of randomly oriented molecules in the gas phase. We show that the averaged vortex differential cross sections reveal new chiral asymmetries caused by the chirality of the vortex photoelectron, which generalize the phenomenon of photoelectron circular dichroism. The theory is illustrated by calculations for the glyceraldehyde molecule described within the molecular zero-range potential model. We also propose and validate by calculations a scheme based on a ring-shaped forked grating which allows, at least in principle, to verify our predictions experimentally.},

We find that the cutoff position of the harmonic spectrum emitted from the ring-current state is extended, but the harmonic efficiency is reduced in a chirped IR field compared with a chirp-free IR field. This harmonic broadening can be well understood by the semiclassical three-step model and the quantum time-frequency analysis. By introducing a UV field into the chirped IR field with a proper chirp parameter, both the efficiency and chirality of harmonic spectrum can be improved. Our analysis indicates that the generation of the elliptically polarized harmonics can be attributed to the asymmetric emission of ionized electrons in the y direction. By optimizing the laser parameters, an isolated 98-as pulse with an ellipticity up to 0.94 is obtained by the broadband elliptically polarized supercontinuum.

Recent experimental and theoretical progress has put metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunneling nanojunctions in the spotlight of ultrafast science. Waveform-controlled laser fields can induce ultrafast currents in these junctions, opening the door to petahertz electronic operation and attosecond-scale scanning tunneling microscopy. Inspired by our strong-field model for attosecond tunneling microscopy [B. Ma and M. Krüger, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133 , 236901 (2024) ], here we generalize our model to MIM nanojunctions. We introduce several refinements and corrections, accounting for the image potential inside the gap and boundary effects. Moreover, we also find that the Keldysh parameter, which is a hallmark parameter for ultrafast light-matter interactions, alone is insufficient for describing the physics in thin MIM nanojunctions. We introduce a new parameter that accounts for the effects of the limited size of the junction and provide several interpretations of the parameter that shed new light on the complex physics in the light-driven junction. Most strikingly, we find that for photon-assisted tunneling is dominating the ultrafast electron transport across the junction, regardless of the value of the Keldysh parameter. Here one or more photons are absorbed and the electron undergoes static tunneling through the barrier. is required for a regime in which the laser field and the Keldysh parameter dominate the transport. We also discuss the three-step model of electron transport across the nanojunction in the adiabatic regime, the energy cutoff of the transported electrons, and the carrier-envelope phase control of the net current. Our theory model provides a rich toolbox for understanding and predicting the physics of ultrafast MIM nanojunctions.},

  abstract     = {In the tunneling regime and at sufficiently low field amplitudes, the shape of orientation-dependent molecular ionization rate curves usually resembles the shape of the ionized orbital. As the ionizing field strength increases, the shape of the ionization rate can deviate from this pattern. The oft-cited explanation is that the increasing contribution of excited states relative to the ground state modifies the distribution. In this paper we show that orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, which are independent of excited-state effects, can also significantly modify the angular dependence of the yields of widely studied molecules where excited state effects are negligible. For example, as the ionizing field increases we find that (1) in CO, orbital distortion is responsible for the switch of the position of the global maximum in the orientation-dependent ionization rate to the opposite orientation, and (2) in , the interplay between orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transforms a local minimum to a local maximum. To simulate orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, we use the one-electron weak-field asymptotic theory including the first-order correction [OE-WFAT(1)] in the integral representation. Since OE-WFAT(1) incurs expensive computations when the number of orientation angles is large, we also reformulate the original OE-WFAT(1) algorithm into a partial-wave expansion form, which greatly enhances the efficiency of the method.},

The subsequent Larmor precession of the atomic magnetic moment is probed via continuous ionization by an optical dipole trap (ODT) laser. The resulting ionization fragments—photoelectrons and photoions—are detected in coincidence using a cold target recoil ion momentum spectrometer (COLTRIMS). While the ODT facilitates further cooling of the atoms, its continuous-wave laser field does not provide the pulsed timing reference typically required to extract photoelectron momentum distributions in COLTRIMS. Here, we present an extension of the standard COLTRIMS technique that exploits redundancies in the measured data to reconstruct the ionization time.

Spectroscopy of trapped atomic samples can greatly improve the accuracy of these tests. Trapping atomic hydrogen in an optical dipole trap or an optical lattice has never been achieved. Only trapping in magnetic fields that lead to large Zeeman shifts has been demonstrated. Standard techniques of atomic physics are difficult to apply to atomic hydrogen. The small mass of the atom and the large photon energy of the 1 S -2 P cooling transition significantly complicate Doppler cooling. This proposal introduces a photon recoil-assisted loading scheme that uses these properties to our advantage to load atomic hydrogen into an optical dipole trap without laser cooling. The magic wavelength (515 nm) for the 1 S -2 S clock transition (1.3-Hz natural linewidth) is easily accessible with current laser technology. Since the 1 S -2 S clock transition can be driven Doppler free, we do not require a very low temperature. Besides improving spectroscopy for fundamental science, such a system can also be used as a “computable” atomic clock that may one day justify the redefinition of the SI second in terms of the Rydberg constant.},

  abstract     = {Vortex states of photons or electrons are a novel and promising experimental tool across atomic, nuclear, and particle physics. Various experimental schemes to generate high-energy vortex particles have been proposed. However, diagnosing the characteristics of vortex states at high energies remains a significant challenge, as traditional low-energy detection schemes become impractical for high-energy vortex particles due to their extremely short de Broglie wavelength. We recently proposed a novel experimental detection scheme based on a mechanism called superkick that is free from many drawbacks of the traditional methods and can reveal the vortex phase characteristics. In this paper, we present a complete theoretical framework for calculating the superkick effect in elastic Møller scattering and systematically investigate the impact of various factors on its visibility. In particular, we argue that the vortex phase can be identified either by detecting the two scattered electrons in coincidence or by analyzing the characteristic azimuthal asymmetry in individual final particles.},

We tabulate isotope shift coefficients for closed-shell systems from Ne to Og and benchmark selected open-shell cases, used to test the interpolation formula. A simple power-law interpolation reproduces calculated field shifts to within about 1% across the table, with the effective exponent growing from roughly 5 near to about 12 at . Due to the domination of inner shells, differences between neutrals and singly charged ions does not exceed a few percent, becoming noticeable mainly when an outer electron is removed. Therefore, these results may also be used for higher charge ions.},

  abstract     = {We perform real-time time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) simulations with Ehrenfest dynamics to investigate how the incident point and initial kinetic energy of hydrogen atom projectiles influence their interaction with a graphenelike structure. To evaluate the role of electronic excitations, we compare these nonadiabatic results against two adiabatic approaches: Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics and ground-state energy profiling. We find that the incident point strongly affects the hydrogen atom's postcollision kinetic energy, scattering angle, and the vibrational response of the graphene lattice. Trajectories that avoid direct collisions with carbon atoms lead to longer interaction times and reduced energy transfer, increasing the likelihood of hydrogen adsorption by facilitating penetration of the graphene's potential energy barrier. Comparison with adiabatic methods reveals that electronic excitations and other non-adiabatic effects—captured by TDDFT—play a significant role in modulating energy loss and scattering direction. These results underscore the importance of including electron dynamics to accurately model hydrogen-graphene interactions and highlight how both geometric and energetic factors govern adsorption and scattering outcomes.},

Further, by combining our computed NSD-PNC transition amplitudes with a Cs experiment [C. S. Wood et al. , Science 275 , 1759 (1997) ], we extract the value of the nuclear anapole moment and pion-mediated meson-nucleon coupling constant f π . The deviation in our f π from the standard model value could be attributed to the existence of new particles such as Z ′ bosons. By combining our nuclear spin-independent PNC calculation with experiment [ Science 275 , 1759 (1997) ], we extract the mass of the Z ′ boson to be M Z ′ > 1.6 TeV/ c 2 . To check the accuracy of the wave functions used in the calculations, we compute the excitation energies, E 1 transition amplitudes, and magnetic dipole hyperfine constants for ground and low-lying excited states. To improve the accuracy of the computed properties, we incorporate the corrections from the relativistic and QED effects in our calculations. The contributions from triple excitations are accounted for perturbatively. Our results on excitation energies, E 1 transition amplitudes, and hyperfine constants are in good agreement with the available experimental results. Our polarizability results using the FSPRCC theory match well with the experimental values. The values of parity-violating transition amplitudes from our calculations are in general on the lower side of the previous values. From a detailed analysis of electron correlations, we find that the corrections from the Breit interaction and QED effects are important to get accurate results of NSD-PNC amplitudes in Cs. The largest cumulative contribution from the Breit and QED corrections is found to be approximately equal to 3.2% of the total value. The upper bound on the theoretical uncertainty in our calculated NSD-PNC amplitudes is estimated to be about 1%.},

This hyperfine van der Waals interaction occurs between two molecules in two rotational states that differ by one quantum. Normally, this induces resonant dipolar interactions that lead to rapid collisional loss. For specific hyperfine states, however, selection rules prevent this. One can effectively turn off the dipolar interaction by merely flipping a nuclear spin. The resulting van der Waals interaction can be repulsive and can suppress collisional loss. We focus on laser-coolable CaF, but show this effect occurs universally for open-shell molecules, including MgF, SrF, BaF and YO. We propose that this effect could be measured by merging molecules in optical tweezers, where flipping a spin in one of the tweezers enables tuning of collision rates by five orders of magnitude.},

This phenomenon is different from that observed in recent experiments [ Science 370 , 339 (2020) ], which is related to the PMD along the propagation direction of the laser. This phenomenon holds even for H 2 + with short-range Coulomb potentials but disappears for atoms, different from that observed in attoclock experiments. We show that the molecular Coulomb potential near the two atomic centers plays an important role here, and theoretical models associated with a more accurate continuum wave function of the molecule are needed for reproducing this phenomenon. This phenomenon also appears for other molecules such as N 2 . It can be useful for ultrafast probing of molecules with a high resolution of several attoseconds or even zeptoseconds.},

In this work the wave-packet convergent close-coupling method is extended to calculating these cross sections for electrons ejected with energies from 1 to 75.4 eV. The approach utilizes a two-center expansion and correlated two-electron helium wave functions to describe the four-body proton-helium system. While there is good agreement with the experiment for electrons ejected with energies near the matching-velocity point, elsewhere, the results overall do not support the picture provided by the available measurements. Hence, further investigations, both theoretical and experimental, are necessary to resolve the intermediate-energy proton-helium differential ionization problem.},

Moreover, we determine the relative ratio of the two dissociation pathways for each channel. We find that proton emission in the first step of the sequential dissociation is the dominant process (94% branching ratio) for the channel involving the H migration of . It can be explained by the pyridine trication undergoing ultrafast hydrogen migration and forming a more stable -isomeric ion, which attenuates the ring-opening reactions.

  abstract     = {We demonstrate a novel method that integrates quantum state preparation of polar molecular ions and the detection of spatially resolved fluorescence in specific regions to study the high-precision spectroscopy of molecular ions in traps. The detection technique not only enables real-time signal measurement but also suppresses common-mode noise arising from fluorescence fluctuations and reduces the state redistribution induced by blackbody radiation. Thus, this method overcomes the key limitations encountered during quantum state preparation of polar molecules through resonance-enhanced threshold photoionization. By utilizing this approach, we measured the ( ): rovibrational transition of ions, with an unperturbed frequency of 303.396 506 7(20) THz. This value is in excellent agreement with the predictions of quantum electrodynamics (QED). Looking forward, our method could be extended to detect hot-band transitions of excited from highly excited rovibrational states. This provides high-precision tools for determining fundamental constants such as the proton-to-electron mass ratio and for exploring the unknown contributions of QED.},

Conventional approaches for remotely preparing entangled states typically require joint operations on multiple particles at the local site, which poses practical challenges in scalable quantum networks. Here, we propose a general remote quantum state preparation scheme based on an asymmetric maximally entangled state, where only single-particle operations are needed at the local node to prepare arbitrary multiqubit states at the remote site. We demonstrate this scheme experimentally on a linear optical platform, using a three-photon asymmetric entangled state as a resource. By applying single-particle operations on a four-dimensional photonic ququart, we remotely prepare arbitrary two-qubit states with fidelities ranging from 0.8534 to 0.9444, all surpassing the classical threshold. This approach simplifies local control requirements and offers a scalable route for remote entanglement generation in quantum networks and distributed quantum computing.},

Multiphase Hadamard codes, based on coherent-state binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation and decoded using vacuum-or-pulse (VP) detectors, offer a promising approach for achieving high communication rates while relying only on linear optics and single-photon detectors (SPDs). However, their performance does not reach the ultimate Holevo limit. In this work, we propose a generalization of Hadamard codes that distributes the signal across multiple modes with optimized probabilities, rather than concentrating it in a single mode, dubbed probabilistic pulse-position modulation (PPPM). We derive an achievable communication rate, demonstrating that our PPPM can outperform traditional Hadamard codes in certain intermediate energy regimes.},

Hybrid quantum-classical approaches, such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Quantum Subspace Methods, offer practical solutions but face limitations in circuit depth and measurement overhead. In this article, we propose a variational strategy based on symmetry-preserving cost functions to iteratively construct a reduced subspace for the extraction of low-lying energy states. We show that, under certain conditions, our approach leads to a tridiagonal representation similar to that obtained with the Lanczos algorithm. The iterative process allows control over the trade-off between circuit depth, the number of variational parameters, and the number of measurements required to achieve the desired accuracy, making it suitable for current quantum hardware. As a proof of concept, we test the proposed algorithms on a H 4 chain and ring, targeting both the ground-state energy and the charge gap.},

We employ multichannel message-passing neural networks, with each channel tailored to address a specific error type. Our neural-network model is trained to minimize the weighted sum of different errors, based on frequency-dependent error models, e.g., two-level-system defects that affect individual qubits, quantum crosstalk that depends on the graph structure formed by qubit couplings, and microwave crosstalk that relies on the spatial arrangement of qubits. The trained neural-network model is adaptable to chips with varying qubit arrangements and scales. Recognizing the diverse experimental conditions of different chips, we compare our algorithm with the snake algorithm across various scales and error weights, providing valuable guidance for experimenters in algorithm selection.

  abstract     = {Ultracold polar molecules trapped in optical lattices or tweezer arrays are an emerging platform for quantum information processing and quantum simulation, thanks to their rich internal structure and long-range dipolar interactions. Recent experimental breakthroughs have enabled precise control over individual molecules, paving the way for implementing two-qubit quantum gates, based on the iSWAP gate. A key challenge is, however, the sensitivity to variations of the dipole-dipole interaction strength—stemming from motion of the molecules and uncertainty on the precise positioning of external confining potentials—that limits current gate fidelities. To address this, we develop a quantum optimal control framework, based on a perturbative approach, to design gates that are robust with respect to quasistatic deviations of either system Hamiltonian parameters, external control parameters, or both, and provide criteria to evaluate a priori whether a gate can be made robust for a given control Hamiltonian. By applying these criteria to exchange-coupled qubits, as polar molecules, we demonstrate that robustness cannot be achieved with global controls only, but can be attained by breaking the exchange symmetry through local controls, such as a local detuning. We determine the robust time-optimal solution for realizing an iSWAP gate, show that the control pulses can be designed to be smooth functions, and achieve theoretical gate fidelities compatible with error correction using reasonable experimental parameters. Additionally, we show that certain entangled-state preparations, such as Bell states, can be made robust even with global controls only. We demonstrate that, under the adiabatic approximation, i.e., where molecular motion occurs on timescales comparable to, or faster, than that of the exchange interaction, the noise arising from thermal motion can be effectively treated as quasistatic variations of Hamiltonian parameters. This allows us to extend our treatment to the concrete experimental case of polar molecules.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multilevel qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in nonlocal operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the nonlocality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. Notably, for superconducting devices, the control complexity of qudits compared to qubits does not increase prohibitively for four-level systems, making them practical for near-term demonstrations, though control challenges grow with increasing dimensionality. Therefore, we provide solutions to the operator decompositions of the Trotterized quantum dynamics into one- and two-qudit gates for all mappings. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t − V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Finally, we show the connection between the plaquette constraint of our mapping and the Z 2 toric code. This connection can be exploited to prove that the ground state of the localized qudit mapping can be efficiently prepared using quantum circuits or measurement-based feedback control. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.},

In this work, measurement-based braiding about MZM Y junctions is simulated by multiqubit parity measurements of a logical qubit.

  abstract     = {Quantum coherence is critical resource for applications in quantum technology, among which quantum-enhanced sensing represents a typical example. Compared with quantum metrology with entangled states of multiple qubits, bosonic interferometers have the advantage of being hardware efficient, enabled by the infinite-dimension Hilbert space of bosonic modes. Phase estimations with precisions approaching the Heisenberg limit have been demonstrated with superpositions of Fock states of single bosonic modes. We here present a scheme for realizing quantum metrology based on a fundamentally distinct kind of superposition states, Schrödinger cat states, defined as quantum superpositions of two quasiclassial states of a bosonic mode. The interferometer aims to estimate the frequency shift of a photonic mode with respect to a reference frequency, which produces a phase-space rotation. We find that such a phase-space rotation can be extracted with a qubit, without mapping the state of the photonic mode to the qubit. This phase-space rotation is directly related to the qubit's population through the combination of a phase-space displacement, a dispersive qubit-photon interaction, and two qubit rotations. The signal-to-noise ratio exhibits a scaling approaching the Heisenberg limit, like interferometers based on Fock state superpositions, but without requiring a step-by-step procedure to prepare the resource state.},

  abstract     = {Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamond offer a promising platform for quantum information processing due to their room-temperature spin coherence and optical addressability. However, scalable quantum processors remain limited by the challenge of achieving strong, controllable interactions between distant NV spins. Here, we propose a scalable architecture utilizing optically levitated nanodiamond arrays, where torsional vibrations mediate the coherent coupling between the embedded NV centers. By optimizing the shape of ellipsoidal nanoparticles, we achieve a light-induced coupling strength exceeding 119 kHz between torsional modes of the distant levitated nanodiamonds, which are two orders of magnitude larger than the typical decoherence rates in this system. This strong interaction, combined with magnetic-field-enabled spin-torsion coupling, establishes an effective interaction between the spatially separated NV centers in the distant nanodiamonds. Numerical simulations confirm that dynamic decoupling can suppress both thermal noise and spin dephasing, enabling two-qubit gates with fidelity exceeding 99%. This work provides a foundation for reconfigurable quantum hybrid systems, with potential applications in rotational sensing and programmable quantum processing.},

  abstract     = {The computation of dynamical response functions is central to many problems in condensed matter physics. Owing to the rapid growth of quantum correlations following a quench, classical methods face significant challenges even if an efficient description of the equilibrium state is available. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative. However, existing approaches often assume access to the equilibrium state, which may be difficult to prepare in practice. In this work, we present a method that circumvents this by using energy filter techniques, enabling the computation of response functions and other dynamical properties in both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. Our approach only requires the preparation of states that have significant weight at the desired energy. The dynamical response functions are then reconstructed from measurements after quenches of varying duration by classical postprocessing. We illustrate the algorithm numerically by applying it to compute the dynamical conductivity of a free-fermion model, which unveils the energy-dependent localization properties of the model.},

Using quantum estimation theory, we demonstrate that the ultimate limit for estimating the separation between two unequal-brightness thermal sources via interferometry remains constant, enabling the potential for superresolution. We give a comparative analysis of two primary stellar interferometric schemes: amplitude interferometry and intensity interferometry. Notably, the nulling strategy employed in amplitude interferometry, a configuration specifically proposed for exoplanet detection by leveraging destructive interference to suppress the brighter source, is quantum optimal for separation estimation. While intensity interferometry is less effective than amplitude interferometry in lossless scenarios and fails to achieve superresolution, it becomes competitive when optical loss in large-scale interferometry is considered. By applying these methodologies to modern stellar interferometry, we highlight the promise of large-scale interferometry for advancing high-resolution astronomical observation.},

  abstract     = {Quantum error mitigation (QEM) schemes have greatly enhanced the performance of quantum computers, mostly by reducing errors caused by interactions with the environment. Nevertheless, the presence of coherence errors, typically arising from miscalibration and interqubit crosstalk, is a significant challenge to the scalability of quantum computing. Such errors are often addressed using a refined Pauli twirling scheme called randomized compiling (RC) that converts the coherent errors into incoherent errors that can then be mitigated by conventional QEM. Unfortunately for multiqubit gates, RC is restricted to Clifford gates such as cnot and cphase . However, it has been demonstrated experimentally that a direct implementation of multiqubit non-Clifford gates, i.e., without using multiqubit Clifford gates, has reduced the depth of the circuit by a factor of four and more. Recently, a framework called pseudotwirling (PST) for treating coherent error in multiqubit non-Clifford gates has been introduced and experimentally demonstrated. We show analytically that a higher-order correction to the existing PST theory yields an over-rotation coherent error generated by the PST protocol itself. This PST effect has no analog in RC. Although the small induced over-rotation can amount to a significant coherent error in deep circuits, we explain why it does not degrade the performance of the gate. Interestingly, we find that a simplified twirling scheme that was introduced and exploited experimentally by Kim et al . also displays an induced over-rotation. We study the conditions under which the two twirling schemes display the same over-rotation behavior.},

Consequently, there is a correspondence between qubit count and the size of the native gate set. One might then wonder, what is the smallest number of auxiliary qubits that still allows for universal parity computing? Here, we demonstrate that the answer is 1 if the number of logical qubits is even, and 2 otherwise. Furthermore, we present a sufficient condition for a given parity gate set to be universal. This leads to a variety of different universal parity gate sets corresponding to different numbers of auxiliary qubits and more generally contributes to the understanding of which entangling gates are required to augment the set of single-qubit unitaries to perform universal quantum computing. As a consequence, we obtain (i) minimal implementations of the parity framework on, e.g., a triangular lattice, (ii) hardware-specific implementations of the parity flow framework on, e.g., a heavy-hex lattice, and (iii) novel universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation.},

Here, we treat them on equal footing in controlling a finite-dimensional quantum system under a time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which is inspired by the D'Alembert principle of regarding active force, constraint force, and inertial force in an unbiased way. Under the biorthogonal condition, the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian could be triangularized in a constraint picture spanned by a set of completed and orthonormal basis states, which is found to be a sufficient condition to construct at least one universal nonadiabatic passage in both bra and ket spaces. The passage ends up with a desired target state that is automatically normalized without artificial normalization in the existing treatments for non-Hermitian quantum systems. Moreover, the passage is found to be robust against the parametric deviation when the real part of its global phase is rapidly varying with time. Our protocol is explicitly verified for the perfect population transfer in the two-level system and the chiral population transfer in the three-level system. It generalizes our framework of universal quantum control to the field of the biorthogonal quantum mechanics.},

However, in realistic scenarios, we show that QRE scales logarithmically with the inverse of the thermal-noise mean photon number. We propose a receiver that achieves this scaling and quantify its performance gains over existing methods.

However, existing IGTBQC protocols lack mechanisms for clients to verify the correctness of computation results and deal with only one type of clients capable of preparing qubits. To address these limitations, we first extend the current IGTBQC protocol to be a verifiable one and then propose another verifiable IGTBQC protocol tailored for a different type of clients with the capability of measuring single-qubit states. Furthermore, both protocols are shown to satisfy blindness and verification simultaneously in a relatively formal way.

  abstract     = {This study investigates the entanglement dynamics of a bipartite system comprising two two-level atoms, initially prepared in a pure entangled state and independently coupled to spatially separated cavities under local squeezed thermal environments. We demonstrate that environmental interactions induce entanglement sudden death (ESD), leading to the abrupt loss of quantum correlations. To mitigate this effect, we propose a protocol involving local unitary operations—X gate and XX gate —applied to the time-evolved state. We further analyze the impact of these operations under symmetric and asymmetric probability amplitudes of the atomic states, considering variations in thermal and squeezing parameters across different reservoirs. Our results show that these operations extend entanglement duration in specific reservoir conditions, while in the case of a vacuum reservoir, they transform ESD into asymptotic decay for both symmetric and asymmetric probability amplitudes of the atomic states. Moreover, independent variations of the thermal and squeezing parameters in each reservoir influence the dynamics of local gate operations, thereby affecting the overall entanglement evolution. Additionally, applying these operations at an earlier stage of the system's evolution can further delay ESD. This scheme offers valuable insights into entanglement behavior and its resilience under various noisy environmental conditions.},

  abstract     = {Quantum machine learning (QML) requires significant quantum resources to address practical real-world problems. When the underlying quantum information exhibits hierarchical structures in the data, limitations persist in training complexity and generalization. Research should prioritize both the efficient design of quantum architectures and the development of learning strategies to optimize resource usage. We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning (Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or data to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. Q-CurL exhibits robustness to noise and data limitations, which is particularly relevant for current and near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We achieve this through a curriculum design based on quantum data density ratios and a dynamic learning schedule that prioritizes the most informative quantum data. Empirical evidence shows that Q-CurL significantly enhances training convergence and generalization for unitary learning and improves the robustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Q-CurL is effective with physical learning applications in physics and quantum chemistry.},

Device-independent conference key agreement (DI-CKA) is multipartite DI-QKD in which more than two parties share a common secure key. The performance of DI-CKA, however, is strictly limited because of its susceptibility to losses due to, e.g., imperfect detection efficiency and channel transmission. Here, we propose a DI-CKA protocol which reduces this limitation by using a heralding scheme to distribute multipartite entanglement. We analyze key rates of our protocol for two different measurement scenarios, and we show that our protocol outperforms a previous DI-CKA protocol even with an experimentally feasible measurement.},

In this work, we construct a sequence of physically feasible dynamical decoupling operators for the three-level system to mitigate not only the transverse dephasing between the excited state and ground states, but also the longitudinal relaxation among them. Combining the Hamiltonian engineering and our constructed dynamical decoupling sequence, we further realize the dynamical decoupling protection of qutrit-based quantum gates.

Inspired by the importance sampling technique applied to sampling Pauli measurements for DFE, we show that similar strategies can be derived from classical shadows. Specifically, we describe efficient methods using only local Pauli measurements to perform DFE with Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ), and Dicke states, establishing tighter bounds (by factors of 14.22 and 16 for GHZ and /Dicke, respectively) on the number of measurements required for desired precision. These protocols are derived by adjusting the distribution of observables. Notably, they require no preprocessing steps other than the sampling algorithms.},

It is found that if we define the evolution speed of a quantum unitary system as the changing rate of the path distance between a quantum state and the state during its evolution, the instantaneous evolution speed is determined by the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues, rather than its expectation value or variance imposed on any quantum state. More specifically, the range of the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues determines the evolution speed of a quantum system through the relation ω H = 1 2 ( λ max − λ min ) , which is independent of the quantum state. Given an initial state ρ 0 in a quantum unitary system, the minimum time required to evolve it to a target state ρ τ is τ min = L min ( ρ 0 , ρ τ ) ω H , where L min ( ρ 0 , ρ τ ) is the path distance contained in the shortest evolution from ρ 0 to ρ τ .

Our findings suggest that evaluating the performance of quantum variational circuits against variational circuits with subuniversal gate sets is a valuable benchmark for identifying areas where quantum variational circuits can excel.},

  abstract     = {The difficulty of training variational quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning models is well established. In particular, quantum loss landscapes are often highly nonconvex and dominated by poor local minima. While this renders their training NP hard in general, efficient heuristics that work well for typical instances may still exist. Here we propose a protocol that uses a targeted noise injection to smooth and regularize quantum loss landscapes. It works by exponentially suppressing the high-frequency components in the Fourier expansion of the quantum loss function. The protocol can be efficiently implemented in both hardware and simulations. We observe significant and robust improvements of solution quality across various problem types. Our method can be combined with existing techniques mitigating the local minima, such as the quantum natural gradient optimizer, and adds to the toolbox of methods for optimizing quantum loss functions.},

  abstract     = {In the scenario of the probe-ancilla interaction, we propose a quantum metrology protocol by the unconditional measurement on the ancillary qubit after an optimized period of joint evolution from a product state. Its key element is the construction of two parallel evolution paths by the measurement that can transform the probe system (a spin ensemble) from an eigenstate of a collective angular momentum operator | 𝑗 , 𝑚 ⟩ to a superposed state ( | 𝑗 , 𝑚 ⟩ + | 𝑗 , − 𝑚 ⟩ ) / ⁢ √ 2 . With synchronous parametric encoding and qubit measurement, the quantum Fisher information about the phase encoded in the probe system with optimized initial states can exactly attain the Heisenberg scaling 𝑁 2 with respect to the probe size (spin number) 𝑁 . The quadratic scaling behavior is not sensitive to the imprecise control over the joint evolution time, the time delay between encoding and measurement, and the coherence in the probe ensemble or the ancillary system that would be degraded by local dephasing. The classical Fisher information of the spin ensemble is found to saturate with its quantum counterpart, irrespective of the idle joint evolution after the parametric encoding. We suggest that both Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states and nonlinear Hamiltonian are not necessary resources for exceeding the standard quantum limit in metrology precision since in our protocol even thermal states can hold an asymptotic quadratic scaling.},

In this work, a protocol for quantum noise spectroscopy is presented by qudit spectators, that are arbitrary -level quantum systems passively spectating noises, which possess stochastic and stationary Gaussian distributions. The protocol uses Weyl basis decomposition, consisting of generalized Pauli matrices, as the theoretical tool, and the Alvarez-Suter noise spectroscopy method, by which the qudit is being exposed to a series of pulse sequences, and the noise polyspectra is extracted by multiple measurements of an observable of the qudit. The formalism is further developed and simulated for three theoretical frameworks: The first two frameworks utilize a simplified Weyl basis and are capable of detecting -type dephasing noise. One is specifically modeled for a qutrit ( = 3), and the second framework is designed for all qudits and has been tested through simulations of a ququad ( = 4) and a quoct ( = 8). The third framework employs the full Weyl basis, enabling it to identify all types of XYZ -dephasing noise. The simulations for this framework have been conducted for a quoct ( = 8) implemented by the antimony atom. The analytical protocol for noise spectroscopy that has been introduced transforms qudit systems into quantum spectators, and the presented simulations demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of this noise spectroscopy protocol.},

In the present work, we address this task by treating the execution of quantum algorithms as the time evolution of an idealized physical system.

In particular, the time evolution of the idealized system obeys a corresponding Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy of equations. This is the basis for the novel error mitigation scheme that we propose. Specifically, we employ a subset of the BBGKY hierarchy as supplementary constraints in the zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) method for error mitigation. We ensure that the computational cost of the scheme scales polynomially with the system size. We test our method on digital quantum simulations of the lattice Schwinger model under noise levels mimicking realistic quantum hardware. We demonstrate that our scheme systematically improves the error mitigation for the measurements of the particle number and the charge within this system. Relative to ZNE, we obtain an average reduction of the error by ( 18.2 ± 0.5 ) % and ( 52.8 ± 6.3 ) % for the respective above observables.

We find that the unit effectively removes leakage with minimal effect on the qubit subspace by taking advantage of energy level disorder for the qubit subspace and resonant leakage energy levels. There are two optimal measurement rates for removing leakage, which we show analytically to correspond to the characteristic timescales of the propagation and disintegration of the leakage excitation. The performance of the leakage removal unit depends on the strength of disorder, coupling between the transmons, and the length of the array. We simulate the system under experimentally feasible parameters and present an optimal configuration.

Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have gained significant attention as promising candidates in this pursuit, particularly for combinatorial optimization problems. While reports of their challenges and limitations continue to accumulate, many studies remain optimistic based on small-scale, idealized testing setups, leaving doubt about the scalability of VQAs for large-scale problems. We systematically investigate this scaling behavior by analyzing how classical optimizers minimize variational quantum loss functions for random Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization instances in the presence of uncertainty, modeled as effective Gaussian noise. We find that the critical noise threshold for successful optimization decreases rapidly as system size grows. This decline exceeds what can be explained solely by shrinking loss variance, confirming deeper, fundamental limitations in the loss landscapes of VQAs beyond barren plateaus. Translating these thresholds into required measurement shots reveals that achieving sufficient precision in the evaluated loss values quickly becomes impractical, even for moderatelysized problems. Our findings demonstrate serious scalability challenges for VQAs in optimization stemming from mere uncertainty, indicating potential barriers to achieving practical quantum advantage with current hybrid approaches.},

If a relative comparison between quantum states can be made, this gives rise to a partial order, where states are ordered according to their suitability to act as a resource. In the literature, various different partial orders for a variety of quantum resources have been proposed. In discrete variable systems, vector majorization of Wigner functions in discrete phase space provides a natural partial order between quantum states. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) by Van Herstraeten et al. [ Quantum 7 , 1021 (2023) ]. In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general N -mode case. In addition, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. For the special case of the convex hull of N -mode Gaussian states, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, and Cerf. We also prove a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization.},

  abstract     = {Geometric phases depend only on the evolution path determined by the closed circuit in the projective Hilbert space but not on evolution details of the quantum system, leading to geometric quantum computation possessing some intrinsic robustness against control errors. Coordinated with dynamical decoupling, geometric quantum computation admits additional resilience to the environment-induced decoherence. However, the previous schemes of geometric quantum computation protected by dynamical decoupling require multiple physical qubits to encode a logical qubit, which undoubtedly increases the consumption of physical-qubit resources and the difficulty in the implementation of the logical-qubit manipulation based on physical-qubit driving. In this work, we put forward a scheme of decoherence-mitigated geometric quantum computation based only on physical qubits rather than logical qubits, hence avoiding the additional overhead of physical-qubit resources for logical-qubit encoding as well as the difficulty in the manipulation of logical qubits. Moreover, our scheme focuses on the most general interaction between an individual qubit and its environment so that it mitigates not just dephasing noise but rather regular decoherence. Our proposal thus represents a more realistic and effective approach towards the realization of geometric control with decoherence mitigation.},

  abstract     = {The quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement is one of the most studied quantum measurement procedures. Usually, such a process involves the coupling of a single system of interest, called signal, with a single probe system, so that the relevant information in the signal system is indirectly measured by observing the probe system. Here we extend the concept of quantum nondemolition interaction to the cases in which the signal and the probe systems are each one multipartite continuous-variable system. Specifically, we propose a general scheme that performs the multipartite QND interactions, relying on beam-splitter couplings between the signal and probe modes with only two ancillary modes prepared offline in squeezed states. The scheme is also composed of homodyne detection and feedforward modulation. The ancillary modes are detected in the process, providing photocurrents for postmodulation of the output systems, as well as sufficient information to calculate genuine multipartite entanglement conditions of the input systems and to monitor similar conditions of the output systems.},

Recently the study of quantum correlations in networks has undergone remarkable progress owing to technological development towards scalable quantum networks. However, compared to the standard Bell scenario, manifestation of the interplay between these two aspects has received less attention in network scenarios featuring independent sources. In this work we have analyzed the relation between entanglement content of the sources and detectable non- -locality in two distinct network topologies (linear and star). We have studied the extremal violations of -local inequalities (compatible with linear and star network) for any fixed amount of entanglement (in terms of concurrence) of the independent sources. It is observed that each of the sources must be entangled for detecting non- -locality in a linear network. However, the same is not true for star -local network. The present analysis reveals that entanglement of all the independent sources is not a necessity for generation of non- -local correlations in star topology. Characterization of sources in terms of the minimum entanglement requirement for any fixed violation amount of the -local inequalities is also provided. Interestingly, detection of non- -locality is ensured in the network if product of concurrence of all the sources involved exceeds},

Our main results are the following bounds on the relative entropy of entanglement after evolution: , connecting it on one side to the initial relative entropy of coherence and information extractable from the environment and on the other side to the decoherence strength, making the statement that larger entanglement leads to more decoherence quantitatively precise. As an illustration, we apply our results to the spin-boson model, where a qubit interacts with a bosonic bath, showing the time evolution of the entanglement and the crossover between Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Our results help us better understand and quantify the complicated correlations produced during open evolution, which will hopefully lead to better and new decoherence-mitigation techniques.},

This duration is referred to as the lifetime of a quantum system. In this paper, we investigate the lifetime of a two-level atomic system undergoing spontaneous emission. We construct an exact statistical ensemble of the lifetimes for two-level systems using quantum reliability theory, incorporating comprehensive information such as mean values, fluctuations, and non-classical properties. Notably, we demonstrate that the ensemble exhibits can be represented by a density matrix, which is recorded in the monitoring apparatus by an observation process. Under the Born-Markov approximation, the diagonal elements decay exponentially at a state-dependent rate related to quantum fidelity. Beyond this approximation, the off-diagonal elements arise from interference between radiation pathways and are determined by the first-order coherence of the field. This feature indicates that the off-diagonal elements encode spectral information beyond the Markovian decay rate, suggesting a potential protocol for probing the environmental spectral density using two-level atoms.},

Next, we consider a single defect in a topologically nontrivial lattice with time-reversal symmetry based on the nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger configuration. We unveil how topologically nontrivial defect states and non-Hermiticity interplay by competing with each other, exhibiting a transition from topologically nontrivial defect states to skin states.

In addition to the conventional time-conditional (Schrödinger) wave function ψ ( x , y , z | t ) , we introduce space-conditional wave functions such as ϕ ( t , y , z | x ) , where x plays the role of the evolution parameter. The function ϕ ( t , y , z | x ) represents the probability amplitude for the particle to arrive on the plane x = constant at time t and transverse position ( y , z ) . More generally, within our framework, any coordinate x μ ∈ { t , x , y , z } can be conveniently chosen as the evolution parameter, depending on the experimental context. This leads to a unified formalism governed by a generalized Schrödinger-type equation P ̂ μ | ϕ μ ( x μ ) 〉 = i ℏ η μ ν d d x ν | ϕ μ ( x μ ) 〉 . It reproduces standard QM when x μ = t , with | ϕ 0 ( x 0 ) 〉 = | ψ ( t ) 〉 , and recovers the STS extension when x μ = x i ∈ { x , y , z } . For a free particle, we show that ϕ ( t , y , z | x ) = 〈 t , y , z | ϕ ( x ) 〉 naturally reproduces the same dependence on the momentum wave function as the axiomatic Kijowski distribution. Possible experimental tests of these predictions are discussed. Finally, we demonstrate that the different states | ϕ μ ( x μ ) 〉 can emerge by conditioning (i.e., projecting) a timeless and spaceless physical state onto the eigenstate | x μ 〉 , leading to constraint equations of the form P ̂ μ | Φ μ 〉 = 0 . Rather than privileging time as the sole evolution parameter, this formulation treats all coordinates on equal footing.},

Recent advancements in randomized measurement techniques have provided fresh insights in this area. Specifically, protocols such as classical shadow tomography and shadow overlap have been proposed. Building on these developments, we investigate the fundamental properties of schemes that certify pure quantum states through random local Haar measurements. We derive bounds for sample fluctuations that are applicable regardless of the specific estimator construction. These bounds depend on the operator size distribution of either the observable used to estimate fidelity or the valid variation of the reduced density matrix for arbitrary observables. Our results unveil the intrinsic interplay between operator complexity and the efficiency of quantum algorithms, serving as an obstacle to local certification of pure states with long-range entanglement.},

The resulting spin precession dynamics induced by the gauge potential are analyzed with and without the adiabatic approximation. Under this approximation, the surface topology is linked to the rotation angle of spin orientation along a surface boundary and to the pseudomagnetic flux. Spin texture evolution along helices illustrates distinct behaviors under geodesic versus nongeodesic propagation. Furthermore, the spin evolution along Viviani's curve exemplifies surface dependence. The curve's topology ensures closure of the spin direction and independence of the spin from the path direction.

However, previous realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of polarization, either spontaneous or induced. Here we introduce a class of prethermal DTCs termed “unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals” (UPDTCs) that arise without any uniform or staggered polarization and propose an experiment to observe them in current trapped-ion quantum simulators. By studying a model of trapped ions using a quantum circuit simulator, we demonstrate that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization, even though its expectation value does not exhibit such dynamics. The period-doubled dynamics is not explained by the classical picture of flipping spins but by quantum fluctuations. We establish that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, a hallmark of prethermalization. These results expand the known phenomenology and mechanism of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases.},

We prove that the degree of degeneracy at any given state corresponds to the degree of degeneracy of the symplectic form when restricted to the manifold of states that are locally unitary equivalent with . Additionally, we provide a physical interpretation of this symplectic indicator of entanglement, articulating it as an inherent ambiguity within the associated classical dynamical framework. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of symplectic geometry in elucidating entanglement properties in quantum mechanics and suggest avenues for further exploration into the geometric structures underlying quantum state spaces.},

Lett. 134 , 220402 (2025) ] introduced the ergotropic Mpemba effect in quantum batteries governed by Markovian dynamics, highlighting the anomalous phenomenon where batteries in higher ergotropy states discharge faster than those in lower ergotropy states. Building on this foundation, our research proposes an all-optical scheme to realize the ergotropic Mpemba effect in open quantum systems, and further investigates its implications in systems exhibiting non-Markovian dynamics. We find that the ergotropic Mpemba effect persists in non-Markovian dynamics. In the strong non-Markovian regime, prior to the occurrence of the ergotropic Mpemba effect, the ergotropy evolution shows multiple crossings, which we refer to as the quasiergotropic Mpemba effect . Moreover, we derive the analytical solution for the critical point at which the ergotropic Mpemba effect occurs, and we establish the necessary conditions for this effect to emerge. Finally, we propose an experimental scheme based on continuous-variable quantum circuits to realize our theoretical prediction.},

Irrespective of the initial state, the battery can be eventually stabilized at the maximal-ergotropy state as long as the charger-battery interaction is present. We use a Dyson series of Lindbladian superoperator to obtain an effective master equation for the battery, which is found to be equivalent to the high-order Fermi's golden rule adapted to the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and spontaneous decay. We extract the optimization condition for charging efficiency and justify it in the finite-size battery with uniform energy splitting, the large spin battery, and the truncated harmonic-oscillator battery.},

We investigate both a two-qubit system, with swap and controlled- not gates, and -qubit systems, configured either in an Ising spin chain or with all-to-all interactions. We demonstrate that these dynamics exhibit atypical quantum behavior, such as nonlinearity and non-Markovianity. Furthermore, we find that these dynamics depend on the initial coarse-grained state and establish conditions for general microscopic dynamics under which linearity is preserved. As the effective dynamics induced by our coarse-grained description of many-body quantum systems diverge from conventional quantum behavior, we anticipate that this approach could aid in describing the quantum-to-classical transition and provide deeper insights into the effects of coarse graining on quantum systems.},

Here, we propose a protocol for realizing DTQWs in multidimensional networks, which accommodate nodes with different numbers of neighbors. Using this protocol, we numerically simulate a Grover walk search algorithm in a cubic network with circuit QED. Our simulations, which consider decoherence, align well with theoretical predictions.

Second, we prove that, under the right conditions, this leakage remains small eternally . That is, we derive a time-independent bound on the leakage itself, expressed in terms of the spectral gap of the unperturbed Hamiltonian and the norm of the perturbation, ensuring its validity for arbitrarily large times.

Discussions around such devices often assume the measurement step to be instantaneous, assessing its cost by Landauer's information erasure within the measurement device. While this simplified perspective is sufficient for classical feedback-controlled engines, for nanoengines that often operate in the quantum realm, the overall performance may be significantly affected by the measurement duration (which may be comparable to the engine's cycle time) and cost (energy needed to create the system-meter correlation). In this study, we employ a generalized von Neumann measurement model to highlight that obtaining a finite amount of information requires a finite measurement time and incurs an energetic cost. We investigate the crucial role of these factors in determining the engine's performance, particularly in terms of efficiency and power output. Furthermore, for the information engine model under consideration, we establish a precise relationship between the acquired information in the measurement process and the maximum energy extractable through the measurement.

  abstract     = {Characterizing the statistical properties of classical interacting particle systems is a long-standing question. For Brownian particles, the microscopic density obeys a stochastic evolution equation, known as the Dean-Kawasaki equation. This equation remains mostly formal and linearization (or higher-order expansions) is required to obtain explicit expressions for physical observables, with a range of validity not easily defined. Here, by combining macroscopic fluctuation theory with equilibrium statistical mechanics, we provide a systematic alternative to the Dean-Kawasaki framework to characterize large-scale correlations. This approach enables us to obtain explicit and exact results for the large-scale behavior of dynamical observables such as tracer cumulants and bath-tracer correlations in one dimension, both in and out of equilibrium. In particular, we reveal a generic nonmonotonic spatial structure in the response of the bath following a temperature quench. Our approach applies to a broad class of interaction potentials and extends naturally to higher dimensions.},

Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters α and D , we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean-squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation D ∝ exp ( α c 1 + c 2 ) for which we provide the exact expression. We compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.

  abstract     = {We present a theory for the relaxation time of the octupole order parameter in nanoscale chiral antiferromagnets (AFMs) coupled to thermal baths and spin injection sources. Using stochastic spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the octupole moment relaxes through two distinct mechanisms—escape over a barrier and precessional dephasing—as the barrier for octupole fluctuations is lowered relative to the thermal energy. Notably, the octupole moment relaxes orders of magnitude faster than the typical dipolar order parameters, reaching picosecond timescales. By combining Langer’s theory with an effective low-energy description of octupole dynamics in chiral AFMs, we derive analytical expressions for the relaxation times. We find that relaxation in chiral AFMs parallels dipole relaxation in magnets, with exchange fields serving the role of the dipole fields. Further, by drawing on the analogy between order parameter dynamics in magnets under spin injection and current-biased Josephson junctions, we propose a new scheme for electrically tuning the octupole relaxation times. Our Letter offers fundamental insights for the development of next-generation spintronic devices that harness octupole order parameters for information encoding.},

Its sign and strength often determine crucial properties of magnetic objects, like their topology or how they can be manipulated with currents. A few experimental techniques are currently available to measure DMI quantitatively, based on the study of domain walls, spin waves, or spin-orbit torques. In this Letter, we propose a qualitative variant of spin wave methods. We rely on magnetic noise from confined thermal spin waves in domain walls and skyrmions in perpendicularly magnetized thin films, which we probe with scanning nitrogen-vacancy center relaxometry. We show both numerically and experimentally that the sign of the DMI can be inferred from the amplitude of the detected noise, which is affected by the nonreciprocity in the spin wave dispersion. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the noise distribution around the contour of magnetic skyrmions reveals their Néel or Bloch nature, giving therefore also insight into the strength of DMI involved in their stabilization.},

We observe a drastic contrast in magnetoresistance behavior between the low- and high-carrier density regimes. Through a combination of experiment and modeling, we identify magnetically driven carrier concentration modulation and mobility modulation as the dominant mechanisms governing magnetoresistance in the respective regimes.

In structurally pristine single crystals, we show that C 3 symmetry-breaking in-plane uniaxial strains do not affect the order’s magnetic neutron diffraction signals. We further show that c -axis propagating light exhibits large Faraday rotations in the ordered state due to the spin vorticity, the sign of which can be trained via the system’s ferrimagnetic moment.

  abstract     = {Bulk-boundary correspondence is the foundational principle of topological physics, first established in the quantum Hall effect, where a D -dimensional topologically nontrivial bulk gives rise to ( D − 1 )-dimensional boundary states. The advent of higher-order topology has generalized this principle to a hierarchical chain, enabling topological states to appear at ( D − 2 ) or even lower-dimensional boundaries. To date, all known realizations of topological systems must require a topologically nontrivial bulk to initiate the chain of action for bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, in an acoustic crystal platform, we experimentally demonstrate an exception to this paradigm—embedded topology in a trivial bulk—where the bulk-boundary correspondence originates from a trivial bulk. Rather than relying on global symmetries, we employ projective crystal symmetry, which induces nontrivial topology not at the outset in the D -dimensional bulk, but midway through the correspondence hierarchy in lower-dimensional boundaries. We further realize a three-dimensional system exhibiting embedded topology that supports zero-dimensional topological states, achieving the longest possible chain of action for such an unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence in physical space. Our Letter experimentally establishes a new form of bulk-boundary correspondence initiated from a trivial bulk, opening additional degrees of freedom for the design of robust topological devices.},

Moreover, we provide exact K -theoretical classifications of topological insulators over these platycosms by the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, and formulate a complete set of topological invariants for their identification. Topological phase transitions are generically characterized by Weyl semimetals, adhering to the generalized Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem: the total chirality number over a Brillouin platycosm is even (zero) if the platycosm is nonorientable (orientable).

We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states on lattices as large as 10 × 10 sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface.

To explain this observation, we study the role of electron-electron interactions in driving flavor symmetry breaking, using the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation, and in stabilizing superconductivity mediated by repulsive interactions. Though mean-field HF correctly predicts the isospin flavors and reproduces the experimental phase diagram, it overestimates the band renormalization near the Fermi energy and suppresses superconducting instabilities. To address this, we introduce a physically motivated scheme that includes internal screening in the HF calculation. Using this formalism, we find superconductivity arising from the spin-valley polarized phase, on the electron-doped side, for a range of electric fields and electron dopings. Our findings reproduce the experimental observations and reveal a p -wave, finite-momentum, time-reversal-symmetry-broken superconducting state, encouraging further investigation into exotic phases in graphene multilayers.},

After laser excitation, impact ionization is observed, with its occurrence depending on both the staggered potential and the laser pump frequency. By analyzing the time evolution of the kinetic, ionic, and Coulomb interaction energies, we identify a novel mechanism for impact ionization, in which excess ionic potential energy is converted into additional double occupancy—distinct from the conventional mechanism where excess kinetic energy drives this process. We further reveal that impact ionization arises from interference between excited states driven by photon excitations of the same order.

  abstract     = {Halide perovskites are known for their rich phase diagram and superior performance in diverse optoelectronics applications. The latter property is often attributed to the long electron-hole recombination time, whose underlying physical mechanism has been a long-standing controversy. In this Letter, we investigate the transport and localization properties of electron and hole carriers in a prototypical halide perovskite ( CsPbBr 3 ), through ab initio tight-binding nonadiabatic dynamics approach for large-scale (tens of nm size) supercell calculations, to simulate electron and ion dynamics on the same footing. We found distinct structural, lattice polarization, and electron-phonon coupling properties at low (below 100 K) and high temperatures, consistent with experimental observations. In particular, at low temperature we find spontaneous formation of polar grain boundaries in the nonpolar bulk systems, which result in two-dimensional polarization patterns that serve to localize and separate electrons and holes. We reveal phonon-assisted variable-range hopping mostly responsible for low-temperature transport, and their characteristic frequency correlates with temperature-dependent phonon power spectrum and energy oscillation frequency in nonadiabatic dynamics. We answer the critical questions of long electron-hole recombination lifetime at low temperature and offer the correlation among polarization domains, electron-phonon couplings, and photocarrier dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Vibronic excitations of molecules at nanoscale interfaces are important for molecular electronics and spintronics and have therefore attracted considerable attention. For single molecules in mechanically controlled break junctions or in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), vibronic excitations are typically described by a double-barrier tunneling junction model. In this model, a homogeneous electric field is considered and the atomic structure of the metal contacts is neglected. Here, we report experimental STM data of a new nonplanar organometallic complex, [ Mo ( CO ) 3 ( Pyridine 3 S 3 ) ], on Ag(111). Spatially resolved maps of the vibronic excitations show several features related to the reordering of the occupied molecular orbitals due to the rapidly decaying potential of the tip apex. Such rearrangement leads to a significant shift in the vibronic levels as the tip position is changed. These observations, together with our modelling results, demonstrate that the molecular orbitals can be controlled by the field of the STM tip, whose atomic-scale variation deserves more attention in studies of nonplanar molecules.},

Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals anisotropic Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) resonances induced by vanadium impurities, with long-range amplitude modulations attributed to spin-conserving Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (BQPI). Analysis of BQPI at the subgap YSR energy shows that only a selective subset of normal-state scattering processes contributes to Cooper pair formation, indicating interband mixing.

Our analysis of the diffuse scattering line shapes and orientations suggests that the three charge density wave components contain independent phase fluctuations with a hierarchy of length scales, leading to intricate fluctuation patterns that go beyond the conventional 2D-to-3D crossover picture.},

This transition is confirmed by theoretical results which show the o F 8 phase becoming energetically favorable above 280 GPa.

Here, we put forward a novel method for generating relativistic SSP lepton beams via employing a state-of-the-art THz source. Building upon our foundational work on velocity-matched spin rotation in dielectric-lined waveguides [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 134 , 075001 (2025) ], we present the first demonstration of spin-polarization mode matching—a novel mechanism that establishes a direct relation between waveguide modes and beam polarization states. This breakthrough enables precise spatial control over spin structures at relativistic energies, generating customizable spin-polarization configurations such as spiderlike, azimuthal, and helical structures. Such SSP beams have the potential to generate high-energy structured photon beams and open a new avenue for research on relativistic structured particle beams, especially in nuclear physics, high-energy physics, materials science, and atomic physics.},

Here, we report a sequence of direct numerical simulations of incompressible Navier-Stokes in a box with periodic boundary conditions, which indicate the likelihood that the anomaly vanishes at a rate that agrees with the scaling of third moment of absolute velocity increments.

While the current linear self-injection locking theory has successfully addressed the linear coupling between the laser cavity and the external microresonator, it fails to describe the complicated nonlinear processes, especially for dark-pulse microcomb formation. Here, we investigate—theoretically, numerically, and experimentally—the Kerr-thermal dynamics of a semiconductor laser self-injection locked to an integrated silicon nitride microresonator. We unveil intriguing yet universal dark-pulse formation and switching behavior with discrete steps, and establish a theoretical model scrutinizing the synergy of laser-microresonator mutual coupling, Kerr nonlinearity, and photothermal effect. Numerical simulation confirms the experimental result and identifies the origins. Exploiting this unique phenomenon, we showcase an application on low-noise photonic microwave generation with phase noise purified by 23.5 dB.

Here, we apply classical light-matter interaction theory together with Floquet analysis to reveal a substantial enhancement of the spontaneous emission decay rate at the momentum gap frequency in photonic time crystals. Moreover, our findings suggest that photonic time crystals enable a nonequilibrium light-matter interaction process: the spontaneous excitation of an atom from its ground state to an excited state, accompanied by the concurrent emission of a photon, referred to as spontaneous emission excitation.},

We find that Ising-type interactions produce two qualitatively distinct phase boundaries, one of which gives rise to an antiferromagnetic-normal phase connected to the superradiant regime via a first-order phase transition. Under anisotropic couplings, we uncover a strongly correlated phase where in-plane spin order coexists with superradiance, exhibiting sublinear scaling of the photon occupation per site and power-law decay of spin correlations. Furthermore, superradiance is strengthened by tuning either isotropic or anisotropic interactions, highlighting the role of intrinsic many-body correlations in shaping light-matter quantum phases.},

We benchmark our proposal by studying the scattering of an electron or a proton against a hydrogen atom, showing the effect of electronic exchange and inelastic ionization as the mass ratio between the simulated nuclei and electrons—a tunable experimental parameter in our simulator—becomes comparable. These benchmarks illustrate how the simulator can qualitatively emulate phenomena like those appearing in molecular dynamical problems even if the simulated interaction occurs in two dimensions with a dipolar scaling. Beyond the molecular implementation proposed here, our proposal can be readily extrapolated to other atomic platforms, e.g., based on fermionic Rydberg atoms.},

  abstract     = {The magnetic dipolar splitting of a p -wave Feshbach resonance is governed by the spin-orbital configuration of the valence electrons in the triplet molecular state. We perform high-resolution trap-loss spectroscopy on ultracold Li 6 atoms to resolve this splitting with sub-milligauss precision. By comparing electron-spin-polarized ( | m S | = 1 ) and electron-spin-mixture ( m S = 0 ) configurations of the triplet state, we observe a clear spin-dependent reversal in the splitting structure, confirmed via momentum-resolved absorption imaging. This behavior directly reflects the interplay between electron spin projection m S and orbital angular momentum m ℓ in the molecular states. Our results provide a stringent benchmark for dipole-dipole interaction models and lay the groundwork for controlling the pairing in p -wave superfluid systems.},

  abstract     = {The question of whether there are enough superfluid neutrons in the inner crust of neutron stars to explain pulsar glitches remains a topic of debate. Previous band structure calculations suggest that the entrainment effect significantly reduces the superfluid density. In this Letter, a new derivation of the BCS expression for the superfluid density is given. We compute it in the superfluid band theory framework through linear response theory, for a small relative velocity between superfluid and normal components, under the assumption that the pairing gap in the rest frame of the superfluid is constant and not affected by the perturbation. Our result suggests that a formula extensively used in neutron star physics is incomplete. Numerical evaluations for two realistic configurations reveal that the previously neglected contribution drastically alters the picture of the superfluid reservoir in the inner crust of neutron stars, suggesting that about 90% of the neutrons are effectively superfluid.},

  abstract     = {The polarization of the Λ and Λ ¯ hyperons along the beam direction has been measured in proton-lead ( p -Pb ) collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 8.16 TeV. The data were obtained with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 186.0 ± 6.5 nb − 1 . A significant azimuthal dependence of the hyperon polarization, characterized by the second-order Fourier sine coefficient P z , s 2 , is observed. The P z , s 2 values decrease as a function of charged particle multiplicity, but increase with transverse momentum. A hydrodynamic model that describes the observed P z , s 2 values in nucleus-nucleus collisions by introducing vorticity effects does not reproduce either the sign or the magnitude of the p -Pb results. These observations pose a challenge to the current theoretical implementation of spin polarization in heavy ion collisions and offer new insights into the origin of spin polarization in hadronic collisions at LHC energies.},

  abstract     = {The leading-order perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions for nucleon electromagnetic form factors were first made in late 1970s. In this Letter, for the first time, we accomplish the calculation of the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to nucleon Dirac form factors at large momentum transfer to leading-twist accuracy in the collinear factorization approach, specifically within the Krankl and Manashov renormalization scheme. The effect of NLO perturbative corrections turns out to be positive and substantial. Taking the nucleon leading-twist light-cone distribution amplitudes determined from the recent lattice simulations as input, we find that the state-of-the-art pQCD predictions significantly underestimate the available nucleon Dirac form factors in both spacelike and timelike domains. This nuisance indicates that some additional soft nonfactorizable contribution might be called for to account for the measured nucleon electromagnetic form factor data up to Q 2 ≈ 30 GeV 2 .},

  abstract     = {Two decades ago the χ c 1 ( 3872 ) state was discovered in the hadron spectrum with two heavy quarks. The discovery fueled a surge in experimental research, uncovering dozens of so called X Y Z exotics states lying outside the conventional quark model, as well as theoretical investigations into new forms of matter, such as quark-gluon hybrids, tetraquarks, and pentaquarks, with the potential of disclosing new information about the fundamental strong force. Among the X Y Z s , the χ c 1 ( 3872 ) and T c c + ( 3875 ) states stand out for their striking characteristics and unleashed many discussions about their nature. Here, we address this question using the Born-Oppenheimer effective field theory (BOEFT) and show how QCD settles the issue of their composition. Not only do we describe well the main features of the χ c 1 ( 3872 ) and T c c + ( 3875 ) states, but we also obtain predictions in the bottomonium sector. This opens the way to systematic applications of BOEFT to all X Y Z s .},

  abstract     = {We present a novel technique to incorporate precision calculations from quantum chromodynamics into fully differential particle-level Monte Carlo simulations. By minimizing an information-theoretic quantity subject to constraints, our reweighted Monte Carlo incorporates systematic uncertainties absent in individual Monte Carlo predictions, achieving consistency with the theory input in precision and its estimated systematic uncertainties. Our method can be applied to arbitrary observables known from precision calculations, including multiple observables simultaneously. It generates strictly positive weights, thus offering a clear path to statistically powerful and theoretically precise computations for current and future collider experiments. As a proof of concept, we apply our technique to event-shape observables at electron-positron colliders, leveraging existing precision calculations of thrust. Our analysis highlights the importance of logarithmic moments of event shapes, which have not been previously studied in the collider physics literature.},

  abstract     = {Inelastic dark matter models that have two dark matter particles and a massive dark photon can reproduce the observed relic dark matter density without violating cosmological limits. The mass splitting between the two dark matter particles χ 1 and χ 2 , with m ( χ 2 ) > m ( χ 1 ) , is induced by a dark Higgs field and a corresponding dark Higgs boson h ′ . We present a search for dark matter in events with two vertices, at least one of which must be displaced from the interaction region, and missing energy. Using a 365 fb − 1 data sample collected at Belle II, which operates at the SuperKEKB e + e − collider, we observe no evidence for a signal. We set upper limits on the product of the production cross section σ ( e + e − → h ′ χ 1 χ 2 ) , and the product of branching fractions B ( χ 2 → χ 1 e + e − ) × B ( h ′ → x + x − ) , where x + x − indicates μ + μ − , π + π − , or K + K − , as functions of h ′ mass and lifetime at the level of 10 − 1 fb .

In this Letter, we propose the extension of hidden zeros to one-loop order in Tr ( ϕ 3 ) theory and the NLSM using the “surface integrand” technology introduced by Arkani-Hamed et al. We demonstrate that, under the assumption of locality, one-loop integrands in Tr ( ϕ 3 ) are unitary if and only if they satisfy these loop hidden zeros. We also present strong evidence that the hidden zeros themselves contain the constraints from locality, leading us to conjecture that the one-loop Tr ( ϕ 3 ) integrand can be fixed by hidden zeros from a generically nonlocal, nonunitary Ansatz . Near the one-loop zeros, we uncover a simple factorization behavior and conjecture that NLSM integrands are fixed by this property, also assuming neither locality nor unitarity. This Letter represents the first extension of such uniqueness results to loop integrands, demonstrating that locality and unitarity emerge from other principles even beyond leading order in perturbation theory.},

In this Letter, we connect these two themes by extending the first law to the case of scattering orbits. We present derivations based on classical S-matrix, Hamiltonian, and pseudo-Hamiltonian methods, the last of which allows us to include dissipative effects for the first time. Finally, a “boundary to bound” map links this first law to the traditional bound-orbit version. Through this map a little-known observable for scatter orbits, the elapsed proper time, is mapped to the Detweiler redshift for bound orbits, which is an invariant building block in gravitational waveform models.},

  abstract     = {The detection of cosmic antideuterons ( D ¯ ) at kinetic energies below a few GeV / n could provide a smoking gun signature for dark matter (DM). However, the theoretical uncertainties of coalescence models have represented so far one of the main limiting factors for precise predictions of the D ¯ flux. In this Letter, we present a novel calculation of the D ¯ source spectra, based on the Wigner formalism, for which we implement the Argonne v 18 antideuteron wave function that does not have any free parameters related to the coalescence process. We show that the Argonne-Wigner model excellently reproduces the D ¯ multiplicity measured by ALEPH at the Z -boson pole, which is usually adopted to tune the coalescence models based on different approaches. Our analysis is based on the p ythia 8 Monte Carlo event generator and the state-of-the-art shower algorithm. We succeed, with our model, to reduce the current theoretical uncertainty on the prediction of the D ¯ source spectra to a few percent, for D ¯ kinetic energies relevant to DM searches with the General Antiparticle Spectrometer and Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, and for DM masses above a few tens of GeV. This result implies that the theoretical uncertainties due to the coalescence process are no longer the main limiting factor in the predictions. We provide the tabulated source spectra for all the relevant DM annihilation and decay channels and DM masses between 5 and 100 TeV, on the CosmiXs GitHub repository.},

For 10 − 22 ≤ m a ≤ 5 × 10 − 21 eV , the results improve upon previous laboratory limits by more than three orders of magnitude, exceeding for the first time the astrophysical limits from supernova SN1987A cooling. For the axion mass range of interest corresponding to ultralow frequencies, the crucial local phase of the axion field is considered. Furthermore, the obtained limits are nearly equivalent to those projected for a recently proposed experiment employing high-intensity neutron beams at the European Spallation Source.

  abstract     = {Scaling quantum computation is a crucial challenge for practical applications, hindered by the inherent errors and noises in real-world quantum systems. The quantum modular architecture offers a possible solution, where smaller quantum modules are individually constructed and assembled into a larger architecture. In this architecture, the nonlocal quantum gates are the building blocks; until now, it has remained challenging for practical applications to implement a nonlocal quantum gate with the memory modules under deterministic and room-temperature conditions, due to intrinsic probability and hardware complexity. Here, we propose and demonstrate a scheme to deterministically implement a nonlocal quantum gate between the room-temperature memory modules. The key technologies include cavity-enhanced atomic modules, two of which are connected by a single pair of distributed entangled optical modes and real-time mutual feedforward controls. The nonlocal quantum nondemolition gate between two room-temperature memory modules is deterministically demonstrated with different input coherent states, and the quantum nature is confirmed by outputting entangled atomic modules. Our results illustrate the functionality and feasibility of nonlocal quantum gate and may have potential applications in modular quantum information processing.},

  abstract     = {Entanglement is the cornerstone of quantum communication, yet conventional detection relies solely on local measurements. In this Letter, we present an experimental demonstration, based on an improved theoretical framework showing that one-way local operations and classical communication (1-LOCC) can significantly outperform purely local measurements in detecting quantum entanglement. By casting the entanglement detection problem as a semidefinite program, we derive protocols that minimize false negatives at fixed false-positive rates. A variational generative machine-learning algorithm efficiently searches over high-dimensional parameter spaces, identifying states and measurement strategies that exhibit a clear 1-LOCC advantage. Experimentally, we realize a genuine event-ready protocol on a three-dimensional photonic entanglement source, employing fiber delays as short-lived quantum memories. We implement rapid, field-programmable gate array-based sampling of the optimized probabilistic instructions, allowing Bob’s measurement settings to adapt to Alice’s outcomes in real time. Our results validate the predicted 1-LOCC advantage in a realistic noisy setting and reduce the experimental trials needed to certify entanglement. These findings mark a step toward scalable, adaptive entanglement detection methods crucial for quantum networks and computing, paving the way for more efficient generation and verification of high-dimensional entangled states.},

Given a code, we explicitly define the corresponding resource state and derive an error-recovery operation based on all Bell measurement outcomes. Our approach offers deeper insights into the impact of resource state noise on repeater performance while also providing strategies for efficient preparation and fault-tolerant preservation of resource states. As an application, we propose a measurement-based repeater protocol based on quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, enabling constant-yield Bell state distribution over arbitrary distances. Numerical simulations identify a fault-tolerant threshold on the total physical error per repeater segment—including errors on resource states, remotely generated Bell states, and Bell measurements—and confirm that increasing the QLDPC code size further suppresses the logical error while maintaining a fixed encoding rate.

Using tools from quantum metrology and quantum control may overcome this limit, yet the full advantage afforded by entanglement so far remains elusive. Here we map the problem of frequency measurement to that of estimating a global dephasing quantum channel. In this way, we determine the ultimate quantum limits of frequency estimation in stochastic ac sensing. We find exact quantum Fisher information bounds for estimating frequency and frequency differences of stochastic fields. In particular, given two close signals with frequency separation ω r , we find that the quantum Fisher information for the separation estimation is approximately 2 / ω r 2 , i.e., inversely proportional to the separation parameter. The bounds are achievable in certain regimes by superpositions of Dicke states. GHZ states are suboptimal but improve precision over unentangled states, achieving Heisenberg scaling in the low-bandwidth limit. This Letter establishes a robust framework for stochastic ac signal sensing that can be extended to arbitrary time-dependent and stochastic fields.},

Interestingly, this approach yields bounds tighter than the state of the art also for uncorrelated channels. We apply the bounds to study the limits for the most general adaptive phase estimation models in the presence of temporally correlated dephasing. We consider dephasing both parallel (no Heisenberg scaling) and perpendicular (Heisenberg scaling possible) to the signal. In the former case our new bounds show that negative correlations are beneficial; for the latter we show evidence that the bounds are tight. We also apply the bounds to collisional thermometry, i.e., estimation of a parameter of the environment, showing evidence that entangled probes may provide only a limited advantage.},

In addition to its simple implementation, recent studies have revealed that its error and cost can be reduced if the initial state is closed in the low-energy subspace. However, the improvement by the low-energy property diminishes rapidly as the Trotter order grows in the previous studies, and thus, it is mysterious whether there exists a genuine advantage of low-energy initial states. In this Letter, we resolve this problem by proving the optimal error bound and cost of Trotterization for low-energy initial states. For generic local Hamiltonians composed of positive-semidefinite terms, we show that the Trotter error is at most linear in the initial state energy and polylogarithmic in the system size . As a result, the computational cost becomes substantially small for low-energy states with compared to the one for arbitrary initial states, where denotes the energy per site and means the whole-system energy. Our error bound and cost of Trotterization achieve the theoretically best scaling in the initial state energy . In addition, they can be partially extended to weakly correlated initial states having low-energy expectation values, which are not necessarily closed in the low-energy subspace. Our results will pave the way for fast and accurate simulations of low-energy states, which are one of the central targets in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.},

Because physical qubits generally contain more than two levels, faster gates often result in a higher leakage rate outside of the computational space. In this Letter, we enhance the state-of-the-art single qubit gate by introducing active leakage cancellation. This is accomplished via a second drive tone near the leakage transition such that we cancel the leakage caused by the main drive. Furthermore, we describe a measurement sequence that can be used to calibrate the parameters of this leakage cancellation drive. Finally, we apply the technique to superconducting transmon qubits and achieve leakage suppression by up to a factor of 20 when compared to pulses shaped with the standard derivative removal by adiabatic gate technique. This results in a coherence-limited gate infidelity of 7.5 × 10 − 5 with leakage below 10 − 5 level, for a 10 ns π / 2 gate and 196 MHz qubit anharmonicity.},

The second key is to employ the gauge canonical form of a projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining with variational Monte Carlo, enabling efficient computations for ( 2 + 1 ) D LGTs. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate ground-state simulation of pure Z 2 , Z 3 , and Z 4 gauge theory, odd- Z 2 gauge theories, and Z 2 gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to 32 × 32 . Furthermore, we demonstrate that it allows for accurate simulations of real-time dynamics up to long time, exemplified by the dynamics of elementary excitations of the deconfined Z 2 gauge field at 10 × 10 . This is also the first example of simulating the real-time dynamics of PEPS with variational Monte Carlo, whose impact may extend beyond gauge theory.

Zunger, Phys. Rev. B 102 , 014422 (2020) ] to possess splitting between the otherwise spin-degenerate energy bands even without the relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we point out that such nonrelativistic spin splitting (NRSS)—in particular, “spin splitting type 4” (SST-4) symmetry-broken antiferromagnets—can be divided into subgroups having distinct patterns of spin splitting and spin textures, depending on additional auxiliary symmetries of spin interconversion and polarity. These SST-4 subgroups include the -type (no spin-interconverting symmetry) having spin splitting at the Brillouin zone center, as well as the subgroup in which a rotation symmetry is applied and determines the alternating spin texture and the subgroup having exclusively reflection spin-interconverting symmetry. Unlike ferrimagnets, the -type compounds are shown to have tiny net magnetization at finite temperature and thus avoid the adverse effect of the stray field. The and subgroups can be either polar or nonpolar, whereas the subgroup is polar only, providing a basis for possible switching by external fields. The combination of NRSS-enabling and auxiliary symmetries is used here as a filter for identifying previously synthesized compounds as specific prototypes. Their characteristic splitting and spin polarization are calculated by density functional theory to the benefit of potential future experimental testing. Interesting results are as follows: (i) SOC-independent NRSS can exceed the magnitude of the SOC-induced Rashba and Dresselhaus spin splitting in semiconductors. (ii) Examples of predicted -type insulating compounds include (nonpolar) and (polar), the latter having spin splitting of 158 meV and 160 meV in the valence and conduction bands, respectively. (iii) The -type ( and ) and -type compounds ( and ) are distinguished both by their auxiliary symmetries and polarity. The spin textures of -type compounds are mirror reflected with spin degeneracy of the wave vectors on that mirror.

To this end, it is useful to harness the resource of continuous-variable (CV) entanglement, since it can be efficiently and unconditionally produced by squeezing light in a nonlinear medium and can be easily manipulated, distributed, and measured using standard components. While various aspects of CV-based quantum communication have been successfully demonstrated in the optical domain, some key capabilities, such as entanglement swapping, have been lacking in the microwave domain. Here, we demonstrate three key elements of CV-based microwave quantum communication: (i) a Josephson mixer operating as a nondegenerate two-mode entangler with maximum measured logarithmic negativity , (ii) a quantum teleportation apparatus, capable of teleporting vacuum and coherent states with a maximum fidelity of 73%, which exceeds the 50% classical limit and is mainly limited by intermediate losses in the setup, and (iii) an entanglement-swapping system which generates entanglement between two remote noninteracting modes via entanglement-swapping operations applied to input vacuum and coherent states with maximum measured logarithmic negativity . Such hardware-efficient CV entanglement building blocks that are based on nondegenerate Josephson mixers could enable wide-ranging applications in modular quantum computation, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication.},

In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: a tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripelike configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models’ phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related t − J model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the t − J Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling t ′ , which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.},

  abstract     = {We initiate the study of state complexity for continuous-variable quantum systems. Concretely, we consider a setup with bosonic modes and auxiliary qubits, where available operations include Gaussian one- and two-mode operations and single- and two-qubit operations as well as qubit-controlled phase-space displacements. We define the (approximate) complexity of a bosonic state by the minimum size of a circuit that prepares an approximation to the state in trace distance. We propose a new circuit which prepares an approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state | G K P κ , Δ ⟩ . Here, κ − 2 is the variance of the envelope, and Δ 2 is the variance of the individual peaks. We show that the circuit accepts with constant probability and—conditioned on acceptance—the output state is polynomially close in ( κ , Δ ) to the state | G K P κ , Δ ⟩ . The size of our circuit is linear in ( log 1 / κ , log 1 / Δ ) . To our knowledge, this is the first protocol for GKP-state preparation with fidelity guarantees for the prepared state. We also show converse bounds, establishing that the linear circuit-size dependence of our construction is optimal. This fully characterizes the complexity of GKP states.},

  abstract     = {The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and determines the ultimate limits of precision. With artificial neural networks gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher information through an artificial neural network performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information and that training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training—eliminating the need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.},

In this work, we investigate the anticoncentration of random Clifford circuits toward the overlap distribution of random stabilizer states. Using exact analytical techniques and extensive numerical simulations based on Clifford replica tensor networks, we demonstrate that random Clifford circuits fully anticoncentrate in logarithmic circuit depth; namely, higher-order moments of the overlap distribution converge to those of random stabilizer states. Moreover, we investigate the effect of introducing a controlled number of non-Clifford (magic) resources into Clifford circuits. We show that inserting a polylogarithmic in qudit number of T states is sufficient to drive the overlap distribution toward the Porter-Thomas statistics, effectively recovering full quantum randomness. In short, this fact presents doped tensor networks and shallow Clifford circuits as pseudomagic quantum states. Our results clarify the interplay between Clifford dynamics, magic-state injection, and quantum complexity, with implications for quantum circuit sampling, many-body quantum physics, and the benchmarking of quantum computational advantage.},

While the molecular underpinnings may be complex, the resulting phenomenon, in which a cell decides between one fate or another, is relatively simple. A body of work—rooted in dynamical systems theory—has formalized this notion of cellular decision making as flow in a Waddington-like landscape, in which cells evolve according to gradientlike dynamics within a potential that changes shape in response to a number of signals. We present a framework leveraging neural networks as universal function approximators to infer such a parametrized landscape from gene expression data. Inspired by the success of physics-informed machine learning in data-limited contexts, we enforce principled constraints motivated not by physical laws but by this phenomenological understanding of differentiation. Our data-driven approach infers a governing landscape atop a manifold situated within expression space, thereby describing the dynamics of interest in a biologically meaningful context. The resulting system provides an intuitive, visualizable, and interpretable model of cellular differentiation dynamics.},

Unlike in the lowest Landau level, where charge motion is confined into cyclotron orbits, the charged excitations in the FQAH occupy Bloch states with well-defined crystal momenta. At a nonzero doping density, this feature enables the formation of itinerant states of the doped anyons just beyond the FQAH plateau region. Focusing on the vicinity of , we describe a few possible itinerant states, including a topological superconductor with chiral neutral fermion edge modes as well as a more exotic pair density wave (PDW) superconductor with non-Abelian topological order. A Fermi liquid metal with a doping-induced period-3 charge density wave also occurs naturally in our analysis. This Fermi liquid (as well as the PDW) arises from pairing instabilities of a composite Fermi liquid metal that can emerge near filling . Though inspired by the theory of anyon superconductivity, we explain how our construction is qualitatively different. At a general Jain filling , the same analytical framework leads to a wider variety of phases, including higher-charge superconductors and generalized composite Fermi liquids. We predict unusual physical signatures associated with each phase and analyze the crossover between different temperature regimes. These results provide a proof-of-principle that exotic itinerant phases can be stabilized by correlations intrinsic to the FQAH setup.},

Many biological processes also depend on time estimation by nanoscale clocks, whose performance can be significantly impacted by random fluctuations. In this work, we formulate the problem of optimal time estimation for Markovian stochastic processes, and present its general solution in the asymptotic (longtime) limit. Specifically, we obtain a tight upper bound on the precision of any time estimate constructed from sustained observations of a classical, Markovian jump process. This bound is controlled by the mean residual time, i.e., the expected wait before the first jump is observed. As a consequence, we obtain a universal bound on the signal-to-noise ratio of arbitrary currents and counting observables in the steady state. This bound is similar in spirit to the kinetic uncertainty relation but provably tighter, and we explicitly construct the counting observables that saturate it. Our results establish ultimate precision limits for an important class of observables in nonequilibrium systems and demonstrate that the mean residual time, not the dynamical activity, is the measure of freneticity that tightly constrains fluctuations far from equilibrium.},

In this work, we extend the Středa formula to periodically driven systems, providing a rigorous framework to elucidate the unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet systems while offering a physically grounded link between Floquet winding numbers and tractable response functions. Using the Sambe representation of periodically driven systems, we analyze the response of the unbounded Floquet density of states to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-Středa response is regularized through Cesàro summation, yielding a well-defined, quantized result within spectral gaps. The response features two physically distinct contributions: a quantized charge flow between edge and bulk and an anomalous energy flow between the system and the drive, offering new insight into the nature of anomalous edge states. This fundamental result rigorously connects Floquet winding numbers to the orbital magnetization density of Floquet states and holds broadly, from clean to disordered and inhomogeneous systems. This is further supported by providing a real-space formulation of the Floquet-Středa response, which introduces a local topological marker suited for periodically driven settings. In translationally invariant systems, the framework yields a remarkably simple expression for Floquet winding numbers involving geometric properties of Floquet-Bloch bands. A concrete experimental protocol is proposed to extract the Floquet-Středa response via particle-density measurements in systems coupled to engineered baths. Finally, by expressing the topological invariants through the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, this approach opens a promising route toward the topological characterization of interacting driven phases.},

Here, we realize a four-terminal JJ in a hybrid heterostructure, where ABSs form a synthetic 3D band structure. We probe the energy spectrum using tunneling spectroscopy and identify spectral features associated with the formation of a tri-Andreev molecule, a bound state whose energy depends on three superconducting phases and, therefore, is able to host topological ABSs. The experimental observations are well described by a numerical model. The calculations predict the appearance of four Weyl nodes at zero energy within a gap smaller than the experimental resolution. These topological states are theoretically predicted to remain stable within an extended region of the parameter space, well accessible by our device. These findings establish an experimental foundation to study high-dimensional synthetic band structures in multiterminal JJs and to realize topological Andreev bands.},

Highly precise predictions can be made using standard techniques, both in the continuum and in the lattice frameworks. However, classical methods have limitations, particularly when attempting to extrapolate the continuum limit from the study of lattice gauge theories. Complementing classical computations or combining them with quantum computational methods, to improve the predictions toward the continuum limit with current quantum resources, is a formidable open challenge. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient method to compute the running of the coupling in non-Abelian gauge theories beyond one spatial dimension. We first represent the Hamiltonian on periodic lattices in terms of loop variables and conjugate loop electric fields, exploiting the Gauss law to retain the gauge-independent ones. Then, we identify a local basis for small and large loops variationally to minimize the truncation error while computing the running of the coupling on small tori. Our method enables computations at arbitrary values of the bare coupling and lattice spacing with current quantum computers, simulators, and tensor-network calculations, in regimes otherwise inaccessible.},

  abstract     = {“Strange” metals that do not follow the predictions of Fermi liquid theory are prevalent in materials that feature superconductivity arising from electron interactions. In recent years, it has been hypothesized that spatial randomness in electron interactions must play a crucial role in strange metals for their hallmark linear-in-temperature ( ) resistivity to survive down to low temperatures where phonon and umklapp processes are ineffective, as is observed in experiments. However, a clear picture of how this happens has not yet been provided in a realistic model free from artificial constructions, such as large- limits and replica tricks. We study a realistic model of two-dimensional metals with spatially random antiferromagnetic interactions in a nonperturbative regime, using numerically exact high-performance, large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo simulation and exact averages over the quenched spatial randomness. Our simulations reproduce strange metals’ key experimental signature of linear-in- resistivity with a universal “Planckian” transport scattering rate that is independent of coupling constants. We further find that strange metallicity in these systems is not associated with a quantum critical point and, instead, arises from a phase of matter with gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations that lacks long-range correlations and spans an extended region of parameter space: A feature that is also observed in several experiments. These gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations take the form of spatially localized overdamped modes, whose presence could possibly be detected using recently developed nanoscale magnetometry methods. Our work paves the way for an eventual microscopic understanding of the role of spatial disorder in determining important properties of correlated-electron materials.},

  abstract     = {Recent progress in tabletop experiments offers the opportunity to show, for the first time, that gravity is not compatible with a classical description. In all current experimental proposals, such as the generation of gravitationally induced entanglement between two quantum sources of gravity, gravitational effects can be explained solely with the Newton potential, namely, in a regime that is consistent with the weak-field limit of general relativity and does not probe the field nature of gravity. Hence, the Newtonian origin of the effects is a limitation to the conclusions on the nature of gravity that can be drawn from these experiments. Here, we identify two effects that overcome this limitation: They cannot be reproduced using the Newton potential, and they are independent of graviton emission. First, we show that the interaction between two generic quantum sources of gravity, e.g., in wide Gaussian states, cannot be reproduced with the Newton potential nor with a known classical theory of gravity. Second, we show that the quantum commutator between the gravitational field and its canonically conjugate momentum appears as an additional term in the relative phase of a generic quantum source interacting with a test particle. Observing these two effects would give further quantitative information and stronger evidence, compared to experiments only involving the Newton potential, to show that gravity is nonclassical. More broadly, identifying stronger quantum aspects of gravity than those reproducible with the Newton potential is crucial to prove the nonclassicality of gravity and to plan a new generation of experiments testing quantum aspects of gravity in a broader sense than what has been proposed so far.},

A constrained theoretical model for the coupled oscillator, assisted by a genetic algorithm, can recreate the experimental electron spectra and, thus, fully reconstructs the longitudinal phase-space distribution of the electron beam with a temporal resolution of approximately 1.3 fs. In particular, it reveals the slice energy spread of the electron beam, which is important to measure for applications such as x-ray free electron lasers. In our experiment, the root-mean-square slice energy spread retrieved is bounded at 9.9 MeV, corresponding to a 0.9%–3.0% relative spread, despite the overall GeV energy beam having approximately 100% relative energy spread.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical properties of biological materials are spatially heterogeneous. Typical tissues are made up of a spanning fibrous extracellular matrix in which various inclusions, such as living cells, are embedded. While the influence of embedded inclusions on the stiffness of common elastic materials such as rubber has been studied for decades and can be understood in terms of the volume fraction and shape of inclusions, the same is not true for disordered filamentous and fibrous networks. Recent work has shown that, in isolation, such networks exhibit unusual viscoelastic behavior indicative of an underlying mechanical phase transition controlled by network connectivity and strain. How this behavior is modified when inclusions are present is unclear. Here, we present a theoretical and computational study of the influence of rigid inclusions on the mechanics of disordered elastic networks near the connectivity-controlled central-force rigidity transition. Combining scaling theory and coarse-grained simulations, we predict and confirm an anomalously strong dependence of the composite stiffness on inclusion volume fraction, beyond that seen in ordinary composites. This stiffening exceeds the well-established volume-fraction-dependent stiffening expected in conventional composites, e.g., as an elastic analog of the classic volume-fraction-dependent increase in the viscosity of liquids first identified by Einstein. We show that this enhancement is a consequence of the interplay between interparticle spacing and an emergent correlation length, leading to an effective finite-size scaling imposed by the presence of inclusions. We outline the expected scaling of the linear shear modulus and strain fluctuations with the inclusion volume fraction and network connectivity, confirm these predictions in simulations, and discuss potential experimental tests and implications for our predictions in real systems.},

  abstract = {Internal conversion is a vital vibronic loss mechanism that competes with all other photophysical mechanisms, and a plethora of information on the subject is available in the literature. However, these data are often difficult to penetrate owing to their complexity. In addition, owing to the sheer number of methods, it is often difficult to understand which method is better for certain systems. This comprehensive review on the state of the art explores the history of internal conversion and provides context to its evolution up to modern quantum chemistry. The most prevalent methods used to study atomic systems, as well as where they rise and they fall, are highlighted. Each method and the corresponding results are noted in a simplified manner, and information is threaded together to elucidate how everything is related. This tapestry illustrating the ups and downs of internal conversion will aid researchers in their study of new and innovative materials and provides a vital comparison of methods not easily gained.},

  abstract = {In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, like our Sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton ( )-chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. The relevant reactions of solar and stellar hydrogen burning are reviewed here from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, general recommendations are also formed.},
