Using shadowgraph imaging as an in situ probe of the atomic density, we measure the time-dependent centers of mass and widths of the condensate in two dimensions and use these measurements to damp oscillations in the two visible dipole modes and the low-frequency quadrupole mode. By inducing oscillations in the condensate, we show that we can efficiently damp the dipole modes to a final mean phonon occupancy per atom of .},

  abstract     = {We report observation of self-oscillating supersonic flows in a two-dimensional atomic superfluid. By imposing a local particle sink with strong loss, we induce a convergent radial flow with a spatially bounded supersonic region, forming an acoustic analog of a black-hole horizon and an inner horizon around the sink. The observed superflow appears to be modulated by quasiperiodic bursts of superluminal signals. We measure their frequencies and find agreement with numerical simulations of the frequencies of ring soliton oscillations within the black-hole horizon. The solitons seen in the simulations are emitted from the region between the two horizons in a process that we attribute to the Landau instability. The presented experiment demonstrates a new method for creating supersonic flows in atomic superfluids, which may find applications in quantum simulations of curved spacetime, supersonic turbulence, and self-oscillating dynamics in dissipative many-body systems.},

We first calculate potential-energy curves of the states and the transition dipole moments between these states using the complete active state self-consistent field method. Using the DM method, we calculate the kinetic-energy release (KER) spectra for the dissociating through the channel. We find that our simulated KER spectra agree well with the experimental data by Wu et al. [ Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 13 , 18398 (2011) ].

We characterize an intrinsic comagnetometer that is available in crystals, which can be used to suppress spurious magnetic-field effects through comparing sets of ions related by spatial reflection symmetry.

Instead of exhibiting energy-conserving persistent coherent motion, the dynamics of such open systems feature, in most cases, a steady state, which is approached in the long-time limit from all initial conditions. This can, in fact, be advantageous as it offers a mechanism for the creation of robust quantum correlations on demand without the need for fine-tuning. Here, we show this for a system consisting of two coherently coupled bosonic modes, which is a paradigmatic scenario for the realization of quantum resources such as squeezed entangled states. Rather counterintuitively, the mere addition of incoherent hopping, which results in a statistical coupling between the bosonic modes, leads to steady states with robust quantum entanglement and enables the emergence of persistent coherent nonstationary behavior.},

Here we introduce a generalized loss model for assemblage tomography that uses conical optimization techniques combined with maximum-likelihood estimation. This approach allows us to accurately estimate assemblages without assuming uniform detection efficiency on the untrusted party's side. Using an evidence-based framework grounded in the Akaike information criterion, we demonstrate faithful reconstructions while balancing model complexity. We validate our results through numerical simulations and an experimental setup, showing robust performance in assemblage estimation when applied to experimentally relevant data.},

However, most existing protocols require perfect control, even though real-world devices inevitably have control imperfections. Here, we consider a fundamental setting of quantum sensing with time domain imperfections, where the duration of control pulses and the interrogation time are all subject to uncertainty. Under this scenario, we investigate the task of frequency estimation in the presence of a non-Markovian environment. We design a control strategy and prove that it outperforms any control-free strategies, recovering the optimal Heisenberg limit up to a small error term that is intrinsic to this model. We further demonstrate the advantage of our control strategy via experiments on a nuclear magnetic resonance platform. Our findings confirm that the advantage of quantum control in quantum sensing persists even in the presence of imperfections.},

Using a realistic organic maser platform, we show the controllable manner of the work extraction from the quantum battery, which can be exploited for on-demand coherent microwave emission at room temperature. These results not only demonstrate the usefulness of metastability for developing the quantum batteries robust against energy losses, but also provide a paradigm of the practical quantum device powered up by quantum batteries.},

The quantum interference at beam splitters lies at the heart of what makes boson sampling hard to emulate by classical computers and is a vital component of quantum computation with light. Yet, despite overwhelming positive evidence, the conjecture that beam splitters with equal reflection and transmission probabilities generate the most entanglement for any state interfered with the vacuum has remained unproven for almost two decades [Asbóth et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 , 173602 (2005) ]. We prove this conjecture for ubiquitous entanglement monotones including mixed-state generalizations of entanglement entropy and purity by uncovering monotonicity and convexity with respect to photon loss for these monotones. At the same time, we highlight an infinite class of lesser-used monotones for which the conjecture fails. Because beam splitters are so fundamental, our results yield numerous corollaries for quantum optics, including proof of a recent conjecture for the evolution of a measure of quantumness through loss and a more efficient computational strategy for optimizing entanglement generation over linear optics. These results justify the value of seeking mathematical rigor behind commonly accepted facts and the danger of trusting them unconditionally.},

In a linear dielectric medium with refractive index n , the momentum is predicted to be smaller by a factor of n according to Abraham and larger by the same factor according to Minkowski. By studying the coupled dynamics of electromagnetic waves and dipoles in a dielectric medium, we show that the change in momentum of the dipole, expressed by the Lorentz force, corresponds to the Abraham momentum and is given by the expectation value of the spin-projected momentum vector. On the other hand, the Minkowski momentum is obtained as the magnitude of the spin-projected momentum vector from the energy-momentum dispersion relation derived by diagonalizing the coupled Hamiltonian and determines the direction of refraction in accordance with Snell's law. Our model also predicts a zitterbewegung -like oscillation due to helicity mixing between left- and right-handed wave components, mediated by dipole oscillation. These internal wave dynamics may be observable via wave-packet motion or polarization-sensitive measurements.},

We find that for relatively large free-space decay rates, the population dynamics of each qubit features Rabi oscillations, while for smaller decay rates it exhibits a complex behavior, which nevertheless can be understood by semianalytical expressions using the sub- and superradiant states of the system. Additionally, we observe phenomena, such as population and entanglement trapping, induced by the strong interaction of the qubits with the graphene nanodisk, with trapping values depending solely on the initial conditions of the two qubits.

  abstract     = {Systems in contact with an environment provide a ubiquitous challenge in quantum dynamics. Many fascinating phenomena can arise if the coupling is strong, leading to non-Markovian dynamics of the system, or collective, where the environment can become highly excited. We introduce a significant improvement of the hierarchy of pure states (HOPS) approach, which is able to efficiently deal with such highly excited, non-Markovian environments in a nearly unitary way. As our method relies on quantum trajectories, we can obtain dynamics efficiently, also for large system sizes, by (1) avoiding the quadratic scaling of a density matrix and (2) exploiting the localization properties of the trajectories with an adaptive basis. We provide the derivation of the nuHOPS (nearly unitary hierarchy of pure states) method, compare it to the original HOPS, and discuss numerical subtleties based on an illustrative dephasing model. Finally, we show its true power using the Dicke model as the paradigmatic example of many emitters decaying superradiantly inside a cavity. We reach numerically exact solutions for up to 1000 emitters. We apply our method to study emerging higher-order correlations in the emitter system or the cavity mode environment and their scaling with the number of emitters.},

In our model, the pump and probe fields coherently drive the first mirror, whereas the second mirror has mechanical oscillation due to the radiation pressure. We show that the right- and left-circular polarization components of the Gaussian probe field striking at an arbitrary incident angle become spatially separate along a direction orthogonal to the plane of incidence. Photonic SHE can be coherently controlled by adjusting the optomechanical interaction, cavity field, and G-mode phonon coupling, as well as G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction. The findings of photonic SHE are equally valid for standard optomechanical systems in the absence of cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and electronic state interaction. The cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling broadened the detuning range of the probe field to observe the dominant photonic SHE. Adding G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction generates enhanced photonic SHE at three different probe field detunings due to optomechanical-induced transparency being split into three windows. We show that asymmetric photonic SHE can be controlled through cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction when probe field detuning is nonzero. The photonic SHE in bilayer graphene integrated with an optomechanical cavity may enable further studies of spin-dependent photonic effects and quantum sensing applications.},

The system, modeled as a Rice-Mele chain using a double-well lattice and facilitating giant-atom-like nonlocal interaction, exhibits intriguing phenomena such as subradiance and superradiance. We demonstrate that APBSs with tunable chirality can be realized in the bound states in the continuum (BICs) and quasi-BICs and support the decoherence-free interaction via two distinct schemes. We also reveal the dynamical mechanisms for the topologically protected SAP, where the chiral-APBS fidelity during the adiabatic transfer is highly sensitive to the topology. These findings open possibilities for quantum simulation and information processing with cold atoms, particularly through the integration of topologically protected controllable mechanisms.},

In this formalism, the electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric object has two contributions, one taking into account the polarization current fluctuations of the object and the other taking into account the vacuum field fluctuations scattered by the object. The combined effect of these fields on the dynamics of a quantum emitter is described via two independent continuous bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each characterized by its own spectral density and initial quantum state. For initial thermal states of the two reservoirs at different temperatures, the standard approach based on the knowledge of the dyadic Green's function of the dielectric object at the quantum emitter position cannot be employed. We map the two reservoirs to a single equivalent reservoir with a temperature-dependent effective spectral density and initially in its vacuum state, focusing on the case of a homogeneous dielectric sphere. We derive analytical expressions for the medium-assisted, scattering-assisted, and effective spectral densities in this setting. We then study the dynamics of the quantum emitter for initial thermal states of the two reservoirs, adopting a nonperturbative approach.},

  abstract     = {The photon blockade is a promising mechanism for single-photon sources. However, in most systems with photon blockade, the brightness of the quantum source (being proportional to the average photon number in cavities) is limited. A recent experiment [Lei et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 , 093801 (2023) ] proves that Friedrich-Wintgen bound states in the continuum (BICs) arise when a microresonator containing a pair of near-resonant modes is side-coupled to an adjacent bus waveguide where the gap between them is narrow. To our knowledge, the impacts of BICs on the single-photon purity and brightness in the blockade process remain less explored. Here, we put forward a scheme to simultaneously enhance both the purity and brightness of single-photon emission in one cavity mode of such an integrated microresonator-waveguide system, while the other cavity mode is considered to be an active mode, modeled as incoherent-pumping (gain)-like laser production. Physically, this enhancement is achieved through BICs produced by quantum destructive interference between different dissipative pathways. We demonstrate that BICs enable the improvement of emission brightness by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, accompanied by high single-photon purity of 0.98 (or strong photon blockade of 0.02) compared with the BIC-free configuration. As a check, the full numerical results for the second-order correlation function and the average photon number of the emission cavity mode, which respectively determine the purity and brightness of single-photon emission, are in excellent agreement with the semianalytical solutions. Our BICs-based work offers a promising avenue for constructing single-photon sources with high purity and high brightness.},

  abstract     = {How environments affect the dynamics of quantum systems remains a central question in understanding transitions between quantum and classical phenomena and optimizing quantum technologies. A paradigm model to address the above question is the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model, in which a two-level particle is coupled to its environment modeled by a continuum of boson modes. Previous analytic solutions show that, starting from the initial condition that the particle is in its excited state and the boson modes are in their vacuum state, the time evolution of the probability that the particle occupies the excited state exhibits a dynamical transition as the system-environment coupling varies; when the coupling is weak, the probability decays to zero monotonically, while a finite weight of the particle is localized in the excited state when the coupling is sufficiently strong. Here we study the dynamical transition for the case that particles are initially excited with the boson modes in their vacuum state. The boson modes are assumed to follow a spectral function up to a cutoff frequency with . In particular, we access the effects of an all-to-all Ising type interaction we introduce between the particles. Our calculation is carried out by the nonperturbative numerical renormalization group method. We find that the value of the critical coupling for the transition exhibits a maximum at a finite and decreases with sufficiently large , and is suppressed (enlarged) by a ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) Ising interaction. Our results enrich understanding of environmental effects on interacting quantum systems.},

The multiphoton JCHM MI phases are classified according to a conserved quantity associated with the total number of excited atoms and photons. When this conserved quantity diverges toward positive infinity, this system enters the forbidden phase. By analyzing the system, we observe MI, superfluid, and forbidden phases in both the single- and two-photon JCHMs, although the MI phases in the two-photon case are confined to subspaces with small values of the conserved quantity.

This was seen through the study of the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian superoperator that describes the joint effect of drive and cooperativity. The cooperative decay depends on the nature of the reservoir correlations. If the reservoir correlations have phase-sensitive behavior, then the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian will be different. We investigate the time-crystal behavior of the nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions under the influence of a squeezed vacuum reservoir. We analyze the steady-state phase diagram as a function of the control parameter and demonstrate that increasing the squeezing strength sharpens the dissipative phase transition. Spectral analysis of the Liouvillian reveals gap closings and the emergence of purely imaginary eigenvalues in the thermodynamic limit, indicating the time-crystal phase. We find that the real parts of subleading eigenvalues exhibit nonmonotonic behavior with increasing squeezing, reflecting the sensitivity of relaxation dynamics to the reservoir properties. Time-domain simulations confirm that the oscillation frequencies correspond to the imaginary parts of the Liouvillian eigenvalues. We also present results on quantum fluctuations in the time-crystal phase. Our results call attention to the study of time crystals in models of cooperativity based on engineered environments.},

While significant progress has been made in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of enantiomer selectivity, many existing studies focus on perfectly chiral cavities that contain only one type of enantiomer. Here, we investigate a scenario of imperfect cavities containing varying mixtures of enantiomers. Using a generalized Hopfield-type model, we systematically explore how the degree of enantiomeric mixing and cavity imperfections affect chiral selectivity. Our analysis includes both an examination of the cavity's eigenmode structure and a quantitative assessment of differential energy transfer into specific enantiomeric species. We demonstrate that both cavity imperfections and the presence of enantiomer mixtures profoundly modify the polaritonic dispersion. We also highlight that pushing the system into the deep strong coupling regime—by increasing molecular concentration—can decrease the efficiency of energy transfer to matter modes. These findings emphasize that precise cavity design and detailed consideration of enantiomeric composition are essential for achieving optimal chiral selectivity in practical cavity QED systems.},

  abstract     = {Optical down-conversion is widely used for generating photon pairs, squeezed and entangled states of light, making it an indispensable tool in quantum optics and quantum information. In the regime where the pump is much stronger than the generated field, the standard parametric approximation treats the pump amplitude as a fixed parameter of the model. This approximation has a limited domain of validity since it assumes a nondepleted and nonentangled pump. By finding an approximate solution to the Schrödinger equation of the down-conversion process, we obtain an improved analytical model beyond the parametric one, which accounts for pump depletion and pump-signal entanglement. Our model is advantageous, first, because it allows one to compute averages of field operators far beyond the domain of validity of the parametric approximation, and second, because it allows one to establish error-specific limits of the latter domain. For a given pump amplitude, we find a maximum squeezing parameter, up to which the approximation remains valid within a specified acceptable error. Our results confirm that recent experiments on Gaussian boson sampling, with a squeezing parameter of and a coherent pump amplitude of , can still be accurately described by the standard parametric approximation. However, we observe a sharp decline in validity as the squeezing parameter increases. For pump amplitudes of , the parametric approximation breaks down when the squeezing parameter exceeds , whereas the new approximation remains valid up to with an acceptable error of 1%.},

  abstract     = {In quantum optics, the postselection amplitude of a nondegenerate parametric down-conversion (PDC) process is linked to a beamsplitter (BS) via partial time reversal, up to a normalization coefficient which is related to the parametric gain [ Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 117 , 33107 (2020) ]. A special example where the gain is low is reminiscent of Klyshko's advanced-wave picture in quantum imaging. Here we propose and prove a generalized duality for multiple spatial paths connecting a quantum nonlinear interference setup consisting of nondegenerate PDCs and linear optical systems to a linear one, where the PDCs are directly replaced by hypothetical wavelength-shifting BSs. This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for -function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.},

  abstract     = {The efficient witnessing and certification of entanglement is necessitated by its ubiquitous use in various aspects of quantum technologies. In the case of continuous-variable bipartite systems, the Shchukin-Vogel hierarchy gives necessary conditions for separability in terms of moments of the mode operators. In this work we derive mode-operator-based witnesses for continuous-variable bipartite entanglement relying on the interference of two states. Specifically, we show how one can access higher moments of the mode operators, crucial for detecting entanglement of non-Gaussian states, using a single beamsplitter with variable phase and photon-number-resolving detectors. We demonstrate that the use of an entangled state paired with a suitable reference state is sufficient to detect entanglement in, e.g., two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON states, and mixed entangled cat states. We also take into account experimental noise, including photon loss and detection inefficiency, as well as finite measurement statistics.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the single-photon scattering spectra in a giant-molecule waveguide quantum electrodynamics system, where a giant molecule consisting of two coupled giant atoms is connected to two waveguides via two separate sites, respectively. The phases of coupling strengths between the giant molecule and waveguides are considered. Using a real-space method, we obtain the exact analytical expressions for the single-photon scattering coefficients, which are valid both in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. It is shown that the transmission spectra strongly depend on phases, including the phases accumulated by photons traveling between coupling points and the phase difference between two coupled channels of the giant-molecule upper (lower) waveguide. Under the Markovian limit, we find that by selecting appropriate accumulated phases and local phase difference, targeted routing and asymmetrical scattering of photons can be achieved without breaking the symmetry in the coupling configuration between the giant molecule and waveguides. Moreover, all the optimal phase combinations for implementing single-photon routing have been summarized. In the non-Markovian regime, the scattering spectra show more complicated line shapes with multiple staggered peaks and dips. More interestingly, the scattering spectrum exhibits periodic changes during the transition from the Markovian to the non-Markovian regime, which makes one obtain a means to control photon routing in addition to phases. Our results may be useful in controlling and manipulating light-matter interactions involving giant atoms at the single-photon level.},

While the previous work was based on symmetry arguments, here we present a fully quantum theory for the SaS scattering that properly explains, quantitatively describes, and provides a means to predict its spectral and polarization properties (for diamond). We also explore the possibilities offered by such a system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the SaS scattering depends on parameters such as the Stokes–anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry, and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the coupling of the fully degenerate triple-photon state generated by three-mode spontaneous parametric down-conversion with the vacuum at a beam splitter via numerical modeling. By using fully degenerate triple-photon states with distinct pump phases as input states, four different squeezed states are extracted at the output, which can be referred to as zero-phase, -phase, -phase, and -phase positive Wigner squeezed states. The non-Gaussianity evolution during the coupling process is quantitatively analyzed via quantum relative entropy, and the entanglement between the two output modes is confirmed from an entropic perspective. Furthermore, the entanglement properties of the zero-phase and -phase positive Wigner squeezed states at the third- and sixth-order moments are revealed by applying the partial transpose positive criterion based on the higher-order covariance matrix. In particular, it is found that the steerability of the two output modes at the third- and sixth-order moments can be dynamically controlled by adjusting the intensity of the input light and the transmission of the beam splitter. These results enrich the repertoire of squeezed states in quantum optics and offer a feasible approach for the deterministic preparation of non-Gaussian entanglement via coupling fully degenerate triple-photon states with vacuum.},

This allows for a powerful numerical solution of optomechanical resonances without any perturbative approximations for the mechanical motion. The scaled population (excitation) dynamics of the Lorentz oscillators are investigated as well as the emitted radiation and electromagnetic spectra, which demonstrates how the usual dipole-dipole resonances couple to the underlying Floquet states, yielding multiple spectral peaks that are separated from the superradiant and subradiant states by an integer number of the mechanical oscillation frequency. Moreover, we observe that when the mechanical amplitude and frequency are sufficiently large, these additional spectral peaks undergo further modification, including spectral splitting, spectral squeezing, or shifting. These observations are fully corroborated by a theoretical Floquet analysis conducted on two coupled harmonic oscillators.},

While non-Hermitian effects have been widely addressed in two-dimensional (2D) systems, we focus on realistic three-dimensional devices. To this end we generalize established phase-space methods from mesoscopic optics and introduce Husimi functions for three-dimensional systems that deepen the insight and access to the mode morphology and their dynamics. We illustrate that four-dimensional Husimi functions can be represented using a specific projection on two dimensions and illustrate it for (conical) cylindrical cavities. The non-Hermitian character of the intrinsically open photonic systems is in particular revealed when examining the transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarization character of the resonance modes. Unlike the 2D case, polarization is not conserved in three-dimensional cavities, and we use generalized Husimi function to represent the interaction of polarization modes. We find their dynamics to be ruled by a network of exceptional points in the parameter space spanned by the refractive index and the cavity geometry tilt angle. This approach not only enhances our understanding of cavity modes but also aids in the design of more efficient photonic devices and systems.},

This approach exploits parity-asymmetric interactions between chiral particles and the metasurface-engineered needle-like optical field, eliminating the need for complex background structures. Leveraging the field manipulation versatility of spin-decoupled metasurfaces, we demonstrate enantiomer separation across thousands of particle diameters—exceeding previous works by an order of magnitude in terms of particle-scale displacement. Furthermore, by tuning the chirality density of the field, directional control of particle motion can be achieved, underscoring its potential for large-scale chiral sorting and enantioselective drug purification.},

However, most existing superscattering techniques depend on complex multilayered structures and primarily aim to enhance scattering magnitudes. In this work, we propose a single-layer plasmonic core-shell nanoparticle that achieves superdirectional scattering without relying on high-permittivity materials and magnetic resonances. We demonstrate that for nanoparticles with a thin plasmonic nanoshell, both dielectric dipolar and quadrupolar resonances occur at nearly the same frequency, where the permittivity of the plasmonic shell approaches zero (degenerate epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) resonances), enabling superscattering in this simple nanoparticle. Furthermore, by tuning the amplitudes of these ENZ resonances, we show that both zero-backward and super-forward scattering can be realized. This approach, relying solely on pure electric ENZ modes in a simple core-shell nanoparticle, offers a new pathway for achieving superdirectional scattering and holds significant potential for applications in photovoltaic devices, biosensors, and nanoantennas.},

To make this connection explicit, we theoretically examine the Born-Kuhn (BK) system, composed of a pair of plasmonic nanorods of variable separation, as a prototypical material model that is both geometrically chiral in its static structure and truly excitationally chiral in its eigenexcitations and eigenfields. By relaying optical chirality metrics of the BK eigenfields back to their underlying sourcing material degrees of freedom, we derive a unique mechanical chirality measure that is related to, but distinct from, other pseudoscalar metrics recently discussed in the literature. Beyond analysis in the absence of sources, we further derive optical chiral extinction, scattering, and absorption cross sections under external drive and discuss their rigorous connection to more common circular dichroism measurements as well as their limitations in comparison to eigenfield chirality metrics. Finally, we investigate the conversion of achiral linearly polarized light into chiral elliptically polarized light through interaction with the BK system, illustrating the conservation of optical chirality in the interaction between light and matter through an analytically tractable example.},

In this work, we systematically investigate the multiple-order differential imaging based on two types of topological singularity in 1D photonic crystals (PhCs). For both oblique and normal incidences, we conduct a detailed investigation of differential imaging effect. For the oblique incident cases, the first type of topological singularities support first-order differential imaging in both x and y directions. Meanwhile, based on the second type of topological singularities, ∂ 2 / ∂ x ∂ y -type differential imaging can be achieved. For the normal incident cases, the first type of topological singularities can support radial second-order and fourth-order differential imaging and the second type of topological singularities can support radial fourth-order differential imaging without the need for fine-tuning of the structural parameters. We further demonstrate the realization of these differential imaging effects in the deep-subwavelength region by shifting the first type of topological singularities into this region. This research connects the topological properties of PhCs with optical differential imaging, paving the way for the development of multiple-order differential imaging devices with improved robustness and functionality.},

By introducing modulation to the optical fields, we realize a momentum lattice featuring nonreciprocal couplings, long-range interactions, and highly tunable parameters. In this platform, the Brillouin zone emerges in real space, enabling band braiding in the E − x space, leading to band structures such as unlinks, unknots, Hopf links, and trefoil knots. The resulting band topology is characterized by the discriminant number in one dimension and homotopy classes in two dimensions. Based on the theory called non-Hermitian absorption spectroscopy, we establish a direct correlation between complex band topological structures and spatially resolved absorption spectra. Interestingly, one can take a photo of the band braiding using an optical camera. Moreover, we propose a protocol to implement a three-band non-Hermitian lattice for exploring non-Abelian topology in a synthetic two-dimensional Brillouin torus and discuss its extension to three dimensions.},

  abstract     = {The far-field intensity distribution of spatiotemporal Laguerre-Gaussian (STLG) modes propagating in free space exhibits a multipetal pattern analogous to that observed in tilted Hermite-Gaussian modes. Here, we show that this phenomenon can be explained by the SU(2) symmetry of spatiotemporal Gaussian modes, which can support the irreducible representation of the SU(2) group and enable the construction of the spatiotemporal model Poincaré sphere. We have also derived analytical expressions for the STLG mode with an arbitrary radial and angular indices propagating in the isotropic media. The propagation dynamics can be understood as a unitary transformation generated by a conserved quantity, where the rotation angle is exactly the intermodal Gouy phase of the spatiotemporal modes in the same order subspace. This spatiotemporal Gouy phase depends on the ellipticity of the wave packets and the group velocity dispersion of the media. The phase, as a function of propagation distance, is categorized into three distinct regimes: normal dispersion, anomalous dispersion, and zero dispersion. Interestingly, in the regime of anomalous dispersion, the nonmonotonic behavior induces both distortion and revival of the intensity distribution, thereby establishing a phase-locked mechanism that is analogous to the Talbot effect.},

  abstract     = {We theoretically investigate light-matter interference phenomena in a hybrid optical cavity–Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) system incorporating both an intracavity optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and atom-atom collisions. Starting from the linearized quantum Langevin equations, we derive the drift matrix and confirm system stability by verifying that all eigenvalue real parts remain negative. We then analyze the probe transmission spectrum under two complementary control mechanisms. First, with collisional interactions suppressed, increasing the OPA gain within the stability region transforms the standard Lorentzian cavity response into a tunable Fano-like profile, accompanied by asymmetric dispersive line shapes and pronounced group delays. Second, with the OPA turned off, including atomic collisions yields an intrinsically narrow Bogoliubov excitation that interferes with the cavity continuum, reproducing Fano resonances, “S-shaped” phase dispersion, slow- and fast-light windows, and positive Goos-Hänchen shifts. By examining both absorptive (real) and dispersive (imaginary) components of the transmitted field, we establish direct links between destructive interference pathways, steep phase slopes, and enhanced optical delays. Our results demonstrate that parametric amplification and collisional nonlinearities are equally versatile tools for engineering quantum interference in cavity QED with ultracold atoms, opening prospects for reconfigurable slow-light buffers, Fano-switchable photonic routers, and atom-integrated delay lines.},

We analytically derive the linear and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities for both scalar and vector probe beams. Our observations indicate that, in addition to the energy transfer from the control beam to the probe beam, the giant cross-Kerr nonlinearity facilitates the focusing of the scalar probe beam into a significantly smaller spot size. Conversely, the vector probe beams exhibit gain-induced narrowing. Furthermore, we evaluate the state of polarization for the vector beam at the minimum beam waist, observing a polarization rotation and a change in ellipticity during propagation. Through the mechanism of focusing, we achieve a reduced spot size for the probe beam, which may have substantial implications for resolution enhancement in microscopy applications.},

Our scheme enables mass detection by monitoring shifts in the second-order sideband generation efficiency when a target mass is deposited on the dielectric membrane. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we identify the maximum achievable efficiency of the second-order upper sideband and its corresponding optimal sensitivity. Remarkably, with the aid of a gain cavity, both the sideband efficiency and mass sensitivity are significantly enhanced—particularly near the exceptional point, where improvements exceeding three orders of magnitude are demonstrated.

  abstract     = {Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are electromagnetic eigenstates that theoretically exhibit infinite quality factors. However, scattering losses induced by manufacturing defects inevitably affect the confinement performance of BICs. Studies have shown that combining multiple BICs can enhance their robustness against such defects. Currently, approaches to merging BICs at off- points typically rely on altering the geometry of the central structure, which not only increases the complexity of device design but also potentially raises costs. Based on this, we propose a scheme that maintains the central structure while introducing specific defect holes to break the in-plane symmetry of the system, thereby inducing the splitting of the higher-order BIC and forming multiple off- BICs. Subsequently, these split BICs, along with the accidental BICs, will merge at the off- point as the structural parameters are varied. The proposed concept not only enhances optical confinement but also enables flexible control over the splitting direction of the higher-order BIC by manipulating the spatial positions of the defect apertures. More importantly, by rationally designing the positions of defects, we can construct merging BICs at arbitrary wave vectors through manipulations of split BICs and accidental BICs. Furthermore, even in the presence of manufacturing defects, the merging BICs demonstrate exceptional robustness. This provides new insights for the flexible control of BICs in diversified applications while also expanding their potential in a broader momentum space.},

In this study, we present a tunable bilayer optical matter motor controlled by distance-modulated electromagnetic interlayer coupling. Using the generalized Lorentz-Mie scattering theory for multispheres and the Langevin dynamics method, we investigate the dynamics of the bilayer motor during light-driven self-organization and rotation. Through the modulation of the interlayer distance to tune coupling effects, we demonstrate the capacity to selectively manipulate the rotation modes of the motor—both layers can rotate clockwise (receiving negative optical torque), rotate anticlockwise, or counterrotate. These modes arise from changes in the relative contributions of excited electric and magnetic multipoles, offering an intuitive understanding of interlayer coupling from the perspective of multipoles. The bilayer motor exhibits stable rotation across a wide range of coupling distances due to strong long-range electromagnetic coupling, and demonstrates excellent robustness to both the polarization of the incident light and structural offset from the beam center, facilitating experimental implementation. Our structural stability analysis indicates that bilayer optical matter motors constructed from equilateral triangular units maintain remarkable stability during light-driven self-organization and rotation, even with varying interlayer coupling. This research enhances our understanding of light-matter interactions in the dynamics of bilayer optical matter systems while providing theoretical foundations for novel micromotor design.},

Here, we propose a scheme for realizing the classical non-Abelian braiding of coupled modes in photonic waveguides system. The Hamiltonian of the designed system is built via the interplay between two sub-Hamiltonians, where one of them enables the non-Abelian braiding, while the other one generates the coupled modes. In this way, the non-Abelian braiding of coupled modes of arbitrarily high order can be realized. We carry out numerical simulations to verify the concept for coupled modes with an order of four, including the mode switching behavior as well as the non-Abelian geometric phase. The proposed concept may lead to on-chip applications including mode division multiplexing non-Abelian braiding.},

  abstract     = {We present a theoretical study of a random laser (RL) formed by a scale-free photonic network (PN) with dissipative photon tunneling between microcavities (MCs) hosting two-level quantum systems (TLSs). Using the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad framework, we identify two distinct lasing regimes. The first is independent of the tunneling parameter and emerges when the steady-state frequency of the mode is resonant with the TLS transition. This resembles lasing in uncoupled MCs and relies on population inversion. The second scenario arises from the nonreciprocal nature of dissipative tunneling and enables lasing of nonresonant modes even at vanishingly small population inversion, owing to energy redistribution across the network. In the latter case, interference effects along graph paths induce node-dependent frequency shifts and nonreciprocal photon transmission. We further propose a renormalization-group hypothesis for the PN to explain the observed spectral features. We analyze the phase structure of photonic modes in the scale-free RL and discuss its relevance for photonic Ising machines operating under the minimum power dissipation principle.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the intersection of quantum optics and attosecond physics has attracted growing interest. Here, we study the quantum optical signatures of high-harmonic generation (HHG) from solid-state material driven by squeezed coherent states. We find that squeezed coherent states can either enhance or suppress the HHG yields compared to that driven by coherent light, depending on the photon bunching or antibunching characteristics of driving light. The analysis on semiclassical trajectories indicates that the amplitude fluctuation alters the recombination energy, while the phase fluctuation affects the birth and recombination time of electron-hole pairs. By calculating the Husimi Q distributions of HHG, we demonstrate that the squeezing of the two conjugate quadratures of driving light asymmetrically influence the squeezing phase of harmonics. Surprisingly, we find that even under coherent driving, the harmonics still exhibit squeezing due to the highly nonlinear response of solid-state HHG, which was overlooked previously. Numerical calculations of the Mandel parameter are performed to characterize the photon statistics of emitted HHG arising from different microscopic mechanisms. The results indicate that intraband radiation can exhibit a super-Poissonian distribution, while interband emission exhibits sub-Poissonian distribution under coherent driving.},

  abstract     = {Single-mode semiconductor lasers support fast nonlinear dynamics for investigating extreme events. Although one laser subject to perturbation is sufficient for yielding extreme events, multiple lasers with mutual interactions have yet to be considered. Here, extreme events are found experimentally using two detuned lasers under delayed mutual injection. The mutually injected lasers each emit an intensity that exhibits locking to a constant, except for interruptions by intermittent pulses, including very strong ones as extreme events. Such extreme eruptions from a constant background under mutual injection are different from the continual chaotic oscillations usually obtained under unidirectional injections. By varying the detuning frequency between the lasers, the intermittent pulsations with extreme events are found in a route that involves regular switching between constant and periodic oscillatory intensities. By adopting space-time representation, the extreme events are observed to emerge stochastically, together with some partial repetitions of pulses corresponding to a slightly lengthened round trip. By optimizing the detuning, the maximal normalized occurrence of extreme events reaches 0.8%, which is relatively high among approaches on lasers without external modulations for excitations. On average, about six extreme events are yielded within one round trip of 130 ns, while their short pulse widths are of the order of 0.1 ns. Applicable to generating strong random electrical pulses, the experiments point to the importance of mutual interactions in single-mode lasers for extreme events.},

The Photon extra-bunching effect, as a special class of the superbunching effect ( ), describes the enhanced photon correlation ( ) through the interference of bright twin beams produced in the spontaneous parametric down-conversion. In this work, we report that this effect can exist in classical beams and that can approach 4 in some extended extreme models. We experimentally demonstrate the nontrivial extra-bunching correlation ( gain) in pairwise-generated holographic thermal light beams with a Dove prism-embedded balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The interaction of such a pair of conjugated thermal light beams can generate a pair of uncorrelated superthermal light beams, enabling ghost imaging and Young's intensity interference with enhanced visibility. The quantum-inspired interference-induced spatial extra-bunching effect provides novel insights into inducing superbunching correlation in classical light and holds the potential for application in the coherent two-photon Lidar system to enhance sensitivity.},

Stability of the dynamic equilibrium of the laser pulse is analyzed and numerically simulated, taking into account the variation of the air density, linear and nonlinear dispersion, and turbulence level, as a function of altitude. In the dynamic equilibrium, the spot size, pulse duration, wave-front curvature, phase, and chirp evolve self-consistently along the propagation path. Significant intensity enhancement at remote distances is achieved by tailoring the laser parameters in such a way that the transverse and longitudinal focal points nearly coincide. In addition, the hybrid filamentation-modulation instability is analyzed and simulated, indicating that the beam breaks up transversely and longitudinally.

We have studied our levitated system over a wide range of trapping parameters and determined four distinct dynamical states of the trapped particle motion, which are associated with the retaining force and drag force nonlinearities. Like any other nonlinear system, the considered one possesses a phase transition in its behavior that demarcates linear and nonlinear regimes of motion. The nonlinear regime manifests itself as the formation of a specific limit cycle of the trapped particle motion also known as an extended orbit . We have shown that the birth of the extended orbits is foretold by the appearance of half-integer trapping frequency multiples in the particle motion oscillation. These half-integer multiples are highly sensitive to trapping parameters and external perturbation. We have demonstrated that the phase transition is a continuous process over a range of system parameters and can be exploited to detect small influences on the levitated system. We have tested the system response in the transient state to the external optical perturbation. The strong sensitivity to perturbation laser power has been shown for both the spectral composition of the trapped particle translational oscillations and extended orbit formation point.

This universality is typically described by effective field theory, in which the two-body interaction is renormalized to a single parameter—the scattering length. For systems of identical bosons, the three-body problem reveals the Efimov effect, a novel phenomenon proposed that necessitates the introduction of an additional three-body parameter. However, the exact relation between this three-body parameter, the coupling constants in the effective field theory, and the binding energies of Efimov states remains unresolved. In this work, we address this question through a comprehensive analysis of the Skorniakov–Ter-Martirosian equation with a finite cutoff. We establish an exact renormalization relation for the three-body parameter and determine its connection to the energies of Efimov bound states. These results are validated through high-precision numerical simulations. We expect our findings to be of fundamental interest across various fields, including atomic, nuclear, condensed matter, and particle physics, and to have broad applications in both few-body and many-body physics.},

We employ two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a new Ansatz for vortex cores in planar quantum fluids that enhances analytic integrability. This Ansatz yields closed-form expressions for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions. Using it, we identify distinct signatures of short- and long-range velocity correlations corresponding to vortex dipoles and vortex pairs, respectively. Second, we analyze the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton. By applying the asymptotic high-velocity wave function, we derive analytic expressions for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the soliton characteristic length scale. We validate our analytical results for the homogeneous system against numerical treatment of a large trapped system, finding close quantitative agreement.

  abstract     = {The sensitive axis of an atom gravimeter is defined by the direction of the Raman lasers. Any tilt of the Raman lasers with respect to the vertical direction introduces systematic errors in gravity measurements. In this work, we report a determination of the tilt of Raman lasers, where the fringe of the atom interferometer is scanned by varying the tilt, rather than the phase, of the Raman lasers. Unlike the periodic cosine fringes typically used in atom interferometers, the fringe obtained by changing the tilt, referred to as the tilt-scanned fringe, is aperiodic in tilt and exhibits a shift due to the presence of a nonzero tilt. The tilt-scanned fringe is highly sensitive to the tilt-caused shift, enabling convenient and precise determination of the Raman laser tilt in atom gravimeters. We demonstrate that one tilt-scanned fringe, corresponding to a tilt measurement sampling time of 13 s, can determine the tilt with a typical precision of about in our developed atom gravimeter. The short-term sensitivity and measurement accuracy of the tilt-scanned fringe method were evaluated, demonstrating performance comparable to conventional tilt determination techniques. We expect this method to offer a convenient solution for Raman laser alignment in atom gravimeters and enhance the efficiency of absolute gravity surveys.},

  abstract     = {The advent of ultracold alkaline-earth atoms in optical lattices has established a platform for investigating correlated quantum matter with symmetry, offering highly tunable model parameters that allow experiments to access phenomena that are unavailable in conventional materials. Understanding the ground-state physics of Fermi-Hubbard models away from the Heisenberg limit and from the spin-flavor balanced setting is important, as examining the flavor imbalance reveals new physics in Fermi-Hubbard models and shows how phases react to practical experimental imperfections in optical lattices. In this study, mean-field phase diagrams are presented for the unit-density SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model at two sets of flavor densities, and , with the flavor imbalance introduced as . Novel phases are identified at moderate interaction strengths for both densities, and their robustness is investigated in the presence of flavor imbalance. Furthermore, we provide microscopic explanations of the phases found and their stability. Analysis of thermal ensembles of random mean-field solutions indicate that, at temperatures accessible in state-of-the-art cold atom experiments, some spin orders are hard for conventional scattering or local observable measurements to detect, but can be more accessible with quantum gas microscopy in optical lattice experiments. This work also shows that nesting and Mottness, intertwined in the usual SU(2) Hubbard model in stark contrast to generic materials, can be tuned in the SU(3) model and play distinct roles. The resulting phase diagrams not only deepen our understanding of Fermi-Hubbard models but also inform future experimental search for new phases.},

Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability types are studied under strong perturbations. Without external perturbation, instabilities are also probed by immiscible-to-miscible quenching transition, under two different initial configurations. Our numerical simulations show that all such instability dynamics are dominated by large vortex production and sound-wave (phonon) propagation. For long-term propagation, vortex dynamics become dominant over sound waves in the KH instability, while sound-wave excitations predominate in the other cases. For all the dynamical simulations, the emergence of possible scaling laws are investigated for the compressible and incompressible parts of the kinetic energy spectra, in terms of the wave number .

  abstract     = {The most sensitive direct neutrino mass searches today are based on measurement of the end point of the spectrum of tritium to infer limits on the mass of the unobserved neutrino. To avoid the smearing associated with the distribution of molecular final states in the T-He molecule, the next generation of these experiments will need to employ atomic (T) rather than molecular tritium sources, at currents of at least atoms per second. Following production, atomic T can be trapped in gravitational and/or magnetic bottles for spectrum experiments, if and only if it can first be cooled to millikelvin temperatures. Accomplishing this cooling presents substantial technological challenges. The Project 8 collaboration is developing a technique based on magnetic evaporative cooling along a beamline (MECB) for the purpose of cooling T to feed a magnetogravitational trap that also serves as a cyclotron radiation emission spectroscope. Initial tests of the approach are planned in a pathfinder apparatus using atomic Li. This paper presents a method for analyzing the dynamics of the MECB technique and applies these calculations to the design of systems for cooling and slowing of atomic Li and T. A scheme is outlined that could provide a current of T at the millikelvin temperatures required for the Project 8 neutrino mass search.},

Invoking an ensemble-average formalism and assuming spatial translation symmetry, we show that the dynamics can be described by a Lindblad master equation with an interpolated coherent Hamiltonian. In the classical limit, the interpolation Hamiltonian leads to a set of nonlinear equations of motion, where limit cycles can emerge in the long-time dynamics. In the quantum limit, by contrast, the system approaches a ferromagnetic steady state at long times. In between the two extremes, the discrete spatial translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken, as an antiferromagnetic steady state emerges, bridging the classical and quantum regimes. In particular, we illustrate how the classical limit-cycle behavior gradually disappears with the increase of quantum correlation. Since our model in the two extremes respectively applies to a dissipative Rydberg gas in the high- and zero-temperature limits, we expect it to provide a qualitatively correct description of dissipative Rydberg gases at interim temperatures and shed light on the fate of limit cycles in a quantum open system.},

When the dipole frequencies along the three symmetric axes of the harmonic trap are degenerate, the dipole motion can decompose into two coupled transverse modes in the plane perpendicular to the synthetic magnetic field, and another decoupled longitudinal mode, enabling controllable Foucault-like precession or biconical trajectories depending on the excitation protocol. Furthermore, quenching the orientation of the synthetic magnetic field excites multiple coupled quadrupole modes. We develop a hydrodynamic theory whose predictions match well with Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the effects of the synthetic magnetic field and the excitations of the collective mode in quantum fluids, providing a foundation for future developments in quantum simulation and high-precision sensing technologies.},

Moreover, it highlights the relevance of energy damping, the number-conserving scattering between thermal and coherent atoms. We analyze the equilibrium properties and near-equilibrium relaxation of a homogeneous BEC in one, two, and three dimensions at high phase-space density and calculate the autocorrelation function and power spectrum of the density and phase fluctuations.

We solve the Schrödinger equation for a fermionic system across a broad range of attractive and repulsive interactions by constructing the system's wave function as a superposition of two-coboson states. We determine key observables such as particle density profiles and two-body correlations. The density profiles calculated agree with both the Tonks-Girardeau and Lieb-Liniger limits and provide a portrait of the transition between those regimes. In the strong repulsive regime, the ansatz captures the Fridel-Wigner transition characterized by a doubling of the peaks in the density profiles. Additionally, we compute the low-lying energy spectrum and estimate the pairing gap.

In a two-dimensional (2D) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at zero temperature, in addition to the vortex drift-out process from the boundary, a vortex-antivortex pair can annihilate in bulk, but controversy remains on the number of vortices involved in the annihilation process. We find that a dynamic crossover exists from four-body to three-body vortex annihilation processes with time evolution in decaying 2D quantum turbulence of a boundary-less uniform quasi-2D BEC. Such a dynamical crossover depends on the initial vortex pair density and occurs when the sound waves generated in the vortex annihilation process surpass a threshold energy. As the confinement along the third direction is relaxed in a quasi-2D BEC, the threshold sound wave energy decreases due to the three-dimensional (3D) vortex line curve and reconnection, shifting the dynamical crossover to the early time. Our work reveals an elementary mechanism for the dissipation of vortex energy that may help understand exotic matter and dynamics in quantum liquids.},

Stability maps in the plane of the solitons' norm and interaction strength exhibit areas of monostability, oscillatory behavior, and soliton splitting. Solitons with complex stationary wave functions emerge as ground states in broad parameter areas due to the effects of the LHY terms.

Using light beams with orbital angular momentum, we theoretically show how to create a stable, pinned vortex configuration, where the rotating component is confined to the region surrounded by the second, nonrotating component. The atoms constituting this vortex can be localized in volumes much smaller than the volume occupied by the second component. We also show that the vortex position can be changed dynamically by moving the laser beams, provided the beams' movement speed remains below the speed of sound. This allows us to use the localized vortex to stir the second component, and to determine the superfluid flow's critical velocity.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, high harmonic generation (HHG) from topological matter has attracted considerable interest, emerging as a promising tool for detecting the topological phase. This work incorporates dephasing effects in the theoretical simulations of HHG from topological insulators described by finite-size tight-binding models. This is done by formulating a density-matrix approach in both length and velocity gauges within dipole approximation, with a gauge-invariant treatment of dephasing properly introduced such that the HHG response of a sufficiently large solidlike system is consistent with the periodic limit obtained using semiconductor Bloch equations. Applying the approach to Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains reveals how dephasing affects the impact of topological edge states on the HHG spectra. It is found that dephasing can either weaken or strengthen the spectral contrast between the topological and trivial phases, depending on which of the intra- and interband mechanisms is dominant for a specific harmonic in the trivial phase.},

In usual treatments of the photoeffect, the final state is represented by a plane-wave scattering state in which the ejected photoelectron is characterized by a definite linear momentum. We consider the photoeffect in which the ejected photoelectron is described by a vortex scattering state and characterized by a definite projection of its angular momentum on a given vortex axis. Although the plane-wave and vortex transition matrix elements can be expressed in terms of each other, the corresponding cross sections cannot. We develop a theory of the molecular photoeffect with vortex photoelectrons, which includes the introduction and analysis of various vortex photoionization observables and their averaging over molecular orientations. The averaging is essential for treating photoionization of randomly oriented molecules in the gas phase. We show that the averaged vortex differential cross sections reveal new chiral asymmetries caused by the chirality of the vortex photoelectron, which generalize the phenomenon of photoelectron circular dichroism. The theory is illustrated by calculations for the glyceraldehyde molecule described within the molecular zero-range potential model. We also propose and validate by calculations a scheme based on a ring-shaped forked grating which allows, at least in principle, to verify our predictions experimentally.},

We find that the cutoff position of the harmonic spectrum emitted from the ring-current state is extended, but the harmonic efficiency is reduced in a chirped IR field compared with a chirp-free IR field. This harmonic broadening can be well understood by the semiclassical three-step model and the quantum time-frequency analysis. By introducing a UV field into the chirped IR field with a proper chirp parameter, both the efficiency and chirality of harmonic spectrum can be improved. Our analysis indicates that the generation of the elliptically polarized harmonics can be attributed to the asymmetric emission of ionized electrons in the y direction. By optimizing the laser parameters, an isolated 98-as pulse with an ellipticity up to 0.94 is obtained by the broadband elliptically polarized supercontinuum. Our approach provides an effective way to generate and control the sub-100-as isolated elliptically polarized pulses.},

Recent experimental and theoretical progress has put metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunneling nanojunctions in the spotlight of ultrafast science. Waveform-controlled laser fields can induce ultrafast currents in these junctions, opening the door to petahertz electronic operation and attosecond-scale scanning tunneling microscopy. Inspired by our strong-field model for attosecond tunneling microscopy [B. Ma and M. Krüger, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133 , 236901 (2024) ], here we generalize our model to MIM nanojunctions. We introduce several refinements and corrections, accounting for the image potential inside the gap and boundary effects. Moreover, we also find that the Keldysh parameter, which is a hallmark parameter for ultrafast light-matter interactions, alone is insufficient for describing the physics in thin MIM nanojunctions. We introduce a new parameter that accounts for the effects of the limited size of the junction and provide several interpretations of the parameter that shed new light on the complex physics in the light-driven junction. Most strikingly, we find that for photon-assisted tunneling is dominating the ultrafast electron transport across the junction, regardless of the value of the Keldysh parameter. Here one or more photons are absorbed and the electron undergoes static tunneling through the barrier. is required for a regime in which the laser field and the Keldysh parameter dominate the transport. We also discuss the three-step model of electron transport across the nanojunction in the adiabatic regime, the energy cutoff of the transported electrons, and the carrier-envelope phase control of the net current. Our theory model provides a rich toolbox for understanding and predicting the physics of ultrafast MIM nanojunctions.},

As the ionizing field strength increases, the shape of the ionization rate can deviate from this pattern. The oft-cited explanation is that the increasing contribution of excited states relative to the ground state modifies the distribution. In this paper we show that orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, which are independent of excited-state effects, can also significantly modify the angular dependence of the yields of widely studied molecules where excited state effects are negligible. For example, as the ionizing field increases we find that (1) in CO, orbital distortion is responsible for the switch of the position of the global maximum in the orientation-dependent ionization rate to the opposite orientation, and (2) in , the interplay between orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transforms a local minimum to a local maximum. To simulate orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, we use the one-electron weak-field asymptotic theory including the first-order correction [OE-WFAT(1)] in the integral representation. Since OE-WFAT(1) incurs expensive computations when the number of orientation angles is large, we also reformulate the original OE-WFAT(1) algorithm into a partial-wave expansion form, which greatly enhances the efficiency of the method.},

The subsequent Larmor precession of the atomic magnetic moment is probed via continuous ionization by an optical dipole trap (ODT) laser. The resulting ionization fragments—photoelectrons and photoions—are detected in coincidence using a cold target recoil ion momentum spectrometer (COLTRIMS). While the ODT facilitates further cooling of the atoms, its continuous-wave laser field does not provide the pulsed timing reference typically required to extract photoelectron momentum distributions in COLTRIMS. Here, we present an extension of the standard COLTRIMS technique that exploits redundancies in the measured data to reconstruct the ionization time.

Spectroscopy of trapped atomic samples can greatly improve the accuracy of these tests. Trapping atomic hydrogen in an optical dipole trap or an optical lattice has never been achieved. Only trapping in magnetic fields that lead to large Zeeman shifts has been demonstrated. Standard techniques of atomic physics are difficult to apply to atomic hydrogen. The small mass of the atom and the large photon energy of the 1 S -2 P cooling transition significantly complicate Doppler cooling. This proposal introduces a photon recoil-assisted loading scheme that uses these properties to our advantage to load atomic hydrogen into an optical dipole trap without laser cooling. The magic wavelength (515 nm) for the 1 S -2 S clock transition (1.3-Hz natural linewidth) is easily accessible with current laser technology. Since the 1 S -2 S clock transition can be driven Doppler free, we do not require a very low temperature. Besides improving spectroscopy for fundamental science, such a system can also be used as a “computable” atomic clock that may one day justify the redefinition of the SI second in terms of the Rydberg constant.},

  abstract     = {We describe a novel type of interaction between open-shell polar molecules at sub-millikelvin temperatures. This hyperfine van der Waals interaction occurs between two molecules in two rotational states that differ by one quantum. Normally, this induces resonant dipolar interactions that lead to rapid collisional loss. For specific hyperfine states, however, selection rules prevent this. One can effectively turn off the dipolar interaction by merely flipping a nuclear spin. The resulting van der Waals interaction can be repulsive and can suppress collisional loss. We focus on laser-coolable CaF, but show this effect occurs universally for open-shell molecules, including MgF, SrF, BaF and YO. We propose that this effect could be measured by merging molecules in optical tweezers, where flipping a spin in one of the tweezers enables tuning of collision rates by five orders of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {We study single-photon ionization of aligned H 2 + in low-intensity near-circular laser fields with lower photon energy numerically and analytically. The photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) within the laser polarization plane, obtained by numerical simulations, shows a remarkable offset angle, which changes with changing the internuclear distance and the laser frequency. This phenomenon is different from that observed in recent experiments [ Science 370 , 339 (2020) ], which is related to the PMD along the propagation direction of the laser. This phenomenon holds even for H 2 + with short-range Coulomb potentials but disappears for atoms, different from that observed in attoclock experiments. We show that the molecular Coulomb potential near the two atomic centers plays an important role here, and theoretical models associated with a more accurate continuum wave function of the molecule are needed for reproducing this phenomenon. This phenomenon also appears for other molecules such as N 2 . It can be useful for ultrafast probing of molecules with a high resolution of several attoseconds or even zeptoseconds.},

For 75 keV proton collisions with helium, various experimental data are available. However, previous theoretical calculations found significant discrepancies across the entire range of data. In this work the wave-packet convergent close-coupling method is extended to calculating these cross sections for electrons ejected with energies from 1 to 75.4 eV. The approach utilizes a two-center expansion and correlated two-electron helium wave functions to describe the four-body proton-helium system. While there is good agreement with the experiment for electrons ejected with energies near the matching-velocity point, elsewhere, the results overall do not support the picture provided by the available measurements. Hence, further investigations, both theoretical and experimental, are necessary to resolve the intermediate-energy proton-helium differential ionization problem.},

By analyzing the correlation maps as a function of kinetic energy release and the angle between the conjugate momenta of the first and second breakup steps as well as the momentum correlation spectra of three fragment ions (Newton diagram) in these three channels, we separate two distinct sequential mechanisms involving proton emission in the first or second step of sequential fragmentation. Moreover, we determine the relative ratio of the two dissociation pathways for each channel. We find that proton emission in the first step of the sequential dissociation is the dominant process (94% branching ratio) for the channel involving the H migration of . It can be explained by the pyridine trication undergoing ultrafast hydrogen migration and forming a more stable -isomeric ion, which attenuates the ring-opening reactions.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multilevel qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in nonlocal operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the nonlocality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. Notably, for superconducting devices, the control complexity of qudits compared to qubits does not increase prohibitively for four-level systems, making them practical for near-term demonstrations, though control challenges grow with increasing dimensionality. Therefore, we provide solutions to the operator decompositions of the Trotterized quantum dynamics into one- and two-qudit gates for all mappings. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t − V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Finally, we show the connection between the plaquette constraint of our mapping and the Z 2 toric code. This connection can be exploited to prove that the ground state of the localized qudit mapping can be efficiently prepared using quantum circuits or measurement-based feedback control. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.},

In this work, measurement-based braiding about MZM Y junctions is simulated by multiqubit parity measurements of a logical qubit. Logical single-qubit geometric S ( † ) and entangling two-qubit braiding operations are shown using two-physical-qubit joint measurements alone, while T ( † ) gates corresponding to a kind of partial-braiding operation require at least one three-qubit joint measurement.

This approach, termed intermediate-state-based Lyapunov control (ISB-LC), allows for greater flexibility in designing control Hamiltonians and facilitates faster convergence without compromising robustness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ISB-LC using several open quantum systems, including three-, four-, and six-level configurations, as well as entangled steady-state generation in interacting Rydberg atoms. Numerical simulations show that ISB-LC can reduce convergence times by more than an order of magnitude, offering a promising route for enhancing dissipation-based quantum control protocols.},

Compared with quantum metrology with entangled states of multiple qubits, bosonic interferometers have the advantage of being hardware efficient, enabled by the infinite-dimension Hilbert space of bosonic modes. Phase estimations with precisions approaching the Heisenberg limit have been demonstrated with superpositions of Fock states of single bosonic modes. We here present a scheme for realizing quantum metrology based on a fundamentally distinct kind of superposition states, Schrödinger cat states, defined as quantum superpositions of two quasiclassial states of a bosonic mode. The interferometer aims to estimate the frequency shift of a photonic mode with respect to a reference frequency, which produces a phase-space rotation. We find that such a phase-space rotation can be extracted with a qubit, without mapping the state of the photonic mode to the qubit. This phase-space rotation is directly related to the qubit's population through the combination of a phase-space displacement, a dispersive qubit-photon interaction, and two qubit rotations. The signal-to-noise ratio exhibits a scaling approaching the Heisenberg limit, like interferometers based on Fock state superpositions, but without requiring a step-by-step procedure to prepare the resource state.},

However, scalable quantum processors remain limited by the challenge of achieving strong, controllable interactions between distant NV spins. Here, we propose a scalable architecture utilizing optically levitated nanodiamond arrays, where torsional vibrations mediate the coherent coupling between the embedded NV centers. By optimizing the shape of ellipsoidal nanoparticles, we achieve a light-induced coupling strength exceeding 119 kHz between torsional modes of the distant levitated nanodiamonds, which are two orders of magnitude larger than the typical decoherence rates in this system. This strong interaction, combined with magnetic-field-enabled spin-torsion coupling, establishes an effective interaction between the spatially separated NV centers in the distant nanodiamonds. Numerical simulations confirm that dynamic decoupling can suppress both thermal noise and spin dephasing, enabling two-qubit gates with fidelity exceeding 99%.

Owing to the rapid growth of quantum correlations following a quench, classical methods face significant challenges even if an efficient description of the equilibrium state is available. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative. However, existing approaches often assume access to the equilibrium state, which may be difficult to prepare in practice. In this work, we present a method that circumvents this by using energy filter techniques, enabling the computation of response functions and other dynamical properties in both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. Our approach only requires the preparation of states that have significant weight at the desired energy. The dynamical response functions are then reconstructed from measurements after quenches of varying duration by classical postprocessing. We illustrate the algorithm numerically by applying it to compute the dynamical conductivity of a free-fermion model, which unveils the energy-dependent localization properties of the model.},

We give a comparative analysis of two primary stellar interferometric schemes: amplitude interferometry and intensity interferometry. Notably, the nulling strategy employed in amplitude interferometry, a configuration specifically proposed for exoplanet detection by leveraging destructive interference to suppress the brighter source, is quantum optimal for separation estimation. While intensity interferometry is less effective than amplitude interferometry in lossless scenarios and fails to achieve superresolution, it becomes competitive when optical loss in large-scale interferometry is considered. By applying these methodologies to modern stellar interferometry, we highlight the promise of large-scale interferometry for advancing high-resolution astronomical observation.},

  abstract     = {Quantum error mitigation (QEM) schemes have greatly enhanced the performance of quantum computers, mostly by reducing errors caused by interactions with the environment. Nevertheless, the presence of coherence errors, typically arising from miscalibration and interqubit crosstalk, is a significant challenge to the scalability of quantum computing. Such errors are often addressed using a refined Pauli twirling scheme called randomized compiling (RC) that converts the coherent errors into incoherent errors that can then be mitigated by conventional QEM. Unfortunately for multiqubit gates, RC is restricted to Clifford gates such as cnot and cphase . However, it has been demonstrated experimentally that a direct implementation of multiqubit non-Clifford gates, i.e., without using multiqubit Clifford gates, has reduced the depth of the circuit by a factor of four and more. Recently, a framework called pseudotwirling (PST) for treating coherent error in multiqubit non-Clifford gates has been introduced and experimentally demonstrated. We show analytically that a higher-order correction to the existing PST theory yields an over-rotation coherent error generated by the PST protocol itself. This PST effect has no analog in RC. Although the small induced over-rotation can amount to a significant coherent error in deep circuits, we explain why it does not degrade the performance of the gate. Interestingly, we find that a simplified twirling scheme that was introduced and exploited experimentally by Kim et al . also displays an induced over-rotation. We study the conditions under which the two twirling schemes display the same over-rotation behavior.},

Here, we demonstrate that the answer is 1 if the number of logical qubits is even, and 2 otherwise. Furthermore, we present a sufficient condition for a given parity gate set to be universal. This leads to a variety of different universal parity gate sets corresponding to different numbers of auxiliary qubits and more generally contributes to the understanding of which entangling gates are required to augment the set of single-qubit unitaries to perform universal quantum computing.

Under the biorthogonal condition, the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian could be triangularized in a constraint picture spanned by a set of completed and orthonormal basis states, which is found to be a sufficient condition to construct at least one universal nonadiabatic passage in both bra and ket spaces. The passage ends up with a desired target state that is automatically normalized without artificial normalization in the existing treatments for non-Hermitian quantum systems. Moreover, the passage is found to be robust against the parametric deviation when the real part of its global phase is rapidly varying with time. Our protocol is explicitly verified for the perfect population transfer in the two-level system and the chiral population transfer in the three-level system.

However, existing IGTBQC protocols lack mechanisms for clients to verify the correctness of computation results and deal with only one type of clients capable of preparing qubits. To address these limitations, we first extend the current IGTBQC protocol to be a verifiable one and then propose another verifiable IGTBQC protocol tailored for a different type of clients with the capability of measuring single-qubit states. Furthermore, both protocols are shown to satisfy blindness and verification simultaneously in a relatively formal way.

  abstract     = {Using the bitstring probabilities of ground states of bipartitioned ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the mutual information, which is a lower bound on the corresponding bipartite von Neumann quantum entanglement entropy S A vN . We show that in many cases these lower bounds can be improved by removing the bitstrings with a probability lower than some value p min and renormalizing the remaining probabilities (filtering). We propose a heuristic based on the change of the conditional entropy under filtering that very effectively improves the estimate of S A vN . We consider various sizes, lattice spacings, and bipartitions. Our numerical investigation suggest that the filtered mutual information obtained with samples having just a few thousand bitstrings can provide reasonably close estimates of S A vN . We briefly discuss practical implementations with QuEra's Aquila device.},

  abstract     = {Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) enables two remote parties to share an information-theoretically secure key without any assumptions on the inner workings of the devices used. Device-independent conference key agreement (DI-CKA) is multipartite DI-QKD in which more than two parties share a common secure key. The performance of DI-CKA, however, is strictly limited because of its susceptibility to losses due to, e.g., imperfect detection efficiency and channel transmission. Here, we propose a DI-CKA protocol which reduces this limitation by using a heralding scheme to distribute multipartite entanglement. We analyze key rates of our protocol for two different measurement scenarios, and we show that our protocol outperforms a previous DI-CKA protocol even with an experimentally feasible measurement.},

However, the quantum information processing in the three-level system is also subject to the decoherence induced by the interaction between the quantum system and its environment or by the crosstalk between different qutrits. In this work, we construct a sequence of physically feasible dynamical decoupling operators for the three-level system to mitigate not only the transverse dephasing between the excited state and ground states, but also the longitudinal relaxation among them. Combining the Hamiltonian engineering and our constructed dynamical decoupling sequence, we further realize the dynamical decoupling protection of qutrit-based quantum gates. Our scheme can effectively enhance the fidelity of three-level-based quantum gates through filtering out the environmental noises, which may provide a new horizon to improve the accuracy of three-level-based quantum manipulation.},

However, estimating properties of an unknown quantum state is expected to be more feasible with random Pauli measurements than with random Clifford measurements in the near future. Inspired by the importance sampling technique applied to sampling Pauli measurements for DFE, we show that similar strategies can be derived from classical shadows. Specifically, we describe efficient methods using only local Pauli measurements to perform DFE with Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ), and Dicke states, establishing tighter bounds (by factors of 14.22 and 16 for GHZ and /Dicke, respectively) on the number of measurements required for desired precision. These protocols are derived by adjusting the distribution of observables. Notably, they require no preprocessing steps other than the sampling algorithms.},

Alternatively, the evolution speed of a quantum system could also be studied based on its evolution path. It is found that if we define the evolution speed of a quantum unitary system as the changing rate of the path distance between a quantum state and the state during its evolution, the instantaneous evolution speed is determined by the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues, rather than its expectation value or variance imposed on any quantum state. More specifically, the range of the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues determines the evolution speed of a quantum system through the relation ω H = 1 2 ( λ max − λ min ) , which is independent of the quantum state. Given an initial state ρ 0 in a quantum unitary system, the minimum time required to evolve it to a target state ρ τ is τ min = L min ( ρ 0 , ρ τ ) ω H , where L min ( ρ 0 , ρ τ ) is the path distance contained in the shortest evolution from ρ 0 to ρ τ .

Its key element is the construction of two parallel evolution paths by the measurement that can transform the probe system (a spin ensemble) from an eigenstate of a collective angular momentum operator | 𝑗 , 𝑚 ⟩ to a superposed state ( | 𝑗 , 𝑚 ⟩ + | 𝑗 , − 𝑚 ⟩ ) / ⁢ √ 2 . With synchronous parametric encoding and qubit measurement, the quantum Fisher information about the phase encoded in the probe system with optimized initial states can exactly attain the Heisenberg scaling 𝑁 2 with respect to the probe size (spin number) 𝑁 . The quadratic scaling behavior is not sensitive to the imprecise control over the joint evolution time, the time delay between encoding and measurement, and the coherence in the probe ensemble or the ancillary system that would be degraded by local dephasing. The classical Fisher information of the spin ensemble is found to saturate with its quantum counterpart, irrespective of the idle joint evolution after the parametric encoding. We suggest that both Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states and nonlinear Hamiltonian are not necessary resources for exceeding the standard quantum limit in metrology precision since in our protocol even thermal states can hold an asymptotic quadratic scaling.},

  abstract     = {Quantum Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) are systems out of equilibrium with a wide range of applications in quantum computing, quantum sensing, and fundamental research. They have been realized in superconducting circuits and photonic platforms. In this work, we explore the onset of ground-state and excited-state quantum phase transitions in KPOs, focusing on the role of the phase-space rotational symmetry when the driving frequency is times the oscillator's natural frequency, specifically for . These cases are experimentally accessible in superconducting circuits, where the Floquet quasienergy spectrum can also be studied as a function of tunable control parameters. Using the classical Hamiltonian of the system, we identify the stationary points associated with quantum phase transitions and analyze the emergence of both real and avoided level crossings, examining their influence on the energy spectrum and tunneling dynamics. Our findings provide insights into the engineering of robust quantum states, quantum dynamics control, and onset of quantum phase transitions with implications for critical quantum sensing.},

We show that in any resource theory of states, which may not be convex, the extent to which the maximum average success probability can be improved in quantum channel discrimination problems without using auxiliary systems can be precisely quantified by the robustness measure. This result offers an intuitive operational meaning of the robustness measure in any convex resource theory.

In this work, a protocol for quantum noise spectroscopy is presented by qudit spectators, that are arbitrary -level quantum systems passively spectating noises, which possess stochastic and stationary Gaussian distributions. The protocol uses Weyl basis decomposition, consisting of generalized Pauli matrices, as the theoretical tool, and the Alvarez-Suter noise spectroscopy method, by which the qudit is being exposed to a series of pulse sequences, and the noise polyspectra is extracted by multiple measurements of an observable of the qudit. The formalism is further developed and simulated for three theoretical frameworks: The first two frameworks utilize a simplified Weyl basis and are capable of detecting -type dephasing noise. One is specifically modeled for a qutrit ( = 3), and the second framework is designed for all qudits and has been tested through simulations of a ququad ( = 4) and a quoct ( = 8). The third framework employs the full Weyl basis, enabling it to identify all types of XYZ -dephasing noise. The simulations for this framework have been conducted for a quoct ( = 8) implemented by the antimony atom. The analytical protocol for noise spectroscopy that has been introduced transforms qudit systems into quantum spectators, and the presented simulations demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of this noise spectroscopy protocol.},

In the present work, we address this task by treating the execution of quantum algorithms as the time evolution of an idealized physical system.

In particular, the time evolution of the idealized system obeys a corresponding Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy of equations. This is the basis for the novel error mitigation scheme that we propose. Specifically, we employ a subset of the BBGKY hierarchy as supplementary constraints in the zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) method for error mitigation. We ensure that the computational cost of the scheme scales polynomially with the system size. We test our method on digital quantum simulations of the lattice Schwinger model under noise levels mimicking realistic quantum hardware. We demonstrate that our scheme systematically improves the error mitigation for the measurements of the particle number and the charge within this system. Relative to ZNE, we obtain an average reduction of the error by ( 18.2 ± 0.5 ) % and ( 52.8 ± 6.3 ) % for the respective above observables.

We find that the unit effectively removes leakage with minimal effect on the qubit subspace by taking advantage of energy level disorder for the qubit subspace and resonant leakage energy levels. There are two optimal measurement rates for removing leakage, which we show analytically to correspond to the characteristic timescales of the propagation and disintegration of the leakage excitation. The performance of the leakage removal unit depends on the strength of disorder, coupling between the transmons, and the length of the array. We simulate the system under experimentally feasible parameters and present an optimal configuration. Our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processors, considering realistic conditions.},

  abstract     = {With rapid advances in quantum hardware, a central question is whether quantum devices with or without full error correction can outperform classical computers on practically relevant problems. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have gained significant attention as promising candidates in this pursuit, particularly for combinatorial optimization problems. While reports of their challenges and limitations continue to accumulate, many studies remain optimistic based on small-scale, idealized testing setups, leaving doubt about the scalability of VQAs for large-scale problems. We systematically investigate this scaling behavior by analyzing how classical optimizers minimize variational quantum loss functions for random Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization instances in the presence of uncertainty, modeled as effective Gaussian noise. We find that the critical noise threshold for successful optimization decreases rapidly as system size grows. This decline exceeds what can be explained solely by shrinking loss variance, confirming deeper, fundamental limitations in the loss landscapes of VQAs beyond barren plateaus. Translating these thresholds into required measurement shots reveals that achieving sufficient precision in the evaluated loss values quickly becomes impractical, even for moderatelysized problems. Our findings demonstrate serious scalability challenges for VQAs in optimization stemming from mere uncertainty, indicating potential barriers to achieving practical quantum advantage with current hybrid approaches.},

If a relative comparison between quantum states can be made, this gives rise to a partial order, where states are ordered according to their suitability to act as a resource. In the literature, various different partial orders for a variety of quantum resources have been proposed. In discrete variable systems, vector majorization of Wigner functions in discrete phase space provides a natural partial order between quantum states. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) by Van Herstraeten et al. [ Quantum 7 , 1021 (2023) ]. In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general N -mode case. In addition, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. For the special case of the convex hull of N -mode Gaussian states, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, and Cerf.

Coordinated with dynamical decoupling, geometric quantum computation admits additional resilience to the environment-induced decoherence. However, the previous schemes of geometric quantum computation protected by dynamical decoupling require multiple physical qubits to encode a logical qubit, which undoubtedly increases the consumption of physical-qubit resources and the difficulty in the implementation of the logical-qubit manipulation based on physical-qubit driving. In this work, we put forward a scheme of decoherence-mitigated geometric quantum computation based only on physical qubits rather than logical qubits, hence avoiding the additional overhead of physical-qubit resources for logical-qubit encoding as well as the difficulty in the manipulation of logical qubits. Moreover, our scheme focuses on the most general interaction between an individual qubit and its environment so that it mitigates not just dephasing noise but rather regular decoherence. Our proposal thus represents a more realistic and effective approach towards the realization of geometric control with decoherence mitigation.},

Here we extend the concept of quantum nondemolition interaction to the cases in which the signal and the probe systems are each one multipartite continuous-variable system. Specifically, we propose a general scheme that performs the multipartite QND interactions, relying on beam-splitter couplings between the signal and probe modes with only two ancillary modes prepared offline in squeezed states. The scheme is also composed of homodyne detection and feedforward modulation. The ancillary modes are detected in the process, providing photocurrents for postmodulation of the output systems, as well as sufficient information to calculate genuine multipartite entanglement conditions of the input systems and to monitor similar conditions of the output systems.},

  abstract     = {Entanglement and nonlocality are two important nonclassical features of quantum correlations. Recently the study of quantum correlations in networks has undergone remarkable progress owing to technological development towards scalable quantum networks. However, compared to the standard Bell scenario, manifestation of the interplay between these two aspects has received less attention in network scenarios featuring independent sources. In this work we have analyzed the relation between entanglement content of the sources and detectable non- -locality in two distinct network topologies (linear and star). We have studied the extremal violations of -local inequalities (compatible with linear and star network) for any fixed amount of entanglement (in terms of concurrence) of the independent sources. It is observed that each of the sources must be entangled for detecting non- -locality in a linear network. However, the same is not true for star -local network. The present analysis reveals that entanglement of all the independent sources is not a necessity for generation of non- -local correlations in star topology. Characterization of sources in terms of the minimum entanglement requirement for any fixed violation amount of the -local inequalities is also provided. Interestingly, detection of non- -locality is ensured in the network if product of concurrence of all the sources involved exceeds},

  abstract     = {Remarkable breakthroughs in quantum science and technology are demanding more efficient methods in analyzing quantum many-body states. A significant challenge in this field is to verify whether a quantum state prepared by quantum devices in the laboratory accurately matches the desired target pure state. Recent advancements in randomized measurement techniques have provided fresh insights in this area. Specifically, protocols such as classical shadow tomography and shadow overlap have been proposed. Building on these developments, we investigate the fundamental properties of schemes that certify pure quantum states through random local Haar measurements. We derive bounds for sample fluctuations that are applicable regardless of the specific estimator construction. These bounds depend on the operator size distribution of either the observable used to estimate fidelity or the valid variation of the reduced density matrix for arbitrary observables. Our results unveil the intrinsic interplay between operator complexity and the efficiency of quantum algorithms, serving as an obstacle to local certification of pure states with long-range entanglement.},

We demonstrate that the geodesic curvature, normal curvature, and geodesic torsion govern the emergent non-Abelian gauge potential, while the geodesic and Gaussian curvatures govern the effective scalar potential in the Hamiltonian. The resulting spin precession dynamics induced by the gauge potential are analyzed with and without the adiabatic approximation. Under this approximation, the surface topology is linked to the rotation angle of spin orientation along a surface boundary and to the pseudomagnetic flux. Spin texture evolution along helices illustrates distinct behaviors under geodesic versus nongeodesic propagation. Furthermore, the spin evolution along Viviani's curve exemplifies surface dependence. The curve's topology ensures closure of the spin direction and independence of the spin from the path direction. Our theory establishes a framework for spin-state manipulation via engineered nanostructured channels, enabling topological quantum control strategies.},

By introducing nonreciprocity through asymmetric couplings to the shared field, we demonstrate that quantum coherence can be revived from fully decohered states. This revival signals a transition from a time-translational symmetric phase to a spontaneously time-translation symmetry-broken phase, realizing a continuous time crystal. Remarkably, steady-state entanglement emerges even in regions where macroscopic coherence is absent, underscoring the nontrivial impact of engineered dissipation. The phase transitions are characterized using numerical simulations of the full quantum master equation, mean-field analysis in the thermodynamic limit, and Liouvillian spectral properties.

However, previous realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of polarization, either spontaneous or induced. Here we introduce a class of prethermal DTCs termed “unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals” (UPDTCs) that arise without any uniform or staggered polarization and propose an experiment to observe them in current trapped-ion quantum simulators. By studying a model of trapped ions using a quantum circuit simulator, we demonstrate that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization, even though its expectation value does not exhibit such dynamics. The period-doubled dynamics is not explained by the classical picture of flipping spins but by quantum fluctuations. We establish that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, a hallmark of prethermalization. These results expand the known phenomenology and mechanism of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases.},

Specifically, we demonstrate that the restriction of the symplectic structure to manifolds comprising all states characterized by isospectral reduced one-particle density matrices exhibits degeneracy for nonseparable states. We prove that the degree of degeneracy at any given state corresponds to the degree of degeneracy of the symplectic form when restricted to the manifold of states that are locally unitary equivalent with .

Building on this foundation, our research proposes an all-optical scheme to realize the ergotropic Mpemba effect in open quantum systems, and further investigates its implications in systems exhibiting non-Markovian dynamics. We find that the ergotropic Mpemba effect persists in non-Markovian dynamics. In the strong non-Markovian regime, prior to the occurrence of the ergotropic Mpemba effect, the ergotropy evolution shows multiple crossings, which we refer to as the quasiergotropic Mpemba effect . Moreover, we derive the analytical solution for the critical point at which the ergotropic Mpemba effect occurs, and we establish the necessary conditions for this effect to emerge.

We demonstrate that these dynamics exhibit atypical quantum behavior, such as nonlinearity and non-Markovianity. Furthermore, we find that these dynamics depend on the initial coarse-grained state and establish conditions for general microscopic dynamics under which linearity is preserved. As the effective dynamics induced by our coarse-grained description of many-body quantum systems diverge from conventional quantum behavior, we anticipate that this approach could aid in describing the quantum-to-classical transition and provide deeper insights into the effects of coarse graining on quantum systems.},

  abstract     = {Discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) have broad applications in quantum computation and simulation, particularly in universal quantum computing. Prior research in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) has focused on implementing DTQWs in one-dimensional chains. However, to achieve practical quantum tasks, it is crucial to extend DTQWs to multidimensional networks with diverse structures. Here, we propose a protocol for realizing DTQWs in multidimensional networks, which accommodate nodes with different numbers of neighbors. Using this protocol, we numerically simulate a Grover walk search algorithm in a cubic network with circuit QED. Our simulations, which consider decoherence, align well with theoretical predictions. Our universal protocol can be adapted for various quantum systems and paves the way for DTQWs in multidimensional networks, which has potential applications in quantum computing and simulation.},

  abstract     = {A quantum system subject to an external perturbation can experience leakage between uncoupled regions of its energy spectrum separated by a gap. To quantify this phenomenon, we present two complementary results. First, we establish time-independent bounds on the distances between the true dynamics and the dynamics generated by block-diagonal effective evolutions constructed via the Schrieffer-Wolff and Bloch methods. Second, we prove that, under the right conditions, this leakage remains small eternally . That is, we derive a time-independent bound on the leakage itself, expressed in terms of the spectral gap of the unperturbed Hamiltonian and the norm of the perturbation, ensuring its validity for arbitrarily large times. Our approach only requires a finite spectral gap, thus accommodating continuous and unbounded spectra. Finally, we apply our bounds to specific systems of practical interest.},

  abstract     = {Information engines, sometimes referred to as Maxwell Demon engines, utilize information obtained through measurement to control the conversion of energy into useful work. Discussions around such devices often assume the measurement step to be instantaneous, assessing its cost by Landauer's information erasure within the measurement device. While this simplified perspective is sufficient for classical feedback-controlled engines, for nanoengines that often operate in the quantum realm, the overall performance may be significantly affected by the measurement duration (which may be comparable to the engine's cycle time) and cost (energy needed to create the system-meter correlation). In this study, we employ a generalized von Neumann measurement model to highlight that obtaining a finite amount of information requires a finite measurement time and incurs an energetic cost. We investigate the crucial role of these factors in determining the engine's performance, particularly in terms of efficiency and power output. Furthermore, for the information engine model under consideration, we establish a precise relationship between the acquired information in the measurement process and the maximum energy extractable through the measurement. We also discuss ways to extend our considerations using these concepts, such as in measurement-enhanced photochemical reactions.},

In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. One such case are malaria parasites gliding through 3D hydrogels, for which we find that the internal correlation time for the stochastic process generating propulsion is similar to the time taken for one helical turn. Motivated by this experimental finding, here we theoretically analyze the case of finite internal correlation time for microorganisms with helical trajectories as chiral active particles with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for torque. We present an analytical solution which is in very good agreement with computer simulations. We then show that, for this type of internal noise, chirality and rotation increase the persistence of motion and results in helical trajectories that have a larger long-time mean squared displacement than straight trajectories at the same propulsion speed. Finally, we provide experimental evidence for this prediction for the case of malaria parasites.},

While nonmotile bacteria partition exclusively into the DEX-rich phase in all conditions tested, we observed that motile bacteria penetrate the soft DEX-PEG interface and partition variably among the two phases. For our model organism Bacillus subtilis , the fraction of motile bacteria in the DEX-rich phase increased from 0.58 to 1 as we increased the DEX composition within the two-phase region. We hypothesized that the chemical affinity between DEX and the bacteria cell wall acts to weakly confine the bacteria within the DEX-rich phase; however, motility can generate sufficient mechanical forces to overcome the soft confinement and propel the bacteria into the PEG-rich phase. Using optical tweezers to drag a bacterium across the DEX-PEG interface, we demonstrate that the overall bacteria partitioning is determined by a competition between the interfacial forces and bacterial propulsive forces. Our measurements are supported by a theoretical model of dilute active rods embedded within a periodic soft confinement potential.},

We show that nonorientability is an obstruction to realizing the symmetry globally, and it induces a geometric phase that captures a memory analogous to a previously identified one in 2D metamaterials. However, we show that orientable ribbons can also obstruct realizing the symmetry globally. This new obstruction is mediated by how the unit normal vector winds around the centerline of the ribbon and provides conditions for constructing soft modes of deformation compatible with the topology of multiply twisted connected ribbons.},

  abstract     = {Activation volume is a crucial concept in mechanochemistry because it describes how the applied mechanical energy facilitates chemical reactions. The activation volume can be determined readily from the load dependence of a chemical reaction based on the stress-assisted thermal activation theory (also known as the Bell model), but it is still very challenging to fully understand what activation volume means physically and how to compute it. Here, by introducing a concept of inherent stress difference ( σ T ) between the initial and transition states, which is associated with the displacement of reacting atoms, a universal formula of activation volume ( Δ V * ) for the interfacial reactions is derived, that is, Δ V * = ( V eff σ T / E ) , where E and V eff refer to the Young’s modulus and the volume influenced by reaction, respectively. This formula implicates that Δ V * is related to the volume change from the initial to transition states. Then, the first-principles calculation was used to confirm the validity of the proposed definition in diverse types of chemical reactions. This Letter provides clear physical insight into how a chemical reaction that is unlikely to occur under thermal conditions is facilitated by mechanical stress, explaining the core principle of mechanochemistry.},

In traditional approaches, such phases are stabilized through intervening in the dynamics of all system constituents or introducing additional interactions. Here, we offer a hitherto-unexplored alternative, namely, subsystem resetting, whereby intervention in the dynamics of only a part of the system, and that too only occasionally in time, is implemented through resetting its state to a reset configuration. Just playing with a few parameters, e.g., the nature of the reset configuration and the size of the reset subsystem, one achieves a remarkable and robust control over the phase diagram of the bare dynamics. We demonstrate that these universal effects span a wide variety of scenarios, including equilibrium and nonequilibrium, mean-field and non-mean-field dynamics, with and without quenched disorder. Despite the challenges posed by memory effects, we obtain explicit analytical predictions, validated by simulations.},

We analyze its dynamics in terms of a velocity trapping that arises from correlations between the local density and the particle velocities. This allows us to formulate a conjecture for its out-of-equilibrium mixing timescale, and to rationalize its equilibrium superdiffusive timescale. Both scales are faster than for the (unlifted) TASEP. They are further justified by our analysis of the lifted TASEP in terms of many-particle realizations of true self-avoiding random walks.

The interfacial electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is widely proposed to enhance pairing, yet to be directly verified. Herein, using ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy, we discover a coherent 4.2 THz optical phonon mode that emerges only upon photoexcitation in FeTe/FeSe/ or FeTe/ heterostructures, but is absent in bare Nb-doped under identical subgap pumping. Atomic-scale electron energy loss spectroscopy in scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies this mode as out-of-plane oxygen vibrations localized at double terminated interface. Crucially, the phonon amplitude in FeTe/FeSe/ is more than twice as large as that in FeTe/ , which can be attributed to higher electron doping that strengthens dipole moments penetrating the FeSe layer, thereby resulting in an enhanced interfacial EPC. Temperature-dependent dynamics further highlight the unique electronic nature of monolayer FeSe in sustaining this robust coupling. These findings provide direct evidence for dipole-mediated interfacial EPC as a critical mechanism of interfacial superconductivity in .},

  abstract     = {Magnet-free, far-field infrared nonreciprocal thermal radiation has been reported using Weyl semimetals or spatiotemporal modulation nanostructures, but these methods face challenges like requiring extremely low temperatures or high modulation frequencies and have limited spectral or angular ranges. Here, we demonstrate far-field nonreciprocal thermal Fizeau drag radiation around asymmetric exceptional points (EPs) by drifting electrons in graphene sheets on dielectric periodic nanostructures. First, the generation and evolution mechanisms of symmetric scattering EP pairs have been unveiled in parameter spaces (i.e., w − θ space, w and θ are filling ratio of gratings and incident angle respectively). The EP pairs are connected by bulk Fermi arc along the θ axis whose length can be tuned over the whole angular range by modifying dielectric optical index. Drifting electrons contribute to asymmetrically redistributing EPs with specific angular and spectral positions at low drifting velocities due to Fizeau drag effects. These nonreciprocal behaviors of EPs in angle space have been used to shape magnet-free infrared nonreciprocal emissivity and absorptivity with different numbers of resonant peaks, resulting in more than an order of magnitude increase in wavelength-integrated thermal nonreciprocity. The physics that underpins the synergy between nonreciprocity and EPs offers new insights into areas such as non-Hermitian physics, nonreciprocal optics, and nonreciprocal thermal photonics.},

Based on our results, we show that a modified version of weak-coupling perturbation theory is remarkably accurate for a large parameter region. We further provide a simple parametrization of the light-matter correlation energy as a functional of the cavity parameters and the electronic density.

Here we report the full control over AFM states by voltage pulses in the insulating Co 3 O 4 spinel well below its Néel temperature. We show that the strong linear magnetoelectric effect is fully governed by the orientation of the Néel vector. As a unique feature of Co 3 O 4 , the magnetoelectric energy can easily overcome the weak magnetocrystalline anisotropy; thus, the Néel vector can be manipulated on demand, either rotated smoothly or reversed suddenly, by combined electric and magnetic fields. We achieve the nonvolatile switching within a few tens of nanoseconds between time-reversed AFM states in macroscopic volumes by voltage pulses. These observations render quasicubic antiferromagnets, like Co 3 O 4 , an ideal platform for the ultrafast (picosecond to nanosecond) manipulation of microscopic AFM domains and may pave the way for the realization of AFM spintronic devices.},

The contributions from the Oersted field, bulk SOTs, and thermal activation induced by Joule heating are also discussed.

Despite its significance across various open classical and quantum systems, the influence of nonlinearity has remained largely unclear. Here, we reveal the Hopf bifurcation of the nonlinear skin effect as a critical phenomenon unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that nonlinearity destabilizes skin states and instead gives rise to the emergence of delocalized states associated with limit cycles in phase space. We also uncover the algebraically localized critical skin effect precisely at the Hopf bifurcation point. We illustrate this behavior in a nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model in both continuum and lattice. Our Letter shows a significant role of nonlinearity in the skin effect and uncovers rich phenomena arising from the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity.},

Here we show that such intriguing chiral phonons can also be induced in nonmagnetic Kagome lattices that lack atomic structural chirality but harbor electronic chirality rooted in the presence of loop current order. This central finding is demonstrated using two types of loop current order, the restricted chiral flux phase characterized by a pure imaginary charge bond order and the more generalized chiral flux phase characterized by a complex charge bond order, as typified in layered ( , Rb, K). At a mechanistic level, the time-reversal symmetry breaking caused by the electronic chirality is shown to pronouncedly influence their vibrational properties through electron-phonon coupling. The electronic chirality in either chiral flux phase is accompanied by a nonzero molecular Berry curvature, which in turn manifests as a nonlocal effective magnetic field of vectorial nature acting on the phonons. Consequently, the double degeneracy at each Brillouin zone corner is lifted, empowering chirality to the phonon modes. This Letter provides an indispensable component toward a more complete understanding of various chiral collective electronic phenomena in such structurally achiral systems.},

Consequently, the disorder induces a phase disconnected from the simple clean limit of the topological insulator, which is achieved via an impurity resonance inducing additional bands with Chern number 2. Thus, we call this impurity induced phase a genuine topological Anderson insulator. In seeming contradiction to the expectation that mass disorder is an irrelevant perturbation to the Dirac semimetal, the tricritical point separating these two Chern insulating phases and a thermal metal phase is located at zero impurity density and connected to the appearance of a zero energy bound state in the continuum that corresponds to a perfectly resonant mass impurity.

  abstract     = {Bound states in the continuum (BICs), with the ability of trapping and manipulating waves within the radiation continuum, have gained significant attention for their potential applications in optics and acoustics. However, challenges arise in reducing wave leakage and noise from fabrication imperfections. The emergence of robust wave manipulations based on topological BICs (TBICs) offers promising solutions. Traditionally, TBICs of different dimensions are observed separately in distinct systems. Here, we report the experimental discovery of the coexistence of two-dimensional surface TBICs and one-dimensional hinge TBICs in a single three-dimensional phononic crystal system. Such an unprecedented dimensional hierarchy of TBICs is triggered by the mechanism of separability and protected by the valley Chern numbers. Notably, these TBICs inherit dispersive propagation characteristics from valley topology and can propagate robustly against defects without leakage. Our findings offer an efficient approach to multidimensional TBICs and can be applied in designing highly efficient acoustic devices for wave trapping and manipulation in multidimensional environments.},

  abstract     = {Topological valley photonics, which exploits valley degrees of freedom to manipulate electromagnetic waves, offers a practical and effective pathway for various classical and quantum photonic applications across the entire spectrum. Current valley photonics, however, has been limited to two dimensions, which typically suffer from out-of-plane losses and can only manipulate the flow of light in planar geometries. Here, we have theoretically and experimentally developed a framework of three-dimensional (3D) topological valley photonics with a complete photonic band gap and vectorial valley contrasting physics. Unlike the two-dimensional counterparts with a pair of valleys characterized by scalar valley Chern numbers, the 3D valley systems exhibit triple pairs of valleys characterized by valley Chern vectors, enabling the creation of vectorial bulk valley vortices and canalized chiral valley surface states. Notably, the valley Chern vectors and the circulating propagation direction of the valley surface states are intrinsically governed by the right-hand-thumb rule. Our findings reveal the vectorial nature of the 3D valley states and highlight their potential applications in 3D waveguiding, directional radiation, and imaging.},

  abstract     = {The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg array quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of nonbipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, “hidden” vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [X. Ran et al. , Hidden orders and phase transitions for the fully packed quantum loop model on the triangular lattice, Commun. Phys. 7 , 207 (2024) ] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of “remnants of fractionalization” at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter—the plaquette loop resonance—and its constituent—the vison field—exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a three-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.},

In this framework, conduction electrons fractionalize into gapless charge and gapped spin excitations. We show that magnetic impurity interacts exclusively with the spin degrees of freedom and induces a quantum phase transition. Furthermore, charge excitations influence dynamical observables, giving rise to the phenomenon we term the “fractionalized Shiba state.” At zero temperature, the tunneling spectrum exhibits universal power-law scaling with an exponent of at half filling, stemming from the gapless charge modes that form a standard Luttinger liquid. Extending this analysis to finite temperatures reveals that the spectral features retain universal behavior at the critical point.},

  abstract     = {Charged defect scattering of electrons plays a critical role in determining a wide range of material properties. However, there is a lack of an accurate method to calculate the scattering, as all the existing methods require assuming a specific distribution for unscreened (i.e., bare) excess charge carried by the defect, which limits their accuracy. Here we develop a first-principles method to determine the bare charge distribution, which thus enables accurate calculations of the scattering. Using this method, we accurately calculate the electron mobility of 2D under the scattering of charged sulfur vacancies and compare with that of charge-neutral oxygen substitutes of sulfur. Interestingly, we find that the charged defect-limited mobility exhibits a strong temperature dependence at low temperature and carrier concentration, in contrast to the neutral defect and the conventional belief that the defect-limited mobility is less sensitive to the temperature. This behavior arises from the free carrier screening of the long-range scattering potential of the charged defect. Our work offers new insights into the transport mechanism, and opens access to accurate calculation, understanding, and prediction of charged defect scattering and a broad range of associated properties.},

Our work proposes and validates a “twist-on-twist” paradigm to realizing unidirectional propagation and robust magic angle at arbitrary directions of the elastic out-of-plane wave. Our elastic metasurface not only exhibits a twisted configuration between the stacked bilayer but also significantly enhances out-of-plane symmetry breaking by further twisting meta-atoms in one constituent layer. Our twist-on-twist method unleashes versatile potentials of twisted thin composite materials to control the extreme propagation of topological elastic waves and even opens up new possibilities for photonic, phononic, and thermal moiré metamaterials.},

Entropy provides insights into the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of both ground and excited states beyond transport measurements. For the one-carrier regime, the obtained entropy shows that the ground state has a twofold degeneracy lifted by an out-of-plane magnetic field. This observation is in agreement with previous direct transport measurements and confirms the applicability of this novel method. For the two-carrier regime, the extracted entropy indicates a nondegenerate ground state at zero magnetic field, contrary to previous studies suggesting a threefold degeneracy. We attribute the degeneracy lifting to the effect of Kane-Mele-type spin-orbit interaction on the two-carrier ground state, which has not been observed before. Our Letter demonstrates the validity and efficacy of entropy measurements as a unique, supplementary experimental tool to investigate the degeneracy of the ground state in quantum devices built in materials such as graphene. This technique, applied to exotic systems with fractional ground state entropies, will be a powerful tool in the study of quantum matter.},

Here, we reported a method for eliminating the defect states in monolayer WSe 2 by coupling it with a c-plane sapphire surface. We found that the defect-relevant photoluminescence peaks at cryogenic temperatures can be completely suppressed in WSe 2 on c-plane sapphire, resulting in intrinsic exciton radiation, prolonged lifetime, and increased diffusion length. Ab initio calculations revealed that the surface of c-plane sapphire is much more active than other planes, where oxygen atoms preferentially transfer to WSe 2 to repair selenium vacancy defects.

The actual value of the crossover depends of the ratio between the local stresses and the shear modulus. This excess DOS leads to a low-temperature specific heat with an apparent temperature exponent, which is between one and two, as observed experimentally. We discuss how these findings may be utilized for the characterization of glassy materials.

Our approach reveals the inherent low dimensionality of phonon-phonon interactions and allows compression of the three- and four-IFC tensors by factors of up to while retaining high accuracy in calculations of phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity. Calculations of thermal conductivity using the compressed IFCs achieve a speedup by nearly 3 orders of magnitude with accuracy relative to the reference uncompressed solution.

  abstract     = {Recently, solar gamma rays produced by cosmic rays interacting with the solar atmosphere have been detected in the GeV to TeV energy range, revealing that cosmic rays are significantly affected by magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere. However, much of the observations remain unexplained by existing physical models. Using a semianalytic model, we demonstrate that magnetic fields at and below the photosphere with a large horizontal component could account for the approximately 1 TeV solar gamma rays observed by HAWC. This suggests that high-energy solar gamma rays could serve as a novel probe for magnetic fields beneath the photosphere, which in the future could help improve the understanding of solar magnetism, the key driver of space weather.},

  abstract     = {Collisional effects significantly influence inertial confinement fusion hohlraum plasmas, where non-Maxwellian inverse bremsstrahlung heating and collision-induced anisotropy alter the kinetic plasma response. We derived the linear ion-acoustic wave (IAW) dispersion relation, revealing the necessity of accounting for binary collisions in both the isotropic and anisotropic parts of the electron distribution function, as well as in the anisotropic part of the light ion distribution function. This affects the IAW damping rate, either increasing or decreasing it depending on laser parameters and plasma composition. Our analytical model, validated against particle-in-cell simulations for single- and two-ion species plasmas, offers crucial insights for high-energy laser-driven implosion experiments. It can be applied to Thomson scattering analysis and integrated into wave mixing processes involving IAWs, such as cross-beam energy transfer and Brillouin scattering.},

Here we show quantum effects that survive for large but finite , by employing a novel open-system dynamics method that allows us to obtain numerically exact quantum dynamical results for atom numbers up to a mesoscopic . While we find that beyond-mean-field effects vanish quickly with increasing in the balanced Dicke model, we are able to identify parameter regimes in the unbalanced Dicke model that allow genuine quantum effects to persist even for mesoscopic . They manifest themselves in a strong squeezing of the steady state and a modification of the steady-state phase diagram that cannot be seen in a mean-field description.

  abstract     = {Understanding the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity is among the most important problems in physics, one for which quantum simulation can provide new insights. However, it remains challenging to characterize superconductivity in existing cold-atom quantum simulation platforms. Here, we introduce a protocol for measuring a broad class of observables in fermionic quantum gas microscopes, including long-range superconducting pairing correlations (after a repulsive-to-attractive mapping). The protocol only requires global controls followed by site-resolved particle number measurements—capabilities that have been already demonstrated in multiple experiments—and is designed by analyzing the Hilbert space of fermions on two sites. The protocol is sample-efficient and we further optimize our pulses for robustness to experimental imperfections such as lattice inhomogeneity. Our Letter introduces a general tool for manipulating quantum states on optical lattices, enhancing their ability to tackle problems such as high-temperature superconductivity.},

We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model does not require postselection and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.},

A detailed discussion of our lattice calculation, demonstrating that inclusive semileptonic decays can nowadays be studied on the lattice at a phenomenologically relevant level of accuracy, is the subject of a companion paper [A.

Here, we focus on the phenomenological implications of our results. Using the current best estimates of the relevant Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements, our theoretical predictions for the decay rate and for the first two lepton-energy moments are in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental measurements. We also argue that, while the inclusive channel is not yet competitive with the exclusive channels in the determination, the situation can be significantly improved in the near future.},

Given any random matrix ensemble, its -point spectral correlations admit a prescribed modular-invariant lift to , which moreover reduce to the original random matrix correlators in a near-extremal limit. Central to the prescription is a presentation of random matrix theory in Mellin space, which lifts to two dimensions via the spectral decomposition employed in previous work. As a demonstration we perform the explicit lift of two-point correlations of the GUE Airy model. We propose that in pure gravity, semiclassical amplitudes for off-shell -boundary torus wormholes with topology are given by the lift of JT gravity wormhole amplitudes. For the three-boundary case, we identify a gravity calculation which matches the result.},

COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112 were designed to test the claim directly using the same target material. COSINE-100, located at Yangyang Underground Laboratory in South Korea, and ANAIS-112, located at Canfranc Underground Laboratory in Spain, have been taking data since 2016 and 2017, respectively. Each experiment published its respective results independently. In this Letter, we present the results of an annual modulation search as a test of the signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA with the first three respective years of data from COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we find best fit values for modulation amplitude of − 0.0002 ± 0.0026 cpd / kg / keV in the 1–6 keV and 0.0021 ± 0.0028 cpd / kg / keV in the 2–6 keV energy regions. These results are not compatible with DAMA/LIBRA’s assertion for their observation of annual modulation at 3.7 σ and 2.6 σ , respectively. Performing a simple combination of the newly released 6-year datasets from both experiments finds values consistent with no modulation at 0.0005 ± 0.0019 cpd / kg / keV in the 1–6 keV and 0.0027 ± 0.0021 cpd / kg / keV in the 2–6 keV energy regions with 4.7 σ and 3.5 σ respective exclusions of the DAMA/LIBRA signal.},

  abstract     = {The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has significantly advanced our ability to study black holes, achieving unprecedented spatial resolution and revealing horizon-scale structures. Notably, these observations feature a distinctive dark shadow—primarily arising from faint jet emissions—surrounded by a bright photon ring. Anticipated upgrades of the EHT promise substantial improvements in dynamic range, enabling deeper exploration of low-background regions, particularly the inner shadow defined by the lensed equatorial horizon. Our analysis shows that observations of these regions transform supermassive black holes into powerful probes for annihilating dark matter, which is expected to accumulate densely in their vicinity. By analyzing the black hole image morphology and performing electron-positron propagation calculations in realistic plasma backgrounds derived from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we set stringent constraints on dark matter annihilation, requiring contributions below the astrophysical emission. These constraints, derived from both current EHT observations and projections for future upgraded arrays, exclude a substantial region of previously unexplored parameter space and remain robust against astrophysical uncertainties, including black hole spin and plasma temperature variations.},

Here, we propose an enhanced gravity-sensing protocol for a nanodiamond levitated in a linear ion trap, which improves the sensing sensitivity and further reduces device size. By introducing gravitational acceleration into the vibrational state through transient free fall, we achieve a square-accelerated relative phase accumulation, yielding higher sensitivity than the linear accumulation process. The sensitivity reaches the standard quantum limit for a nanodiamond containing multiple nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) centers. Besides, by using phonon-mediated one-axis twisting dynamics induced by magnetic field gradient to squeeze the initial spin state, the sensitivity can further surpass the standard quantum limit as a scaling law of . To fully assess the protocol performance, we further analyze the effects of decoherence and control errors, which are negligible under experimentally achievable conditions. Specifically, the sensitivity reaches for the nanodiamond containing only one N-V center over a free-fall distance of , while exceeds for 100 N-V centers. Our results will further facilitate research on compact and high-sensitivity gravimeters.},

We introduce a protocol that leverages high-dimensional entanglement to perform this task perfectly, without requiring quantum interference between particles at the measurement station. We experimentally demonstrate how this unlocks implementation in the high-dimensional regime through an optical setup using eight-dimensional entanglement and multioutcome detection, providing a practical solution for stochastic communication and a robust method for certifying the dimensionality of entanglement in communication experiments.},

We also investigated the enhancement of the incoherent noise due to the impedance-matched cavity and characterized the quantum memory performance, showing a two-way transfer from excited to spin states and back of up to 83%. Finally, we confirmed the quantum nature of our memory by storing nonclassical states of light, i.e., a heralded single photon from a nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, and achieved nonclassical correlations between the heralding and the stored-and-retrieved photon. These results demonstrate that impedance-matched AFC spin-wave quantum memories with on-demand readout can be used for experiments involving the storage of photonic quantum states.

In this Letter, we propose a new quantum algorithm for solving ODEs by harnessing open quantum systems. Specifically, we propose a novel technique called nondiagonal density matrix encoding, which leverages the inherent nonunitary dynamics of Lindbladians to encode general linear ODEs into the nondiagonal blocks of density matrices. This framework enables us to design quantum algorithms with both theoretical simplicity and high performance. Combined with the state-of-the-art quantum Lindbladian simulation algorithms, our algorithm can outperform all existing quantum ODE algorithms and achieve near-optimal dependence on all parameters under a plausible input model.

  abstract     = {When placing an ultracold atomic gas inside a cavity, the light-matter coupling is enhanced and nonlinear atomic dynamics is generated, offering a promising platform for quantum simulation of models with short- and long-range interactions. Recently, superradiant self-organized phases for ultracold atomic gases inside a cavity, pumped by a blue detuned optical lattice, have been observed. Here, we explore the formation of quantum many-body phases of bosonic atoms inside an optical cavity, subject to transverse blue detuned pumping. We investigate the strongly interacting regime, which can be reached by tuning the -wave scattering length using external fields. We analyze the interplay between superradiant self-organization with superfluid and Mott insulator phases, without the need of including higher lying bands, as the Wannier functions are dynamically linked to the cavity light via backaction. We observe different kinds of structural phase transitions driven by the light inside the cavity and the interplay with atomic collisions. We observe the mode softening at the critical points in the quantum phase transitions which can be measured in future experiments. We obtain our results within a full self-consistent theoretical framework, the light-matter density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), which employs the computation of light dependent Wannier functions for the full quantum optical lattice in combination with DMRG for the atomic dynamics.

  abstract     = {After fifty years of lattice gauge theories (LGTs), the nature of the transition between their topological phases (confinement or deconfinement) remains challenging due to the absence of a local order parameter. In this work, we conduct a percolation analysis of Wegner’s three-dimensional lattice gauge model using intensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling, offering fresh insights into the topological phase transitions of gauge-invariant systems. We demonstrate that, regardless of the connection rules, geometrical loops, constructed by piercing excited plaquettes percolate precisely at the thermal critical point , with critical exponents coinciding with those of the loop representation of the dual 3D Ising model. Further, we construct Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters in a random-cluster representation, showing that they also percolate at , enabling access to all thermal critical exponents. Strikingly, the Binder cumulants of the percolation order parameters for both loops and FK clusters reveal a pseudo-first-order transition. This work sheds new light on the critical behavior of pure LGTs, with potential implications for condensed matter systems and quantum error correction.},

Concretely, we consider a setup with bosonic modes and auxiliary qubits, where available operations include Gaussian one- and two-mode operations and single- and two-qubit operations as well as qubit-controlled phase-space displacements. We define the (approximate) complexity of a bosonic state by the minimum size of a circuit that prepares an approximation to the state in trace distance. We propose a new circuit which prepares an approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state | G K P κ , Δ ⟩ . Here, κ − 2 is the variance of the envelope, and Δ 2 is the variance of the individual peaks. We show that the circuit accepts with constant probability and—conditioned on acceptance—the output state is polynomially close in ( κ , Δ ) to the state | G K P κ , Δ ⟩ . The size of our circuit is linear in ( log 1 / κ , log 1 / Δ ) . To our knowledge, this is the first protocol for GKP-state preparation with fidelity guarantees for the prepared state. We also show converse bounds, establishing that the linear circuit-size dependence of our construction is optimal. This fully characterizes the complexity of GKP states.},

A key tool in understanding and improving such estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and determines the ultimate limits of precision. With artificial neural networks gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher information through an artificial neural network performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information and that training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training—eliminating the need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.},

Using exact analytical techniques and extensive numerical simulations based on Clifford replica tensor networks, we demonstrate that random Clifford circuits fully anticoncentrate in logarithmic circuit depth; namely, higher-order moments of the overlap distribution converge to those of random stabilizer states. Moreover, we investigate the effect of introducing a controlled number of non-Clifford (magic) resources into Clifford circuits. We show that inserting a polylogarithmic in qudit number of T states is sufficient to drive the overlap distribution toward the Porter-Thomas statistics, effectively recovering full quantum randomness. In short, this fact presents doped tensor networks and shallow Clifford circuits as pseudomagic quantum states. Our results clarify the interplay between Clifford dynamics, magic-state injection, and quantum complexity, with implications for quantum circuit sampling, many-body quantum physics, and the benchmarking of quantum computational advantage.},

A body of work—rooted in dynamical systems theory—has formalized this notion of cellular decision making as flow in a Waddington-like landscape, in which cells evolve according to gradientlike dynamics within a potential that changes shape in response to a number of signals. We present a framework leveraging neural networks as universal function approximators to infer such a parametrized landscape from gene expression data. Inspired by the success of physics-informed machine learning in data-limited contexts, we enforce principled constraints motivated not by physical laws but by this phenomenological understanding of differentiation. Our data-driven approach infers a governing landscape atop a manifold situated within expression space, thereby describing the dynamics of interest in a biologically meaningful context.

Unlike in the lowest Landau level, where charge motion is confined into cyclotron orbits, the charged excitations in the FQAH occupy Bloch states with well-defined crystal momenta. At a nonzero doping density, this feature enables the formation of itinerant states of the doped anyons just beyond the FQAH plateau region. Focusing on the vicinity of , we describe a few possible itinerant states, including a topological superconductor with chiral neutral fermion edge modes as well as a more exotic pair density wave (PDW) superconductor with non-Abelian topological order. A Fermi liquid metal with a doping-induced period-3 charge density wave also occurs naturally in our analysis. This Fermi liquid (as well as the PDW) arises from pairing instabilities of a composite Fermi liquid metal that can emerge near filling . Though inspired by the theory of anyon superconductivity, we explain how our construction is qualitatively different. At a general Jain filling , the same analytical framework leads to a wider variety of phases, including higher-charge superconductors and generalized composite Fermi liquids. We predict unusual physical signatures associated with each phase and analyze the crossover between different temperature regimes. These results provide a proof-of-principle that exotic itinerant phases can be stabilized by correlations intrinsic to the FQAH setup.},

Many biological processes also depend on time estimation by nanoscale clocks, whose performance can be significantly impacted by random fluctuations. In this work, we formulate the problem of optimal time estimation for Markovian stochastic processes, and present its general solution in the asymptotic (longtime) limit. Specifically, we obtain a tight upper bound on the precision of any time estimate constructed from sustained observations of a classical, Markovian jump process. This bound is controlled by the mean residual time, i.e., the expected wait before the first jump is observed. As a consequence, we obtain a universal bound on the signal-to-noise ratio of arbitrary currents and counting observables in the steady state. This bound is similar in spirit to the kinetic uncertainty relation but provably tighter, and we explicitly construct the counting observables that saturate it. Our results establish ultimate precision limits for an important class of observables in nonequilibrium systems and demonstrate that the mean residual time, not the dynamical activity, is the measure of freneticity that tightly constrains fluctuations far from equilibrium.},

In this work, we extend the Středa formula to periodically driven systems, providing a rigorous framework to elucidate the unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet systems while offering a physically grounded link between Floquet winding numbers and tractable response functions. Using the Sambe representation of periodically driven systems, we analyze the response of the unbounded Floquet density of states to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-Středa response is regularized through Cesàro summation, yielding a well-defined, quantized result within spectral gaps. The response features two physically distinct contributions: a quantized charge flow between edge and bulk and an anomalous energy flow between the system and the drive, offering new insight into the nature of anomalous edge states. This fundamental result rigorously connects Floquet winding numbers to the orbital magnetization density of Floquet states and holds broadly, from clean to disordered and inhomogeneous systems. This is further supported by providing a real-space formulation of the Floquet-Středa response, which introduces a local topological marker suited for periodically driven settings. In translationally invariant systems, the framework yields a remarkably simple expression for Floquet winding numbers involving geometric properties of Floquet-Bloch bands. A concrete experimental protocol is proposed to extract the Floquet-Středa response via particle-density measurements in systems coupled to engineered baths. Finally, by expressing the topological invariants through the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, this approach opens a promising route toward the topological characterization of interacting driven phases.},

Here, we realize a four-terminal JJ in a hybrid heterostructure, where ABSs form a synthetic 3D band structure. We probe the energy spectrum using tunneling spectroscopy and identify spectral features associated with the formation of a tri-Andreev molecule, a bound state whose energy depends on three superconducting phases and, therefore, is able to host topological ABSs. The experimental observations are well described by a numerical model. The calculations predict the appearance of four Weyl nodes at zero energy within a gap smaller than the experimental resolution. These topological states are theoretically predicted to remain stable within an extended region of the parameter space, well accessible by our device. These findings establish an experimental foundation to study high-dimensional synthetic band structures in multiterminal JJs and to realize topological Andreev bands.},

Highly precise predictions can be made using standard techniques, both in the continuum and in the lattice frameworks. However, classical methods have limitations, particularly when attempting to extrapolate the continuum limit from the study of lattice gauge theories. Complementing classical computations or combining them with quantum computational methods, to improve the predictions toward the continuum limit with current quantum resources, is a formidable open challenge. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient method to compute the running of the coupling in non-Abelian gauge theories beyond one spatial dimension. We first represent the Hamiltonian on periodic lattices in terms of loop variables and conjugate loop electric fields, exploiting the Gauss law to retain the gauge-independent ones. Then, we identify a local basis for small and large loops variationally to minimize the truncation error while computing the running of the coupling on small tori. Our method enables computations at arbitrary values of the bare coupling and lattice spacing with current quantum computers, simulators, and tensor-network calculations, in regimes otherwise inaccessible.},

  abstract     = {“Strange” metals that do not follow the predictions of Fermi liquid theory are prevalent in materials that feature superconductivity arising from electron interactions. In recent years, it has been hypothesized that spatial randomness in electron interactions must play a crucial role in strange metals for their hallmark linear-in-temperature ( ) resistivity to survive down to low temperatures where phonon and umklapp processes are ineffective, as is observed in experiments. However, a clear picture of how this happens has not yet been provided in a realistic model free from artificial constructions, such as large- limits and replica tricks. We study a realistic model of two-dimensional metals with spatially random antiferromagnetic interactions in a nonperturbative regime, using numerically exact high-performance, large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo simulation and exact averages over the quenched spatial randomness. Our simulations reproduce strange metals’ key experimental signature of linear-in- resistivity with a universal “Planckian” transport scattering rate that is independent of coupling constants. We further find that strange metallicity in these systems is not associated with a quantum critical point and, instead, arises from a phase of matter with gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations that lacks long-range correlations and spans an extended region of parameter space: A feature that is also observed in several experiments. These gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations take the form of spatially localized overdamped modes, whose presence could possibly be detected using recently developed nanoscale magnetometry methods. Our work paves the way for an eventual microscopic understanding of the role of spatial disorder in determining important properties of correlated-electron materials.},

  abstract     = {Recent progress in tabletop experiments offers the opportunity to show, for the first time, that gravity is not compatible with a classical description. In all current experimental proposals, such as the generation of gravitationally induced entanglement between two quantum sources of gravity, gravitational effects can be explained solely with the Newton potential, namely, in a regime that is consistent with the weak-field limit of general relativity and does not probe the field nature of gravity. Hence, the Newtonian origin of the effects is a limitation to the conclusions on the nature of gravity that can be drawn from these experiments. Here, we identify two effects that overcome this limitation: They cannot be reproduced using the Newton potential, and they are independent of graviton emission. First, we show that the interaction between two generic quantum sources of gravity, e.g., in wide Gaussian states, cannot be reproduced with the Newton potential nor with a known classical theory of gravity. Second, we show that the quantum commutator between the gravitational field and its canonically conjugate momentum appears as an additional term in the relative phase of a generic quantum source interacting with a test particle. Observing these two effects would give further quantitative information and stronger evidence, compared to experiments only involving the Newton potential, to show that gravity is nonclassical. More broadly, identifying stronger quantum aspects of gravity than those reproducible with the Newton potential is crucial to prove the nonclassicality of gravity and to plan a new generation of experiments testing quantum aspects of gravity in a broader sense than what has been proposed so far.},

  abstract     = {We report on a single-shot longitudinal phase-space reconstruction diagnostic for electron beams in a laser wakefield accelerator via the experimental observation of distinct periodic modulations in the angularly resolved spectra. Such modulated angular spectra arise as a result of the direct interaction between the ultrarelativistic electron beam and the laser driver in the presence of the wakefield. A constrained theoretical model for the coupled oscillator, assisted by a genetic algorithm, can recreate the experimental electron spectra and, thus, fully reconstructs the longitudinal phase-space distribution of the electron beam with a temporal resolution of approximately 1.3 fs. In particular, it reveals the slice energy spread of the electron beam, which is important to measure for applications such as x-ray free electron lasers. In our experiment, the root-mean-square slice energy spread retrieved is bounded at 9.9 MeV, corresponding to a 0.9%–3.0% relative spread, despite the overall GeV energy beam having approximately 100% relative energy spread.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical properties of biological materials are spatially heterogeneous. Typical tissues are made up of a spanning fibrous extracellular matrix in which various inclusions, such as living cells, are embedded. While the influence of embedded inclusions on the stiffness of common elastic materials such as rubber has been studied for decades and can be understood in terms of the volume fraction and shape of inclusions, the same is not true for disordered filamentous and fibrous networks. Recent work has shown that, in isolation, such networks exhibit unusual viscoelastic behavior indicative of an underlying mechanical phase transition controlled by network connectivity and strain. How this behavior is modified when inclusions are present is unclear. Here, we present a theoretical and computational study of the influence of rigid inclusions on the mechanics of disordered elastic networks near the connectivity-controlled central-force rigidity transition. Combining scaling theory and coarse-grained simulations, we predict and confirm an anomalously strong dependence of the composite stiffness on inclusion volume fraction, beyond that seen in ordinary composites. This stiffening exceeds the well-established volume-fraction-dependent stiffening expected in conventional composites, e.g., as an elastic analog of the classic volume-fraction-dependent increase in the viscosity of liquids first identified by Einstein. We show that this enhancement is a consequence of the interplay between interparticle spacing and an emergent correlation length, leading to an effective finite-size scaling imposed by the presence of inclusions. We outline the expected scaling of the linear shear modulus and strain fluctuations with the inclusion volume fraction and network connectivity, confirm these predictions in simulations, and discuss potential experimental tests and implications for our predictions in real systems.},

  abstract = {Internal conversion is a vital vibronic loss mechanism that competes with all other photophysical mechanisms, and a plethora of information on the subject is available in the literature. However, these data are often difficult to penetrate owing to their complexity. In addition, owing to the sheer number of methods, it is often difficult to understand which method is better for certain systems. This comprehensive review on the state of the art explores the history of internal conversion and provides context to its evolution up to modern quantum chemistry. The most prevalent methods used to study atomic systems, as well as where they rise and they fall, are highlighted. Each method and the corresponding results are noted in a simplified manner, and information is threaded together to elucidate how everything is related. This tapestry illustrating the ups and downs of internal conversion will aid researchers in their study of new and innovative materials and provides a vital comparison of methods not easily gained.},

  abstract = {In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, like our Sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton ( )-chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. The relevant reactions of solar and stellar hydrogen burning are reviewed here from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, general recommendations are also formed.},
