  abstract     = {The two-body contact is a fundamental quantity of a dilute Bose gas that relates the thermodynamics to the short-distance two-body correlations. For a Bose gas in an optical lattice, near the superfluid–Mott-insulator transition, we show that a “universal” contact can be defined from the singular part of the pressure ( is the pressure of the Mott insulator). Its expression coincides with that of a dilute Bose gas provided we consider the effective “scattering length” of the quasiparticles at the quantum critical point (QCP) rather than the scattering length in vacuum, and the excess density of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. Close to the transition, we find that the singular part of the momentum distribution exhibits a high-momentum tail of the form over a broad region of the Brillouin zone, where is the quasiparticle weight of the elementary excitations at the QCP. Our results demonstrate that the notion of contact extends to strongly correlated lattice bosons, and we argue that the contact can be measured in state-of-the-art experiments on Bose gases in optical lattices and magnetic insulators.},

We consider the dynamical response to the perturbation for a single coherent state and for Schrödinger cat states constructed as both balanced and imbalanced superpositions of two coherent states. For individual coherent states, we demonstrate that a weak parametric drive yields a long-lived sequence of classical echoes. Cat states are found to exhibit distinct quantum echoes that are sensitive to the initial relative phase and weights of the coherent states in superposition. We examine the effect of dissipation on quantum echoes and quantum revivals of cat states. We demonstrate that, even when dissipation suppresses quantum revivals, quantum echoes can be recovered by properly tuning the timing and strength of the perturbation. These results may be useful for characterizing and mitigating errors of cat qubits.},

The natural framework for this platform is measurement-based quantum computation, where fault-tolerant graph states supersede traditional quantum error-correcting codes. However, the existing formalism for foliation—the construction of fault-tolerant graph states—does not reveal how certain properties, such as single-shot error correction, manifest in the measurement-based setting. We introduce the fault complex, a representation of dynamic quantum error-correction protocols particularly well suited to describe foliation. Our approach enables precise computation of fault tolerance properties of foliated codes and provides insights into circuit-based quantum computation. Analyzing the fault complex yields improved thresholds for three- and four-dimensional toric codes, a generalization of stability experiments, and the existence of single-shot lattice surgery with higher-dimensional topological codes.},

Through a comprehensive analysis of the system's dynamics, we reveal the cooperative interactions that drive coherent-stimulated emission in both the magnonic (spin-wave) and photonic (electromagnetic) domains. The model outlines a scalable configuration in which NV centers, excited via optical pumping, couple efficiently to the magnon modes of the YIG sphere placed inside the microwave cavity. Numerical simulations based on experimentally accessible parameters confirm the feasibility of dual-domain lasing.

  abstract     = {Light-matter strong coupling has been the subject of much attention in recent decades, giving optical systems unique features. However, properties of a system with strong coupling are determined by the properties of its components and are thus difficult to control. Here, we propose Floquet engineering, a technique of controlling the energy levels of a quantum system using external fields, as a method of manipulating a hybrid system of a molecule strongly coupled to a single-mode resonator. We show that an external field can change the relative positions of levels in an open strongly coupled system, leading to a change in the rates of transitions between them. We demonstrate that if the frequency of the pumping wave is close to polariton transitions in the hybrid system, nonmonotonic dependence of fluorescence and scattering amplitudes on pump intensity with a narrow resonance-like response occurs. We show that this phenomenon occurs due to hybridization of the lower and upper polaritons with substantially different excitation numbers caused by the pumping affecting polariton states of the system. This occurs when the Rabi interaction with the coherent field is comparable to the field-matter coupling constant, which in turn needs to be sufficient for the manifestation of strong coupling. This nonmonotonic dependence of the fluorescence and scattering amplitudes on pump rate intensity paves the way for the creation of nonlinear optical devices.},

The bosonic nature of the dipole oscillators as well as the reservoir modes allows an exact numerical simulation of the dynamics for arbitrary coupling strengths. At weak coupling, apart from essentially recovering the dynamics expected from a Markovian Lindblad master equation, we also obtain non-Markovian effects for spatially separated two-level emitters. In the so-called ultrastrong coupling regime, we find the dynamics and steady state depends on the choice of the reservoir which is chosen as either an ideal cavity with equispaced, unbounded dispersion or a cavity array with a bounded dispersion. Moreover, at even higher coupling strengths, we find a decoupling between the light and matter degrees of freedom attributable to the increased importance of the diamagnetic term in the Hamiltonian. In this regime we find that the dependence of the dynamics on the separation between the dipoles is not important and the dynamics is dominated by the occupation of the polariton mode of lowest energy.},

This steady-state entanglement is created by purely dissipative dynamics, unlike the superradiance of permutationally symmetric two-level atoms, whose steady state is the ground state. Furthermore, we show that the entanglement is significantly enhanced near critical points in the superradiance potential because of the extremely high two-mode squeezing factor between two atomic ensembles. We also discuss spin squeezing in each atomic ensemble in the vicinity of specific critical points in the potential. These findings may play an important role in the generation of correlations immune to dissipation in separated atomic modes.},

We show that under appropriate conditions, an effective Hamiltonian for nondegenerate parametric down-conversion involving the two mechanical oscillators and the cavity field can be engineered. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that the cavity dissipation drives the mechanical oscillators into a steady-state non-Gaussian entangled state. The properties of the mechanical state, including non-Gaussianity, Wigner negativity, entanglement, and quantum steering, are investigated in detail. We further reveal that through the non-Gaussian mechanical entanglement, the remote preparation of the Schrödinger cat states of one mechanical oscillator can be achieved by coupling the other one to an auxiliary probe cavity and homodyning the output of the probe cavity. We also discuss the robustness of the mechanical states against thermal fluctuations. Our scheme provides a feasible approach for the dissipative and remote preparation of non-Gaussian mechanical nonclassical states.},

However, due to the interaction with the external environment, it leads to decoherence and thus reduces both the lifetime and the charging efficiency of QB. Here, we propose suppressing the environmental dissipation in the energy-storage process of the QB by exploiting both the electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT) effect and bound states. By constructing a hybrid system composed of a four-level atom and a coupled-cavity array, two bound states are formed in the system when the energy of the QB is in the energy band of the cavity array. Environmental dissipation is significantly inhibited due to the bound state and EIT effects, which extends the lifetime of the QB. We show that the charging efficiency of the QB is optimal when the energy of the QB is in resonance with the cavity. In addition, there is an optimal coupling strength between the two adjacent cavities, which helps to improve the performance of the QB. Our research has achieved the realization of long-term energy storage while improving the charging efficiency of QB, which has practical implications for the realization of QB.},

This setup corresponds to the quantum Rabi model (QRM) with a purely imaginary bias on the qubit, exhibiting parity-time ( P T ) symmetry. In this work, we first solve the P T -symmetric QRM using the Bogoliubov operator approach. We derive the transcendental function responsible for the exact solution, which can also be used to precisely identify exceptional points. The adiabatic approximation previously used can be easily formulated within this approach by considering transitions between the same manifolds in the space of Bogoliubov operators. By further considering transitions between the nearest-neighboring manifolds, we can analytically obtain more accurate eigensolutions. Moreover, these simple corrections can capture the main features of the dynamics, where the adiabatic approximation fails. Furthermore, the rich characteristics of the vacuum Rabi splitting in the emission spectrum are predicted. The width of the peaks increases with the coupling strength and the imaginary biases, reflecting the nature of open quantum systems. Additionally, we identify a quantum-criticality-enhanced effect by calculating the quantum Fisher information. Near the exceptional points, the quantum Fisher information in the P T -symmetric QRM is significantly higher than that of the non-Hermitian qubit component. This may open a new avenue for enhancing quantum sensitivity in non-Hermitian systems by incorporating coupling with an additional degree of freedom, enabling more precise parameter estimation.},

When driven on two-photon resonance, the atom is excited into its highest energy state | f 〉 by absorbing two photons simultaneously. The atom then de-excites via a cascaded decay | f 〉 → | e 〉 → | g 〉 . Here we present a theoretical study of the atomic fluorescence spectrum where, upon strong coherent driving, the spectrum exhibits seven distinct frequencies corresponding to transitions among the atomic dressed states. We characterize the quantum statistics of the emitted photons by investigating the second-order correlation functions of the emitted field. We do so by considering the total field emitted by the atom and focusing on each of the dressed-state components, taking in particular a secular-approximation and deriving straightforward, transparent analytic expressions for the second-order auto- and cross-correlations.},

The anomalous-dispersion phase matching (ADPM), though demonstrated in gases and liquids, has not been established in crystals due to the parasitic material absorption that induces the anomalous dispersion in the first place. This absorption bottleneck can be overcome by a crystal possessing an additional spectral gap in its absorption spectrum, beyond the regular band gap, which we term the “hypergap”. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate such a hypergap and the ADPM-enabled third harmonic generation in potassium chromate K 2 CrO 4 . Our results introduce a class of nonlinear optical materials that do not rely on lattice anisotropy or periodic poling.},

It has traditionally been regarded as a fully coherent structure. Here, through comprehensive simulations, we show that DSRs can exhibit partial coherence, characterized by stochastic temporal and spectral dynamics. Under appropriate saturation power of a nonmonotonic saturable absorber, the pulse develops a strong nonlinear chirp induced by self-phase modulation, which, in conjunction with normal dispersion, gives rise to wave-breaking-induced temporal fringes and the chaotic proliferation and decay of dark solitons. Concurrently, spatiotemporal intermittency emerges across the pulse plateau in the form of irregular patterns. These dynamics lead to stochastic temporal evolution and the degradation of spectral coherence, quantified by the decay of first-order spectral coherence between successive pulses. Nevertheless, the partially coherent DSR still exhibits characteristics similar to those of the coherent DSR, such as constant power and a pulse duration that increases with pump strength. Our results provide new physical insight into the coherence properties of DSRs and offer practical criteria for experimentally identifying the widely observed flat-top square pulses.},

Circular dichroism is typically observed in chiral atoms, molecules (such as DNA), and optically asymmetric materials.

Meanwhile, negative-refractive-index materials offer exotic applications in optics and photonics, including superresolution imaging, invisibility cloaking, and subwavelength imaging. Here we identify a route to achieving birefringence and dichroism in a left-handed system. We investigate the optical activity of an atomic left-handed medium, analyzing the interaction of left- and right-circularly polarized light with different atomic states while incorporating local field corrections. Notably, our results demonstrate simultaneous left-handedness for both polarization states. Furthermore, we find that electric birefringence and dichroism are significantly enhanced with increasing control field strength, while magnetic birefringence and dichroism can be fully controlled via strong laser coupling. These findings have promising implications in fields at the interface of left-handedness and dichroism.},

Because SOIs become significant at subwavelength scale, they have largely been explored in the context of inhomogeneous materials exhibiting wavelength-scale structures and notably metamaterials. Here we demonstrate that spin-orbit interactions can in fact analogously emerge in moving matter through the well-known light-dragging effects. SOIs in moving media are shown to manifest through a Berry phase induced by vorticity, which then leads to a rotation of the wave's polarization. In bringing together electrodynamics of moving media and SOIs of light, our work not only paves the way for the discovery of fundamental effects but also uncovers alternative means to harness SOIs to control light.},

Intriguingly, by adiabatically tuning the nonlinear susceptibilities along the fiber, the Stokes vector on the Poincaré sphere accumulates a nonintegrable phase known as the Hannay angle—the classical counterpart to the Berry phase—which exhibits the same geometric gauge structure, including conic singularities in parameter space, as those associated with quantum phase transitions in systems like Bose-Einstein condensates.

  abstract     = {This article presents a comprehensive three-dimensional canonical quantization to treat quantum plasmonics for finite metallic or dielectric media of arbitrary shape. We use a microscopic model for the dissipative and dispersive medium coupled with the electromagnetic field, which is justified by the fact that if one integrates the degrees of freedom of the medium, one obtains the macroscopic Maxwell equations. Its quantization features a Hamiltonian formulation having the form of two infinite harmonic oscillators characterized by a double continuum. The diagonalized Hamiltonian is quantized by the correspondence principle, introducing creation-annihilation operators in a bosonic Fock space. The diagonal quantum Hamiltonian is the sum of two terms corresponding to the two continua. The physical observables, such as the electric field, are also the sum of two terms corresponding to the two continua, one of which had been omitted in the literature geared for an infinite bulk medium. In a second step, we show that the electric field operator can by written as linear combinations of the creation-annihilation operators with coefficients that satisfy integral equations of Fredholm type. We show that the solution of these equations can be expressed in terms of the classical Green tensor of the medium satisfying the Sommerfeld radiation condition. Finally, we consider the Purcell effect for the spontaneous emission of an atom close to the medium. We show that through an exact compensation of some terms, the Purcell factor for the system with the double continuum is proportional to the imaginary part of the Green tensor, which defines the local density of states. This result has the same form as the one obtained in the literature for bulk systems that involve a single continuum and a small dissipative background extending to infinity, and can be seen as a justification of this approach.},

First, we derive the effective potential for two polar molecules in the presence of (i) an elliptical polarization field alone, (ii) combined elliptical and linear polarization fields, and (iii) combined elliptical polarization and static fields. The effective potential is then expressed as a sum of a zero-range contact interaction and a long-range dipolar interaction under the Born approximation. We find that the methods (i) and (ii) only partially suppress attractive interactions, while the method (ii) allows for the construction of bound states with different polarization shapes.

  abstract     = {The present contribution explores phase transitions that occur in the ground state (GS) of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) under the action of gradient magnetic fields. By solving the corresponding linearized system in an exact fashion, we identify the conditions under which the GS phase transitions occur, thus transforming excited states into GSs. The study of the full nonlinear system, including both density-density and spin-spin interactions, is numerically analyzed. For the case of repulsive spin-spin interactions, the results resemble the linear case, while attractive spin-spin interactions lead to the formation of mixed states near the GS phase-transition points. Additionally, higher-order vortex states are found to be stable even in the nonlinear regime. These findings demonstrate that arbitrary winding numbers corresponding to stable GSs can be achieved, thus contributing to the understanding of topological properties in SOC BECs.},

  abstract     = {We present a strong-coupling expansion of the Bose-Hubbard model based on a mean-field treatment of the hopping term, while onsite fluctuations are taken into account exactly. This random phase approximation describes the universal features of the generic Mott-insulator–superfluid transition (induced by a density change) and the superfluid state near the phase transition. The critical quasiparticles at the quantum critical point have a quadratic dispersion with an effective mass and their mutual interaction is described by an effective -wave scattering length . The singular part of the pressure takes the same form as in a dilute Bose gas, provided we replace the boson mass and the scattering length in vacuum by and , and the density by the excess density of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. We define a universal two-body contact that controls the high-momentum tail of the singular part of the momentum distribution. We also apply the strong-coupling RPA to a lattice model of hard-core bosons and find that the high-momentum distribution is controlled by a universal contact, in complete agreement with the Bose-Hubbard model. Finally, we discuss a continuum model of bosons in an optical lattice and define two additional two-body contacts: a short-distance universal contact which controls the high-momentum tail of at scales larger than the inverse lattice spacing, and a full contact , which controls the high-momentum tail of the full-momentum distribution .},

Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we establish that the impurity velocity exhibits exponential decay asymptotically. When the impurity velocity is much lower than the thermal velocity of the gas atoms, the relaxation time τ is governed entirely by the self-energy evaluated at zero momentum and zero frequency, Σ ( p = 0 ; ω = 0 ) . Furthermore, via virial expansion theory, τ admits a systematic expansion in powers of the fugacity z ≡ e β μ .

Interestingly, the localization is mutually induced by both components for the quasiperiodic confinement, whereas for a harmonic trap the localization is induced in the potential-free component by interaction with that confined in the potential. Further, we explore the condensate dynamics by implementing a periodic driving of the Rabi frequency, where various frequency-dependent delocalization patterns, such as double- (triple)-minima, treelike (parquetlike), and frozen distributions with a correlated propagation of different spin populations are observed in the condensate density. These features pave the way to control the condensate mass and spin density patterns, both in the stationary and dynamical realizations.},

We identify additional terms not part of the textbook Kondo problem, mostly ignored in previous works and giving rise to a direct competition between spin and charge correlations, strongly suppressing Kondo physics. We show that the Kondo effect can be restored by locally adjusting the chemical potential on the impurity site, and we identify realistic parameter regimes and preparation protocols suited to current experiments with AEA arrays.

  abstract     = {We investigate theoretically high-order harmonic generation (HHG) and its ellipticity in gapped graphene, driven by a femtosecond short-pulse laser at various orientation angles, employing the two-band density-matrix equations within the tight-binding approximation. The orientation-dependent harmonic spectra exhibit pronounced enhancement of specific harmonics, which we attribute to the caustic effect. Using the recombination trajectory model, we reveal that the orientation dependence of these enhanced harmonics originates from the distinct band structures encountered by electrons ionized from the two inequivalent points. Moreover, we focus on the ellipticity of the enhanced harmonics at specific angles and demonstrate that it primarily depends on the phase difference between the parallel and perpendicular components, which can be accurately predicted by our recombination trajectory model. Based on these insights, we propose a two-color (fundamental plus second-harmonic) field scheme to generate isolated elliptically polarized attosecond pulses (IEAPs) in gapped graphene and discuss the dependence of IEAPs on the laser parameters and gap energy. Our findings may provide a promising pathway for generating IEAPs in gapped graphene or transition-metal dichalcogenides.},

In this article we examine multibody fragmentation of formic acid dications, produced by ultrashort intense laser pulses, using coincidence momentum imaging and deuterium tagging to distinguish the hydrogen sites. Our measurements indicate that double hydrogen elimination leads to three- and four-body breakup, specifically H + D + CO 2 2 + and H + D + O + + CO + , respectively. We find that the latter breakup channel also proceeds via the CO 2 2 + metastable dication, but with shorter lifetimes than the CO 2 2 + dications detected intact. This intriguing sequential breakup is identified using native frames analysis and simulations to confirm the signature of this process in spite of the inferior momentum resolution associated with breakup channels for which not all fragments are detected. In addition to the fragmentation channel above, we found no evidence of sequential breakup for single hydrogen elimination, H + CO + + OD + . The elimination of three atoms, H + D + O + C + + O + , shows evidence of both concerted fragmentation and sequential breakup via metastable intermediate CO 2 + ions.

As long as the assumptions of the underlying model are satisfied, the proposed approach is robust against variations in the laser parameters, band dispersion, and hidden errors in the input data.

While the behaviors of the concerted pathway and the sequential pathway involving initial H + emission are comparable in both systems, the sequential pathway with H + emission in the second step exhibits distinct dynamics, with a higher relative branching ratio for ( NH 3 ) 2 . These differences arise from the stronger hydrogen bonds in ( H 2 O ) 2 promoting proton transfer and the weaker hydrogen bonds in ( NH 3 ) 2 favoring hydrogen bond breaking.

  abstract     = {We have applied a semiclassical impact-parameter close-coupling method to calculate the state-resolved excitation cross sections in proton collisions with the ground state of helium. Using both correlation-configuration and frozen-core two-electron basis functions, we construct a large number of helium pseudostates to use in the expansion of the total scattering wave function. Extensive convergence studies show that the present results are accurate to within a few percent. The present cross sections for transitions from the ground state into all states for the , and symmetries agree very well with experimental data where available. This work serves to provide a comprehensive set of excitation cross sections that were previously available only in narrow energy regions and for some channels. Furthermore, we present elastic-scattering, total excitation, and total electron-loss cross sections from 2 to . We conclude that with modern supercomputer technology, a single-center method can accurately model collisions through implicit inclusion of the electron-capture process via coupling to the large number of positive-energy pseudostates representing the continuum.},

The measurements led to absolute uncertainties of 750 kHz in the two-photon transition wave numbers for the five dominant isotopes of Xe, e.g., 80 118.982 918(27) cm − 1 for Xe 136 .

The analysis indicates that the natural-abundance-weighted ionization energy of Xe should be revised by − 0.023 cm − 1 to 97 833.7641(20) cm − 1 . Large fluctuations in the UV-laser pulse intensities were exploited to characterize intensity-dependent shifts of the observed two-photon transition frequencies. Shifts of up to − 20 MHz were observed and attributed to frequency shifts arising from chirps in the amplification and up-conversion of the laser radiation rather than to the ac-Stark effect.},

  abstract     = {Radio frequency antennas based on highly excited Rydberg atom vapors can in principle reach sensitivities beyond those of any conventional wire antenna, especially at lower frequencies where very long wires are needed to accommodate the growing wavelength. Conventional Rydberg sensors are based on individual atom response, with increased signal resolution relying on the O ( 10 3 ) electric dipole moment enhancement, scaling as the square of the Rydberg-state principal quantum number N ∼ 50 . However, despite more than 30 years of steady advances, beyond-classical signal sensitivity has yet to be demonstrated. More recently, the optical bistability effect, a many-body nonequilibrium phase transition occurring at somewhat higher vapor densities, has been exploited for an order of magnitude or more increased sensitivity for some setups through tuning into the critical region. However, the results fall significantly short of those using more advanced “conventional” Rydberg sensor setups—which achieve even greater enhancement by exploiting resonant interaction between a pair of nearby Rydberg levels. This paper seeks to combine the many-body and resonant enhancement effects by extending the bistable phase analysis to include a pair of resonant Rydberg levels, supported by an exact treatment of the atom velocity thermal average. A dynamic linear response formalism is developed as well to explore the trade-off between measurement sensitivity and finite-bandwidth signals. We demonstrate regions of the phase diagram which could be exploited for record breaking, beyond-classical sensitivity. Of course, only a limited number of vapor parameters are under full experimental control, and experiments will be needed to quantitatively constrain the effective mean-field interaction parameters appearing in the theory and thereby define the accessible regions of the phase diagram.},

The convergence of QED perturbative expansion is improved by using the extended Furry picture, which starts from the Dirac equation with a local screening potential. An ab initio treatment is accomplished for one- and two-photon electron-structure QED effects and the one-photon screening of the self-energy and vacuum-polarization corrections. This is complemented with an approximate treatment of the two-photon QED screening and higher-order (three or more photon) electron-structure effects. As a result, the obtained theoretical predictions improve upon the accuracy achieved in previous calculations. Comparison with available experimental data shows a good agreement between theory and experiment. In most cases, the theoretical values surpass the experimental results in precision with only a few exceptions. In the case of uranium and bismuth, the comparison provides one of the most stringent tests of bound-state QED in the strong-field regime. Alternatively, the obtained results can be employed for high-precision determinations of nuclear charge radii.},

Meanwhile, such mechanics will increase the crosstalk between atoms and enhance the decoherence. In this paper, we propose a new scheme to realize the controlled-phase gate without Rydberg blockade. The scheme works effectively with large atomic spacings and is insensitive to the thermal motions of atoms. The proposal is robust against random noises due to the geometric characteristic and operates fast based on the nonadiabatic evolution. The proposed gate is actually a geometric gate that consolidates the nonadiabatic holonomic control and the unconventional geometric control simultaneously. The interference between two different types of geometric phases can be investigated in the proposal. Furthermore, we show that the actuating quantity (the product of interaction strength and the evolution time) of the proposed scheme is 90 times smaller than the present Rydberg blockade scheme. Therefore, our proposal provides a fast and robust way to realize geometric quantum control, and it may trigger the discoveries of new geometric gates in high-dimensional Hilbert space.},

We introduce the Time-Rescaled Feedback-Based Quantum Algorithm (TR-FQA) and Time-Rescaled Feedback-Based Algorithm for Quantum Optimization (TR-FALQON), time-rescaled versions of FQA and FALQON, respectively. The method is applied to two representative problems: the MaxCut combinatorial optimization problem and ground-state preparation in the axial next-nearest neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model. The results show that TR-FALQON accelerates convergence toward the optimal solution in the circuit's early layers and outperforms the standard version in low-depth regimes. In the context of state preparation, TR-FQA requires fewer layers than the original algorithm. These findings suggest that time rescaling can reduce the number of layers needed to reach a high-quality solution, even if the exact ground state is not obtained.},

We then demonstrate that the entanglement of two SPP modes can serve as a useful resource for quantum communication of continuous-variable light signals over a long distance, mediated by concatenated swap operations. The teleportation fidelity of an unknown coherent state has strong robustness to loss and imperfect detection at relatively strong effective optical-microwave coupling.

Previous work [D. M. Long et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 128 , 183602 (2022) ] proposed that such a pump could be realized with a strongly driven superconducting qubit coupled to a cavity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy of energy scales and drive frequencies can be realized using a transmon qubit. We develop an experimental toolkit to realize the adiabatic driving field required for energy pumping using coordinated frequency modulation of the transmon and amplitude modulation of an applied resonant microwave drive. With this toolkit, we measure adiabatic evolution of the qubit under the applied field for times comparable to T 1 , which far exceed the bare qubit dephasing time. This result paves the way for direct experimental observation of topological energy pumping.},

In the original framework of evolution symmetrization, a DD sequence was shown to enforce a symmetry on the unwanted Hamiltonian, thereby suppressing it if the symmetry was inaccessible. In this work, we show how symmetries already present in the undesired Hamiltonian can be harnessed to reduce the complexity of decoupling sequences and to construct nested protocols that correct dominant errors at shorter timescales using the factorization of DD symmetry groups into a product of its subgroups. We provide many relevant examples in various spin systems, using the Majorana constellation and point-group factorization to identify and exploit symmetries in the interaction Hamiltonian. Our framework recovers tailored pulse sequences developed in the context of NMR, including the classical Lee-Goldburg protocol, and further produces novel short and robust sequences capable of suppressing on-site disorder, dipole-dipole interactions, and more exotic many-body interactions in spin ensembles.},

To address quantum steering detection in isotropic states, partially entangled states, and random states, we explore, respectively, the most tailored feature and classifier. Given that the SDP method provides only a sufficient condition for steerability detection, we establish the first rigorously constructed, accurately labeled dataset based on theoretical foundations. This dataset enables models to exhibit outstanding accuracy and generalization capabilities, independent of the choice of features. As applications, we investigate the steerability boundaries of isotropic states and partially entangled states, discover new steerable states, and determine their parameter ranges.

Within this framework, we introduce PAM witnesses that can distinguish stabilizer from nonstabilizer states, and we provide analytical proofs that threshold violations of these witnesses certify nonstabilizerness. In the simplest setting—three preparations, two measurements, and qubit systems—surpassing a specific threshold guarantees that at least one prepared state lies outside the stabilizer polytope, while a stronger violation can certify at least two. We extend this approach by linking it to quantum random access codes, also generalizing our results to qutrit systems and introducing a necessary condition for certifying nonstabilizerness based on state overlaps (Gram matrices).

To address these challenges, we present a scalable fault-tolerant method for preparing encoded k -uniform states and we illustrate our approach using surface and color codes. We first present a technique to determine k uniformity of stabilizer states directly from their stabilizer tableau. We then identify a family of Clifford circuits that ensures both fault tolerance and scalability in preparing these states. Building on the encoded k -uniform states, we introduce a hybrid physical-logical strategy that retains some of the error-protection benefits of logical qubits while lowering the overhead for implementing arbitrary gates compared to fully logical algorithms. We show that this hybrid approach can outperform fully physical implementations for resource-state preparation, as demonstrated by explicit constructions of k -uniform states.},

  abstract     = {Graph kernels are essential for learning the properties of graph data, a fundamental task in the analysis of such data. However, a major limitation of current graph kernel methods is their high computational cost, which becomes prohibitive when dealing with large-scale graphs. In order to address this bottleneck, we propose a quantum algorithm designed to analyze the intrinsic structural information within graph data through an efficient quantum kernel method. The core idea of our kernel method involves encoding pertinent information from graphs into quantum states, utilizing quantum kernel functions to represent the similarities among various graphs. This process is facilitated through the application of quantum walks and quantum signal processing techniques. Building upon this framework, we propose a quantum kernel ridge regression algorithm that consists of two key steps. First, we employ our quantum kernel method to prepare a quantum state, in which the amplitudes encode the kernel functions. Second, we implement quantum feature mapping in parallel to encode the corresponding kernel matrix into the quantum circuit. Crucially, we demonstrate that the computational complexity of our regression algorithm scales primarily as O ( M 3 / 2 ) with respect to the size of the graph set M . This suggests that our quantum kernel method could process graph data with resource requirements scaling approximately as O ( poly log ( N ) ) , where N denotes the number of nodes in the graph. Accordingly, this underscores the advantage of our approach over classical methods in the context of large-scale graph analysis. To validate our approach, we conduct numerical experiments on chemical molecular datasets, demonstrating the method's effectiveness and advantages. In summary, this work represents a significant advancement in quantum graph learning, enhancing its potential for analyzing large-scale graph data.},

While ideal quantum teleportation requires maximally entangled states as resources, real-world implementations inevitably face environmental noise and decoherence effects. In this work, we investigate quantum teleportation in nonequilibrium environments with different temperatures or chemical potentials. We employ the Bloch-Redfield equation to characterize the nonequilibrium dynamics in both bosonic and fermionic reservoirs. Our analysis reveals that nonequilibrium conditions, namely, the temperature difference and chemical potential difference, can significantly enhance the teleportation fidelity beyond what is achievable in equilibrium scenarios. Notably, under certain nonequilibrium conditions, the fidelities for all input states converge to the same value. We term this behavior the teleportation with a fixed-point fidelity. Importantly, at this fixed point, fidelity can be further enhanced by tuning the nonequilibrium parameters. These findings offer crucial insights for the implementation of quantum communication protocols in realistic environments, demonstrating that nonequilibrium conditions not only improve the fidelity but also present a promising avenue for simplifying practical quantum teleportation schemes.},

Rev. A 73 , 064302 (2006) ], we find that the threshold temperature of quantum entanglement decreases with increasing spin j and completely disappears in the limit j → ∞ . In the ground state of systems with highly symmetric interactions, the discord-type quantum correlations can exist even for arbitrarily large spin. Such correlations turn out to be unstable and are destroyed by small perturbations that violate the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The stable quantum correlations gradually degrade as the spin j grows and eventually vanish when the classical limit is reached.},

This represents the optimal (2-2-2) Bell nonlocality for this kind of systems. The work generalizes the well-known Horodeckis result for a qubit-qubit setup. We also give simple lower and upper bounds on that violation. We apply our general results to address a number of issues, namely, we obtain a bound on the degree of purity required in a system to exhibit nonlocality and study the statistics of nonlocality in random density matrices. In addition, we show the impossibility of improving the amount of CHSH violation by embedding the qudit in a Hilbert space of larger dimension. Finally, the general result is illustrated with a family of density matrices in the context of a qubit-qutrit system.},

In this paper, we present a general procedure for constructing error-correcting qudit codes through the irreducible representations of SU ( d ) for any odd integer d ≥ 3 . Using the Weyl character formula and inner product of characters, we deduce the relevant branching rules, through which we identify the physical Hilbert spaces that contain valid code spaces. We then discuss how two forms of permutation invariance and the Heisenberg-Weyl symmetry of su ( d ) can be exploited to simplify the construction of error-correcting codes. Finally, we use our procedure to construct an infinite class of error-correcting codes encoding a logical qudit into ( d − 1 ) 2 physical qudits.},

Moreover, the 6 s n g G 4 1 Rydberg state has strong dipole-dipole interaction due to small Förster defect with nearby Rydberg states and possesses long radiative lifetime. These can benefit quantum computing based on individually trapped neutral atoms and can enable long-lived Rydberg polaritons in atomic media, which brings fresh opportunities in all-optical quantum information.},

Here we consider directed acyclic graphs each of which contains both nodes representing observed variables as well as nodes representing latent or hidden variables. When comparing distinct causal structures, a natural question to ask is if they can explain distinct sets of observable distributions or not. Statisticians have developed a great variety of tools for resolving such questions under the assumption that latent nodes are interpreted classically. Here we highlight how the change to a quantum interpretation of the latent nodes induces distinctions between causal scenarios that would be classically indistinguishable. We especially concentrate on quantum scenarios containing latent nodes with at least one latent parent, a.k.a. possessing intermediate latents . This initial survey demonstrates that many such quantum processes can be operationally distinguished by considerations related to monogamy of nonlocality, especially when computationally aided by a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations which we tailor for the study of such scenarios. We conclude by clarifying the challenges that prevent the generalization of this work, calling attention to open problems regarding observational (in)equivalence of quantum causal structures with intermediate latents.},

Here we propose a wireless transfer scheme with parity-time symmetry to efficiently extract the energy stored in non-Hermitian QBs to consumption hubs. For linear cases, the transfer energy oscillates periodically in the unbroken symmetry region and grows hyperbolically in the broken region. For nonlinear cases, the transfer energy eventually reaches and remains steady-state values arising from the feedback mechanism of the nonlinear saturable gain. The non-Hermitian QBs with gains can persistently absorb energy and store it in batteries while transfering it to consumption hubs, thus exhibiting more considerable robustness in the large detuning regime and significant enhancement in the weak coupling regime than those in partial deep-strong coupling regime. Furthermore, we also introduce a classical simulator and demonstrate some counterintuitive advantages of the non-Hermitian QBs. Our work overcomes energy bottlenecks of wireless transfer schemes in QBs and may provide inspirations for practical applications of QBs.},

This assumption, however, is not always guaranteed in realistic scenarios and several theoretical approaches to characterize initially correlated dynamics have been introduced. For the uncorrelated scenario, stochastic unravelings are a powerful tool to simulate the dynamics. So far they have not been used in the most general case in which correlations are initially present since they cannot be applied to nonpositive operators or noncompletely positive maps. In our work, we employ the bath positive or one-sided positive decomposition (OPD) formalism as a starting point to generalize stochastic unraveling in the presence of initial correlations. Noticeably, our approach does not depend on the particular unraveling technique, but holds for both piecewise deterministic and diffusive unravelings. This generalization allows not only for more powerful simulations for the reduced dynamics, but also for a deeper theoretical understanding of open system dynamics.},

We propose a general dynamical quantum finite-size scaling theory and demonstrate its validity using numerical and analytical approaches in a spin chain. Combining fidelity and renormalization group, we identify the scaling behavior of the transverse magnetization that simultaneously exhibits quantum coherence and statistical properties. In addition, we adapt generalized correlation functions in quantum chemistry protocols to visualize the effective light cone of quantum mutual information, demonstrating the importance of the coherence propagation to DQPTs. Our work provides a phenomenological insight and a quantitative analysis to the underlying microscopic entanglement evolution, offering an alternative interpretation of DQPTs and advancing the understanding of many-body physics.},

  abstract     = {The spontaneous switching of a quantum particle between the wells of a double-well potential is a phenomenon of general interest to physics and chemistry. It was broadly believed that the switching rate decreases steadily as a function of the size of the energy barrier. This view was challenged by a recent experiment on a driven superconducting Kerr nonlinear oscillator (often called the Kerr-cat qubit or the Kerr parametric oscillator ), whose energy barrier can be continuously increased by ramping up the drive. Remarkably, as the drive amplitude increases, the switching rate exhibits a steplike decrease termed the “staircase.” The view challenged by the experimental staircase demands a deep review of our understanding of the role of quantum effects in double wells. In this work, we use a Lindbladian model of dissipation to derive a semianalytical formula for the switching rate, resolving a continuous transition between tunneling-dominated dynamics and dissipation-dominated dynamics. These two dynamics are observed respectively in the flat part and the steep part of each step in the staircase. Our formula exposes two distinct dissipative processes that limit tunneling: the dephasing of interwell superpositions freezes tunneling via the quantum Zeno effect, and the decay from one excited state to another limits the time during which tunneling can be attempted. This physical understanding allows us to pinpoint the critical drive amplitude that separates the flat and steep part of each step using an equation involving the rates of the two dissipative processes and the tunnel splitting. In addition, analyzing the transition matrix elements in the formula shows that in the regime of a few ( ≲ 10 ) states in the well and under moderate to low temperatures, highly excited states are populated predominantly via cascaded and direct thermal heating rather than quantum heating. At very low temperatures, we find that the perturbation induced by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian part of the Lindbladian model becomes increasingly important and facilitates a form of quantum heating that has not been identified before. We numerically map the activation mechanism as a function of drive amplitude, damping rate, and temperature. Our theory deepens the understanding of switching dynamics between metastable quantum states, highlights the importance of a general interplay between tunneling and dissipation, and identifies a novel quantum regime in activated transitions.},

Beyond the foundational significance, the problem of bounding nonlocal correlations by reasonable physical principles has meaningful practical consequences, particularly for device-independent (DI) cryptographic security. In this work, we advance in this direction, demonstrating that the IC is enough to ensure DI security on quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Security is proven for a range of theoretically quantum-attainable parameters against individual attacks by a potentially postquantum eavesdropper. This result follows as a consequence of a strong form of monogamy of Bell's inequality violations, which we prove to be implied by the recently proposed multipartite formulation for IC . Additionally, we demonstrate that the original bipartite formulation of IC fails to imply monogamy relations, and hence, ensure security of DIQKD, thus stressing the necessity of the multipartite framework.},
