  abstract     = {While the special properties of exceptional points (EPs) may improve application relevant features such as hypersensing, often their realization requires a precise fine-tuning of parameters. Here we report the robust formation of EP chains in coupled optical microcavities over intercavity distances on the order of the cavity size. We find that coupling, or more generally, the availability of an outer (coupling) channel, is sufficient to induce EPs in the parameter space spanned by the refractive index along with . This occurs even at of several wavelengths, yielding a network of EPs in parameter space with a periodicity of the order of the wavelength in the direction. Upon the increase of , we observe a sharp transition in the sign of the chirality measured in one of the cavities that further structures the system properties. While the details of the Riemannian surfaces associated with the formation of exceptional points are mode dependent and allow for a variety of single-cavity chiralities, we find the underlying mechanism to be universal, robust, applicable to other and more general coupled systems, and promising for potential applications such as optical measurements of pressure, voltages, or distances.},

By imposing a local particle sink with strong loss, we induce a convergent radial flow with a spatially bounded supersonic region, forming an acoustic analog of a black-hole horizon and an inner horizon around the sink. The observed superflow appears to be modulated by quasiperiodic bursts of superluminal signals. We measure their frequencies and find agreement with numerical simulations of the frequencies of ring soliton oscillations within the black-hole horizon. The solitons seen in the simulations are emitted from the region between the two horizons in a process that we attribute to the Landau instability. The presented experiment demonstrates a new method for creating supersonic flows in atomic superfluids, which may find applications in quantum simulations of curved spacetime, supersonic turbulence, and self-oscillating dynamics in dissipative many-body systems.},

We characterize an intrinsic comagnetometer that is available in crystals, which can be used to suppress spurious magnetic-field effects through comparing sets of ions related by spatial reflection symmetry.

Instead of exhibiting energy-conserving persistent coherent motion, the dynamics of such open systems feature, in most cases, a steady state, which is approached in the long-time limit from all initial conditions. This can, in fact, be advantageous as it offers a mechanism for the creation of robust quantum correlations on demand without the need for fine-tuning. Here, we show this for a system consisting of two coherently coupled bosonic modes, which is a paradigmatic scenario for the realization of quantum resources such as squeezed entangled states. Rather counterintuitively, the mere addition of incoherent hopping, which results in a statistical coupling between the bosonic modes, leads to steady states with robust quantum entanglement and enables the emergence of persistent coherent nonstationary behavior.},

We perform an exhaustive search for triangle-local models, and from it we infer analytic expressions for the boundaries of the set of distributions that admit such models, which we conjecture to be all the tight Bell inequalities for the scenario.

This approach allows us to accurately estimate assemblages without assuming uniform detection efficiency on the untrusted party's side. Using an evidence-based framework grounded in the Akaike information criterion, we demonstrate faithful reconstructions while balancing model complexity.

Under this scenario, we investigate the task of frequency estimation in the presence of a non-Markovian environment. We design a control strategy and prove that it outperforms any control-free strategies, recovering the optimal Heisenberg limit up to a small error term that is intrinsic to this model. We further demonstrate the advantage of our control strategy via experiments on a nuclear magnetic resonance platform.

In the quantum regime, current approaches to smoothing either give unphysical outcomes, due to the noncommutativity of the measurements at different times, or require assumptions about how the environment is measuring the system, which with current technology is unverifiable. We propose a novel definition of the smoothed quantum state based on quantum Bayesian retrodiction, which mirrors the classical retrodictive approach to smoothing. This approach always yields physical results and does not require any assumption on the environment. We show that this smoothed state has, on average, greater purity than the state reconstructed using just the prior information. Finally, we make a connection with the smoothing theory of Guevara and Wiseman in a well-studied regime, and describe from a purely quantum perspective how it conditions on the posterior information.},

The principle asserts the sufficiency of local measurements for achieving a tomographic characterization of any bipartite state. In this work, we explore the meaning of the principle of tomographic locality by developing a simple scheme for generating a wide variety of theories that violate the principle. In this scheme, one starts with a tomographically local theory—which can be classical, quantum, or postquantum—and a physical symmetry, and one restricts the processes in the theory to all and only those that are covariant with respect to the collective action of that symmetry. We refer to the resulting theories as twirled worlds . We show that failures of tomographic locality are ubiquitous in twirled worlds. From the possibility of such failures in classical twirled worlds, we argue that the failure of tomographic locality (i.e., tomographic non locality) does not imply ontological holism. Our results also demonstrate the need for researchers seeking to axiomatize quantum theory to take a stand on the question of whether there are superselection rules that have a fundamental status.},

  abstract     = {Quantum optics routinely uses beam splitters to generate entanglement, including in pioneering experiments conducted by Hanbury-Brown and Twiss and Hong, Ou, and Mandel. The quantum interference at beam splitters lies at the heart of what makes boson sampling hard to emulate by classical computers and is a vital component of quantum computation with light. Yet, despite overwhelming positive evidence, the conjecture that beam splitters with equal reflection and transmission probabilities generate the most entanglement for any state interfered with the vacuum has remained unproven for almost two decades [Asbóth et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 , 173602 (2005) ]. We prove this conjecture for ubiquitous entanglement monotones including mixed-state generalizations of entanglement entropy and purity by uncovering monotonicity and convexity with respect to photon loss for these monotones. At the same time, we highlight an infinite class of lesser-used monotones for which the conjecture fails. Because beam splitters are so fundamental, our results yield numerous corollaries for quantum optics, including proof of a recent conjecture for the evolution of a measure of quantumness through loss and a more efficient computational strategy for optimizing entanglement generation over linear optics. These results justify the value of seeking mathematical rigor behind commonly accepted facts and the danger of trusting them unconditionally.},

In a linear dielectric medium with refractive index n , the momentum is predicted to be smaller by a factor of n according to Abraham and larger by the same factor according to Minkowski. By studying the coupled dynamics of electromagnetic waves and dipoles in a dielectric medium, we show that the change in momentum of the dipole, expressed by the Lorentz force, corresponds to the Abraham momentum and is given by the expectation value of the spin-projected momentum vector. On the other hand, the Minkowski momentum is obtained as the magnitude of the spin-projected momentum vector from the energy-momentum dispersion relation derived by diagonalizing the coupled Hamiltonian and determines the direction of refraction in accordance with Snell's law. Our model also predicts a zitterbewegung -like oscillation due to helicity mixing between left- and right-handed wave components, mediated by dipole oscillation. These internal wave dynamics may be observable via wave-packet motion or polarization-sensitive measurements.},

We find that for relatively large free-space decay rates, the population dynamics of each qubit features Rabi oscillations, while for smaller decay rates it exhibits a complex behavior, which nevertheless can be understood by semianalytical expressions using the sub- and superradiant states of the system. Additionally, we observe phenomena, such as population and entanglement trapping, induced by the strong interaction of the qubits with the graphene nanodisk, with trapping values depending solely on the initial conditions of the two qubits.

  abstract     = {Systems in contact with an environment provide a ubiquitous challenge in quantum dynamics. Many fascinating phenomena can arise if the coupling is strong, leading to non-Markovian dynamics of the system, or collective, where the environment can become highly excited. We introduce a significant improvement of the hierarchy of pure states (HOPS) approach, which is able to efficiently deal with such highly excited, non-Markovian environments in a nearly unitary way. As our method relies on quantum trajectories, we can obtain dynamics efficiently, also for large system sizes, by (1) avoiding the quadratic scaling of a density matrix and (2) exploiting the localization properties of the trajectories with an adaptive basis. We provide the derivation of the nuHOPS (nearly unitary hierarchy of pure states) method, compare it to the original HOPS, and discuss numerical subtleties based on an illustrative dephasing model. Finally, we show its true power using the Dicke model as the paradigmatic example of many emitters decaying superradiantly inside a cavity. We reach numerically exact solutions for up to 1000 emitters. We apply our method to study emerging higher-order correlations in the emitter system or the cavity mode environment and their scaling with the number of emitters.},

In our model, the pump and probe fields coherently drive the first mirror, whereas the second mirror has mechanical oscillation due to the radiation pressure. We show that the right- and left-circular polarization components of the Gaussian probe field striking at an arbitrary incident angle become spatially separate along a direction orthogonal to the plane of incidence. Photonic SHE can be coherently controlled by adjusting the optomechanical interaction, cavity field, and G-mode phonon coupling, as well as G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction. The findings of photonic SHE are equally valid for standard optomechanical systems in the absence of cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and electronic state interaction. The cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling broadened the detuning range of the probe field to observe the dominant photonic SHE. Adding G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction generates enhanced photonic SHE at three different probe field detunings due to optomechanical-induced transparency being split into three windows. We show that asymmetric photonic SHE can be controlled through cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction when probe field detuning is nonzero. The photonic SHE in bilayer graphene integrated with an optomechanical cavity may enable further studies of spin-dependent photonic effects and quantum sensing applications.},

The system, modeled as a Rice-Mele chain using a double-well lattice and facilitating giant-atom-like nonlocal interaction, exhibits intriguing phenomena such as subradiance and superradiance. We demonstrate that APBSs with tunable chirality can be realized in the bound states in the continuum (BICs) and quasi-BICs and support the decoherence-free interaction via two distinct schemes. We also reveal the dynamical mechanisms for the topologically protected SAP, where the chiral-APBS fidelity during the adiabatic transfer is highly sensitive to the topology. These findings open possibilities for quantum simulation and information processing with cold atoms, particularly through the integration of topologically protected controllable mechanisms.},

In this formalism, the electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric object has two contributions, one taking into account the polarization current fluctuations of the object and the other taking into account the vacuum field fluctuations scattered by the object. The combined effect of these fields on the dynamics of a quantum emitter is described via two independent continuous bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each characterized by its own spectral density and initial quantum state. For initial thermal states of the two reservoirs at different temperatures, the standard approach based on the knowledge of the dyadic Green's function of the dielectric object at the quantum emitter position cannot be employed. We map the two reservoirs to a single equivalent reservoir with a temperature-dependent effective spectral density and initially in its vacuum state, focusing on the case of a homogeneous dielectric sphere. We derive analytical expressions for the medium-assisted, scattering-assisted, and effective spectral densities in this setting. We then study the dynamics of the quantum emitter for initial thermal states of the two reservoirs, adopting a nonperturbative approach.},

To our knowledge, the impacts of BICs on the single-photon purity and brightness in the blockade process remain less explored. Here, we put forward a scheme to simultaneously enhance both the purity and brightness of single-photon emission in one cavity mode of such an integrated microresonator-waveguide system, while the other cavity mode is considered to be an active mode, modeled as incoherent-pumping (gain)-like laser production. Physically, this enhancement is achieved through BICs produced by quantum destructive interference between different dissipative pathways. We demonstrate that BICs enable the improvement of emission brightness by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, accompanied by high single-photon purity of 0.98 (or strong photon blockade of 0.02) compared with the BIC-free configuration. As a check, the full numerical results for the second-order correlation function and the average photon number of the emission cavity mode, which respectively determine the purity and brightness of single-photon emission, are in excellent agreement with the semianalytical solutions. Our BICs-based work offers a promising avenue for constructing single-photon sources with high purity and high brightness.},

  abstract     = {How environments affect the dynamics of quantum systems remains a central question in understanding transitions between quantum and classical phenomena and optimizing quantum technologies. A paradigm model to address the above question is the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model, in which a two-level particle is coupled to its environment modeled by a continuum of boson modes. Previous analytic solutions show that, starting from the initial condition that the particle is in its excited state and the boson modes are in their vacuum state, the time evolution of the probability that the particle occupies the excited state exhibits a dynamical transition as the system-environment coupling varies; when the coupling is weak, the probability decays to zero monotonically, while a finite weight of the particle is localized in the excited state when the coupling is sufficiently strong. Here we study the dynamical transition for the case that particles are initially excited with the boson modes in their vacuum state. The boson modes are assumed to follow a spectral function up to a cutoff frequency with . In particular, we access the effects of an all-to-all Ising type interaction we introduce between the particles. Our calculation is carried out by the nonperturbative numerical renormalization group method. We find that the value of the critical coupling for the transition exhibits a maximum at a finite and decreases with sufficiently large , and is suppressed (enlarged) by a ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) Ising interaction. Our results enrich understanding of environmental effects on interacting quantum systems.},

The multiphoton JCHM MI phases are classified according to a conserved quantity associated with the total number of excited atoms and photons. When this conserved quantity diverges toward positive infinity, this system enters the forbidden phase. By analyzing the system, we observe MI, superfluid, and forbidden phases in both the single- and two-photon JCHMs, although the MI phases in the two-photon case are confined to subspaces with small values of the conserved quantity. In contrast, only the superfluid and forbidden phases appear in the three- and four-photon JCHMs, with no MI phase observed.},

This was seen through the study of the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian superoperator that describes the joint effect of drive and cooperativity. The cooperative decay depends on the nature of the reservoir correlations. If the reservoir correlations have phase-sensitive behavior, then the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian will be different. We investigate the time-crystal behavior of the nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions under the influence of a squeezed vacuum reservoir. We analyze the steady-state phase diagram as a function of the control parameter and demonstrate that increasing the squeezing strength sharpens the dissipative phase transition. Spectral analysis of the Liouvillian reveals gap closings and the emergence of purely imaginary eigenvalues in the thermodynamic limit, indicating the time-crystal phase. We find that the real parts of subleading eigenvalues exhibit nonmonotonic behavior with increasing squeezing, reflecting the sensitivity of relaxation dynamics to the reservoir properties. Time-domain simulations confirm that the oscillation frequencies correspond to the imaginary parts of the Liouvillian eigenvalues. We also present results on quantum fluctuations in the time-crystal phase. Our results call attention to the study of time crystals in models of cooperativity based on engineered environments.},

While significant progress has been made in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of enantiomer selectivity, many existing studies focus on perfectly chiral cavities that contain only one type of enantiomer. Here, we investigate a scenario of imperfect cavities containing varying mixtures of enantiomers. Using a generalized Hopfield-type model, we systematically explore how the degree of enantiomeric mixing and cavity imperfections affect chiral selectivity. Our analysis includes both an examination of the cavity's eigenmode structure and a quantitative assessment of differential energy transfer into specific enantiomeric species. We demonstrate that both cavity imperfections and the presence of enantiomer mixtures profoundly modify the polaritonic dispersion. We also highlight that pushing the system into the deep strong coupling regime—by increasing molecular concentration—can decrease the efficiency of energy transfer to matter modes. These findings emphasize that precise cavity design and detailed consideration of enantiomeric composition are essential for achieving optimal chiral selectivity in practical cavity QED systems.},

  abstract     = {Optical down-conversion is widely used for generating photon pairs, squeezed and entangled states of light, making it an indispensable tool in quantum optics and quantum information. In the regime where the pump is much stronger than the generated field, the standard parametric approximation treats the pump amplitude as a fixed parameter of the model. This approximation has a limited domain of validity since it assumes a nondepleted and nonentangled pump. By finding an approximate solution to the Schrödinger equation of the down-conversion process, we obtain an improved analytical model beyond the parametric one, which accounts for pump depletion and pump-signal entanglement. Our model is advantageous, first, because it allows one to compute averages of field operators far beyond the domain of validity of the parametric approximation, and second, because it allows one to establish error-specific limits of the latter domain. For a given pump amplitude, we find a maximum squeezing parameter, up to which the approximation remains valid within a specified acceptable error. Our results confirm that recent experiments on Gaussian boson sampling, with a squeezing parameter of and a coherent pump amplitude of , can still be accurately described by the standard parametric approximation. However, we observe a sharp decline in validity as the squeezing parameter increases. For pump amplitudes of , the parametric approximation breaks down when the squeezing parameter exceeds , whereas the new approximation remains valid up to with an acceptable error of 1%.},

This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for -function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.},

Specifically, we show how one can access higher moments of the mode operators, crucial for detecting entanglement of non-Gaussian states, using a single beamsplitter with variable phase and photon-number-resolving detectors. We demonstrate that the use of an entangled state paired with a suitable reference state is sufficient to detect entanglement in, e.g., two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON states, and mixed entangled cat states.

The phases of coupling strengths between the giant molecule and waveguides are considered. Using a real-space method, we obtain the exact analytical expressions for the single-photon scattering coefficients, which are valid both in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. It is shown that the transmission spectra strongly depend on phases, including the phases accumulated by photons traveling between coupling points and the phase difference between two coupled channels of the giant-molecule upper (lower) waveguide. Under the Markovian limit, we find that by selecting appropriate accumulated phases and local phase difference, targeted routing and asymmetrical scattering of photons can be achieved without breaking the symmetry in the coupling configuration between the giant molecule and waveguides. Moreover, all the optimal phase combinations for implementing single-photon routing have been summarized. In the non-Markovian regime, the scattering spectra show more complicated line shapes with multiple staggered peaks and dips. More interestingly, the scattering spectrum exhibits periodic changes during the transition from the Markovian to the non-Markovian regime, which makes one obtain a means to control photon routing in addition to phases.

We also explore the possibilities offered by such a system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the SaS scattering depends on parameters such as the Stokes–anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry, and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.},

The non-Gaussianity evolution during the coupling process is quantitatively analyzed via quantum relative entropy, and the entanglement between the two output modes is confirmed from an entropic perspective. Furthermore, the entanglement properties of the zero-phase and -phase positive Wigner squeezed states at the third- and sixth-order moments are revealed by applying the partial transpose positive criterion based on the higher-order covariance matrix. In particular, it is found that the steerability of the two output modes at the third- and sixth-order moments can be dynamically controlled by adjusting the intensity of the input light and the transmission of the beam splitter.

Our results reveal a transition from anomalous to normal in the ellipticity dependence as the laser frequency increases. Simultaneously, the structure of the orientation dependence undergoes a transformation. By analyzing the conduction-band electron populations, we attribute these changes to the transformation of the dominant excitation mechanism. At low frequencies, tunneling ionization dominates, whereas at high frequencies, multiphoton ionization prevails. Furthermore, the limitation of the solid Keldysh parameter is discussed. These findings underscore the crucial role of the dominant excitation mechanism in solid high-order harmonic generation.},

  abstract     = {Singular optics is an important and meaningful subject that has attracted widespread attention. The famous vortex beam and vector beam carrying different singularities have found broad applications, and there are four kinds of optical singularities including one kind of phase singularity and three kinds of polarization singularities. However, the classification of optical singularities remains incomplete, as the polarization singularity with indeterminate ellipticity and determinate orientation has not been defined. Here, we propose a kind of E -point singularity, where the ellipticity of polarization is indeterminate and the orientation is determinate. The amount, positions, and topological charges of the E -point singularities can be theoretically and experimentally manipulated on the wave front of the beam. It is found that the E -point singularity has a function of polarization purification in propagation, and the E -point singularity acts like catalyst when achieving pure transverse spin angular momentum (SAM) in tight focusing process. The proposed E -point singularity not only supplements the theoretical framework of singular optics, but also enables SAM manipulation during propagation and focusing processes, demonstrating broad application potential across various regions.},

This allows for a powerful numerical solution of optomechanical resonances without any perturbative approximations for the mechanical motion. The scaled population (excitation) dynamics of the Lorentz oscillators are investigated as well as the emitted radiation and electromagnetic spectra, which demonstrates how the usual dipole-dipole resonances couple to the underlying Floquet states, yielding multiple spectral peaks that are separated from the superradiant and subradiant states by an integer number of the mechanical oscillation frequency. Moreover, we observe that when the mechanical amplitude and frequency are sufficiently large, these additional spectral peaks undergo further modification, including spectral splitting, spectral squeezing, or shifting. These observations are fully corroborated by a theoretical Floquet analysis conducted on two coupled harmonic oscillators.},

While non-Hermitian effects have been widely addressed in two-dimensional (2D) systems, we focus on realistic three-dimensional devices. To this end we generalize established phase-space methods from mesoscopic optics and introduce Husimi functions for three-dimensional systems that deepen the insight and access to the mode morphology and their dynamics. We illustrate that four-dimensional Husimi functions can be represented using a specific projection on two dimensions and illustrate it for (conical) cylindrical cavities. The non-Hermitian character of the intrinsically open photonic systems is in particular revealed when examining the transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarization character of the resonance modes. Unlike the 2D case, polarization is not conserved in three-dimensional cavities, and we use generalized Husimi function to represent the interaction of polarization modes. We find their dynamics to be ruled by a network of exceptional points in the parameter space spanned by the refractive index and the cavity geometry tilt angle. This approach not only enhances our understanding of cavity modes but also aids in the design of more efficient photonic devices and systems.},

This approach exploits parity-asymmetric interactions between chiral particles and the metasurface-engineered needle-like optical field, eliminating the need for complex background structures. Leveraging the field manipulation versatility of spin-decoupled metasurfaces, we demonstrate enantiomer separation across thousands of particle diameters—exceeding previous works by an order of magnitude in terms of particle-scale displacement. Furthermore, by tuning the chirality density of the field, directional control of particle motion can be achieved, underscoring its potential for large-scale chiral sorting and enantioselective drug purification.},

It involves two coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations for the forward and backward propagating fields, alongside a single equation governing the acoustic oscillation. Under the standard assumptions for the mean-field approach (high finesse, weak nonlinearity, and weak dispersion) we demonstrate that our model closely matches the original system. The simplified and elegant mathematical structure of our equation provides valuable physical insights. As a key example, we derive an expression for the growth rate of harmonic perturbations to the steady states. Additionally, our model facilitates fast and accurate numerical simulations using standard Fourier split-step methods.

Superscattering, induced by degenerate resonances, allows the scattering cross section of subwavelength structures to surpass the fundamental single-channel limit. However, most existing superscattering techniques depend on complex multilayered structures and primarily aim to enhance scattering magnitudes. In this work, we propose a single-layer plasmonic core-shell nanoparticle that achieves superdirectional scattering without relying on high-permittivity materials and magnetic resonances. We demonstrate that for nanoparticles with a thin plasmonic nanoshell, both dielectric dipolar and quadrupolar resonances occur at nearly the same frequency, where the permittivity of the plasmonic shell approaches zero (degenerate epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) resonances), enabling superscattering in this simple nanoparticle. Furthermore, by tuning the amplitudes of these ENZ resonances, we show that both zero-backward and super-forward scattering can be realized. This approach, relying solely on pure electric ENZ modes in a simple core-shell nanoparticle, offers a new pathway for achieving superdirectional scattering and holds significant potential for applications in photovoltaic devices, biosensors, and nanoantennas.},

Here we utilize the conservation of optical chirality to connect the parity and time-reversal symmetries of the intrinsic excitational eigenmodes of a material to those of their associated electromagnetic eigenfields as dictated by Maxwell's equations. To make this connection explicit, we theoretically examine the Born-Kuhn (BK) system, composed of a pair of plasmonic nanorods of variable separation, as a prototypical material model that is both geometrically chiral in its static structure and truly excitationally chiral in its eigenexcitations and eigenfields. By relaying optical chirality metrics of the BK eigenfields back to their underlying sourcing material degrees of freedom, we derive a unique mechanical chirality measure that is related to, but distinct from, other pseudoscalar metrics recently discussed in the literature. Beyond analysis in the absence of sources, we further derive optical chiral extinction, scattering, and absorption cross sections under external drive and discuss their rigorous connection to more common circular dichroism measurements as well as their limitations in comparison to eigenfield chirality metrics. Finally, we investigate the conversion of achiral linearly polarized light into chiral elliptically polarized light through interaction with the BK system, illustrating the conservation of optical chirality in the interaction between light and matter through an analytically tractable example.},

In this work, we systematically investigate the multiple-order differential imaging based on two types of topological singularity in 1D photonic crystals (PhCs). For both oblique and normal incidences, we conduct a detailed investigation of differential imaging effect. For the oblique incident cases, the first type of topological singularities support first-order differential imaging in both x and y directions. Meanwhile, based on the second type of topological singularities, ∂ 2 / ∂ x ∂ y -type differential imaging can be achieved. For the normal incident cases, the first type of topological singularities can support radial second-order and fourth-order differential imaging and the second type of topological singularities can support radial fourth-order differential imaging without the need for fine-tuning of the structural parameters. We further demonstrate the realization of these differential imaging effects in the deep-subwavelength region by shifting the first type of topological singularities into this region. This research connects the topological properties of PhCs with optical differential imaging, paving the way for the development of multiple-order differential imaging devices with improved robustness and functionality.},

We have also derived analytical expressions for the STLG mode with an arbitrary radial and angular indices propagating in the isotropic media. The propagation dynamics can be understood as a unitary transformation generated by a conserved quantity, where the rotation angle is exactly the intermodal Gouy phase of the spatiotemporal modes in the same order subspace. This spatiotemporal Gouy phase depends on the ellipticity of the wave packets and the group velocity dispersion of the media. The phase, as a function of propagation distance, is categorized into three distinct regimes: normal dispersion, anomalous dispersion, and zero dispersion. Interestingly, in the regime of anomalous dispersion, the nonmonotonic behavior induces both distortion and revival of the intensity distribution, thereby establishing a phase-locked mechanism that is analogous to the Talbot effect.},

Starting from the linearized quantum Langevin equations, we derive the drift matrix and confirm system stability by verifying that all eigenvalue real parts remain negative. We then analyze the probe transmission spectrum under two complementary control mechanisms. First, with collisional interactions suppressed, increasing the OPA gain within the stability region transforms the standard Lorentzian cavity response into a tunable Fano-like profile, accompanied by asymmetric dispersive line shapes and pronounced group delays. Second, with the OPA turned off, including atomic collisions yields an intrinsically narrow Bogoliubov excitation that interferes with the cavity continuum, reproducing Fano resonances, “S-shaped” phase dispersion, slow- and fast-light windows, and positive Goos-Hänchen shifts. By examining both absorptive (real) and dispersive (imaginary) components of the transmitted field, we establish direct links between destructive interference pathways, steep phase slopes, and enhanced optical delays. Our results demonstrate that parametric amplification and collisional nonlinearities are equally versatile tools for engineering quantum interference in cavity QED with ultracold atoms, opening prospects for reconfigurable slow-light buffers, Fano-switchable photonic routers, and atom-integrated delay lines.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the focusing characteristics of scalar and vector beams within an atomic medium. An active-Raman-gain configuration is employed to achieve significant Kerr nonlinearity in a four-state atomic system. The probe beams can attain focusing within the medium through careful selection of input beam intensities and the spatial profile of the control field. We analytically derive the linear and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities for both scalar and vector probe beams. Our observations indicate that, in addition to the energy transfer from the control beam to the probe beam, the giant cross-Kerr nonlinearity facilitates the focusing of the scalar probe beam into a significantly smaller spot size. Conversely, the vector probe beams exhibit gain-induced narrowing. Furthermore, we evaluate the state of polarization for the vector beam at the minimum beam waist, observing a polarization rotation and a change in ellipticity during propagation. Through the mechanism of focusing, we achieve a reduced spot size for the probe beam, which may have substantial implications for resolution enhancement in microscopy applications.},

Moving beyond conventional linearized approximations, we derive analytical expressions for both the second-order sideband efficiency and mass-sensing sensitivity using a perturbation approach. Our scheme enables mass detection by monitoring shifts in the second-order sideband generation efficiency when a target mass is deposited on the dielectric membrane. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we identify the maximum achievable efficiency of the second-order upper sideband and its corresponding optimal sensitivity. Remarkably, with the aid of a gain cavity, both the sideband efficiency and mass sensitivity are significantly enhanced—particularly near the exceptional point, where improvements exceeding three orders of magnitude are demonstrated. This work provides a promising approach to high-precision mass measurement, advancing and complementing existing methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are electromagnetic eigenstates that theoretically exhibit infinite quality factors. However, scattering losses induced by manufacturing defects inevitably affect the confinement performance of BICs. Studies have shown that combining multiple BICs can enhance their robustness against such defects. Currently, approaches to merging BICs at off- points typically rely on altering the geometry of the central structure, which not only increases the complexity of device design but also potentially raises costs. Based on this, we propose a scheme that maintains the central structure while introducing specific defect holes to break the in-plane symmetry of the system, thereby inducing the splitting of the higher-order BIC and forming multiple off- BICs. Subsequently, these split BICs, along with the accidental BICs, will merge at the off- point as the structural parameters are varied. The proposed concept not only enhances optical confinement but also enables flexible control over the splitting direction of the higher-order BIC by manipulating the spatial positions of the defect apertures. More importantly, by rationally designing the positions of defects, we can construct merging BICs at arbitrary wave vectors through manipulations of split BICs and accidental BICs. Furthermore, even in the presence of manufacturing defects, the merging BICs demonstrate exceptional robustness. This provides new insights for the flexible control of BICs in diversified applications while also expanding their potential in a broader momentum space.},

In this study, we present a tunable bilayer optical matter motor controlled by distance-modulated electromagnetic interlayer coupling. Using the generalized Lorentz-Mie scattering theory for multispheres and the Langevin dynamics method, we investigate the dynamics of the bilayer motor during light-driven self-organization and rotation. Through the modulation of the interlayer distance to tune coupling effects, we demonstrate the capacity to selectively manipulate the rotation modes of the motor—both layers can rotate clockwise (receiving negative optical torque), rotate anticlockwise, or counterrotate. These modes arise from changes in the relative contributions of excited electric and magnetic multipoles, offering an intuitive understanding of interlayer coupling from the perspective of multipoles. The bilayer motor exhibits stable rotation across a wide range of coupling distances due to strong long-range electromagnetic coupling, and demonstrates excellent robustness to both the polarization of the incident light and structural offset from the beam center, facilitating experimental implementation. Our structural stability analysis indicates that bilayer optical matter motors constructed from equilateral triangular units maintain remarkable stability during light-driven self-organization and rotation, even with varying interlayer coupling. This research enhances our understanding of light-matter interactions in the dynamics of bilayer optical matter systems while providing theoretical foundations for novel micromotor design.},

Here, we propose a scheme for realizing the classical non-Abelian braiding of coupled modes in photonic waveguides system. The Hamiltonian of the designed system is built via the interplay between two sub-Hamiltonians, where one of them enables the non-Abelian braiding, while the other one generates the coupled modes. In this way, the non-Abelian braiding of coupled modes of arbitrarily high order can be realized. We carry out numerical simulations to verify the concept for coupled modes with an order of four, including the mode switching behavior as well as the non-Abelian geometric phase. The proposed concept may lead to on-chip applications including mode division multiplexing non-Abelian braiding.},

As an illustrative example, we employ a cosine-Gaussian correlated Schell-model pulse to conduct in-depth analyses. Our numerical results reveal that the obstructed pulses, with the help of the source degree of coherence, exhibit outstanding self-reconstruction properties in the nonlinear Kerr media. Although the nonlinearity can to some extent impair the self-reconstruction ability of pulses, ultrastrong self-reconstruction of the pulses can be achieved by reducing the optical coherence.

In this work, we propose an integrated and tunable transducer that combines a coplanar waveguide microwave resonator with a magno-optomechanical microcavity via flip-chip bonding. Benefiting from the broad frequency tunability of the magnon mode, the working frequency range can be tuned over several gigahertz. Through optimization of the geometry and pump powers, our design achieves a theoretical microwave-to-optical photon conversion efficiency exceeding 50% using experimentally achievable parameters, alongside a bandwidth greater than 10 kHz. An added noise near the quantum limit is achievable at 10 mK using lower pump powers at the cost of conversion efficiency or a pulsed-pump protocol.

PSS rises as increases, reaching a maximum of roughly 300 and 120 for the transverse and longitudinal shift values, respectively.

The first is independent of the tunneling parameter and emerges when the steady-state frequency of the mode is resonant with the TLS transition. This resembles lasing in uncoupled MCs and relies on population inversion. The second scenario arises from the nonreciprocal nature of dissipative tunneling and enables lasing of nonresonant modes even at vanishingly small population inversion, owing to energy redistribution across the network. In the latter case, interference effects along graph paths induce node-dependent frequency shifts and nonreciprocal photon transmission. We further propose a renormalization-group hypothesis for the PN to explain the observed spectral features. We analyze the phase structure of photonic modes in the scale-free RL and discuss its relevance for photonic Ising machines operating under the minimum power dissipation principle.},

Here, we study the quantum optical signatures of high-harmonic generation (HHG) from solid-state material driven by squeezed coherent states. We find that squeezed coherent states can either enhance or suppress the HHG yields compared to that driven by coherent light, depending on the photon bunching or antibunching characteristics of driving light. The analysis on semiclassical trajectories indicates that the amplitude fluctuation alters the recombination energy, while the phase fluctuation affects the birth and recombination time of electron-hole pairs. By calculating the Husimi Q distributions of HHG, we demonstrate that the squeezing of the two conjugate quadratures of driving light asymmetrically influence the squeezing phase of harmonics. Surprisingly, we find that even under coherent driving, the harmonics still exhibit squeezing due to the highly nonlinear response of solid-state HHG, which was overlooked previously. Numerical calculations of the Mandel parameter are performed to characterize the photon statistics of emitted HHG arising from different microscopic mechanisms. The results indicate that intraband radiation can exhibit a super-Poissonian distribution, while interband emission exhibits sub-Poissonian distribution under coherent driving.},

  abstract     = {Single-mode semiconductor lasers support fast nonlinear dynamics for investigating extreme events. Although one laser subject to perturbation is sufficient for yielding extreme events, multiple lasers with mutual interactions have yet to be considered. Here, extreme events are found experimentally using two detuned lasers under delayed mutual injection. The mutually injected lasers each emit an intensity that exhibits locking to a constant, except for interruptions by intermittent pulses, including very strong ones as extreme events. Such extreme eruptions from a constant background under mutual injection are different from the continual chaotic oscillations usually obtained under unidirectional injections. By varying the detuning frequency between the lasers, the intermittent pulsations with extreme events are found in a route that involves regular switching between constant and periodic oscillatory intensities. By adopting space-time representation, the extreme events are observed to emerge stochastically, together with some partial repetitions of pulses corresponding to a slightly lengthened round trip. By optimizing the detuning, the maximal normalized occurrence of extreme events reaches 0.8%, which is relatively high among approaches on lasers without external modulations for excitations. On average, about six extreme events are yielded within one round trip of 130 ns, while their short pulse widths are of the order of 0.1 ns. Applicable to generating strong random electrical pulses, the experiments point to the importance of mutual interactions in single-mode lasers for extreme events.},

The Photon extra-bunching effect, as a special class of the superbunching effect ( ), describes the enhanced photon correlation ( ) through the interference of bright twin beams produced in the spontaneous parametric down-conversion. In this work, we report that this effect can exist in classical beams and that can approach 4 in some extended extreme models. We experimentally demonstrate the nontrivial extra-bunching correlation ( gain) in pairwise-generated holographic thermal light beams with a Dove prism-embedded balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The interaction of such a pair of conjugated thermal light beams can generate a pair of uncorrelated superthermal light beams, enabling ghost imaging and Young's intensity interference with enhanced visibility. The quantum-inspired interference-induced spatial extra-bunching effect provides novel insights into inducing superbunching correlation in classical light and holds the potential for application in the coherent two-photon Lidar system to enhance sensitivity.},

In the dynamic equilibrium, the spot size, pulse duration, wave-front curvature, phase, and chirp evolve self-consistently along the propagation path. Significant intensity enhancement at remote distances is achieved by tailoring the laser parameters in such a way that the transverse and longitudinal focal points nearly coincide. In addition, the hybrid filamentation-modulation instability is analyzed and simulated, indicating that the beam breaks up transversely and longitudinally.

We have studied our levitated system over a wide range of trapping parameters and determined four distinct dynamical states of the trapped particle motion, which are associated with the retaining force and drag force nonlinearities. Like any other nonlinear system, the considered one possesses a phase transition in its behavior that demarcates linear and nonlinear regimes of motion. The nonlinear regime manifests itself as the formation of a specific limit cycle of the trapped particle motion also known as an extended orbit . We have shown that the birth of the extended orbits is foretold by the appearance of half-integer trapping frequency multiples in the particle motion oscillation. These half-integer multiples are highly sensitive to trapping parameters and external perturbation. We have demonstrated that the phase transition is a continuous process over a range of system parameters and can be exploited to detect small influences on the levitated system. We have tested the system response in the transient state to the external optical perturbation. The strong sensitivity to perturbation laser power has been shown for both the spectral composition of the trapped particle translational oscillations and extended orbit formation point. We believe in the potential to apply the nonlinear state of the levitodynamic system with massive particles to the field of precision measurements and nonequilibrium physics investigation.},

Using the same analytical approach, we then discuss the applicability of the quench spectroscopy to non-Hermitian quantum lattice models by considering the sudden global quench dynamics of the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain confined in the paramagnetic phase. We finally generalize this spectroscopy method to isolated Hermitian quantum lattice models characterized by a quadratic fermionic or bosonic Hamiltonian. For this purpose, we consider the case study of the Hermitian version of the latter one-dimensional lattice model.

  abstract     = {In the low-energy limit, nonrelativistic particles with short-range interactions exhibit universal behavior that is largely independent of microscopic details. This universality is typically described by effective field theory, in which the two-body interaction is renormalized to a single parameter—the scattering length. For systems of identical bosons, the three-body problem reveals the Efimov effect, a novel phenomenon proposed that necessitates the introduction of an additional three-body parameter. However, the exact relation between this three-body parameter, the coupling constants in the effective field theory, and the binding energies of Efimov states remains unresolved. In this work, we address this question through a comprehensive analysis of the Skorniakov–Ter-Martirosian equation with a finite cutoff. We establish an exact renormalization relation for the three-body parameter and determine its connection to the energies of Efimov bound states. These results are validated through high-precision numerical simulations. We expect our findings to be of fundamental interest across various fields, including atomic, nuclear, condensed matter, and particle physics, and to have broad applications in both few-body and many-body physics.},

We employ two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a new Ansatz for vortex cores in planar quantum fluids that enhances analytic integrability. This Ansatz yields closed-form expressions for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions. Using it, we identify distinct signatures of short- and long-range velocity correlations corresponding to vortex dipoles and vortex pairs, respectively. Second, we analyze the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton. By applying the asymptotic high-velocity wave function, we derive analytic expressions for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the soliton characteristic length scale. We validate our analytical results for the homogeneous system against numerical treatment of a large trapped system, finding close quantitative agreement.

Any tilt of the Raman lasers with respect to the vertical direction introduces systematic errors in gravity measurements. In this work, we report a determination of the tilt of Raman lasers, where the fringe of the atom interferometer is scanned by varying the tilt, rather than the phase, of the Raman lasers. Unlike the periodic cosine fringes typically used in atom interferometers, the fringe obtained by changing the tilt, referred to as the tilt-scanned fringe, is aperiodic in tilt and exhibits a shift due to the presence of a nonzero tilt. The tilt-scanned fringe is highly sensitive to the tilt-caused shift, enabling convenient and precise determination of the Raman laser tilt in atom gravimeters. We demonstrate that one tilt-scanned fringe, corresponding to a tilt measurement sampling time of 13 s, can determine the tilt with a typical precision of about in our developed atom gravimeter. The short-term sensitivity and measurement accuracy of the tilt-scanned fringe method were evaluated, demonstrating performance comparable to conventional tilt determination techniques.

Novel phases are identified at moderate interaction strengths for both densities, and their robustness is investigated in the presence of flavor imbalance. Furthermore, we provide microscopic explanations of the phases found and their stability. Analysis of thermal ensembles of random mean-field solutions indicate that, at temperatures accessible in state-of-the-art cold atom experiments, some spin orders are hard for conventional scattering or local observable measurements to detect, but can be more accessible with quantum gas microscopy in optical lattice experiments. This work also shows that nesting and Mottness, intertwined in the usual SU(2) Hubbard model in stark contrast to generic materials, can be tuned in the SU(3) model and play distinct roles. The resulting phase diagrams not only deepen our understanding of Fermi-Hubbard models but also inform future experimental search for new phases.},

  abstract     = {We investigate three kinds of instabilities in binary immiscible homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, considering rubidium isotopes and confined in two-dimensional circular box. Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability types are studied under strong perturbations. Without external perturbation, instabilities are also probed by immiscible-to-miscible quenching transition, under two different initial configurations. Our numerical simulations show that all such instability dynamics are dominated by large vortex production and sound-wave (phonon) propagation. For long-term propagation, vortex dynamics become dominant over sound waves in the KH instability, while sound-wave excitations predominate in the other cases. For all the dynamical simulations, the emergence of possible scaling laws are investigated for the compressible and incompressible parts of the kinetic energy spectra, in terms of the wave number . The corresponding results are compared with the classical Kolmogorov scalings, and , for turbulence, which are observed in the kinetic energy spectra at some specific time intervals.},

  abstract     = {The most sensitive direct neutrino mass searches today are based on measurement of the end point of the spectrum of tritium to infer limits on the mass of the unobserved neutrino. To avoid the smearing associated with the distribution of molecular final states in the T-He molecule, the next generation of these experiments will need to employ atomic (T) rather than molecular tritium sources, at currents of at least atoms per second. Following production, atomic T can be trapped in gravitational and/or magnetic bottles for spectrum experiments, if and only if it can first be cooled to millikelvin temperatures. Accomplishing this cooling presents substantial technological challenges. The Project 8 collaboration is developing a technique based on magnetic evaporative cooling along a beamline (MECB) for the purpose of cooling T to feed a magnetogravitational trap that also serves as a cyclotron radiation emission spectroscope. Initial tests of the approach are planned in a pathfinder apparatus using atomic Li. This paper presents a method for analyzing the dynamics of the MECB technique and applies these calculations to the design of systems for cooling and slowing of atomic Li and T. A scheme is outlined that could provide a current of T at the millikelvin temperatures required for the Project 8 neutrino mass search.},

Invoking an ensemble-average formalism and assuming spatial translation symmetry, we show that the dynamics can be described by a Lindblad master equation with an interpolated coherent Hamiltonian. In the classical limit, the interpolation Hamiltonian leads to a set of nonlinear equations of motion, where limit cycles can emerge in the long-time dynamics. In the quantum limit, by contrast, the system approaches a ferromagnetic steady state at long times. In between the two extremes, the discrete spatial translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken, as an antiferromagnetic steady state emerges, bridging the classical and quantum regimes. In particular, we illustrate how the classical limit-cycle behavior gradually disappears with the increase of quantum correlation. Since our model in the two extremes respectively applies to a dissipative Rydberg gas in the high- and zero-temperature limits, we expect it to provide a qualitatively correct description of dissipative Rydberg gases at interim temperatures and shed light on the fate of limit cycles in a quantum open system.},

When the dipole frequencies along the three symmetric axes of the harmonic trap are degenerate, the dipole motion can decompose into two coupled transverse modes in the plane perpendicular to the synthetic magnetic field, and another decoupled longitudinal mode, enabling controllable Foucault-like precession or biconical trajectories depending on the excitation protocol. Furthermore, quenching the orientation of the synthetic magnetic field excites multiple coupled quadrupole modes. We develop a hydrodynamic theory whose predictions match well with Gross-Pitaevskii simulations.

Moreover, it highlights the relevance of energy damping, the number-conserving scattering between thermal and coherent atoms. We analyze the equilibrium properties and near-equilibrium relaxation of a homogeneous BEC in one, two, and three dimensions at high phase-space density and calculate the autocorrelation function and power spectrum of the density and phase fluctuations. Simulations of the full nonlinear SPGPE are in close agreement and extend our arguments beyond the linear regime.

We solve the Schrödinger equation for a fermionic system across a broad range of attractive and repulsive interactions by constructing the system's wave function as a superposition of two-coboson states. We determine key observables such as particle density profiles and two-body correlations. The density profiles calculated agree with both the Tonks-Girardeau and Lieb-Liniger limits and provide a portrait of the transition between those regimes. In the strong repulsive regime, the ansatz captures the Fridel-Wigner transition characterized by a doubling of the peaks in the density profiles. Additionally, we compute the low-lying energy spectrum and estimate the pairing gap. Our results highlight the usefulness of the coboson superposition ansatz for exploring quantum phenomena in strongly correlated few-body systems.},

The dynamical phase diagram in nonlinear parameter space is presented, identifying oscillation regions with different skewed sinusoidal dependence, and diffusion regions with irreversible soliton spreading due to instability of the barrier.

In a two-dimensional (2D) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at zero temperature, in addition to the vortex drift-out process from the boundary, a vortex-antivortex pair can annihilate in bulk, but controversy remains on the number of vortices involved in the annihilation process. We find that a dynamic crossover exists from four-body to three-body vortex annihilation processes with time evolution in decaying 2D quantum turbulence of a boundary-less uniform quasi-2D BEC. Such a dynamical crossover depends on the initial vortex pair density and occurs when the sound waves generated in the vortex annihilation process surpass a threshold energy. As the confinement along the third direction is relaxed in a quasi-2D BEC, the threshold sound wave energy decreases due to the three-dimensional (3D) vortex line curve and reconnection, shifting the dynamical crossover to the early time. Our work reveals an elementary mechanism for the dissipation of vortex energy that may help understand exotic matter and dynamics in quantum liquids.},

The origin of spin squeezing is attributed to the interaction between the nuclear quadrupole moment and the electric-field gradients in the molecular environment. The formal description of the nonlinear operators responsible for spin squeezing is achieved using the spin angular momentum representation via the one-axis twisting mechanism. This approach provides a framework for quantum control and metrology over the spin squeezing process while accounting for the influence of relaxation phenomena. Non-Cartesian angular momentum operators are proposed, with their variance products catching the quantum effects during the dynamics. An upper bound for the squeezing parameter and the Heisenberg uncertainty at steady state are also predicted for any spin quantum number.},

The technique relies on optical pumping in Autler Townes configuration, whose efficiency is controlled by the presence or absence of a Rydberg excitation. Taking rubidium atoms as an example, we give realistic estimates for the achievable fidelities and parameters. However, our protocol can be transferred to any other atomic species that features multiple stable states.

The corresponding ab initio simulations reveal a characteristic “knee” in the ionization yield at lower field intensities than in comparable two-electron systems. To understand the origin of this shift, a quantitative semianalytic model for double ionization of a three-electron atom has been created. In this model, ionization is treated as a combination of different scenarios and channels. Each channel is simulated with either quantitative rescattering theory (QRS) or a two-electron ab initio model. Analysis of the semianalytical results indicates that the shifted part of the “knee” is dominated by a recollision-excitation channel in which the rescattering electron initially escapes the parent atom from an inner orbital. This counterintuitive phenomenon is then discussed and explained.},

This work incorporates dephasing effects in the theoretical simulations of HHG from topological insulators described by finite-size tight-binding models. This is done by formulating a density-matrix approach in both length and velocity gauges within dipole approximation, with a gauge-invariant treatment of dephasing properly introduced such that the HHG response of a sufficiently large solidlike system is consistent with the periodic limit obtained using semiconductor Bloch equations. Applying the approach to Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains reveals how dephasing affects the impact of topological edge states on the HHG spectra. It is found that dephasing can either weaken or strengthen the spectral contrast between the topological and trivial phases, depending on which of the intra- and interband mechanisms is dominant for a specific harmonic in the trivial phase.},

We consider the photoeffect in which the ejected photoelectron is described by a vortex scattering state and characterized by a definite projection of its angular momentum on a given vortex axis. Although the plane-wave and vortex transition matrix elements can be expressed in terms of each other, the corresponding cross sections cannot. We develop a theory of the molecular photoeffect with vortex photoelectrons, which includes the introduction and analysis of various vortex photoionization observables and their averaging over molecular orientations. The averaging is essential for treating photoionization of randomly oriented molecules in the gas phase. We show that the averaged vortex differential cross sections reveal new chiral asymmetries caused by the chirality of the vortex photoelectron, which generalize the phenomenon of photoelectron circular dichroism. The theory is illustrated by calculations for the glyceraldehyde molecule described within the molecular zero-range potential model. We also propose and validate by calculations a scheme based on a ring-shaped forked grating which allows, at least in principle, to verify our predictions experimentally.},

We find that the cutoff position of the harmonic spectrum emitted from the ring-current state is extended, but the harmonic efficiency is reduced in a chirped IR field compared with a chirp-free IR field. This harmonic broadening can be well understood by the semiclassical three-step model and the quantum time-frequency analysis. By introducing a UV field into the chirped IR field with a proper chirp parameter, both the efficiency and chirality of harmonic spectrum can be improved. Our analysis indicates that the generation of the elliptically polarized harmonics can be attributed to the asymmetric emission of ionized electrons in the y direction. By optimizing the laser parameters, an isolated 98-as pulse with an ellipticity up to 0.94 is obtained by the broadband elliptically polarized supercontinuum.

Recent experimental and theoretical progress has put metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunneling nanojunctions in the spotlight of ultrafast science. Waveform-controlled laser fields can induce ultrafast currents in these junctions, opening the door to petahertz electronic operation and attosecond-scale scanning tunneling microscopy. Inspired by our strong-field model for attosecond tunneling microscopy [B. Ma and M. Krüger, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133 , 236901 (2024) ], here we generalize our model to MIM nanojunctions. We introduce several refinements and corrections, accounting for the image potential inside the gap and boundary effects. Moreover, we also find that the Keldysh parameter, which is a hallmark parameter for ultrafast light-matter interactions, alone is insufficient for describing the physics in thin MIM nanojunctions. We introduce a new parameter that accounts for the effects of the limited size of the junction and provide several interpretations of the parameter that shed new light on the complex physics in the light-driven junction. Most strikingly, we find that for photon-assisted tunneling is dominating the ultrafast electron transport across the junction, regardless of the value of the Keldysh parameter. Here one or more photons are absorbed and the electron undergoes static tunneling through the barrier. is required for a regime in which the laser field and the Keldysh parameter dominate the transport. We also discuss the three-step model of electron transport across the nanojunction in the adiabatic regime, the energy cutoff of the transported electrons, and the carrier-envelope phase control of the net current. Our theory model provides a rich toolbox for understanding and predicting the physics of ultrafast MIM nanojunctions.},

  abstract     = {In the tunneling regime and at sufficiently low field amplitudes, the shape of orientation-dependent molecular ionization rate curves usually resembles the shape of the ionized orbital. As the ionizing field strength increases, the shape of the ionization rate can deviate from this pattern. The oft-cited explanation is that the increasing contribution of excited states relative to the ground state modifies the distribution. In this paper we show that orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, which are independent of excited-state effects, can also significantly modify the angular dependence of the yields of widely studied molecules where excited state effects are negligible. For example, as the ionizing field increases we find that (1) in CO, orbital distortion is responsible for the switch of the position of the global maximum in the orientation-dependent ionization rate to the opposite orientation, and (2) in , the interplay between orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transforms a local minimum to a local maximum. To simulate orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, we use the one-electron weak-field asymptotic theory including the first-order correction [OE-WFAT(1)] in the integral representation. Since OE-WFAT(1) incurs expensive computations when the number of orientation angles is large, we also reformulate the original OE-WFAT(1) algorithm into a partial-wave expansion form, which greatly enhances the efficiency of the method.},

The subsequent Larmor precession of the atomic magnetic moment is probed via continuous ionization by an optical dipole trap (ODT) laser. The resulting ionization fragments—photoelectrons and photoions—are detected in coincidence using a cold target recoil ion momentum spectrometer (COLTRIMS). While the ODT facilitates further cooling of the atoms, its continuous-wave laser field does not provide the pulsed timing reference typically required to extract photoelectron momentum distributions in COLTRIMS. Here, we present an extension of the standard COLTRIMS technique that exploits redundancies in the measured data to reconstruct the ionization time.

Spectroscopy of trapped atomic samples can greatly improve the accuracy of these tests. Trapping atomic hydrogen in an optical dipole trap or an optical lattice has never been achieved. Only trapping in magnetic fields that lead to large Zeeman shifts has been demonstrated. Standard techniques of atomic physics are difficult to apply to atomic hydrogen. The small mass of the atom and the large photon energy of the 1 S -2 P cooling transition significantly complicate Doppler cooling. This proposal introduces a photon recoil-assisted loading scheme that uses these properties to our advantage to load atomic hydrogen into an optical dipole trap without laser cooling. The magic wavelength (515 nm) for the 1 S -2 S clock transition (1.3-Hz natural linewidth) is easily accessible with current laser technology. Since the 1 S -2 S clock transition can be driven Doppler free, we do not require a very low temperature. Besides improving spectroscopy for fundamental science, such a system can also be used as a “computable” atomic clock that may one day justify the redefinition of the SI second in terms of the Rydberg constant.},

Commun. 15 , 5663 (2024) ]. To systematically investigate the structure properties of the ion, we employ the -spline-based many-body perturbation theory combined with the configuration-interaction method. We conducted comprehensive calculations of energies, matrix elements, and electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities. Furthermore, we determined the magic wavelengths and the sensitivity factor for variations in the fine-structure constant . Detailed comparisons with existing results demonstrate good agreement, validating the reliability of our method. Additionally, we derive a general formula to incorporate the contribution of negative-energy states to the magnetic dipole tensor polarizability, thereby elucidating their non-negligible impact on the calculation of high-accuracy magnetic polarizability.},

Various experimental schemes to generate high-energy vortex particles have been proposed. However, diagnosing the characteristics of vortex states at high energies remains a significant challenge, as traditional low-energy detection schemes become impractical for high-energy vortex particles due to their extremely short de Broglie wavelength. We recently proposed a novel experimental detection scheme based on a mechanism called superkick that is free from many drawbacks of the traditional methods and can reveal the vortex phase characteristics. In this paper, we present a complete theoretical framework for calculating the superkick effect in elastic Møller scattering and systematically investigate the impact of various factors on its visibility. In particular, we argue that the vortex phase can be identified either by detecting the two scattered electrons in coincidence or by analyzing the characteristic azimuthal asymmetry in individual final particles.},

We tabulate isotope shift coefficients for closed-shell systems from Ne to Og and benchmark selected open-shell cases, used to test the interpolation formula. A simple power-law interpolation reproduces calculated field shifts to within about 1% across the table, with the effective exponent growing from roughly 5 near to about 12 at . Due to the domination of inner shells, differences between neutrals and singly charged ions does not exceed a few percent, becoming noticeable mainly when an outer electron is removed.

To evaluate the role of electronic excitations, we compare these nonadiabatic results against two adiabatic approaches: Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics and ground-state energy profiling. We find that the incident point strongly affects the hydrogen atom's postcollision kinetic energy, scattering angle, and the vibrational response of the graphene lattice. Trajectories that avoid direct collisions with carbon atoms lead to longer interaction times and reduced energy transfer, increasing the likelihood of hydrogen adsorption by facilitating penetration of the graphene's potential energy barrier. Comparison with adiabatic methods reveals that electronic excitations and other non-adiabatic effects—captured by TDDFT—play a significant role in modulating energy loss and scattering direction. These results underscore the importance of including electron dynamics to accurately model hydrogen-graphene interactions and highlight how both geometric and energetic factors govern adsorption and scattering outcomes.},

Further, by combining our computed NSD-PNC transition amplitudes with a Cs experiment [C. S. Wood et al. , Science 275 , 1759 (1997) ], we extract the value of the nuclear anapole moment and pion-mediated meson-nucleon coupling constant f π . The deviation in our f π from the standard model value could be attributed to the existence of new particles such as Z ′ bosons. By combining our nuclear spin-independent PNC calculation with experiment [ Science 275 , 1759 (1997) ], we extract the mass of the Z ′ boson to be M Z ′ > 1.6 TeV/ c 2 . To check the accuracy of the wave functions used in the calculations, we compute the excitation energies, E 1 transition amplitudes, and magnetic dipole hyperfine constants for ground and low-lying excited states. To improve the accuracy of the computed properties, we incorporate the corrections from the relativistic and QED effects in our calculations. The contributions from triple excitations are accounted for perturbatively. Our results on excitation energies, E 1 transition amplitudes, and hyperfine constants are in good agreement with the available experimental results. Our polarizability results using the FSPRCC theory match well with the experimental values. The values of parity-violating transition amplitudes from our calculations are in general on the lower side of the previous values. From a detailed analysis of electron correlations, we find that the corrections from the Breit interaction and QED effects are important to get accurate results of NSD-PNC amplitudes in Cs. The largest cumulative contribution from the Breit and QED corrections is found to be approximately equal to 3.2% of the total value. The upper bound on the theoretical uncertainty in our calculated NSD-PNC amplitudes is estimated to be about 1%.},

This hyperfine van der Waals interaction occurs between two molecules in two rotational states that differ by one quantum. Normally, this induces resonant dipolar interactions that lead to rapid collisional loss. For specific hyperfine states, however, selection rules prevent this. One can effectively turn off the dipolar interaction by merely flipping a nuclear spin. The resulting van der Waals interaction can be repulsive and can suppress collisional loss. We focus on laser-coolable CaF, but show this effect occurs universally for open-shell molecules, including MgF, SrF, BaF and YO. We propose that this effect could be measured by merging molecules in optical tweezers, where flipping a spin in one of the tweezers enables tuning of collision rates by five orders of magnitude.},

This phenomenon holds even for H 2 + with short-range Coulomb potentials but disappears for atoms, different from that observed in attoclock experiments.

In this work the wave-packet convergent close-coupling method is extended to calculating these cross sections for electrons ejected with energies from 1 to 75.4 eV. The approach utilizes a two-center expansion and correlated two-electron helium wave functions to describe the four-body proton-helium system. While there is good agreement with the experiment for electrons ejected with energies near the matching-velocity point, elsewhere, the results overall do not support the picture provided by the available measurements.

By analyzing the correlation maps as a function of kinetic energy release and the angle between the conjugate momenta of the first and second breakup steps as well as the momentum correlation spectra of three fragment ions (Newton diagram) in these three channels, we separate two distinct sequential mechanisms involving proton emission in the first or second step of sequential fragmentation. Moreover, we determine the relative ratio of the two dissociation pathways for each channel. We find that proton emission in the first step of the sequential dissociation is the dominant process (94% branching ratio) for the channel involving the H migration of . It can be explained by the pyridine trication undergoing ultrafast hydrogen migration and forming a more stable -isomeric ion, which attenuates the ring-opening reactions.

While the quantum resources such as squeezing have been widely explored, light-matter interaction systems set up a highly controllable platform applicable for QM in novel pursuit of high MP. However, critical QM by the conventional linear interaction is confronted with the limitation of a local parameter regime, restriction of a low-frequency-limit condition, and the detrimental problem of diverging preparation time of probe state (PTPS). This work shows that mixed interactions by linear and nonlinear light-matter couplings in the presence of bias field can provide various quantum resources, including squeezing, degeneracy lifting, displacement, and quantum phase transition. These resources manifest high sensitivity for QM as demonstrated by analytically obtained critical exponents or exponential behavior of quantum Fisher information. We find that these sensitivity resources can be combined to upgrade the upper bound of MP by many orders over the widely applied squeezing resource. As further advantages in contrast to the linear critical QM, such an upgraded metrology protocol can have a global parameter regime, break the frequency-limit restriction, and avoid the diverging PTPS. Our work paves a way to exploit and combine all the resources in momentum, position, and spin spaces to maximize the MP and expand the applicable conditions simultaneously.},

Here, we propose a general remote quantum state preparation scheme based on an asymmetric maximally entangled state, where only single-particle operations are needed at the local node to prepare arbitrary multiqubit states at the remote site. We demonstrate this scheme experimentally on a linear optical platform, using a three-photon asymmetric entangled state as a resource. By applying single-particle operations on a four-dimensional photonic ququart, we remotely prepare arbitrary two-qubit states with fidelities ranging from 0.8534 to 0.9444, all surpassing the classical threshold. This approach simplifies local control requirements and offers a scalable route for remote entanglement generation in quantum networks and distributed quantum computing.},

In this article, we propose a variational strategy based on symmetry-preserving cost functions to iteratively construct a reduced subspace for the extraction of low-lying energy states. We show that, under certain conditions, our approach leads to a tridiagonal representation similar to that obtained with the Lanczos algorithm. The iterative process allows control over the trade-off between circuit depth, the number of variational parameters, and the number of measurements required to achieve the desired accuracy, making it suitable for current quantum hardware. As a proof of concept, we test the proposed algorithms on a H 4 chain and ring, targeting both the ground-state energy and the charge gap.},

We employ multichannel message-passing neural networks, with each channel tailored to address a specific error type. Our neural-network model is trained to minimize the weighted sum of different errors, based on frequency-dependent error models, e.g., two-level-system defects that affect individual qubits, quantum crosstalk that depends on the graph structure formed by qubit couplings, and microwave crosstalk that relies on the spatial arrangement of qubits. The trained neural-network model is adaptable to chips with varying qubit arrangements and scales. Recognizing the diverse experimental conditions of different chips, we compare our algorithm with the snake algorithm across various scales and error weights, providing valuable guidance for experimenters in algorithm selection.

  abstract     = {Ultracold polar molecules trapped in optical lattices or tweezer arrays are an emerging platform for quantum information processing and quantum simulation, thanks to their rich internal structure and long-range dipolar interactions. Recent experimental breakthroughs have enabled precise control over individual molecules, paving the way for implementing two-qubit quantum gates, based on the iSWAP gate. A key challenge is, however, the sensitivity to variations of the dipole-dipole interaction strength—stemming from motion of the molecules and uncertainty on the precise positioning of external confining potentials—that limits current gate fidelities. To address this, we develop a quantum optimal control framework, based on a perturbative approach, to design gates that are robust with respect to quasistatic deviations of either system Hamiltonian parameters, external control parameters, or both, and provide criteria to evaluate a priori whether a gate can be made robust for a given control Hamiltonian. By applying these criteria to exchange-coupled qubits, as polar molecules, we demonstrate that robustness cannot be achieved with global controls only, but can be attained by breaking the exchange symmetry through local controls, such as a local detuning. We determine the robust time-optimal solution for realizing an iSWAP gate, show that the control pulses can be designed to be smooth functions, and achieve theoretical gate fidelities compatible with error correction using reasonable experimental parameters. Additionally, we show that certain entangled-state preparations, such as Bell states, can be made robust even with global controls only. We demonstrate that, under the adiabatic approximation, i.e., where molecular motion occurs on timescales comparable to, or faster, than that of the exchange interaction, the noise arising from thermal motion can be effectively treated as quasistatic variations of Hamiltonian parameters. This allows us to extend our treatment to the concrete experimental case of polar molecules.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multilevel qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in nonlocal operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the nonlocality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. Notably, for superconducting devices, the control complexity of qudits compared to qubits does not increase prohibitively for four-level systems, making them practical for near-term demonstrations, though control challenges grow with increasing dimensionality. Therefore, we provide solutions to the operator decompositions of the Trotterized quantum dynamics into one- and two-qudit gates for all mappings. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t − V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Finally, we show the connection between the plaquette constraint of our mapping and the Z 2 toric code. This connection can be exploited to prove that the ground state of the localized qudit mapping can be efficiently prepared using quantum circuits or measurement-based feedback control. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.},

  abstract     = {While the adiabatic exchange of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) enables a nonuniversal set of geometrically protected gates, realizing an experimental implementation of MZM braiding remains challenging. In an alternative proposal, charge-parity measurement of two neighboring MZMs supports braiding by teleportation. Moreover, owing to the lack of definitive evidence of MZMs in semiconducting systems, there have been several simulations of MZMs on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices which more naturally lend themselves to braiding. In this work, measurement-based braiding about MZM Y junctions is simulated by multiqubit parity measurements of a logical qubit. Logical single-qubit geometric S ( † ) and entangling two-qubit braiding operations are shown using two-physical-qubit joint measurements alone, while T ( † ) gates corresponding to a kind of partial-braiding operation require at least one three-qubit joint measurement. These relatively small-scale circuits demonstrate potential applications of both measurement-based geometric gates and a measurement-based demonstration of quantum Hamiltonian simulation.},

Compared with quantum metrology with entangled states of multiple qubits, bosonic interferometers have the advantage of being hardware efficient, enabled by the infinite-dimension Hilbert space of bosonic modes. Phase estimations with precisions approaching the Heisenberg limit have been demonstrated with superpositions of Fock states of single bosonic modes. We here present a scheme for realizing quantum metrology based on a fundamentally distinct kind of superposition states, Schrödinger cat states, defined as quantum superpositions of two quasiclassial states of a bosonic mode. The interferometer aims to estimate the frequency shift of a photonic mode with respect to a reference frequency, which produces a phase-space rotation. We find that such a phase-space rotation can be extracted with a qubit, without mapping the state of the photonic mode to the qubit. This phase-space rotation is directly related to the qubit's population through the combination of a phase-space displacement, a dispersive qubit-photon interaction, and two qubit rotations. The signal-to-noise ratio exhibits a scaling approaching the Heisenberg limit, like interferometers based on Fock state superpositions, but without requiring a step-by-step procedure to prepare the resource state.},

However, scalable quantum processors remain limited by the challenge of achieving strong, controllable interactions between distant NV spins. Here, we propose a scalable architecture utilizing optically levitated nanodiamond arrays, where torsional vibrations mediate the coherent coupling between the embedded NV centers. By optimizing the shape of ellipsoidal nanoparticles, we achieve a light-induced coupling strength exceeding 119 kHz between torsional modes of the distant levitated nanodiamonds, which are two orders of magnitude larger than the typical decoherence rates in this system. This strong interaction, combined with magnetic-field-enabled spin-torsion coupling, establishes an effective interaction between the spatially separated NV centers in the distant nanodiamonds. Numerical simulations confirm that dynamic decoupling can suppress both thermal noise and spin dephasing, enabling two-qubit gates with fidelity exceeding 99%.

Owing to the rapid growth of quantum correlations following a quench, classical methods face significant challenges even if an efficient description of the equilibrium state is available. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative. However, existing approaches often assume access to the equilibrium state, which may be difficult to prepare in practice. In this work, we present a method that circumvents this by using energy filter techniques, enabling the computation of response functions and other dynamical properties in both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. Our approach only requires the preparation of states that have significant weight at the desired energy. The dynamical response functions are then reconstructed from measurements after quenches of varying duration by classical postprocessing. We illustrate the algorithm numerically by applying it to compute the dynamical conductivity of a free-fermion model, which unveils the energy-dependent localization properties of the model.},

We give a comparative analysis of two primary stellar interferometric schemes: amplitude interferometry and intensity interferometry. Notably, the nulling strategy employed in amplitude interferometry, a configuration specifically proposed for exoplanet detection by leveraging destructive interference to suppress the brighter source, is quantum optimal for separation estimation. While intensity interferometry is less effective than amplitude interferometry in lossless scenarios and fails to achieve superresolution, it becomes competitive when optical loss in large-scale interferometry is considered. By applying these methodologies to modern stellar interferometry, we highlight the promise of large-scale interferometry for advancing high-resolution astronomical observation.},

  abstract     = {Quantum error mitigation (QEM) schemes have greatly enhanced the performance of quantum computers, mostly by reducing errors caused by interactions with the environment. Nevertheless, the presence of coherence errors, typically arising from miscalibration and interqubit crosstalk, is a significant challenge to the scalability of quantum computing. Such errors are often addressed using a refined Pauli twirling scheme called randomized compiling (RC) that converts the coherent errors into incoherent errors that can then be mitigated by conventional QEM. Unfortunately for multiqubit gates, RC is restricted to Clifford gates such as cnot and cphase . However, it has been demonstrated experimentally that a direct implementation of multiqubit non-Clifford gates, i.e., without using multiqubit Clifford gates, has reduced the depth of the circuit by a factor of four and more. Recently, a framework called pseudotwirling (PST) for treating coherent error in multiqubit non-Clifford gates has been introduced and experimentally demonstrated. We show analytically that a higher-order correction to the existing PST theory yields an over-rotation coherent error generated by the PST protocol itself. This PST effect has no analog in RC. Although the small induced over-rotation can amount to a significant coherent error in deep circuits, we explain why it does not degrade the performance of the gate. Interestingly, we find that a simplified twirling scheme that was introduced and exploited experimentally by Kim et al . also displays an induced over-rotation. We study the conditions under which the two twirling schemes display the same over-rotation behavior.},

Here, we demonstrate that the answer is 1 if the number of logical qubits is even, and 2 otherwise. Furthermore, we present a sufficient condition for a given parity gate set to be universal. This leads to a variety of different universal parity gate sets corresponding to different numbers of auxiliary qubits and more generally contributes to the understanding of which entangling gates are required to augment the set of single-qubit unitaries to perform universal quantum computing. As a consequence, we obtain (i) minimal implementations of the parity framework on, e.g., a triangular lattice, (ii) hardware-specific implementations of the parity flow framework on, e.g., a heavy-hex lattice, and (iii) novel universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation.},

Under the biorthogonal condition, the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian could be triangularized in a constraint picture spanned by a set of completed and orthonormal basis states, which is found to be a sufficient condition to construct at least one universal nonadiabatic passage in both bra and ket spaces. The passage ends up with a desired target state that is automatically normalized without artificial normalization in the existing treatments for non-Hermitian quantum systems. Moreover, the passage is found to be robust against the parametric deviation when the real part of its global phase is rapidly varying with time. Our protocol is explicitly verified for the perfect population transfer in the two-level system and the chiral population transfer in the three-level system. It generalizes our framework of universal quantum control to the field of the biorthogonal quantum mechanics.},

  abstract     = {Blind quantum computation (BQC) provides a secure framework for clients to delegate quantum computations to servers without revealing their private information. Among BQC protocols, those built on iterated gate teleportation (IGTBQC) have demonstrated promising potential in overcoming the constraints imposed by the no-programming theorem and significantly reducing communication overhead. However, existing IGTBQC protocols lack mechanisms for clients to verify the correctness of computation results and deal with only one type of clients capable of preparing qubits. To address these limitations, we first extend the current IGTBQC protocol to be a verifiable one and then propose another verifiable IGTBQC protocol tailored for a different type of clients with the capability of measuring single-qubit states. Furthermore, both protocols are shown to satisfy blindness and verification simultaneously in a relatively formal way. Our results not only broaden the applicability to a wider range of clients but also enhance the practicality of delegated quantum computation.},

This multipath entanglement purification (MP-EP) strategy can exploit the network's complex structure to strengthen the entanglement connection between node pairs separated by appropriate graph distances. We investigate the network scenarios in which MP-EP outperforms entanglement distribution over single network paths utilizing a statistical model of a quantum network and find that MP-EP can be an effective entanglement distribution strategy over a range of node separations determined by the average edge fidelities and probabilities of the network. We find that MP-EP can boost the entanglement connection between suitably separated node pairs to reach fidelities sufficient for a given quantum task thereby increasing the functionality of a quantum network. Further, we provide statistical criteria for the feasibility of MP-EP in terms of network parameters that can determine the regions of the network where MP-EP can be a useful entanglement distribution strategy.},

In this work, we introduce a generalized nonclassicality quantifier based on metric-adjusted skew information, which aims to characterize the intrinsic nonclassical features of bosonic field states. The proposed nonclassicality quantifier is formally defined as the maximum metric-adjusted skew information between a quantum state and the homodyne rotated quadrature operator, which can effectively reflect the phase-dependent characteristics of the light field and is therefore suitable for capturing nonclassical effects. Notably, our findings reveal that coherent states exhibit a distinct threshold behavior, enabling a precise distinction between classical and nonclassical regimes. Furthermore, through rigorous analysis and comparative evaluation across a set of representative quantum states, we demonstrate that the quantifier not only captures essential nonclassical merits, but also detects entanglement by identifying violations of the additivity property that holds for separable states. As a result, this framework establishes a unified and mathematically rigorous approach for quantifying nonclassicality in both separable and entangled systems, thereby contributing valuable insights to the advancement of quantum resource theories.},

  abstract     = {Quantum network states are multipartite states built from distributing pairwise entanglement among parties and underpin the paradigm of quantum networks for quantum information processing. In this work we introduce the problem of partial distillability in noisy quantum networks. This corresponds to the possibility of distilling by local operations and classical communication an arbitrary pure state for an arbitrary subset of parties starting from a single copy of a quantum network state of an increasing number of parties that share noisy (i.e., mixed) bipartite entangled states. Here, distillation means that the target state is obtained with fidelity as close to 1 as desired, as the size of the network increases when the pairwise entangled links support a constant amount of noise. While we prove an obstruction to multipartite distillation protocols after teleportation with channels with constant noise, we show that partial distillability is indeed possible if certain well-established graph-theoretic parameters that measure the connectivity in the network grow fast enough with its size. We give necessary as well as sufficient conditions for partial distillability in terms of these parameters and we, moreover, provide explicit constructions of networks with partial distillability and a relatively slow connectivity growth.},

We demonstrate that environmental interactions induce entanglement sudden death (ESD), leading to the abrupt loss of quantum correlations. To mitigate this effect, we propose a protocol involving local unitary operations—X gate and XX gate —applied to the time-evolved state. We further analyze the impact of these operations under symmetric and asymmetric probability amplitudes of the atomic states, considering variations in thermal and squeezing parameters across different reservoirs. Our results show that these operations extend entanglement duration in specific reservoir conditions, while in the case of a vacuum reservoir, they transform ESD into asymptotic decay for both symmetric and asymmetric probability amplitudes of the atomic states. Moreover, independent variations of the thermal and squeezing parameters in each reservoir influence the dynamics of local gate operations, thereby affecting the overall entanglement evolution. Additionally, applying these operations at an earlier stage of the system's evolution can further delay ESD. This scheme offers valuable insights into entanglement behavior and its resilience under various noisy environmental conditions.},

When the underlying quantum information exhibits hierarchical structures in the data, limitations persist in training complexity and generalization.

We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning (Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or data to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. Q-CurL exhibits robustness to noise and data limitations, which is particularly relevant for current and near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We achieve this through a curriculum design based on quantum data density ratios and a dynamic learning schedule that prioritizes the most informative quantum data. Empirical evidence shows that Q-CurL significantly enhances training convergence and generalization for unitary learning and improves the robustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Q-CurL is effective with physical learning applications in physics and quantum chemistry.},

The GME can be nonmultiplicative, meaning that the closest product state to two states is entangled across subsystems. In this work, we explore the GME in two families of states: those that are invariant under bilateral orthogonal transformations, and mixtures of singlet states. In both cases, a region of GME nonmultiplicativity is identified around the antisymmetric projector state. We employ state-of-the-art numerical optimization methods and models to quantitatively analyze nonmultiplicativity in these states for . We also investigate a constrained form of GME that measures closeness to the set of real product states and show that this measure can be nonmultiplicative even for real separable states.},

We demonstrated that specific network transformations correspond to quantum gates, underscoring the potential of classical many-body systems as platforms for quantum-inspired information processing. In this paper we extend this framework by systematically identifying the classical dynamics best suited for this purpose. Specifically, we address the following question: Can the collective steady state of a classical network encode signatures of quantum information? We prove that the answer is affirmative for a special class of synchronizing many-body systems, namely, a complex-field extension of the Kuramoto model of nonlinearly coupled classical oscillators. Through this approach, we investigate how quantumlike entangled states can emerge from classical synchronization dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The average energy and energy spread of a quantum system are two important factors that affect a system's evolution speed, which is usually defined as the changing rate of the distance between a quantum state and the state during its evolution. Alternatively, the evolution speed of a quantum system could also be studied based on its evolution path. It is found that if we define the evolution speed of a quantum unitary system as the changing rate of the path distance between a quantum state and the state during its evolution, the instantaneous evolution speed is determined by the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues, rather than its expectation value or variance imposed on any quantum state. More specifically, the range of the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues determines the evolution speed of a quantum system through the relation ω H = 1 2 ( λ max − λ min ) , which is independent of the quantum state. Given an initial state ρ 0 in a quantum unitary system, the minimum time required to evolve it to a target state ρ τ is τ min = L min ( ρ 0 , ρ τ ) ω H , where L min ( ρ 0 , ρ τ ) is the path distance contained in the shortest evolution from ρ 0 to ρ τ . This lower bound of the evolution time is tight and achievable in a finite-energy system.},

It works by exponentially suppressing the high-frequency components in the Fourier expansion of the quantum loss function. The protocol can be efficiently implemented in both hardware and simulations. We observe significant and robust improvements of solution quality across various problem types.

Its key element is the construction of two parallel evolution paths by the measurement that can transform the probe system (a spin ensemble) from an eigenstate of a collective angular momentum operator | 𝑗 , 𝑚 ⟩ to a superposed state ( | 𝑗 , 𝑚 ⟩ + | 𝑗 , − 𝑚 ⟩ ) / ⁢ √ 2 . With synchronous parametric encoding and qubit measurement, the quantum Fisher information about the phase encoded in the probe system with optimized initial states can exactly attain the Heisenberg scaling 𝑁 2 with respect to the probe size (spin number) 𝑁 . The quadratic scaling behavior is not sensitive to the imprecise control over the joint evolution time, the time delay between encoding and measurement, and the coherence in the probe ensemble or the ancillary system that would be degraded by local dephasing. The classical Fisher information of the spin ensemble is found to saturate with its quantum counterpart, irrespective of the idle joint evolution after the parametric encoding. We suggest that both Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states and nonlinear Hamiltonian are not necessary resources for exceeding the standard quantum limit in metrology precision since in our protocol even thermal states can hold an asymptotic quadratic scaling.},

In this work, a protocol for quantum noise spectroscopy is presented by qudit spectators, that are arbitrary -level quantum systems passively spectating noises, which possess stochastic and stationary Gaussian distributions. The protocol uses Weyl basis decomposition, consisting of generalized Pauli matrices, as the theoretical tool, and the Alvarez-Suter noise spectroscopy method, by which the qudit is being exposed to a series of pulse sequences, and the noise polyspectra is extracted by multiple measurements of an observable of the qudit. The formalism is further developed and simulated for three theoretical frameworks: The first two frameworks utilize a simplified Weyl basis and are capable of detecting -type dephasing noise. One is specifically modeled for a qutrit ( = 3), and the second framework is designed for all qudits and has been tested through simulations of a ququad ( = 4) and a quoct ( = 8). The third framework employs the full Weyl basis, enabling it to identify all types of XYZ -dephasing noise. The simulations for this framework have been conducted for a quoct ( = 8) implemented by the antimony atom.

However, existing methods, including the Gram-Schmidt process, have problems of high complexity, scaling in the system dimension , which leads to difficulties when calculating large-scale or ill-conditioned problems. With the development of quantum information processing, a series of quantum algorithms have been proposed, providing advantages and speedups over classical algorithms in many fields. In this paper we propose quantum algorithms to solve these two problems based on the idea of the Gram-Schmidt process and quantum phase estimation. The complexity of proposed quantum algorithms is theoretically and numerically analyzed. We find that our algorithms provide polynomial acceleration over the best-known quantum algorithms and a potential polynomial acceleration over the best-known classical algorithms on these two problems, scaling in the dimension of the system when ignoring the complexity of state readout or when considering the complexity of state readout.},

  abstract     = {Mitigation of quantum errors is critical for current NISQ devices. In the present work, we address this task by treating the execution of quantum algorithms as the time evolution of an idealized physical system. We use knowledge of its physics to assist the mitigation of the quantum noise produced on the real device. In particular, the time evolution of the idealized system obeys a corresponding Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy of equations. This is the basis for the novel error mitigation scheme that we propose. Specifically, we employ a subset of the BBGKY hierarchy as supplementary constraints in the zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) method for error mitigation. We ensure that the computational cost of the scheme scales polynomially with the system size. We test our method on digital quantum simulations of the lattice Schwinger model under noise levels mimicking realistic quantum hardware. We demonstrate that our scheme systematically improves the error mitigation for the measurements of the particle number and the charge within this system. Relative to ZNE, we obtain an average reduction of the error by ( 18.2 ± 0.5 ) % and ( 52.8 ± 6.3 ) % for the respective above observables. We propose further applications of the BBGKY hierarchy for quantum error mitigation.},

We propose here a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. We find that the unit effectively removes leakage with minimal effect on the qubit subspace by taking advantage of energy level disorder for the qubit subspace and resonant leakage energy levels. There are two optimal measurement rates for removing leakage, which we show analytically to correspond to the characteristic timescales of the propagation and disintegration of the leakage excitation. The performance of the leakage removal unit depends on the strength of disorder, coupling between the transmons, and the length of the array. We simulate the system under experimentally feasible parameters and present an optimal configuration. Our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processors, considering realistic conditions.},

  abstract     = {With rapid advances in quantum hardware, a central question is whether quantum devices with or without full error correction can outperform classical computers on practically relevant problems. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have gained significant attention as promising candidates in this pursuit, particularly for combinatorial optimization problems. While reports of their challenges and limitations continue to accumulate, many studies remain optimistic based on small-scale, idealized testing setups, leaving doubt about the scalability of VQAs for large-scale problems. We systematically investigate this scaling behavior by analyzing how classical optimizers minimize variational quantum loss functions for random Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization instances in the presence of uncertainty, modeled as effective Gaussian noise. We find that the critical noise threshold for successful optimization decreases rapidly as system size grows. This decline exceeds what can be explained solely by shrinking loss variance, confirming deeper, fundamental limitations in the loss landscapes of VQAs beyond barren plateaus. Translating these thresholds into required measurement shots reveals that achieving sufficient precision in the evaluated loss values quickly becomes impractical, even for moderatelysized problems. Our findings demonstrate serious scalability challenges for VQAs in optimization stemming from mere uncertainty, indicating potential barriers to achieving practical quantum advantage with current hybrid approaches.},

  abstract     = {In quantum resource theory, one is often interested in identifying which states serve as the best resources for particular quantum tasks. If a relative comparison between quantum states can be made, this gives rise to a partial order, where states are ordered according to their suitability to act as a resource. In the literature, various different partial orders for a variety of quantum resources have been proposed. In discrete variable systems, vector majorization of Wigner functions in discrete phase space provides a natural partial order between quantum states. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) by Van Herstraeten et al. [ Quantum 7 , 1021 (2023) ]. In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general N -mode case. In addition, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. For the special case of the convex hull of N -mode Gaussian states, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, and Cerf. We also prove a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization.},

This enables us to self-test both the -partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and the local anticommuting observables (up to local unitaries and complex conjugation).

Coordinated with dynamical decoupling, geometric quantum computation admits additional resilience to the environment-induced decoherence. However, the previous schemes of geometric quantum computation protected by dynamical decoupling require multiple physical qubits to encode a logical qubit, which undoubtedly increases the consumption of physical-qubit resources and the difficulty in the implementation of the logical-qubit manipulation based on physical-qubit driving. In this work, we put forward a scheme of decoherence-mitigated geometric quantum computation based only on physical qubits rather than logical qubits, hence avoiding the additional overhead of physical-qubit resources for logical-qubit encoding as well as the difficulty in the manipulation of logical qubits. Moreover, our scheme focuses on the most general interaction between an individual qubit and its environment so that it mitigates not just dephasing noise but rather regular decoherence. Our proposal thus represents a more realistic and effective approach towards the realization of geometric control with decoherence mitigation.},

Here we extend the concept of quantum nondemolition interaction to the cases in which the signal and the probe systems are each one multipartite continuous-variable system. Specifically, we propose a general scheme that performs the multipartite QND interactions, relying on beam-splitter couplings between the signal and probe modes with only two ancillary modes prepared offline in squeezed states. The scheme is also composed of homodyne detection and feedforward modulation. The ancillary modes are detected in the process, providing photocurrents for postmodulation of the output systems, as well as sufficient information to calculate genuine multipartite entanglement conditions of the input systems and to monitor similar conditions of the output systems.},

However, compared to the standard Bell scenario, manifestation of the interplay between these two aspects has received less attention in network scenarios featuring independent sources. In this work we have analyzed the relation between entanglement content of the sources and detectable non- -locality in two distinct network topologies (linear and star). We have studied the extremal violations of -local inequalities (compatible with linear and star network) for any fixed amount of entanglement (in terms of concurrence) of the independent sources. It is observed that each of the sources must be entangled for detecting non- -locality in a linear network. However, the same is not true for star -local network. The present analysis reveals that entanglement of all the independent sources is not a necessity for generation of non- -local correlations in star topology. Characterization of sources in terms of the minimum entanglement requirement for any fixed violation amount of the -local inequalities is also provided. Interestingly, detection of non- -locality is ensured in the network if product of concurrence of all the sources involved exceeds},

We propose parameter optimization strategies to maximize the efficiency of the heat engine, as there are multiple ways for the effective coupling constant to move toward its critical point. In the normal phase, enhancing the temperature ratio of hot-to-cold reservoirs and spin-mode coupling strength can boost QHE efficiency, while increasing the spin-spin coupling strength will reduce the efficiency. In the superradiant phase, when the temperature ratio is held constant, lowering the cold reservoir temperature moves the efficiency closer to the Carnot limit. Furthermore, when the cold reservoir temperature is fixed, increasing the ratio between spin-mode coupling and mode frequency will improve the efficiency. While the spin-spin coupling is fixed, the cycle with a higher-temperature ratio between the hot and cold reservoirs demands a higher ratio between the spin-mode coupling and mode frequency to improve efficiency.

  abstract     = {The computation of tunneling splitting in physical systems, such as molecular systems, qubits, and more, is still quite challenging because of its very small magnitude, as compared with the typical vibrational spacing between doublet levels. Thus, it is important to understand and develop methods that can reproduce the physics of the tunneling splitting in a simple and direct way. Herring's formula is probably the most popular expression in this sense. To shed light on the implications of this formula, which was first proposed by Herring [C. Herring, Rev. Mod. Phys. 34 , 631 (1962) ], we investigate the connection between the two-state approximation, as employed for nonadiabatic-induced tunneling splitting, and the Herring formula, which is relevant to adiabatic tunneling splitting. We show that the two-state approximation and the Herring formula, which may be derived as a weak value of the flux operator and is a derivative result, are identical for a symmetric double well potential. This unveils the physics underlying Herring's formula and provides further justification for the two-state approximation for the nonadiabatic tunneling splitting estimate. We conclude that, when Herring's formula is used with approximate eigenfunctions, it will not be accurate when the two-state approximation is not valid, i.e., when the energy splitting is comparable to the eigenenergy spacing. More generally, Herring's formula will fail when the two-state approximation fails. We also show how the identity between the integral two-state approximation form and Herring's formula may be used to obtain analytic expressions for some nontrivial integrals.},

To solve this problem, we consider the exact WKB approach, which is a mathematical method that treats perturbative expansion with respect to the Planck constant as a rigorous singular perturbation. This method is also a powerful computational tool that makes analytical computation much easier for mathematical software. Using the exact WKB, we analyze the derivation of the dynamical and the geometric exponents in generalized Landau-Zener models, highlighting the differences from other calculational methods. The discontinuity of complex geometric factor is a universal phenomenon that manifests itself in phase transitions, boundaries, particle generation, and topology changes. These phenomena are “nonperturbative” in physics, while mathematically, these discontinuities can be deeply related to the singular structure of complex analysis. The mathematical structure of these phenomena will be revealed by using the exact WKB.},

  abstract     = {The fact that, in the course of open evolution, the creation of system-environment entanglement out of the initial coherence occurs in the vast majority of cases has been known for many years. However, how much entanglement can be created under general assumptions has not been analyzed yet. In this work, we investigate system-environment entanglement generation under a broad and important class of interactions known as pure-dephasing interactions for arbitrary initial conditions. Our main results are the following bounds on the relative entropy of entanglement after evolution: , connecting it on one side to the initial relative entropy of coherence and information extractable from the environment and on the other side to the decoherence strength, making the statement that larger entanglement leads to more decoherence quantitatively precise. As an illustration, we apply our results to the spin-boson model, where a qubit interacts with a bosonic bath, showing the time evolution of the entanglement and the crossover between Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Our results help us better understand and quantify the complicated correlations produced during open evolution, which will hopefully lead to better and new decoherence-mitigation techniques.},

  abstract     = {To characterize the aging process of quantum devices, the concept of quantum reliability has recently been proposed as a process-based metric that quantifies the duration during which operations remain unaffected by noise. This duration is referred to as the lifetime of a quantum system. In this paper, we investigate the lifetime of a two-level atomic system undergoing spontaneous emission. We construct an exact statistical ensemble of the lifetimes for two-level systems using quantum reliability theory, incorporating comprehensive information such as mean values, fluctuations, and non-classical properties. Notably, we demonstrate that the ensemble exhibits can be represented by a density matrix, which is recorded in the monitoring apparatus by an observation process. Under the Born-Markov approximation, the diagonal elements decay exponentially at a state-dependent rate related to quantum fidelity. Beyond this approximation, the off-diagonal elements arise from interference between radiation pathways and are determined by the first-order coherence of the field. This feature indicates that the off-diagonal elements encode spectral information beyond the Markovian decay rate, suggesting a potential protocol for probing the environmental spectral density using two-level atoms.},

We demonstrate a novel class of hybrid skin-defect states in finite-size systems resulting from the coupling between the skin and defect states. Next, we consider a single defect in a topologically nontrivial lattice with time-reversal symmetry based on the nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger configuration. We unveil how topologically nontrivial defect states and non-Hermiticity interplay by competing with each other, exhibiting a transition from topologically nontrivial defect states to skin states. In addition, we show that decreasing the defect strength can result in a transition from trivial defect states to skin states. Our work promotes the understanding of the interplay between defects and the NHSE and especially the importance of the energy spectra of the system with the defect under periodic boundary conditions.},

  abstract     = {We generalize a space-time-symmetric (STS) extension of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics (QM) to describe a particle moving in three spatial dimensions. In addition to the conventional time-conditional (Schrödinger) wave function ψ ( x , y , z | t ) , we introduce space-conditional wave functions such as ϕ ( t , y , z | x ) , where x plays the role of the evolution parameter. The function ϕ ( t , y , z | x ) represents the probability amplitude for the particle to arrive on the plane x = constant at time t and transverse position ( y , z ) . More generally, within our framework, any coordinate x μ ∈ { t , x , y , z } can be conveniently chosen as the evolution parameter, depending on the experimental context. This leads to a unified formalism governed by a generalized Schrödinger-type equation P ̂ μ | ϕ μ ( x μ ) 〉 = i ℏ η μ ν d d x ν | ϕ μ ( x μ ) 〉 . It reproduces standard QM when x μ = t , with | ϕ 0 ( x 0 ) 〉 = | ψ ( t ) 〉 , and recovers the STS extension when x μ = x i ∈ { x , y , z } . For a free particle, we show that ϕ ( t , y , z | x ) = 〈 t , y , z | ϕ ( x ) 〉 naturally reproduces the same dependence on the momentum wave function as the axiomatic Kijowski distribution. Possible experimental tests of these predictions are discussed. Finally, we demonstrate that the different states | ϕ μ ( x μ ) 〉 can emerge by conditioning (i.e., projecting) a timeless and spaceless physical state onto the eigenstate | x μ 〉 , leading to constraint equations of the form P ̂ μ | Φ μ 〉 = 0 . Rather than privileging time as the sole evolution parameter, this formulation treats all coordinates on equal footing.},

A significant challenge in this field is to verify whether a quantum state prepared by quantum devices in the laboratory accurately matches the desired target pure state. Recent advancements in randomized measurement techniques have provided fresh insights in this area. Specifically, protocols such as classical shadow tomography and shadow overlap have been proposed. Building on these developments, we investigate the fundamental properties of schemes that certify pure quantum states through random local Haar measurements. We derive bounds for sample fluctuations that are applicable regardless of the specific estimator construction. These bounds depend on the operator size distribution of either the observable used to estimate fidelity or the valid variation of the reduced density matrix for arbitrary observables. Our results unveil the intrinsic interplay between operator complexity and the efficiency of quantum algorithms, serving as an obstacle to local certification of pure states with long-range entanglement.},

The resulting spin precession dynamics induced by the gauge potential are analyzed with and without the adiabatic approximation. Under this approximation, the surface topology is linked to the rotation angle of spin orientation along a surface boundary and to the pseudomagnetic flux. Spin texture evolution along helices illustrates distinct behaviors under geodesic versus nongeodesic propagation. Furthermore, the spin evolution along Viviani's curve exemplifies surface dependence. The curve's topology ensures closure of the spin direction and independence of the spin from the path direction. Our theory establishes a framework for spin-state manipulation via engineered nanostructured channels, enabling topological quantum control strategies.},

By introducing nonreciprocity through asymmetric couplings to the shared field, we demonstrate that quantum coherence can be revived from fully decohered states. This revival signals a transition from a time-translational symmetric phase to a spontaneously time-translation symmetry-broken phase, realizing a continuous time crystal. Remarkably, steady-state entanglement emerges even in regions where macroscopic coherence is absent, underscoring the nontrivial impact of engineered dissipation. The phase transitions are characterized using numerical simulations of the full quantum master equation, mean-field analysis in the thermodynamic limit, and Liouvillian spectral properties.

Here we introduce a class of prethermal DTCs termed “unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals” (UPDTCs) that arise without any uniform or staggered polarization and propose an experiment to observe them in current trapped-ion quantum simulators. By studying a model of trapped ions using a quantum circuit simulator, we demonstrate that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization, even though its expectation value does not exhibit such dynamics. The period-doubled dynamics is not explained by the classical picture of flipping spins but by quantum fluctuations. We establish that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, a hallmark of prethermalization. These results expand the known phenomenology and mechanism of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases.},

Building on this foundation, our research proposes an all-optical scheme to realize the ergotropic Mpemba effect in open quantum systems, and further investigates its implications in systems exhibiting non-Markovian dynamics. We find that the ergotropic Mpemba effect persists in non-Markovian dynamics. In the strong non-Markovian regime, prior to the occurrence of the ergotropic Mpemba effect, the ergotropy evolution shows multiple crossings, which we refer to as the quasiergotropic Mpemba effect . Moreover, we derive the analytical solution for the critical point at which the ergotropic Mpemba effect occurs, and we establish the necessary conditions for this effect to emerge.

  abstract     = {We analyze and generalize a construction method of Kochen-Specker (KS) sets given by Waegell and Aravind. In this method the bases that participate in a KS set are formed by modifying a seed basis using a vector space of shifts. We show that any real or generalized Hadamard matrix can be used as the seed basis, and that the space of shifts can be much smaller than originally proposed. Main benefits of these generalizations are a vastly extended set of available seed matrices, and significantly smaller KS sets produced. Analytical constructions of infinite families of Hadamard matrices combined with our generalized approach allow us to construct an infinite family of KS sets.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a stable charging scheme mediated by a three-level system (qutrit), which renders a unidirectional energy flow from an external power source to an ( )-dimensional quantum battery. By virtue of the qutrit dissipation, the battery avoids the spontaneous discharging induced by the time-reversal symmetry of any unitary-charging scheme. Irrespective of the initial state, the battery can be eventually stabilized at the maximal-ergotropy state as long as the charger-battery interaction is present. We use a Dyson series of Lindbladian superoperator to obtain an effective master equation for the battery, which is found to be equivalent to the high-order Fermi's golden rule adapted to the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and spontaneous decay. We extract the optimization condition for charging efficiency and justify it in the finite-size battery with uniform energy splitting, the large spin battery, and the truncated harmonic-oscillator battery.},

It has efficient applications in quantum information hiding and quantum secret sharing. Constructing a smaller-size set with the strongest nonlocality contributes to reducing resource consumption. In this paper we establish a sufficient and necessary condition for the strongest nonlocality in general -partite systems. Then we derive the minimum size of the strongest nonlocal set with symmetry in the system . Notably, the genuinely entangled sets constructed in our previous work [ Phys. Rev. A 109 , 022220 (2024) ] achieved this minimum size. In addition, we construct the strongest nonlocal genuinely entangled sets in the system for , which have a smaller size than the existing sets as increases. Our results provide a meaningful complement to the current understanding of the strongest nonlocality.},

  abstract     = {Starting from a coarse-grained map of a quantum many-body system, we construct the inverse map that assigns a microscopic state to a coarse-grained state based on the maximum entropy principle. Assuming unitary evolution in the microscopic system, we examine the resulting dynamics in the coarse-grained system using the assignment map. We investigate both a two-qubit system, with swap and controlled- not gates, and -qubit systems, configured either in an Ising spin chain or with all-to-all interactions. We demonstrate that these dynamics exhibit atypical quantum behavior, such as nonlinearity and non-Markovianity. Furthermore, we find that these dynamics depend on the initial coarse-grained state and establish conditions for general microscopic dynamics under which linearity is preserved. As the effective dynamics induced by our coarse-grained description of many-body quantum systems diverge from conventional quantum behavior, we anticipate that this approach could aid in describing the quantum-to-classical transition and provide deeper insights into the effects of coarse graining on quantum systems.},

  abstract     = {Discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) have broad applications in quantum computation and simulation, particularly in universal quantum computing. Prior research in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) has focused on implementing DTQWs in one-dimensional chains. However, to achieve practical quantum tasks, it is crucial to extend DTQWs to multidimensional networks with diverse structures. Here, we propose a protocol for realizing DTQWs in multidimensional networks, which accommodate nodes with different numbers of neighbors. Using this protocol, we numerically simulate a Grover walk search algorithm in a cubic network with circuit QED. Our simulations, which consider decoherence, align well with theoretical predictions. Our universal protocol can be adapted for various quantum systems and paves the way for DTQWs in multidimensional networks, which has potential applications in quantum computing and simulation.},

  abstract     = {A quantum system subject to an external perturbation can experience leakage between uncoupled regions of its energy spectrum separated by a gap. To quantify this phenomenon, we present two complementary results. First, we establish time-independent bounds on the distances between the true dynamics and the dynamics generated by block-diagonal effective evolutions constructed via the Schrieffer-Wolff and Bloch methods. Second, we prove that, under the right conditions, this leakage remains small eternally . That is, we derive a time-independent bound on the leakage itself, expressed in terms of the spectral gap of the unperturbed Hamiltonian and the norm of the perturbation, ensuring its validity for arbitrarily large times. Our approach only requires a finite spectral gap, thus accommodating continuous and unbounded spectra. Finally, we apply our bounds to specific systems of practical interest.},

  abstract     = {Information engines, sometimes referred to as Maxwell Demon engines, utilize information obtained through measurement to control the conversion of energy into useful work. Discussions around such devices often assume the measurement step to be instantaneous, assessing its cost by Landauer's information erasure within the measurement device. While this simplified perspective is sufficient for classical feedback-controlled engines, for nanoengines that often operate in the quantum realm, the overall performance may be significantly affected by the measurement duration (which may be comparable to the engine's cycle time) and cost (energy needed to create the system-meter correlation). In this study, we employ a generalized von Neumann measurement model to highlight that obtaining a finite amount of information requires a finite measurement time and incurs an energetic cost. We investigate the crucial role of these factors in determining the engine's performance, particularly in terms of efficiency and power output. Furthermore, for the information engine model under consideration, we establish a precise relationship between the acquired information in the measurement process and the maximum energy extractable through the measurement. We also discuss ways to extend our considerations using these concepts, such as in measurement-enhanced photochemical reactions.},
