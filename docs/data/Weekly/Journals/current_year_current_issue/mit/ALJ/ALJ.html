  abstract     = {With the recent Nobel Prize awarded for radical advances in protein discovery, foundation models (FMs) for exploring large combinatorial spaces promise to revolutionize many scientific fields. Artificial Life (ALife) has not yet integrated FMs, thus presenting a major opportunity for the field to alleviate the historical burden of relying chiefly on manual design and trial and error to discover the configurations of lifelike simulations. This article presents, for the first time, a successful realization of this opportunity using vision-language FMs. The proposed approach, called automated search for Artificial Life (ASAL), (a) finds simulations that produce target phenomena, (b) discovers simulations that generate temporally open-ended novelty, and (c) illuminates an entire space of interestingly diverse simulations. Because of the generality of FMs, ASAL works effectively across a diverse range of ALife substrates, including Boids, Particle Life, the Game of Life, Lenia, and neural cellular automata. A major result highlighting the potential of this technique is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids life-forms, as well as cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway’s Game of Life. Additionally, the use of FMs allows for the quantification of previously qualitative phenomena in a human-aligned way. This new paradigm promises to accelerate ALife research beyond what is possible through human ingenuity alone.},

  abstract     = {An analysis of the language we use in scientific practice is critical to developing more rigorous and sound methodologies. This article argues that how certain methods of description are commonly employed in cognitive science risks obscuring important features of an agent’s cognition. We propose to make explicit a method of description whereby the concept of cognitive distinctions is the core principle. A model of referential communication is developed and analyzed as a platform to compare methods of description. We demonstrate that cognitive distinctions, realized in a graph theoretic formalism, better describe the behavior and perspective of a simple model agent than other, less systematic or natural language–dependent methods. We then consider how different descriptions relate to one another in the broader methodological framework of minimally cognitive behavior. Finally, we explore the consequences of, and challenges for, cognitive distinctions as a useful concept and method in the tool kit of cognitive scientists.},

  abstract     = {Robot controllers are often optimized for a single robot in a single environment. This approach proves brittle, as such a controller will often fail to produce sensible behavior for a new morphology or environment. In comparison, animal gaits are robust and versatile. By observing animals, and attempting to extract general principles of locomotion from their movement, we aim to design a single, decentralized controller applicable to diverse morphologies and environments. The controller implements the three components of (a) undulation, (b) peristalsis, and (c) leg motion, which we believe are the essential elements in most animal gaits. This work is a first step toward a general controller. Accordingly, the controller has been evaluated on a limited range of simulated centipede-like robot morphologies. The centipede is chosen as inspiration because it moves using both body contractions and legged locomotion. For a controller to work in qualitatively different settings, it must also be able to exhibit qualitatively different behaviors. We find that six different modes of locomotion emerge from our controller in response to environmental and morphological changes. We also find that different parts of the centipede model can exhibit different modes of locomotion, simultaneously, based on local morphological features. This controller can potentially aid in the design or evolution of robots, by quickly testing the potential of a morphology, or be used to get insights about underlying locomotion principles in the centipede.},

Saccharina latissima , a seaweed species economically beneficial to humans but threatened by overexploitation, motivates the creation of this artwork. Technically, the authors create an underwater virtual ecosystem consisting of a seaweed swarm and symbiotic fungi, created using procedural content generation via machine learning and rule-based methods. Moreover, the work features a unique cybernetic loop structure, incorporating audience observation and game token interactions. This virtual system is also symbolically influenced in real time by indoor carbon dioxide measurements, serving as an artistic metaphor for the broader impacts of climate change. This integration with the physical game machine underscores the fragile relationship between human activities and the environment under severe global climate change and immerses the audience in the challenging balance between sustainability and profit seeking in this context.},

  abstract     = {The scientific fields of complexity, Artificial Life (ALife), and artificial intelligence (AI) share commonalities: historic, conceptual, methodological, and philosophical. Although their origins trace back to the 1940s birth of cybernetics, they were able to develop properly only as modern information technology became available. In this perspective, I offer a personal (and thus biased) account of the expectations and limitations of these fields, some of which have their roots in the limits of formal systems. I use interactions, self-organization, emergence, and balance to compare different aspects of complexity, ALife, and AI. Even when the trajectory of the article is influenced by my personal experience, the general questions posed (which outweigh the answers) will, I hope, be useful in aligning efforts in these fields toward overcoming—or accepting—their limits.},

  abstract     = {Epigenetic tracking (ET) is a model of development that is capable of generating diverse, arbitrary, complex three-dimensional cellular structures starting from a single cell. The generated structures have a level of complexity (in terms of the number of cells) comparable to multicellular biological organisms. In this article, we investigate the evolvability of the development of a complex structure inspired by the “French flag” problem: an “Italian Anubis” (a three-dimensional, doglike figure patterned in three colors). Genes during development are triggered in ET at specific developmental stages, and the fitness of individuals during simulated evolution is calculated after a certain stage. When this evaluation stage was allowed to evolve, genes that were triggered at later stages of development tended to be incorporated into the genome later during evolutionary runs. This suggests the emergence of the property of terminal addition in this system. When the principle of terminal addition was explicitly incorporated into ET, and was the sole mechanism for introducing morphological innovation, evolvability improved markedly, leading to the development of structures much more closely approximating the target at a much lower computational cost.},

  abstract     = {The NK fitness landscape is a well-known model with which to study evolutionary dynamics in landscapes of different ruggedness. However, the model is static, and genomes are typically small, allowing observations over only a short adaptive period. Here we introduce an extension to the model that allows the experimenter to set the velocity at which the landscape changes independently from other parameters, such as the ruggedness or the mutation rate. We find that, similar to the previously observed complexity catastrophe, where evolution comes to a halt when environments become too complex due to overly high degrees of epistasis, here the same phenomenon occurs when changes happen too rapidly. Our expanded model also preserves essential properties of the static NK landscape, allowing for proper comparisons between static and dynamic landscapes.},

  abstract     = {In this issue of contributed articles, we are pleased to share with you a diversity of ALife research.In his letter “Neurons as Autoencoders,” Bull brings together ideas from backpropagation, dendritic computing, the NK model, and autoencoders to augment standard models of neuronal autoencoding. The NK model reappears in the article “Continuous Evolution in the NK Treadmill Model,” in which Mehra and Hintze extend the originally static model to allow it to change in a parameterized manner and investigate how evolution behaves at different rates of change. In “Evolvability in Artificial Development of Large Complex Structures and the Principle of Terminal Addition,” Fontana and Wróbel examine evo-devo processes and the emergence of modification to the later stages of a developmental process.In a historical and philosophical perspective, Gershenson offers a personal account that compares various aspects of, and raises questions about, the closely related topics of “Complexity, Artificial Life, and Artificial Intelligence.”Games are an interesting subtopic in ALife, useful both for understanding complex systems and for outreach. In “Benefit Game 2.0: Alien Seaweed Swarms—Exploring the Interplay of Human Activity and Environmental Sustainability,” Fei, Wu, and Zhang present their immersive seaweed ecosystem simulation game that responds not only to audience input but also to the real-world environmental state. Moving from plant to animal behavior, in “Behaviour Diversity in a Walking and Climbing Centipede-Like Virtual Creature,” Norstein et al. take inspiration from arthropod multilegged locomotion to help develop robotic controllers robust to morphological and environmental variation.In their methodological article “Cognitive Distinctions as a Language for Cognitive Science: Comparing Methods of Description in a Model of Referential Communication,” Gaul and Izquierdo examine the effect of choices of language and terminology on theoretical frameworks in cognitive science and use a model to expose the consequences. In another methodological work, “Automating the Search for Artificial Life With Foundation Models,” Kumar et al. exploit concepts of artificial intelligence’s foundation models to develop a new approach to searching for lifelike behaviors, applied to a range of ALife simulations.We thank all the authors for the time and care they took to perform their research and present their work.
