  abstract     = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability leading to multiple sequelae in cognitive, sensory, and physical domains, including posttraumatic epilepsy. Despite extensive research, our understanding of its impact on macroscopic brain circuitry remains incomplete. We analyzed electrophysiological functional connectomes in the gamma band from an animal model of blast-induced TBI over multiple time points after injury. We revealed differences in small-world propensity and rich-club structure compared with age-matched controls, indicating functional reorganization following injury. We further investigated cost-efficiency trade-offs, propose a computationally efficient normalization procedure for quantifying the cost of spatially embedded networks that controls for connectivity strength differences, and observed dynamic changes across the injury timeline. To explore potential links between altered network topology and epileptic activity, we employed a brain-wide computational model of seizure dynamics and attribute brain reorganization to a homeostatic mechanism of activity regulation with the potential unintended consequence of driving generalized seizures. Finally, we demonstrated post-injury hyperexcitability that manifests as an increase in sound-evoked response amplitudes at the cortical level. Our work characterizes, for the first time, gamma-band functional network reorganization in a model of brain injury and proposes potential causes of these changes, thus identifying targets for future therapeutic interventions. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a prevalent neurological disorder caused by factors such as accidents, contact sports, or military conflict. While animal studies have provided detailed insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying TBI, and clinical research has revealed its effects on large-scale brain network organization, these findings often lack integration. Our research seeks to address this gap by examining large-scale brain activity in an animal model of TBI. By analyzing brain network structures, we identify reorganization, highlighting novel connections to weight gain and posttraumatic epilepsy. Further exploration using this model may deepen our understanding of cross-scale mechanisms and inform the development of therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract     = {Neuroendocrinology has received little attention in human neuroscience research, resulting in a dearth of knowledge surrounding potent and dynamic modulators of cognition and behavior, as well as brain structure and function. This work addresses one such phenomenon by studying functional connectomics related to ovarian hormone fluctuations throughout the adult menstrual cycle. To do so, we used fMRI and hormone assessments from two dense, longitudinal datasets to assess variations in functional connectivity with respect to endogenous and exogenous endocrine factors throughout the menstrual cycle. First, we replicated prior findings that common, group-level, and individual-specific factors have similar relative contributions to functional brain network organization. Second, we found widespread connectivity related to hormonal contraceptive (HC) use, in addition to sparser estradiol- and progesterone-related connectivity. Differential generalizability of these connectivity patterns suggests progestin-specific impacts on functional brain organization in HC users. These results provide novel insight into within-individual changes in brain organization across the menstrual cycle and the extent to which these changes are shared between individuals, illuminating understudied phenomena in reproductive health and important information for all neuroimaging studies that include participants who menstruate. Endocrine modulation of brain function across the menstrual cycle is poorly understood. Human neuroimaging research on the menstrual cycle has long relied on group differences and/or coarse, within-individual cycle stage differences, overlooking considerable individual differences in brain organization, the menstrual cycle, and hormone concentrations. Here, we take a multidataset approach to identify the idiosyncratic contraceptive- and hormone-related functional connectivity from within-individual neuroendocrine dynamics and then test the generalizability of this connectivity to other individuals. In doing so, we identified idiosyncratic hormone-responsive functional connectivity that is somewhat generalizable to other individuals, although this generalizability is complicated by hormonal contraceptive use, potentially reflecting differential connectivity between contraceptive formulations. Thus, this work illuminates individual similarities and differences in neuroendocrine dynamics across the menstrual cycle.},

  abstract     = {Functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) help explore correlations between structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC; SC–FC coupling). Studies on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) observed coupling disruptions, co-occurring with cognitive decline. Advanced “fixel-based” analyses improved DWI’s accuracy in assessing microstructural and macrostructural features of white matter (WM), but previous aging coupling studies commonly defined SC via tensor-based tractography and streamline counts, thereby missing fiber-specific information. We investigated different types of fixel-FC coupling and their relation to cognition in 392 participants (Age mean = 73; 207 females) from the ADNI. Two hundred twenty-five controls, 142 MCI, and 25 AD with diffusion-weighted and resting-state fMRI scans were analyzed. Structural connectomes were constructed using average fixel metrics (fiber density (FD), fiber-bundle cross-section log, and combined [FDC]) as edges. SC–FC coupling for each SC metric was calculated at overall network, edge, and node levels. Overall DMN, node- and edge-specific coupling differences were found across SC measures and groups. DMN nodal coupling significantly predicted Mini-Mental Status Examination score and verbal memory. In conclusion, different types of fixel-based coupling alterations can be observed across the neurocognitive aging spectrum, in particular, FD–FC and FDC–FC coupling between DMN regions are associated with cognitive functioning. Structure–function coupling is the correlation between white matter structures connecting pairs of brain regions (structural connectivity) and their concomitant brain activity (functional connectivity). “fixel-based” diffusion-weighted imaging techniques improve the accuracy of white matter structure estimation and provide information on microstructural and macrostructural changes to brain networks. Using structural connectomes based on fixel-based weights, coupling was found to be altered in Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment, especially in the default mode network. Default mode network coupling may be relevant to verbal memory and cognitive decline across aging, particularly for coupling driven by microstructural features of white matter.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of the human cortex are highly metastable, driving the spontaneous exploration of network states. This metastability depends on circuit-level edge-of-bifurcation dynamics, which emerge from firing-rate control through multiple mechanisms of excitatory–inhibitory (E–I) homeostasis. However, it is unclear how these contribute to the metastability of cortical networks. We propose that individual mechanisms of the E–I homeostasis contribute uniquely to the emergence of resting-state dynamics and test this hypothesis in a large-scale model of the human cortex. We show that empirical connectivity and dynamics can only be reproduced when accounting for multiple mechanisms of the E–I homeostasis. More specifically, while the homeostasis of excitation and inhibition enhances metastability, the regulation of intrinsic excitability ensures moderate synchrony, maximizing functional complexity. Furthermore, the modulation bifurcation modulation by the homeostasis of excitation and intrinsic excitability compensates for strong input fluctuations in connector hubs. Importantly, this only occurs in models accounting for local gamma oscillations, suggesting a relationship between E–I balance, gamma rhythms, and metastable dynamics. Altogether, our results show that cortical networks self-organize toward maximal metastability through the multifactor homeostasis of E–I balance. Therefore, the benefits of combining multiple homeostatic mechanisms transcend the circuit level, supporting the metastable dynamics of large-scale cortical networks. Experimental studies have consistently shown that cortical circuits maintain a precise homeostasis of excitatory–inhibitory (E–I) balance, thereby optimizing local dynamics. While it is well established that multiple homeostatic mechanisms are involved in this local regulation, it remains unclear how each contributes to the large-scale dynamics of cortical networks. This study presents evidence that, through the E–I homeostasis, the cortex can self-organize toward a regime of highly complex and metastable spontaneous dynamics. Crucially, we demonstrate that this results from the synergistic action of multiple homeostatic mechanisms. Our findings advance our understanding of the E–I homeostasis as a process of self-organization, demonstrating its key role in the maintenance of metastable dynamics in large-scale cortical networks.},

  abstract     = {Single-subject morphological brain networks derived from cross-feature correlation of macroscopic MRI-derived morphological measures provide an important means for studying the brain connectome. However, the validity of this approach remains to be confirmed at the microscopic level. Here, we constructed morphological brain networks at the single-cell level by extending features from macroscopic morphological measures to microscopic descriptions of neuronal morphology. We demonstrated the feasibility and generalizability of the method using neurons in the somatosensory cortex of a rat, neurons over the whole brain of a mouse, and neurons in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) of a human. We found that interneuron morphological similarity was higher for intra- than interclass connections, depended on cytoarchitectonic, chemoarchitectonic, and laminar classification of neurons (rat), differed between regions with different evolutionary timelines (mouse), and correlated with neuronal axonal projections (mouse). Furthermore, highly connected hub neurons were disproportionately from superficial layers (rat), inhibitory neurons (rat), and subcortical regions (mouse), and exhibited unique morphology. Finally, we demonstrated a more segregated, less integrated, and economic network architecture with worse resistance to targeted attacks for neurons in human MTG than neurons in a mouse’s primary visual cortex. Overall, our method provides an alternative avenue to study neuronal wiring diagrams in brains. The brain is a highly complex network spanning multiple spatial scales, yet the organization of brain networks at the single-cell level remains poorly understood. Here, we constructed microscopic morphological brain networks by assessing interneuron similarity based on neuronal morphology for different species. We found that interneuron morphological similarity was correlated with neuronal axonal projections, dependent on neuronal affiliation with respect to cellular and molecular architecture, laminar positioning, and brain area location, and capable of uncovering cross-species differences. Our method complements existing methodology aimed at mapping wiring diagrams in brains at the microscopic level.},

  abstract     = {In fMRI research, graphical models are used to uncover complex patterns of relationships between brain regions. Connectivity-based fMRI studies typically analyze nested data; raw observations, for example, BOLD responses, are nested within participants, which are nested within populations, for example, healthy controls. Often, studies ignore the nested structure and analyze participants either individually or in aggregate. This overlooks the distinction between within-participant and between-participant variance, which can lead to poor generalizability of results because group-level effects do not necessarily reflect effects for each member of the group and, at worst, risk paradoxical results where group-level effects are opposite to individual-level effects (e.g., Kievit, Frankenhuis, Waldorp, & Borsboom, 2013 ; Robinson, 2009 ; Simpson, 1951 ). To address these concerns, we propose a multilevel approach to model the fMRI networks, using a Gaussian graphical model at the individual level and a Curie-Weiss graphical model at the group level. Simulations show that our method outperforms individual or aggregate analysis in edge retrieval. We apply the proposed multilevel approach to resting-state fMRI data of 724 healthy participants, examining both their commonalities and individual differences. We not only recover the seven previously found resting-state networks at the group level but also observe considerable heterogeneity in the individual-level networks. Finally, we discuss the necessity of a multilevel approach, additional challenges, and possible future extensions.},

  abstract     = {Studying structural brain networks has witnessed significant advancement in recent decades. Findings revealed a geometric principle, the exponential distance rule (EDR) showing that the number of neurons decreases exponentially with the length of their axons. This neuron-level information was used to build a region-level EDR network model that was able to explain various characteristics of interareal cortical networks in macaques, mice, and rats. The complete connectome of the Drosophila has recently been mapped providing information also about the network of neuropils (projectome). A recent study demonstrated the presence of the EDR in the Drosophila . In our study, we first revisit the EDR itself and precisely measure the characteristic decay rate. Next, we demonstrate that the EDR model effectively accounts for numerous binary and weighted properties of the projectome. Our study illustrates that the EDR model is a suitable null model for analyzing networks of brain regions, as it captures properties of region-level networks in very different species. The importance of the null model lies in its ability to facilitate the identification of functionally significant features not caused by inevitable geometric constraints, as we illustrate with the pronounced asymmetry of connection weights important for functional hierarchy.

  abstract     = {Current techniques to estimate directed functional connectivity from magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals involve two sequential steps: (a) estimation of the sources and their amplitude time series from the MEG data and (b) estimation of directed interactions between the source time series. However, such a sequential approach is not optimal as it leads to spurious connectivity due to spatial leakage. Here, we present an algorithm to jointly estimate the source and connectivity parameters using Bayesian filtering. We refer to this new algorithm as JEDI-MEG (Joint Estimation of source Dynamics and Interactions from MEG data). By formulating a state-space model for the locations and amplitudes of a given number of sources, we show that estimation of their connections can be reduced to a system identification problem. Using simulated MEG data, we show that the joint approach provides a more accurate reconstruction of connectivity parameters than the conventional two-step approach. Using real MEG responses to visually presented faces in 16 subjects, we also demonstrate that our method gives source and connectivity estimates that are both physiologically plausible and largely consistent across subjects. In conclusion, the proposed joint estimation approach outperforms the traditional two-step approach in determining functional connectivity in MEG data. Functional connectivity is currently estimated from electromagnetic brain signals such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) in two consecutive steps: First, the inverse problem is solved to estimate the locations and temporal dynamics of brain sources. Second, connectivity metrics are computed between these estimated sources. This approach suffers from the limitation that the information provided by the connectivity structure is not exploited in the estimation of source activity and vice versa. Here, we present a novel algorithm, utilizing Bayesian filtering, to jointly estimate the source and connectivity parameters to overcome this limitation. Compared with state-of-the-art two-step approaches, our method provides a more accurate reconstruction of the connectivity parameters, which we demonstrate using a standard connectivity benchmark simulation and an electrocorticography-based simulation of MEG data. We also applied our method to real MEG responses (open-access dataset) to visually presented faces in 16 subjects, and the results show that our approach provides source and connectivity estimates that are both physiologically plausible and largely consistent across subjects. Overall, this work contributes to methodological advances in estimating functional connectivity from MEG data.},

In this longitudinal magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we investigated changes in brain network topology of ALSci/bi over time as compared with ALS-pure motor and bvFTD patients. Resting-state MEG was recorded in ALS-pure motor ( n = 9), ALSci/bi ( n = 16), and bvFTD ( n = 16) at baseline and 5-month follow-up, projected to source space. The corrected version of the amplitude envelope correlation was applied to compute frequency-band-specific functional connectivity between brain regions, from which the backbone of the functional networks was constructed using the minimum spanning tree (MST) approach. Reference MSTs were computed based on the functional connectivity matrices for ALS-pure motor and bvFTD, against which the networks of ALSci/bi were compared. We showed that, at baseline, networks in the theta band of ALSci/bi patients were more similar to ALS-pure motor than bvFTD. At follow-up, ALSci/bi patients’ beta-band network similarity had moved away from ALS-pure motor and resembled bvFTD. In conclusion, our findings suggest that brain networks of ALSci/bi patients move along the ALS-bvFTD spectrum over time, from ALS-pure motor to bvFTD-like topology. In this longitudinal magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we explored changes in brain network topology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with cognitive/behavioral impairment (ALSci/bi), compared with the two extreme ends of the ALS behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (ALS-bvFTD) spectrum (ALS with only motor impairment and bvFTD patients without ALS). We recorded resting-state MEG at baseline and 5-month follow-up, analyzing frequency-band-specific functional connectivity and constructing the networks’ backbone using the minimum spanning tree (MST). Our findings indicate that at baseline, ALSci/bi networks were more similar to ALS-pure motor than bvFTD in the theta band. At follow-up, ALSci/bi networks shifted toward bvFTD-like topology in the beta band. This suggests that ALSci/bi patients’ brain networks evolve along the ALS-bvFTD spectrum, highlighting potential implications for disease progression.},
