  abstract     = {Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods are the most widely applied tools in the network neurosciences, but their reliability remains an active area of study. We use back-to-back 10-min resting-state scans in a healthy aging ( n = 41) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) sample ( n = 45) composed of older adults to assess the replicability of RSFC using a “mini” multiverse approach. The goal was to evaluate the reproducibility of commonly used graph metrics and determine if aging and moderate-severe TBI influences RSFC reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). There is clear evidence for reliable results in aging and TBI. Global network metrics such as within-network connectivity and segregation were most reliable whereas other whole-brain connectivity estimates (e.g., clustering coefficient, eigenvector centrality) were least reliable. Analysis of canonical networks revealed the default mode and salience networks as most reliable. There was a notable influence of motion scrubbing on ICCs, with diminished reliability proportional to the number of volumes removed. Choice of brain atlas had a modest effect on findings. Overall, RSFC reproducibility is preserved in older adults and after significant neurological compromise. We also identify a subset of graph metrics and canonical networks with promising reliability. In this paper, we examine the reproducibility of resting-state functional connectivity in healthy aging and traumatic brain injury (TBI). We use a mini-verse approach to determine if workflows have a significant effect on resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) reliability. While the study of RSFC reliability has been previously examined (e.g., in healthy, young adults), it is lacking in the aging and TBI literatures. To our knowledge, this is the first study of back-to-back (consecutive) scans that examine RSFC reliability in healthy aging and TBI. In brief, these data and these analyses do not currently exist in the literature. RSFC reliability remains a vital area of investigation in healthy aging and clinical samples. We believe there are critical contributions that can be made by this paper.},

  abstract     = {Functional connectivity derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has been increasingly used to study brain activity. In this study, we model brain dynamic functional connectivity during narrative tasks as a temporal brain network and employ a machine learning model to classify in a supervised setting the modality (audio, movie), the content (airport, restaurant situations) of narratives, and both combined. Leveraging Shapley values, we analyze subnetwork contributions within Yeo parcellations (7- and 17-subnetworks) to explore their involvement in narrative modality and comprehension. This work represents the first application of this approach to functional aspects of the brain, validated by existing literature, and provides novel insights at the whole-brain level. Our findings suggest that schematic representations in narratives may not depend solely on preexisting knowledge of the top-down process to guide perception and understanding, but may also emerge from a bottom-up process driven by the temporal parietal subnetwork. This study investigates how different brain subnetworks contribute to processing narratives. We used a machine learning model to analyze fMRI data from participants listening to or watching narratives that varied in modality (audio or movie) and thematic content (airport or restaurant). Our model accurately classified these different narrative aspects, and by using Shapley values, we identified the subnetworks most crucial for each classification. Consistent with existing neuroscience knowledge, our findings highlight the distinct roles of these subnetworks in narrative comprehension. This study provides a powerful approach for investigating brain function across various domains.},

  abstract     = {Recent machine learning techniques have improved connectome-based predictions by modeling complex dependencies between brain connectivity and cognitive traits. However, they typically require large datasets that are costly and time-consuming to collect. To address this, we propose Task-guided generative adversarial network (GAN) II, a novel data augmentation method that uses GANs to expand sample sizes in connectome-based prediction tasks. Our method incorporates a task-guided branch within the Wasserstein GAN framework, specifically designed to synthesize structural connectivity matrices and improve prediction accuracy by capturing task-relevant features. We evaluated Task-guided GAN II on the prediction of fluid intelligence using the NIMH Health Research Volunteer Dataset. Results showed that data augmentation improved prediction accuracy. To further assess whether augmentation can substitute for increasing actual collected sample sizes, we conducted additional validation using the Human Connectome Project WU-Minn S1200 dataset. Task-guided GAN II improved prediction performance with limited real data, with gains of up to twofold augmentation observed. However, excessive augmentation did not result in further improvements, suggesting that augmentation complements, but does not fully replace, real data augmentation. These results suggest that Task-guided GAN II is a promising tool for harnessing small datasets in human connectomics research, improving predictive modeling where large-scale data collection is impractical.},

  abstract     = {Interregional communication within the human brain is essential for maintaining functional integrity. A promising approach for investigating how brain regions communicate relies on the assumption that the brain operates as a complex network. In this context, positron emission tomography (PET) images have been suggested as a valuable source for understanding brain networks. However, such networks are typically assembled through direct computation without accounting for outliers, impacting the reliability of group representative networks. In this study, we used brain [ 18 F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose PET data from 1,227 individuals in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) continuum from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort to develop a novel method for constructing stable metabolic brain networks that are resilient to spurious data points. Our multiple sampling scheme generates brain networks with greater stability compared with conventional approaches. The proposed method is robust to imbalanced datasets and requires 50% fewer subjects to achieve stability than the conventional method. We further validated the approach in an independent AD cohort ( n = 114) from São Paulo, Brazil (Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo). This innovative method is flexible and improves the robustness of metabolic brain network analyses, supporting better insights into brain connectivity and resilience to data variability across multiple radiotracers for both health and disease.},

  abstract     = {Brain structure-function coupling has been studied in health and disease by many different researchers in recent years. Most of the studies have estimated functional connectivity matrices as correlation coefficients between different brain areas, despite well-known disadvantages compared with partial correlation connectivity matrices. Indeed, partial correlation represents a more sensible model for structural connectivity since, under a Gaussian approximation, it accounts only for direct dependencies between brain areas. Motivated by this and following previous results by different authors, we investigate structure-function coupling using partial correlation matrices of functional magnetic resonance imaging brain activity time series under various regularization (also known as noise-cleaning) algorithms. We find that, across different algorithms and conditions, partial correlation provides a higher match with structural connectivity retrieved from density-weighted imaging data than standard correlation, and this occurs at both subject and population levels. Importantly, we also show that regularization and thresholding are crucial for this match to emerge. Finally, we assess neurogenetic associations in relation to structure-function coupling, which presents promising opportunities to further advance research in the field of network neuroscience, particularly concerning brain disorders. A precise understanding of how brain structure and function interact is fundamentally relevant to understanding disease. For the functional representation, most of the previous research has used correlation methods, which have limitations. Our study explores a different approach called partial correlation methods, which more accurately reflect the brain’s direct connections. We found that partial correlation aligns better with the brain’s structural connectivity than standard methods, both in individuals and groups. Additionally, we identified promising links between brain connectivity and genetics, offering new insights into brain disorders. Our work highlights the importance of using advanced connectivity methods to improve our understanding of the brain’s structure-function relationship, paving the way for future research in brain health and disease.},

  abstract     = {Intrinsic brain dynamics play a fundamental role in cognitive function, but their development is incompletely understood. We investigated pubertal changes in temporal fluctuations of intrinsic network topologies (focusing on the strongest connections and coordination patterns) and signals, in an early longitudinal sample from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, with resting-state fMRI ( n = 4,099 at baseline; n = 3,376 at follow-up [median age = 10.0 (1.1) and 12.0 (1.1) years; n = 2,116 with both assessments]). Reproducible, inverse associations between low-frequency signal and topological fluctuations were estimated ( p < 0.05, β = −0.20 to −0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [−0.23, −0.001]). Signal (but not topological) fluctuations increased in somatomotor and prefrontal areas with pubertal stage ( p < 0.03, β = 0.06–0.07, 95% CI = [0.03, 0.11]), but decreased in orbitofrontal, insular, and cingulate cortices, as well as cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus ( p < 0.05, β = −0.09 to −0.03, 95% CI = [−0.15, −0.001]). Higher temporal signal and topological variability in spatially distributed regions were estimated in girls. In racial/ethnic minorities, several associations between signal and topological fluctuations were in the opposite direction of those in the entire sample, suggesting potential racial differences. Our findings indicate that during puberty, intrinsic signal dynamics change significantly in developed and developing brain regions, but their strongest coordination patterns may already be sufficiently developed and remain temporally consistent. We have investigated pubertal changes in intrinsic signal and network dynamics, estimated from resting-state fMRI in a sample of youth from the ABCD study. We have identified reproducible, inverse associations between low-frequency signal and topological fluctuations, as well as pubertal changes in intrinsic signal dynamics but not topological patterns of strongly connected networks. We have also identified sex differences in these dynamics and negative associations with body mass index (BMI). Several associations between signal and topological fluctuations were in the opposite direction in racial/ethnic minorities compared with those in the entire sample. Our findings indicate that intrinsic signal dynamics change significantly in developed and developing brain regions during puberty, but their strongest synchronization patterns may already be sufficiently developed prior to puberty and are dynamically reproducible.},
