  abstract     = {Genomic data from a single institution lacks global diversity representation, especially for rare variants and diseases. Confidential computing can enable collaborative genome-wide association studies (GWAS) without compromising privacy or accuracy. However, due to limited secure memory space and performance overheads, previous solutions fail to support widely used regression methods. Here we present SECRET-GWAS—a rapid, privacy-preserving, population-scale, collaborative GWAS tool. We discuss several system optimizations, including streaming, batching, data parallelization and reducing trusted hardware overheads to efficiently scale linear and logistic regression to over a thousand processor cores on an Intel SGX-based cloud platform. In addition, we protect SECRET-GWAS against several hardware side-channel attacks. SECRET-GWAS is an open-source tool and works with the widely used Hail genomic analysis framework. Our experiments on Azure’s Confidential Computing platform demonstrate that SECRET-GWAS enables multivariate linear and logistic regression GWAS queries on population-scale datasets from ten independent sources in just 4.5 and 29 minutes, respectively. Secure collaborative genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with population-scale datasets address gaps in genomic data. This work proposes SECRET-GWAS and system optimizations that overcome resource constraints and exploit parallelism, while maintaining privacy and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Transformer networks, driven by self-attention, are central to large language models. In generative transformers, self-attention uses cache memory to store token projections, avoiding recomputation at each time step. However, graphics processing unit (GPU)-stored projections must be loaded into static random-access memory for each new generation step, causing latency and energy bottlenecks. Here we present a custom self-attention in-memory computing architecture based on emerging charge-based memories called gain cells, which can be efficiently written to store new tokens during sequence generation and enable parallel analog dot-product computation required for self-attention. However, the analog gain-cell circuits introduce non-idealities and constraints preventing the direct mapping of pre-trained models. To circumvent this problem, we design an initialization algorithm achieving text-processing performance comparable to GPT-2 without training from scratch. Our architecture reduces attention latency and energy consumption by up to two and four orders of magnitude, respectively, compared with GPUs, marking a substantial step toward ultrafast, low-power generative transformers. Leveraging in-memory computing with emerging gain-cell devices, the authors accelerate attention—a core mechanism in large language models. They train a 1.5-billion-parameter model, achieving up to a 70,000-fold reduction in energy consumption and a 100-fold speed-up compared with GPUs.},

  abstract     = {Inferring optimal solutions from limited data is considered the ultimate goal in scientific discovery. Artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue to greatly accelerate this process. Existing methods often depend on large datasets, strong assumptions about objective functions, and classic machine learning techniques, restricting their effectiveness to low-dimensional or data-rich problems. Here we introduce an optimization pipeline that can effectively tackle complex, high-dimensional problems with limited data. This approach utilizes a deep neural surrogate to iteratively find optimal solutions and introduces additional mechanisms to avoid local optima, thereby minimizing the required samples. Our method finds superior solutions in problems with up to 2,000 dimensions, whereas existing approaches are confined to 100 dimensions and need considerably more data. It excels across varied real-world systems, outperforming current algorithms and enabling efficient knowledge discovery. Although focused on scientific problems, its benefits extend to numerous quantitative fields, paving the way for advanced self-driving laboratories. This study introduces a deep active optimization pipeline that effectively tackles high-dimensional, complex problems with limited data. The approach minimizes sample size and surpasses existing methods, achieving optimal solutions in up to 2,000 dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Directly visualizing chemical trajectories offers insights into catalysis, gas-phase reactions and photoinduced dynamics. Tracking the transformation of chemical species is best achieved by coupling theory and experiment. Here we developed Digital Twin for Chemical Science (DTCS) v.01, which integrates theory, experiment and their bidirectional feedback loops into a unified platform for chemical characterization. DTCS addresses a core question: given a set of experimental conditions, what is the expected outcome and why? It consists of a forward solver that takes a chemical reaction network and predicts spectra under experimental conditions, and an inverse solver that infers kinetics from measured spectra. We applied DTCS to ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of the Ag–H2O interface as an example. This approach enables real-time knowledge extraction and guides experiments until a stopping condition is met based on accuracy and degeneracy. As a step toward autonomous chemical characterization, DTCS provides mechanistic knowledge in a verified, standardized manner. Interpreting spectroscopic data in real time remains a challenge in chemical characterization. Here a digital twin framework is developed that links first-principles theory and experimental data via a bidirectional feedback loop, enabling on-the-fly decision-making and insights into reaction mechanisms based on measured spectra during chemical experiments.},

  abstract     = {With approximately 90% of industrial reactions occurring on surfaces, the role of heterogeneous catalysts is paramount. Currently, accurate surface exposure prediction is vital for heterogeneous catalyst design, but it is hindered by the high costs of experimental and computational methods. Here we introduce a foundation force-field-based model for predicting surface exposure and synthesizability (SurFF) across intermetallic crystals, which are essential materials for heterogeneous catalysts. We created a comprehensive intermetallic surface database using an active learning method and high-throughput density functional theory calculations, encompassing 12,553 unique surfaces and 344,200 single points. SurFF achieves density-functional-theory-level precision with a prediction error of 3 meV Å−2 and enables large-scale surface exposure prediction with a 105-fold acceleration. Validation against computational and experimental data both show strong alignment. We applied SurFF for large-scale predictions of surface energy and Wulff shapes for over 6,000 intermetallic crystals, providing valuable data for the community. A foundation machine learning model, SurFF, enables DFT-accurate predictions of surface energies and morphologies in intermetallic catalysts, achieving over 105-fold acceleration for high-throughput materials screening.},

Here we introduce the surrogate functional false discovery rate (sfFDR) framework that integrates summary statistics of related traits to increase power. The sfFDR framework provides estimates of FDR quantities such as the functional local FDR and q value, and uses these estimates to derive a functional P value for type I error rate control and a functional local Bayes’ factor for post-GWAS analyses. Compared with a standard analysis, sfFDR substantially increased power (equivalent to a 52% increase in sample size) in a study of obesity-related traits from the UK Biobank and discovered eight additional lead SNPs near genes linked to immune-related responses in a rare disease GWAS of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Collectively, these results highlight the utility of exploiting related traits in both small and large studies. This study introduces a cost-effective strategy called surrogate functional false discovery rates to increase power in genome-wide association studies by leveraging genetic correlations (or pleiotropy) between related traits.},

  abstract     = {Estimating the epileptogenic zone network (EZN) is an important part of the diagnosis of drug-resistant focal epilepsy and has a pivotal role in treatment and intervention. Virtual brain twins provide a modeling method for personalized diagnosis and treatment. They integrate patient-specific brain topography with structural connectivity from anatomical neuroimaging such as magnetic resonance imaging, and dynamic activity from functional recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) and stereo-EEG (SEEG). Seizures show rich spatial and temporal features in functional recordings, which can be exploited to estimate the EZN. Stimulation-induced seizures can provide important and complementary information. Here we consider invasive SEEG stimulation and non-invasive temporal interference stimulation as a complementary approach. This paper offers a high-resolution virtual brain twin framework for EZN diagnosis based on stimulation-induced seizures. It provides an important methodological and conceptual basis to make the transition from invasive to non-invasive diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant focal epilepsy. A high-resolution virtual brain twin approach is proposed using stimulation-induced seizures to estimate the epileptogenic network, offering a step toward non-invasive diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant focal epilepsy.},

Methods have been proposed to infer ancestral gene order, but they lack scalability, limiting the depth to which gene neighbourhood evolution can be traced back. Here we introduce edgeHOG, a tool designed for accurate ancestral gene order inference with linear time complexity. We validated edgeHOG on various benchmarks and applied it to the entire OMA orthology database, encompassing 2,845 extant genomes across all domains of life. We reconstructed ancestral gene order for 1,133 ancestral genomes, including ancestral contigs for the last common ancestor of eukaryotes, dating back around 1.8 billion years, and observed significant functional association among neighbouring genes. EdgeHOG also dates gene adjacencies, allowing the detection of both conserved gene clusters and chromosomal rearrangements. A new method to reconstruct ancestral genomes is used to estimate contigs of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes and to infer features such as the age of gene adjacencies and chromosome rearrangements.},

  abstract     = {The partitioning of ecological niches is a fundamental component of species diversification in adaptive radiations. However, it is currently unknown if and how such bursts of organismal diversity are influenced by temporal niche partitioning, wherein species avoid competition by being active or sleeping during different time windows. Here we address this question through profiling temporal activity patterns in the exceptionally diverse fauna of cichlid fishes from the African Lake Tanganyika. By integrating week-long longitudinal behavioural recordings of over 500 individuals from 60 species with eco-morphological and genomic information, we provide two lines of evidence that temporal niche partitioning occurs in this massive adaptive radiation. First, Tanganyikan cichlids exhibit all known circadian temporal activity patterns (diurnal, nocturnal, crepuscular and cathemeral) and display substantial interspecific variation in daily amounts of locomotion. Second, many species with similar habitat and diet niches occupy distinct temporal niches. Moreover, our results suggest that shifts between diurnal and nocturnal activity patterns are facilitated by a crepuscular intermediate state. Genome-wide association studies indicate that the genetics underlying activity patterns is complex, with different clades associated with different combinations of variants. The identified variants were not associated with core circadian clock genes but with genes implicated in synapse function. These observations indicate that temporal niche partitioning may have contributed to adaptive radiation in cichlids and that many genes are associated with the diversity and evolution of temporal activity patterns. An analysis of behavioural, eco-morphological and genomic data in 60 species of Lake Tanganyika cichlids reveals a remarkable diversity of temporal activity patterns across species, suggesting that temporal niche partitioning may have played a role in the adaptive diversification of this group.},

  abstract     = {Deleterious mutations are ubiquitous in natural populations and, when expressed, reduce fitness. However, the specific nature of these mutations and the ways in which they impact fitness remain poorly understood. We exploited recent advances in genomics to predict deleterious mutations in the black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix), an iconic lekking species. Analysis of 190 whole genomes alongside comprehensive life-history data including repeated measures of behavioural, ornamental and fitness traits revealed that deleterious mutations identified through evolutionary conservation and functional prediction are associated with reduced male lifetime mating success. Both homozygous and heterozygous deleterious mutations reduce fitness, indicating that fully and partially recessive mutations contribute towards an individual’s realized mutation load. Notably, deleterious mutations in promotors have disproportionally negative fitness effects, suggesting that they impair an individual’s ability to dynamically adjust gene expression to meet context-dependent functional demands. Finally, deleterious mutations impact male mating success by reducing lek attendance rather than by altering the expression of ornamental traits, suggesting that behaviour serves as an honest indicator of genetic quality. These findings offer insights into the genetic architecture of male fitness and illuminate the complex interplay between genetic variation and phenotypic expression. Analysis of whole genomes and life-history data of male black grouse shows that deleterious mutations, especially those in promotors, reduce lifetime reproductive success.},

Here we present a spatial description of the global, bathymetric and taxonomic extent of the benthic marine class Asteroidea using a compiled dataset of ~200,000 species-level occurrence records. We used these data to produce comparisons of sea-floor richness between hemispheres and oceans. We show that species richness is significantly correlated with temperature and nutrient flux despite markedly different distributional patterns across oceans and latitudes that suggest further influence from a combination of additional geographic, taxonomic and environmental factors. The relative importance of temperature and nutrient levels also varies greatly with depth. Species richness peaks in the shallow-water tropics, closely matching sea-floor temperature variation, but at bathyal and abyssal depths it is higher at temperate latitudes, where nutrient flux levels are of greater importance. We show that richness in the deep benthos is restricted below ~1.5 °C, with this strong thermal threshold consistent among oceans irrespective of other factors. Global trends in species richness in the deep sea are poorly explored. This study uses occurrence records of Asteroidea to show that species richness in the deep benthos is restricted below ~1.5 °C but correlated with temperature and nutrient flux, despite different patterns across oceans and latitudes.},

Here we quantify the impact of climate change on bird populations from across the world by combining models of their response to environmental conditions with a climate attribution framework. We identify a dominant role of intensified heat extremes compared to changes in average temperature and precipitation. Increased interannual exposure to hot extremes reduces annual abundance growth rates most strongly in lower-latitude tropical regions, with effects robust when controlling for changing human industrial pressure and other long-term drivers. Compared to a counterfactual without human-driven climate change, the historical intensification of heat extremes has caused a 25–38% reduction in the level of abundance of tropical birds, which has accumulated from 1950 to 2020. Across observed tropical bird populations, impacts of climate change have typically been larger than direct human pressure, the opposite across sub-tropical regions. Overall, these results showcase how human-driven climate change is already reshaping biodiversity globally and may explain reported declines of birds in undisturbed tropical habitats. Climate change poses a growing threat to biodiversity, but disentangling its overall impact from other anthropogenic stressors is challenging. Here the authors use a data-driven climate attribution framework to identify a key role of heat extremes in causing changes in bird populations globally.},

The vast size and remote location of the continent introduce substantial uncertainty in understanding and predicting these threats.

We identified ten emerging conservation challenges across six thematic categories. Key issues included extreme precipitation, emerging animal pathogens, human pandemics, security threats, reduced cooperation among Antarctic Treaty parties and potential agricultural expansion. Several of these challenges stem from persistent underlying drivers, revealing how longstanding processes are giving rise to new and increasingly acute conservation concerns. Others, driven by global disruptions, have no historical precedent in the region but increasingly constrain decision-making and international coordination. This horizon scan reveals substantial limitations in the ability of the Antarctic Treaty system to address these challenges, underscoring the need to reassess existing governance mechanisms to protect the unique ecosystems of Antarctica and its vital role in the global climate system. A horizon scan of international respondents identifies and discusses ten developing challenges in Antarctic conservation, revealing an increased emphasis on challenges related to governance, geopolitics and economics compared to a similar scan from 2012.},

Novel sources of data for analysing biodiversity change across time and space are urgently needed. By metabarcoding highly standardized biota samples from a long-term pollution monitoring archive in Germany, we here analyse four decades of community diversity for tens of thousands of species across the tree of life. The archived samples—tree leaves, marine macroalgae, and marine and limnic mussels—represent natural community DNA samplers, preserving a taxonomically diverse imprint of their associated biodiversity at the time of collection. We find no evidence for universal diversity declines at the local scale. Instead, a gradual compositional turnover emerges as a universal pattern of temporal biodiversity change in Germany’s terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This turnover results in biotic homogenization in most terrestrial and marine communities. Limnic communities, in contrast, rather differentiate across space, probably due to the immigration of different invasive species into different sites. Our study highlights the immense promise of alternative sample sources to provide standardized time series data of biodiversity change in the Anthropocene. This study explores four decades of biodiversity change across the tree of life in Germany’s terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems by sequencing standardized biota samples from a long-term pollution monitoring archive.},

  abstract     = {Terrestrial carbon (C) sink has long been recognized as trending upwards, yet its recent slowdown raises concerns about accelerating climate change. Variations in wetland C sequestration are hypothesized to play a key role in this shift. Here we mapped annual water levels in global wetlands from 2000 to 2020 using 2,295 field-based measurements and predicted the spatiotemporal pattern of wetland net ecosystem production (NEP) in conjunction with other environmental factors. By compiling 934 in situ observations, we estimated a global mean wetland NEP of 56.4 (44.0‒68.8) gC m−2 yr−1. Integrating the NEP dataset with environmental datasets and machine-learning models, we estimated the mean annual global wetland C sequestration between 2000 and 2020 to be 1,004 (961‒1,047) TgC, 70% of which originated from tropical wetlands. We observed a decline in global wetland C sinks until 2005, followed by an increase thereafter. Overall, wetland C sequestration was roughly stable during 2000‒2020, as gains in northern mid-to-high latitudes were fully overwhelmed by declines in the tropics and southern mid-to-high latitudes. Our findings highlight hydrological change as a dominant driver of increasing regional variability in wetland C sinks, while intensifying hydrological extremes under climate change may undermine the resilience of wetland C sinks and the ecosystem services they support. Here the authors identify hotspots for wetland carbon uptake and regions where wetland carbon sinks are most susceptible to hydrological shifts. They show that two decades of improved carbon sinks in northern mid- to high-latitude wetlands are offset by declining efficiencies elsewhere.},

  abstract     = {Forest age transitions are critical in shaping the global carbon balance, yet their influence on carbon stocks and fluxes remains poorly quantified. Here we analyse global forest age dynamics from 2010 to 2020 using the Global Age Mapping Integration v2.0 dataset, alongside satellite-derived aboveground carbon (AGC) and atmospheric inversion-derived net CO2 flux data. We reveal widespread declines in forest age across the Amazon, Congo Basin, Southeast Asia and parts of Siberia, primarily driven by stand-replacing disturbances such as fire and harvest, leading to the replacement of older forests by younger stands. Meanwhile, forests in China, Europe and North America experienced net ageing. Globally, stand replacement resulted in substantial AGC losses, with old forests (&gt;200 years, ~98.0 MgC ha−1) transitioning to younger, carbon-poor stands (&lt;20 years, ~43.5 MgC ha−1), leading to a net AGC loss of ~0.14 PgC per year. Despite this, regions with high rates of young stands replacing old forests exhibited a temporary strengthening of the carbon sink, driven by the rapid regrowth of these young stands. Crucially, these young forests do not compensate for the long-term carbon storage of old forests. Our findings underscore the importance of protecting old forests while optimizing forest management strategies to maximize carbon gains and enhance climate mitigation. A global analysis reveals regional trends of net forest ageing but also that widespread stand-replacing disturbances, such as fire and harvest, are driving declining forest age in many areas, often accompanied by substantial losses in aboveground carbon stocks and shifts in carbon sink dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Although numerous studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem stability, that is low temporal variability in ecosystem functions, the role of interspecific interactions in driving this relationship remains elusive. Here we develop a partitioning framework to disentangle the effects of interspecific interactions on ecosystem variability from those of interaction-independent processes. Applying this framework to competition models and biodiversity experiments in European and North American grasslands, we find that species-specific dynamics observable in monocultures (for example, environmental responses or demographic stochasticity), rather than interspecific interactions observable only in mixtures, explain much of the stabilizing effects of biodiversity on ecosystems. The weak net effect of interspecific interactions results from two counter-balancing effects: an interaction-driven increase in average species variability and an interaction-driven decrease in average species synchrony. We also find that interspecific interactions contributing to higher ecosystem functioning tend to reduce ecosystem variability. Our study provides a systematic empirical assessment of the role of interspecific interactions in shaping grassland ecosystem stability, challenging traditional assumptions about their importance and highlighting species-specific dynamics as the primary mechanism underlying the pervasive biodiversity–stability relationship. The role of interspecific interactions in biodiversity–ecosystem stability relationships is unclear. Here the authors develop a theoretical approach and show that empirical diversity–stability relationships in grasslands are best explained by species-specific dynamics rather than by interspecific interactions.},

  abstract     = {Understanding how plants adjust their hydraulic system to the environment is essential to predict how these organisms will respond to global change. Here we compiled a dataset and performed meta-analysis on 223 studies on plastic and evolutionary adjustments of hydraulic traits to air temperature, CO2 concentration, irradiance, soil nutrient and water availability. On average, species plastically increased embolism resistance and sapwood area per leaf area under drier conditions, with a decrease in stem-specific hydraulic conductivity and water potential at the turgor loss point, which are consistent with adaptive responses. However, the average increased embolism resistance was not sufficient to compensate the reduction in the minimum water potential, implying a lower safety margin from lethal hydraulic failure under drought. These results point towards a general critical increase in the risk of hydraulic failure in future drier environments. Plastic responses to increased soil nutrient content and irradiance did not always align with those to drought, highlighting the potential for changes in light and nutrient conditions to modify plant hydraulic responses to climate-change-driven droughts. Plants across many ecosystems are increasingly exposed to dryness stress. Using meta-analysis, the authors show that plants can adjust their hydraulic traits in response to drought and other global change factors, but not equally across traits and not enough to prevent lethal hydraulic failure.},

  abstract     = {Tree diversity often increases stand-level growth, but whether neighbourhood diversity effects on individual tree growth change with climatic conditions remains unclear. Here, using 852,170 records of 113,701 individuals from 129 species in 15 tree diversity experiments across four biomes, we address this knowledge gap with a synthesis of tree growth data spanning a broad climate gradient. We examine how neighbourhood-scale (defined as a focal tree and the adjacent trees) taxonomic and functional diversity effects on tree growth vary with climate, both spatially (across sites) and temporally (within sites). Increasing species richness and trait dissimilarity from monospecific to high-diversity neighbourhoods enhanced individual tree growth by 7–13% on average. The positive diversity effect increased from dry to wet climates, contrasting with most prior studies, but was unaffected by interannual climatic variation within sites. Given that tree–tree interactions are ubiquitous and likely to interact with climate in both young and old forests, our findings suggest incorporating neighbourhood diversity as a management tool to enhance forest productivity, while considering underlying mechanisms and interactions with climate, thereby facilitating targeted and site-specific climate and biodiversity benefits. How tree diversity effects on ecosystem functioning vary along climatic gradients is unclear. Here, analysing data from 15 experimental forest sites, the authors show that tree growth responses to neighbourhood species diversity are stronger in wetter climates but are unaffected by interannual climatic variation within sites.},

  abstract     = {Precipitation effects on plant carbon uptake extend beyond immediate timeframes, reflecting temporal lags between rainfall and plant growth. Mechanisms and relative importance of such lagged effects are expected to vary across ecosystems. Here we draw on an extensive collections of productivity proxies from long-term ground measurements, satellite observations and model simulations to show that preceding-year precipitation exerts a comparable influence on plant productivity to current-year precipitation. Statistically supported lagged precipitation effects are detected in 13.4%–19.7% of the grids depending on the data source. In these sites, preceding-year precipitation positively controls current-year plant productivity in water-limited areas, while negative effects occur in some wet regions, such as tropical forests. While aridity emerges as the main driver of this spatial variability, machine learning-based spatial attribution also indicates interactions among plant traits, climatic conditions and soil properties. We also show that soil water dynamics, plant phenology and foliar structure might mediate lagged precipitation effects across time. Our findings highlight the role of preceding-year precipitation in global plant productivity. Precipitation is a key driver of plant growth. Here the authors integrate ground-based observations, remote sensing and process-based models to disentangle the relative contribution of preceding-year and current-year precipitation on plant productivity and identify its predictors across biomes.},

  abstract     = {Vegetation responses to soil moisture limitation play a key role in land–atmosphere interactions and are a major source of uncertainty in future projections of the global water and carbon cycles. Vegetation water-use strategies—that is, how plants regulate transpiration rates as the soil dries—are highly dynamic across space and time, presenting a major challenge to inferring ecosystem responses to water limitation. Here we show that, when aggregated globally, water-use strategies derived from point-based soil moisture observations exhibit emergent patterns across and within climates and vegetation types along a spectrum of aggressive to conservative responses to water limitation. Water use becomes more conservative, declining more rapidly as the soil dries, as mean annual precipitation increases and as woody cover increases from grasslands to savannahs to forests. We embed this empirical synthesis within an ecohydrological framework to show that key ecological (leaf area) and hydroclimatic (aridity) factors driving demand for water explain up to 77% of the variance in water-use strategies within ecosystem types. All biomes respond to ecological and hydroclimatic demand by shifting towards more aggressive water-use strategies. However, woodlands reach a threshold beyond which water use becomes increasingly conservative, probably reflecting the greater hydraulic risk and cost of tissue damage associated with sustaining high transpiration rates under water limitation for trees than grasses. These findings highlight the importance of characterizing the dynamic nature of vegetation water-use strategies to improve predictions of ecosystem responses to climate change. Vegetation responses to water limitation are difficult to predict due to large variation across space and time. A new analysis of global soil moisture dynamics reveals that water-use strategies vary systematically by vegetation type in response to ecological and climatic conditions.},

  abstract     = {Few high-latitude archaeological contexts are older than marine isotope stage (MIS) 15 and even fewer provide evidence of early human occupation during a glacial period. New discoveries at Old Park, Canterbury (UK), provide evidence of both the oldest accessible artefact-bearing sediment in northern Europe and cold-stage adaptation. Radiometric and palaeomagnetic dating places the earliest suggested occupation of this site between 773 thousand years ago (ka) and 607 ka, with hominin presence inferred during MIS 17–16. Two additional artefact-bearing stratigraphic units, dated to around 542 ka and 437 ka, strongly align with the MIS 14 and 12 cold stages, respectively. The latter unit contains convincing evidence of glacial-stage occupation by Acheulean hominins; fresh, unabraded flakes (including biface-thinning) between clearly defined glacial-aged sediments displaying mixed grassland palaeoenvironmental evidence. An historically collected assemblage of more than 330 handaxes is argued to be derived from both the MIS 17–16 and MIS 12 sediments, providing evidence of the earliest known Acheulean bifaces in northern Europe, and re-occupation by Acheulean populations 200,000 years later. Together, Old Park provides evidence for Lower Palaeolithic hominins reoccupying a location over several mid-Pleistocene MIS cycles, early human presence above 51° latitude during a glacial stage and handaxe production in northern Europe from MIS 17 to 16. The authors report Acheulean hominin occupation of eastern Britain during glacial marine isotope stages 17–16 and again in glacial marine isotope stage 12 via stone tools in sediments dated to 712,000 to 424,000 years ago.},

Despite the importance of such host–microbiota relationships, relatively little is known about the role microbiotas have in mediating evolution of the host and entire host–microbe assemblages. This knowledge gap is partly due to the lack of theoretical frameworks that generate testable predictions on the evolutionary dynamics of host–microbiota systems. In this Perspective, we argue that the foundation for such frameworks exists in evolutionary theory. We highlight four examples of theoretical models—niche construction, indirect genetic effects, maternal effects and multilevel selection—that capture important aspects of host–microbiome evolution. We outline how each of these frameworks can provide key insights into the evolution of host–microbiota systems while also suggesting expansions of current theory to incorporate processes unique to host–microbe assemblages; for instance, focusing on nuances in microbiota transmission and ecological microbial community dynamics. Expanding evolutionary theory to accommodate host–microbiota associations is key for a more integrative understanding of evolution, and the approach outlined here can guide future empirical research on the function and evolution of these ubiquitous interactions. This Perspective discusses how well-established theoretical models of evolution can be adapted to study and generate testable predictions about the evolutionary dynamics of host–microbiota associations.},

  abstract     = {Unlike human-engineered systems, such as aeroplanes, for which the role and dependencies of each component are well understood, the inner workings of artificial intelligence models remain largely opaque, which hinders verifiability and undermines trust. Current approaches to neural network interpretability, including input attribution methods, probe-based analysis and activation visualization techniques, typically provide limited insights about the role of individual components or require extensive manual interpretation that cannot scale with model complexity. This paper introduces SemanticLens, a universal explanation method for neural networks that maps hidden knowledge encoded by components (for example, individual neurons) into the semantically structured, multimodal space of a foundation model such as CLIP. In this space, unique operations become possible, including (1) textual searches to identify neurons encoding specific concepts, (2) systematic analysis and comparison of model representations, (3) automated labelling of neurons and explanation of their functional roles, and (4) audits to validate decision-making against requirements. Fully scalable and operating without human input, SemanticLens is shown to be effective for debugging and validation, summarizing model knowledge, aligning reasoning with expectations (for example, adherence to the ABCDE rule in melanoma classification) and detecting components tied to spurious correlations and their associated training data. By enabling component-level understanding and validation, the proposed approach helps mitigate the opacity that limits confidence in artificial intelligence systems compared to traditional engineered systems, enabling more reliable deployment in critical applications. SemanticLens is a tool that embeds artificial intelligence model components (such as neurons) into a searchable, human-understandable space. This enables automated auditing, validation of decisions and detection of problematic behaviours with minimal human oversight.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence has transformed the field of precise organic synthesis. Data-driven methods, including machine learning and deep learning, have shown great promise in predicting reaction performance and synthesis planning. However, the inherent methodological divergence between numerical regression-driven reaction performance prediction and sequence generation-based synthesis planning creates formidable challenges in constructing a unified deep learning architecture. Here we present RXNGraphormer, a framework to jointly address these tasks through a unified pre-training approach. By synergizing graph neural networks for intramolecular pattern recognition with Transformer-based models for intermolecular interaction modelling, and training on 13 million reactions via a carefully designed strategy, RXNGraphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight benchmark datasets for reactivity or selectivity prediction and forward-synthesis or retrosynthesis planning, as well as three external realistic datasets for reactivity and selectivity prediction. Notably, the model generates chemically meaningful embeddings that spontaneously cluster reactions by type without explicit supervision. This work bridges the critical gap between performance prediction and synthesis planning tasks in chemical AI, offering a versatile tool for accurate reaction prediction and synthesis design. Xu et al. present RXNGraphormer, a pre-trained model that learns bond transformation patterns from over 13 million reactions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in reaction performance prediction and synthesis planning.},

  abstract     = {Molecular docking plays a crucial role in structure-based drug discovery, enabling the prediction of how small molecules interact with protein targets. Traditional docking methods rely on scoring functions and search heuristics, whereas recent generative approaches, such as DiffDock, leverage deep learning for pose prediction. However, blind-diffusion-based docking often struggles with binding site localization and pose accuracy, particularly in complex protein–ligand systems. This work introduces GeoDirDock (GDD), a guided diffusion approach to molecular docking that enhances the accuracy and physical plausibility of ligand docking predictions. GDD guides the denoising process of a diffusion model along geodesic paths within multiple spaces representing translational, rotational and torsional degrees of freedom. Our method leverages expert knowledge to direct the generative modelling process, specifically targeting desired protein–ligand interaction regions. We demonstrate that GDD outperforms existing blind docking methods in terms of root mean squared distance accuracy and physicochemical pose realism. Our results indicate that incorporating domain expertise into the diffusion process leads to more biologically relevant docking predictions. Additionally, we explore the potential of GDD as a template-based modelling tool for lead optimization in drug discovery through angle transfer in maximum common substructure docking, showcasing its capability to accurately predict ligand orientations for chemically similar compounds. Future applications in real-world drug discovery campaigns will naturally continue to refine and extend the utility of prior-informed diffusion docking methods. GeoDirDock is a framework that guides the denoising process of a generative diffusion docking model along geodesic paths within multiple spaces representing translational, rotational and torsional degrees of freedom.

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) models are powerful tools for detecting complex patterns, yet their ‘black-box’ nature limits their interpretability, hindering their use in critical domains like healthcare and finance. Interpretable ML methods aim to explain how features influence model predictions but often focus on univariate feature importance, overlooking complex feature interactions. Although recent efforts extend interpretability to feature interactions, existing approaches struggle with robustness and error control, especially under data perturbations. In this study, we introduce Diamond, a method for trustworthy feature interaction discovery. Diamond uniquely integrates the model-X knockoffs framework to control the false discovery rate, ensuring a low proportion of falsely detected interactions. Diamond includes a non-additivity distillation procedure that refines existing interaction importance measures to isolate non-additive interaction effects and preserve false discovery rate control. This approach addresses the limitations of off-the-shelf interaction measures, which, when used naively, can lead to inaccurate discoveries. Diamond’s applicability spans a broad class of ML models, including deep neural networks, transformers, tree-based models and factorization-based models. Empirical evaluations on both simulated and real datasets across various biomedical studies demonstrate its utility in enabling reliable data-driven scientific discoveries. Diamond represents a significant step forward in leveraging ML for scientific innovation and hypothesis generation. Diamond, a statistically rigorous method, is capable of finding meaningful feature interactions within machine learning models, making black-box models more interpretable for science and medicine.},

  abstract     = {Discovering novel drug candidate molecules is a fundamental step in drug development. Generative deep learning models can sample new molecular structures from learned probability distributions; however, their practical use in drug discovery hinges on generating compounds tailored to a specific target molecule. Here we introduce DrugGEN, an end-to-end generative system for the de novo design of drug candidate molecules that interact with a selected protein. The proposed method represents molecules as graphs and processes them using a generative adversarial network that comprises graph transformer layers. Trained on large datasets of drug-like compounds and target-specific bioactive molecules, DrugGEN designed candidate inhibitors for AKT1, a kinase crucial in many cancers. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the generated compounds effectively bind to AKT1, and attention maps provide insights into the model’s reasoning. Furthermore, selected de novo molecules were synthesized and shown to inhibit AKT1 at low micromolar concentrations in the context of in vitro enzymatic assays. These results demonstrate the potential of DrugGEN for designing target-specific molecules. Using the open-access DrugGEN codebase, researchers can retrain the model for other druggable proteins, provided a dataset of known bioactive molecules is available. Inhibiting AKT1 kinase can have potentially positive uses against many types of cancer. To find novel molecules targeting this protein, a graph adversarial network is trained as a generative model.},

To significantly increase the BCI performance, we use shared autonomy, where artificial intelligence (AI) copilots collaborate with BCI users to achieve task goals. We demonstrate this AI-BCI in a non-invasive BCI system decoding electroencephalography signals. We first contribute a hybrid adaptive decoding approach using a convolutional neural network and ReFIT-like Kalman filter, enabling healthy users and a participant with paralysis to control computer cursors and robotic arms via decoded electroencephalography signals. We then design two AI copilots to aid BCI users in a cursor control task and a robotic arm pick-and-place task. We demonstrate AI-BCIs that enable a participant with paralysis to achieve 3.9-times-higher performance in target hit rate during cursor control and control a robotic arm to sequentially move random blocks to random locations, a task they could not do without an AI copilot. As AI copilots improve, BCIs designed with shared autonomy may achieve higher performance. AI copilots are integrated into brain–computer interfaces, enabling a paralysed participant to achieve improved control of computer cursors and robotic arms. This shared autonomy approach offers a promising path to increase BCI performance and clinical viability.},

  abstract     = {Despite recent advances in T cell receptor (TCR) engineering, designing functional TCRs against arbitrary targets remains challenging due to complex rules governing cross-reactivity and limited paired data. Here we present TCR-TRANSLATE, a sequence-to-sequence framework that adapts low-resource machine translation techniques to generate antigen-specific TCR sequences against unseen epitopes. By evaluating 12 model variants of the BART and T5 model architectures, we identified key factors affecting performance and utility, revealing discordances between these objectives. Our flagship model, TCRT5, outperforms existing approaches on computational benchmarks, prioritizing functionally relevant sequences at higher ranks. Most significantly, we experimentally validated a computationally designed TCR against Wilms’ tumour antigen, a therapeutically relevant target in leukaemia, excluded from our training and validation sets. Although the identified TCR shows cross-reactivity with pathogen-derived peptides, highlighting limitations in specificity, our work represents the successful computational design of a functional TCR construct against a non-viral epitope from the target sequence alone. Our findings establish a foundation for computational TCR design and reveal current limitations in data availability and methodology, providing a framework for accelerating personalized immunotherapy by reducing the search space for novel targets. TCR-TRANSLATE, a deep learning framework adapting machine translation to immune design, demonstrates the successful generation of a functional T cell receptor sequence for a cancer epitope from the target sequence alone.},

Models of the cochlea are highly accurate and widely used, but models of the auditory brain lag far behind in both performance and penetration. Here we present ICNet, a convolutional encoder–decoder model of neural coding in the inferior colliculus. We developed ICNet using large-scale intracranial recordings from anaesthetized gerbils, addressing three key modelling challenges that are common across all sensory systems: capturing the full statistical structure of neuronal response patterns; accounting for physiological and experimental non-stationarity; and extracting features of sensory processing that are shared across different brains. ICNet provides highly accurate simulation of multi-unit neural responses to a wide range of complex sounds, including near-perfect responses to speech. It also reproduces key neurophysiological phenomena such as forward masking and dynamic range adaptation. ICNet can be used to simulate activity from thousands of neural units or to provide a compact representation of early central auditory processing through its latent dynamics, facilitating a wide range of hearing and audio applications. It can also serve as a foundation core, providing a baseline neural representation for models of active listening or higher-level auditory processing. Drakopoulos et al. present a model that captures the transformation from sound waves to neural activity patterns underlying early auditory processing. The model reproduces neural responses to a range of complex sounds and key neurophysiological phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) deciphers genome-wide chromatin accessibility, providing profound insights into gene regulation mechanisms. With the rapid advance of sequencing technologies, scATAC-seq data typically encompass numerous samples from various conditions, resulting in complex batch effects, thus necessitating reliable integration tools. While numerous batch integration tools exist for single-cell RNA sequencing data, inherent data characteristic differences limit their effectiveness on scATAC-seq data. Existing integration methods for scATAC-seq data suffer from several fundamental limitations, such as disrupting the biological heterogeneity and focusing solely on low-dimensional correction, which may distort data and hinder downstream analysis. Here we propose Fountain, a deep learning framework for scATAC-seq data integration via rigorous barycentric mapping. Barycentric mapping transforms one data distribution to another in a principled and effective manner through optimal transport. By regularizing barycentric mapping with geometric data information, Fountain achieves accurate batch alignment while preserving biological heterogeneity. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of Fountain over existing methods in batch correction and biological conservation. In addition, the trained Fountain model can integrate data from new batches alongside already integrated data without retraining, enabling continuous online data integration. Moreover, Fountain’s reconstruction strategy generates batch-corrected ATAC profiles, improving the capture of cellular heterogeneity and revealing cell-type-specific implications such as expression enrichment analysis and partitioned heritability analysis. Zhu, Hua and Chen propose Fountain, a deep learning framework for batch integration of scATAC-seq data that utilizes regularized barycentric mapping. It preserves biological heterogeneity, enabling online and original dimensionality integration.},

In addition to strong performance on benchmark datasets, μProtein identified high-gain-of-function multi-point mutants for the enzyme β-lactamase, surpassing one of the highest-known activity levels, in wet laboratory, trained solely on single-mutation data. These results demonstrate μProtein’s capability to discover impactful mutations across the vast protein sequence space, offering a robust, efficient approach for protein optimization. μProtein, combining deep learning and reinforcement learning, is developed to design high-function proteins.

Therefore, there is considerable interest in computationally designing proteins with specified properties. Protein structure generative models provide a means to design protein structures in a controllable manner and have been successfully applied to address various protein design tasks. Such models are paired with protein sequence and structure predictors to produce and select protein sequences for experimental testing. However, current protein structure generators face important limitations for proteins with more than 400 amino acids and require retraining for protein design tasks unseen during model training. To address the first issue, we introduce salad, a family of sparse all-atom denoising models for protein structure generation. Our models are smaller and faster than the state of the art and matching or improving design quality, successfully generating structures for protein lengths up to 1,000 amino acids. To address the second issue, we combine salad with structure editing, a sampling strategy for expanding the capability of protein denoising models to unseen tasks. We apply our approach to a variety of challenging protein design tasks, from generating protein scaffolds containing functional protein motifs (motif scaffolding) to designing proteins capable of adopting multiple distinct folds under different conditions (multi-state protein design), demonstrating the flexibility of salad and structure editing. A small and fast diffusion model is presented, which is able to efficiently generate long protein backbones.},

  abstract     = {Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for learning meaningful representations from large-scale unlabelled datasets in single-cell genomics. Richter et al. evaluated SSL pretext tasks on modelling single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, demonstrating the effective use of SSL models. However, the transferability of these pretrained SSL models to the spatial transcriptomics domain remains unexplored. Here we assess the performance of three SSL models (random mask, gene programme mask and Barlow Twins) pretrained on scRNA-seq data with spatial transcriptomics datasets, focusing on cell-type prediction and spatial clustering. Our experiments demonstrate that the SSL model with random mask strategy exhibits the best overall performance among evaluated SSL models. Moreover, the models trained from scratch on spatial transcriptomics data outperform the fine-tuned SSL models on cell-type prediction, highlighting a domain gap between scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data whose underlying causes remain an open question. Through expanded analyses of multiple imputation methods and data degradation scenarios, we demonstrate that gene imputation would degrade SSL model performance on cell-type prediction, an effect that is exacerbated by increasing data sparsity. Finally, integrating zero-shot random mask embeddings into chosen spatial clustering methods significantly enhanced their accuracy. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the limitations and potential of transferring SSL models to spatial transcriptomics and offer practical guidance for researchers leveraging pretrained models for spatial transcriptomics data analysis. Self-supervised learning models for single-cell RNA sequencing data exhibit poor transferability to spatial transcriptomics for cell-type prediction, although their learned features may enhance spatial analysis.},

  abstract     = {Protein language models are trained to predict amino acid sequences from vast protein databases and learn to represent proteins as feature vectors. These vector representations have enabled impressive applications, from predicting mutation effects to protein folding. One of the reasons offered for the success of these models is that conserved sequence motifs tend to be important for protein fitness. Yet, the relationship between sequence conservation and fitness can be confounded by the evolutionary and environmental context. Should we, therefore, look to other data sources that may contain more direct functional information? In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study examining the effects of training protein models to predict 19 types of text annotation from UniProt. Our results show that fine-tuning protein models on a subset of these annotations enhances the models’ predictive capabilities on a variety of function prediction tasks. In particular, when evaluated on our tasks, our model outperforms the basic local alignment search tool, which none of the pretrained protein models accomplished. Our results suggest that a much wider array of data modalities, such as text annotations, may be tapped to improve protein language models. Although protein language models have enabled major advances, they often rely on indirect signals that may not fully capture functional relevance. Fine-tuning these models on textual annotations is shown to improve their performance on function prediction tasks.},

Although upper limb wearable robots hold considerable promise for functional restoration, most existing prototypes have been validated minimally in people with SCI and target almost exclusively hand opening and closing. We introduce a lightweight, modular assistive soft exosuit that simultaneously and automatically supports shoulder abduction and elbow flexion or extension movements using lightweight fabric-based pneumatic actuators, controlled through inertial sensors. The individual elbow modules were first validated in 11 healthy volunteers, and subsequently tested, together with the shoulder module, in 15 individuals with cervical SCI (C4–C7, AIS A–D). In the SCI participants, exosuits assistance resulted in increased static endurance time (by more than 250%), and lower activity of the primary muscles involved in dynamic tasks (by up to 50%). The two SCI participants retaining prehensile capability also improved their scores in the box and block test when assisted. Moreover, the soft actuation provided a safe, comfortable and easy-to-use solution that was positively appreciated by the participants. Collectively, these results provide encouraging evidence that exosuits can augment upper limb motor performance, and may ultimately translate into greater functional independence and quality of life for the SCI population. A lightweight, modular assistive soft exosuit is introduced, which supports shoulder and elbow movement in individuals with cervical spinal cord injury.

The responsible use of AI and its participation in human–AI teams increasingly shows the need for AI alignment, that is, to make AI systems act according to our preferences. A crucial yet often overlooked aspect of these interactions is the different ways in which humans and machines generalize. In cognitive science, human generalization commonly involves abstraction and concept learning. By contrast, AI generalization encompasses out-of-domain generalization in machine learning, rule-based reasoning in symbolic AI, and abstraction in neurosymbolic AI. Here we combine insights from AI and cognitive science to identify key commonalities and differences across three dimensions: notions of, methods for, and evaluation of generalization. We map the different conceptualizations of generalization in AI and cognitive science along these three dimensions and consider their role for alignment in human–AI teaming. This results in interdisciplinary challenges across AI and cognitive science that must be tackled to support effective and cognitively supported alignment in human–AI teaming scenarios. Ilievski et al. examine differences and similarities in the various ways human and AI systems generalize. The insights are important for effectively supporting alignment in human–AI teams.},

  abstract     = {The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) anchors a conserved signalling pathway that regulates growth in response to nutrient availability1–5. Amino acids activate mTORC1 through the Rag GTPases, which are regulated by GATOR, a supercomplex consisting of GATOR1, KICSTOR and the nutrient-sensing hub GATOR2 (refs. 6–9). GATOR2 forms an octagonal cage, with its distinct WD40 domain β-propellers interacting with GATOR1 and the leucine sensors Sestrin1&nbsp;and Sestrin2&nbsp;(SESN1 and SESN2) and the arginine sensor&nbsp;CASTOR1 (ref. 10). The mechanisms through which these sensors regulate GATOR2 and how they detach from it upon binding their cognate amino acids remain unknown. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we determined the structures of a stabilized GATOR2 bound to either Sestrin2 or CASTOR1. The sensors occupy distinct and non-overlapping binding sites, disruption of which selectively impairs the ability of mTORC1 to sense individual amino acids. We also resolved the apo (leucine-free) structure of Sestrin2 and characterized the amino acid-induced structural rearrangements within Sestrin2 and CASTOR1 that trigger their dissociation from GATOR2. Binding of either sensor restricts the dynamic WDR24 β-propeller of GATOR2, a domain essential for nutrient-dependent mTORC1 activation. These findings reveal the allosteric mechanisms that convey amino acid sufficiency to GATOR2 and the ensuing structural changes that lead to mTORC1 activation. Using cryo-electron microscopy, the interactions of Sestrin2 and CASTOR1 with GATOR2 were resolved, revealing how mTORC1 activation is regulated and how nutrient availability triggers signalling for cellular growth.},

However, the complexity of the structural features that determine protein–protein interactions makes their design challenging. Here we present BindCraft, an open-source and automated pipeline for de novo protein binder design with experimental success rates of 10–100%. BindCraft leverages the weights of AlphaFold2 (ref. 1) to generate binders with nanomolar affinity without the need for high-throughput screening or experimental optimization, even in the absence of known binding sites. We successfully designed binders against a diverse set of challenging targets, including cell-surface receptors, common allergens, de novo designed proteins and multi-domain nucleases, such as CRISPR–Cas9. We showcase the functional and therapeutic potential of designed binders by reducing IgE binding to birch allergen in patient-derived samples, modulating Cas9 gene editing activity and reducing the cytotoxicity of a foodborne bacterial enterotoxin. Last, we use cell-surface-receptor-specific binders to redirect adeno-associated virus capsids for targeted gene delivery. This work represents a significant advancement towards a ‘one design-one binder’ approach in computational design, with immense potential in therapeutics, diagnostics and biotechnology.

  abstract     = {Eukaryotic cells produce over 1,000 different lipid species that tune organelle membrane properties, control signalling and store energy1,2. How lipid species are selectively sorted between organelles to maintain specific membrane identities is largely unclear, owing to the difficulty of imaging lipid transport in cells3. Here we measured the&nbsp;retrograde transport and metabolism of individual lipid species in mammalian cells using time-resolved fluorescence imaging of bifunctional lipid probes in combination with ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry and mathematical modelling. Quantification of lipid flux between organelles revealed that directional, non-vesicular lipid transport is responsible for fast, species-selective lipid sorting, in contrast to the slow, unspecific vesicular membrane trafficking. Using genetic perturbations, we found that coupling between energy-dependent lipid flipping and non-vesicular transport is a mechanism for directional lipid transport. Comparison of metabolic conversion and transport rates showed that non-vesicular transport dominates the organelle distribution of lipids, while species-specific phospholipid metabolism controls neutral lipid accumulation. Our results provide the first quantitative map of retrograde lipid flux in cells4. We anticipate that our pipeline for mapping of lipid flux through physical and chemical space in cells will boost our understanding of lipids in cell biology and disease.

  abstract     = {Perineural invasion (PNI) is a well-established factor of poor prognosis in multiple cancer types1, yet its mechanism remains unclear. Here we provide clinical and mechanistic insights into the role of PNI and cancer-induced nerve injury (CINI) in resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our study demonstrates that PNI and CINI of tumour-associated nerves are associated with poor response to anti-PD-1 therapy among patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and gastric cancer. Electron microscopy and electrical conduction analyses reveal that cancer cells degrade the nerve fibre myelin sheets. The injured neurons respond by autonomously initiating IL-6- and type I interferon-mediated&nbsp;inflammation to promote nerve healing and regeneration. As the tumour grows, the CINI burden increases, and&nbsp;its associated inflammation becomes chronic and skews the general immune tone within the tumour microenvironment into a suppressive and exhaustive state. The CINI-driven anti-PD-1 resistance can be reversed by targeting multiple steps in the CINI signalling process: denervating the tumour, conditional knockout of the transcription factor mediating the injury signal within neurons (Atf3), knockout of interferon-α receptor signalling (Ifnar1−/−) or by combining anti-PD-1 and anti-IL-6-receptor blockade. Our findings demonstrate the direct immunoregulatory roles of CINI and its therapeutic potential. Perineural invasion and cancer-induced nerve injury of tumour-associated nerves are associated with poor response to anti-PD-1 therapy, which can be reversed by combining anti-PD-1 therapy with&nbsp;anti-inflammatory interventions.},

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and highly therapy-resistant brain tumour1,2. Although advanced disease has been intensely investigated, the mechanisms that underpin the earlier, likely more tractable, stages of GBM development remain poorly understood. Here we identify axonal injury as a key driver of GBM progression, which we find is induced in white matter by early tumour cells preferentially expanding in this region. Mechanistically, axonal injury promotes gliomagenesis by triggering Wallerian degeneration, a targetable active programme of axonal death3, which we show increases neuroinflammation and tumour proliferation. Inactivation of SARM1, the key enzyme activated in response to injury that mediates Wallerian degeneration4, was sufficient to break this tumour-promoting feedforward loop, leading to the development of less advanced terminal tumours and prolonged survival in mice. Thus, targeting the tumour-induced injury microenvironment may supress progression from latent to advanced disease, thereby providing a potential strategy for GBM interception and control. Axonal injury, induced in the white matter by expansion of early tumour cells, is a key driver of glioblastoma progression.},

  abstract     = {B-1 cells are innate-like immune cells abundant in serosal cavities with antibodies enriched in bacterial recognition, yet their existence in humans has been controversial1–3. The CD5+ B-1a subset expresses anti-inflammatory molecules including IL-10, PDL1 and CTLA4 and can be immunoregulatory4–6. Unlike conventional B cells that are continuously replenished, B-1a cells are produced early in life and maintained through self-renewal7. Here we show that the transcription factors TCF1 and LEF1 are critical regulators of B-1a cells. LEF1 expression is highest in fetal and bone marrow B-1 progenitors, whereas the levels of TCF1 are higher in splenic and peritoneal B-1 cells than in B-1 progenitors. TCF1–LEF1 double deficient mice have reduced B-1a cells and defective B-1a cell maintenance. These transcription factors promote MYC-dependent metabolic pathways and induce a stem-like population upon activation, partly via IL-10 production. In the absence of TCF1 and LEF1, B-1 cells proliferate excessively and acquire an exhausted phenotype with reduced IL-10 and PDL1 expression. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of B-1 cells lacking TCF1 and LEF1 fails to suppress brain inflammation. These transcription factors are also expressed in human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia B cells and in a B-1-like population that is abundant in pleural fluid and circulation of some patients with pleural infection. Our findings define a TCF1–LEF1-driven transcriptional program that integrates stemness and regulatory function in B-1a cells. The transcription factors TCF1 and LEF1 promote self-renewal and regulatory functions in B-1a cells.},

  abstract     = {The nine human herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, human cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus, present a significant burden to global public health1. Their envelopes contain at least ten different glycoproteins, which are necessary for host cell tropism, attachment and entry2. The best conserved among them, glycoprotein B (gB), is essential as it performs membrane fusion by undergoing extensive rearrangements from a prefusion to postfusion conformation. At present, there are no antiviral drugs targeting gB or neutralizing antibodies directed against its prefusion form, because of the difficulty in structurally determining and using this metastable conformation. Here we show the isolation of prefusion-specific nanobodies, one of which exhibits strong neutralizing and cross-species activity. By mutational stabilization we solved the herpes simplex virus 1 gB full-length prefusion structure, which allowed the bound epitope to be determined. Our analyses show the membrane-embedded regions of gB and previously unresolved structural features3,4, including a new fusion loop arrangement, providing insights into the initial conformational changes required for membrane fusion. Binding an epitope spanning three domains, proximal only in the prefusion state, the nanobody keeps wild-type HSV-2 gB in this conformation and enabled its native prefusion structure to be determined. This also indicates the mode of neutralization and an attractive avenue for antiviral interventions. A neutralizing nanobody specific to the prefusion conformation of herpes simplex virus glycoprotein B has cross-species activity and offers insights into virus neutralization, possible immunogens and an attractive avenue for antiviral interventions.},

Here we identify and characterize the N-acyl-cyclolysine (ACL) system—a cell-density-dependent chemical signalling system specific to and widespread in the phylum Bacteroidota (formerly Bacteroidetes)—and show that it regulates the expression of co-localized operons encoding diverse secreted molecules. Using genetic and biochemical analyses, combined with structural studies of a key biosynthetic enzyme, AclA, we elucidate the molecular structure of various ACLs and their complete biosynthetic pathway involving l-lysine acylation and ATP-dependent cyclization. Furthermore, we find that secreted ACLs are sensed by a dedicated transcription factor, AclR, resulting in the expression of associated operons and the autoinduction of ACL biosynthesis. Moreover, we show that different Bacteroidota strains produce structurally diverse ACLs and encode transcription factors with varying ligand specificities. Finally, we find that the acl circuit is widely distributed and transcribed in human gut and oral microbiome samples, with clear evidence for an active role in regulating associated operons under host colonization conditions. Understanding the function of the ACL system in different contexts has the potential to reveal details about the biology, ecology and chemistry of the Bacteroidota and how members of this phylum interact with their environments and hosts. The N-acyl-cyclolysine system regulates the expression of co-localized operons encoding diverse secreted molecules in Bacteroidota.},

  abstract     = {The brain avidly consumes glucose to fuel neurophysiology1. Cancers of the brain, such as glioblastoma, relinquish physiological integrity and gain the ability to proliferate and invade healthy tissue2. How brain cancers rewire glucose use to drive aggressive growth remains unclear. Here we infused 13C-labelled glucose into patients and mice with brain cancer, coupled with quantitative metabolic flux analysis, to map the fates of glucose-derived carbon in tumour versus cortex. Through direct and comprehensive measurements of carbon and nitrogen labelling in both cortex and glioma tissues, we identify profound metabolic transformations. In the human cortex, glucose carbons fuel essential physiological processes, including tricarboxylic acid cycle oxidation and neurotransmitter synthesis. Conversely, gliomas downregulate these processes and scavenge alternative carbon sources such as amino acids from the environment, repurposing glucose-derived carbons to generate molecules needed for proliferation and invasion. Targeting this metabolic rewiring in mice through dietary amino acid modulation selectively alters glioblastoma metabolism, slows tumour growth and augments the efficacy of standard-of-care treatments. These findings illuminate how aggressive brain tumours exploit glucose to suppress normal physiological activity in favour of malignant expansion and offer potential therapeutic strategies to enhance treatment outcomes. The cortex fuels essential physiological processes with glucose-derived carbon, while gliomas fuel their aggressiveness by rerouting glucose carbon pathways and scavenging alternative carbon sources such as&nbsp;environmental amino acids, providing&nbsp;a potential therapeutic target.},

  abstract     = {Polyamines are regulatory metabolites with key roles in transcription, translation, cell signalling and autophagy1. They are implicated in multiple neurological disorders, including stroke, epilepsy and neurodegeneration, and can regulate neuronal excitability through interactions with ion channels2. Polyamines have been linked to pain, showing altered levels in human persistent pain states and modulation of pain behaviour in animal models3. However, the systems governing polyamine transport within the nervous system remain unclear. Here, undertaking a genome-wide association study (GWAS)&nbsp;of chronic pain intensity in the UK&nbsp;Biobank&nbsp;(UKB), we found a significant association between pain intensity and variants mapping to the SLC45A4 gene locus. In the mouse nervous system, Slc45a4 expression is enriched in all sensory neuron subtypes within the dorsal root ganglion, including nociceptors. Cell-based assays show that SLC45A4 is a selective plasma membrane polyamine transporter, and the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure reveals a regulatory domain and basis for polyamine recognition. Mice lacking SLC45A4 show normal mechanosensitivity but reduced sensitivity to noxious heat- and algogen-induced tonic pain that is associated with reduced excitability of C-polymodal nociceptors. Our findings therefore establish a role for neuronal polyamine transport in pain perception and identify a target for therapeutic intervention in pain treatment. The SLC45A4 gene encodes a neuronal polyamine transporter and is linked to pain response in humans and mice.},

  abstract     = {Internal motive states, such as sexual arousal, drive behaviour in response to social cues. However, little is known about how internal states and external cues are integrated to release appropriate behaviours at the correct moment during a social interaction, such as the transition from the appetitive to the consummatory phases of mating1,2. Here we identify a neural circuit in male mice that gates the onset of consummatory reproductive behaviours on contact with a mating partner. Stimulating MPOAEsr1∩Vgat hypothalamic neurons promotes mounting of conspecifics and three-dimensional dummy objects3. We find that such mounting depends on mechanosensory but not visual cues. Through a large-scale electrophysiological screen, we identify neurons in the subparafascicular thalamic nucleus that nonlinearly integrate medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus (MPOA) and mechanosensory input to encode contact with a potential mate. Circuit tracing and perturbations demonstrated that this conjunctive coding occurs by means of convergent disinhibition from MPOA and excitation from the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Functional manipulations and calcium recordings showed these social-contact neurons, marked by parathyroid hormone 2, were essential for and able to promote mounting. These data indicate that subparafascicular thalamic nucleus-parathyroid hormone 2 neurons integrate internal drive with social touch to trigger mounting at opportune moments during mating. More generally, our findings uncover a brain mechanism whereby an internal state can attribute a social quality to a generic touch to initiate purposeful reproductive actions.

  abstract     = {The second half of the first millennium ce in Central and Eastern Europe was accompanied by fundamental cultural and political transformations. This period of change is commonly associated with the appearance of the Slavs, which is supported by textual evidence1,2 and coincides with the emergence of similar archaeological horizons3–6. However, so far there has been no consensus on whether this archaeological horizon spread by migration, Slavicisation or a combination of both. Genetic data remain sparse, especially owing to the widespread practice of cremation in the early phase of the Slavic settlement. Here we present genome-wide data from 555 ancient individuals, including 359 samples from Slavic contexts from as early as the seventh century ce. Our data demonstrate large-scale population movement from Eastern Europe during the sixth to eighth centuries, replacing more than 80% of the local gene pool in Eastern Germany, Poland and Croatia. Yet, we also show substantial regional heterogeneity as well as a lack of sex-biased admixture, indicating varying degrees of cultural assimilation of the autochthonous populations. Comparing archaeological and genetic evidence, we find that the change in ancestry in Eastern Germany coincided with a change in social organization, characterized by an intensification of inter- and intra-site genetic relatedness and patrilocality. On the European scale, it appears plausible that the changes in material culture and language between the sixth and eighth centuries were connected to these large-scale population movements. Analyses of ancient human DNA show that cultural and political transformations in Central Europe during the second half of the first millennium ce were associated with movements of Slavic populations into Germany, Poland and Croatia.},

Previously, the oldest indication of hominins in Wallacea, the oceanic island zone east of Sunda, comprised flaked stone artefacts deposited at least 1.02 ± 0.02 million years ago (Ma) at Wolo Sege on Flores5. Early hominins were also established on the oceanic island of Luzon (Philippines), as indicated by both stone artefacts and cut marks on faunal remains dating to between 777 and 631 thousand years ago (ka) at Kalinga6. Moreover, fossils of extinct, small-bodied hominins occur on Flores (Homo floresiensis)7–12 and Luzon (Homo luzonensis)13. On Sulawesi, the largest Wallacean island, previous excavations revealed stone artefacts with a minimum age of 194 ka at the open site of Talepu in the Walanae Depression14, long preceding the earliest known presence of modern humans (Homo sapiens) in the region (73–63 ka in Sunda)15. Here we show that stone artefacts also occur at the nearby site of Calio in fossiliferous layers dated to at least 1.04 Ma and possibly up to 1.48 Ma, using palaeomagnetic dating of sedimentary rocks and coupled Uranium-series (U-series) and electron-spin resonance (US–ESR) dating of fossil teeth.

Frequent flowering dearth periods and high-density rearing conditions weaken colonies, which often leads to their demise2. Beekeepers provide colonies with pollen substitutes, but these feeds do not sustain brood production because they lack essential sterols found in pollen3,4. Here we describe a technological advance in honeybee nutrition with wide-reaching impacts on global food security. We first measured the quantity and proportion of sterols present in honeybee tissues. Using this information, we genetically engineered a strain of the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica to produce a mixture of essential sterols for bees and incorporated this&nbsp;yeast strain into an otherwise nutritionally complete diet. Colonies exclusively fed with this diet reared brood for significantly longer than those fed diets without suitable sterols. The use of this method to incorporate sterol supplements into pollen substitutes will enable honeybee colonies to produce brood in the absence of floral pollen. Optimized diets created using this yeast strain could also reduce competition between bee species for access to natural floral resources and stem the decline in wild bee populations.

  abstract     = {The Great Fear of 1789, a wave of panic and unrest in rural France fuelled by the spreading of rumours, was an important moment at the onset of the French Revolution, marking the collapse of feudalism and the rise of the new regime1. The Great Fear provides a vivid example of the role the spreading of rumours has in driving political changes that might be relevant today2,3. Here, we collect existing historical records related to the Great Fear and use epidemiology tools and models4 to reconstruct the network of its transmission from town to town. In this way, we quantify the spatiotemporal spread of the rumours and compute key epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction number. Exploiting information on the structure of the road network in eighteenth century France5, we estimate the most probable diffusion paths of the Great Fear and quantify the distribution of spreading velocities. By endowing the nodes in our reconstructed network with indicators related to the institutional, demographic and socio-economic conditions of the time6, including literacy, population size, political participation, wheat prices7,8, income and ownership laws9, and the unequal distribution of land ownership, we compute factors associated with spread of the Great Fear. Our analysis sheds light on unresolved historiographic issues on the significance of the Great Fear for the French Revolution, providing a quantitative answer to the unresolved debate between the role of emotions and rationality in explaining its diffusion. Epidemiological methods are used to show that the Great Fear of 1789, a series of peasant insurrections in rural revolutionary France, was driven by deliberate political action rather than spontaneous fear.},

However, the unstable anode morphological changes and the irreversible anionic reactions at the electrolyte–cathode interfaces induce oxygen escape and catalytic decomposition of polymer electrolytes, resulting in severe interfacial degradation and poor cycling stability. Here we design an in-built fluoropolyether-based polymer electrolyte composed of strongly solvating polyether and weakly solvating fluorohydrocarbon pendants, creating an anion-rich solvation structure and thus anion-derived fluorine-rich interfacial layers on the cathode and anode to resist interfacial issues. The LRMO cathode exhibits improved oxygen redox reversibility with substantially reduced oxygen-involving interfacial side reactions. This quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte with 30 wt% trimethyl phosphate enables an LRMO cathode with a reversible high-areal-capacity cycling (&gt;8 mAh cm−2) in pouch cells&nbsp;and long-term stability (&gt;500 cycles at 25 °C)&nbsp;in coin cells, respectively. The pouch cells exhibit an energy density of 604 Wh kg−1 (1,027 Wh l−1) and excellent safety under a nail penetration at a fully charged condition. Our work, therefore, provides a promising direction for creating practical high-energy-density and high-safety lithium batteries. An in-built fluoropolyether-based quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte enables high-capacity lithium-rich manganese-based layered oxide cathodes with stable interfaces, achieving 604 Wh kg−1 pouch-cell energy density.},

  abstract     = {As a negative charge carrier, the hydride ion (H−) is more energetic, polarizable and reactive than cations1. An&nbsp;H−-mediated electrochemical process is fundamentally different from existing systems and enables the development of innovative electrochemical devices, such as rechargeable batteries, fuel cells, electrolysis cells and gas separation membranes2. Here we developed a core-shell hydride 3CeH3@BaH2, which exhibits fast H− conduction at ambient temperature and becomes a superionic conductor above 60 °C. This hydride allows us to construct an all-solid-state rechargeable H− battery CeH2|3CeH3@BaH2|NaAlH4, which operates at ambient conditions using NaAlH4 and CeH2 as cathode and anode materials, respectively. This battery has an initial specific capacity of 984 mAh g−1 and retains 402 mAh g−1 after 20 cycles. Using hydrogen as charge carriers can avoid the formation of detrimental metal dendrites, in principle, which creates new research avenues for clean energy storage and conversion. A core-shell hydride 3CeH3@BaH2, which exhibits fast H− conduction at ambient temperature and becomes a superionic conductor above 60 °C, is used to construct an all-solid-state rechargeable H− battery.},

  abstract     = {Even with the rapid development of renewable energy sources, improving the efficiency of energy conversion from fossil or synthetic fuels remains a challenge because, for example, combustion engines in long-range aircraft will still be needed in the upcoming decades1. Increasing their operating temperatures (1,050–1,150 °C (refs. 2–4)) is one option. This requires replacing single-crystalline Ni-based superalloys in the hottest sections of turbines by refractory-element-based materials, which exhibit much higher solidus temperatures beyond 2,000 °C (refs. 5–7). Here we introduce a single-phase Cr-36.1Mo-3Si (at.%) alloy that meets, for the first time, to our knowledge, the most important critical requirements for refractory-element-based materials: (1) relevant resistance against pesting, nitridation and scale spallation at elevated temperatures, minimum up to 1,100 °C, and (2) sufficient compression ductility at room temperature. Although strength and creep resistance in such alloys were already superior to Ni-based superalloys in several cases, oxidation/corrosion resistance, mandatory to withstand the combustion atmosphere, and ductility/toughness, needed for damage tolerance and device setting, still pose barriers for the development or application of refractory-element-based candidate materials. Any previous successful attempts to address the otherwise catastrophic oxidation of Mo and nitridation of Cr during oxidation suffered from a loss in ductility at ambient temperatures. A single-phase chromium–molybdenum–silicon alloy is described that exhibits compression ductility at room temperature as well as resistance to oxidation, pesting, nitridation and scale spallation at temperatures up to at least 1,100 °C.},

  abstract     = {Kinetically trapping the high-temperature states through rapid cooling solidification is widely used for the synthesis of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), especially those with intrinsically immiscible elemental combinations1–4. However, strategies need to be developed to overcome the fundamental limitations of rapid cooling solidification in controlling the crystallinity, structure and morphology of HEAs. Here we introduce an isothermal solidification strategy for the synthesis of HEAs by rapidly altering the metal alloy composition through liquid–liquid interface reactions at low temperatures, for example, from 25 °C to 80 °C. We use gallium (Ga)-based metal as the sacrificial reagent and mixing medium. By directing the reactions to the interfaces between the Ga-based liquid metal and an aqueous metal ion solution, the foreign metal ions can be reduced at the interfaces and incorporated into the liquid metal quickly. HEAs with various crystallinity (single crystal, mesocrystal, polycrystal and amorphous), morphology (zero, two and three dimensions) and compositions can be achieved through the isothermal solidification. Ga can be completely consumed, resulting in Ga-free HEAs. If desired, Ga can be one of the metal elements in the final products. In situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies and theoretical analysis show the isothermal solidification mechanisms. Our direct observations show the enhanced mixing of liquid metal elements and the solidification process with fluctuating nucleation dynamics. The isothermal solidification marks a powerful strategy for HEA synthesis through an unexplored pathway of kinetically trapping the high-entropy states. Gallium is used as a sacrificial agent and mixing medium for the isothermal solidification synthesis of high-entropy alloy nanomaterials with diverse crystallinities and morphologies.},

  abstract     = {Metabolism enables life to sustain dynamics and to repeatedly interact with the environment by storing and consuming chemical energy. A major challenge for artificial molecular machines is to find a universal energy source akin to ATP for biological organisms and electricity for electromechanical machines. More than 20 years ago, DNA was first used as fuel to drive nanomechanical devices1,2 and catalytic reactions3. However, each system requires distinct fuel sequences, preventing DNA alone from becoming a universal energy source. Despite extensive efforts4, we still lack an ATP-like or electricity-like power supply to sustain diverse molecular machines. Here we show that heat can restore enzyme-free DNA circuits from equilibrium to out-of-equilibrium states. During heating and cooling, nucleic acids with strong secondary structures reach kinetically trapped states5,6, providing energy for subsequent computation. We demonstrate that complex logic circuits and neural networks, involving more than 200 distinct molecular species, can respond to a temperature ramp and recharge within minutes, allowing at least 16 rounds of computation with varying sequential inputs. Our strategy enables diverse systems to be powered by the same energy source without problematic waste build-up, thereby ensuring consistent performance over time. This scalable approach supports the sustained operation of enzyme-free molecular circuits and opens opportunities for advanced autonomous behaviours, such as iterative computation and unsupervised learning in artificial chemical systems. Heat recharges enzyme-free DNA circuits, enabling complex logic operations and neural networks to perform multiple computations, offering a universal energy source for molecular machines and advancing autonomous behaviours in artificial chemical systems.},

  abstract     = {Optical lattice clocks are at the forefront of precision metrology1–6, operating near a standard quantum limit set by quantum noise4,7. Harnessing quantum entanglement offers a promising route to surpass this limit8–15; however, there are practical difficulties in terms of scalability and measurement resolution requirements16,17. Here we adapt the holonomic quantum gate concept18 to develop a new Rabi-type ‘global-phase spectroscopy’ that uses the detuning-sensitive global Aharonov–Anandan phase19. With this approach, we can demonstrate quantum-amplified time-reversal spectroscopy on an optical clock transition that achieves directly measured 2.4(7) dB metrological gain and 4.0(8) dB improvement in laser noise sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit. To this end, we introduce rotary echo to protect the dynamics from inhomogeneities in light–atom coupling and implement a laser-noise-cancelling differential measurement through symmetric phase encoding in two nuclear spin states. Our technique is not limited by measurement resolution, scales easily because of the global nature of entangling interaction and exhibits high resilience to typical experimental imperfections. We expect it to be broadly applicable to next-generation atomic clocks and other quantum sensors approaching the fundamental quantum precision limits20–22. The precision of determining the phase of an optical atomic clock is increased above the standard quantum limit in a new spectroscopic method.},

  abstract     = {Fast, reliable logical operations are essential for realizing useful quantum computers1–3. By redundantly encoding logical qubits into many physical qubits and using syndrome measurements to detect and correct errors, we can achieve low logical error rates. However, for many practical quantum error correction codes such as the surface code, owing to syndrome measurement errors, standard constructions require multiple extraction rounds—of the order of the code distance d—for fault-tolerant computation, particularly considering fault-tolerant state preparation4–12. Here we show that logical operations can be performed fault-tolerantly with only a constant number of extraction rounds for a broad class of quantum error correction codes, including the surface code with magic state inputs and feedforward, to achieve ‘transversal algorithmic fault tolerance’. Through the combination of transversal operations7 and new strategies for correlated decoding13, despite only having access to partial syndrome information, we prove that the deviation from the ideal logical measurement distribution can be made exponentially small in the distance, even if the instantaneous quantum state cannot be made close to a logical codeword because of measurement errors. We supplement this proof with circuit-level simulations in a range of relevant settings, demonstrating the fault tolerance and competitive performance of our approach. Our work sheds new light on the theory of quantum fault tolerance and has the potential to reduce the space–time cost of practical fault-tolerant quantum computation by over an order of magnitude. Logical operations can be performed fault-tolerantly with only a constant number of syndrome extraction rounds for a broad class of quantum error correction codes, including the surface code with magic state inputs and feedforward, to achieve ‘transversal algorithmic fault tolerance’.},

Here we show that the tapering of the basin outline and the more gradual topographic and crustal thickness transition towards the south support a southward impact trajectory, opposite of that commonly assumed. A broad thorium-rich and iron-rich ejecta deposit southwest of the basin is consistent with partial excavation of late-stage magma ocean liquids. These observations indicate that thorium-rich magma ocean liquids persisted only beneath the southwestern half of the basin at the time of impact, matching predictions for the transition from a global magma ocean to a local enrichment of potassium, rare-earth elements&nbsp;and phosphorus (KREEP) in the&nbsp;near-side Procellarum KREEP Terrane. These results have important implications for the upcoming human exploration of the lunar south pole by Artemis, as proposed landing sites are now recognized to sit on the downrange rim and thorium-rich impact ejecta of the basin. Observations of the shape, topography, crustal thickness&nbsp;and surface composition of the South Pole–Aitken impact basin on the Moon suggest a southward impact trajectory and the excavation of a discontinuous remnant magma ocean from beneath the crust.},

  abstract     = {Methods to systematically monitor protein complex dynamics are needed. We introduce serial ultrafiltration combined with limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry (FLiP–MS), a structural proteomics workflow that generates a library of peptide markers specific to changes in PPIs by probing differences in protease susceptibility between complex-bound and monomeric forms of proteins. The library includes markers mapping to protein-binding interfaces and markers reporting on structural changes that accompany PPI changes. Integrating the marker library with LiP–MS data allows for global profiling of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) from unfractionated lysates. We apply FLiP–MS to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and probe changes in protein complex dynamics after DNA replication stress, identifying links between Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase activity and the assembly state of several complexes. FLiP–MS enables protein complex dynamics to be probed on any perturbation, proteome-wide, at high throughput, with peptide-level structural resolution and informing on occupancy of binding interfaces, thus providing both global and molecular views of a system under study. FLiP–MS uses a library of protein–protein interaction markers to understand protein complex dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Inactive Cas13 orthologs have been fused to a mutant human ADAR2 deaminase domain at the C terminus to enable programmable adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in selected transcripts. Although promising, existing RNA-editing tools generally suffer from a trade-off between efficacy and specificity, and off-target editing remains an unsolved problem. Here we describe the development of an optimized RNA-editing platform by rational protein engineering, CasRx-based Programmable Editing of RNA Technology (xPERT). We demonstrate that the topological rearrangement of a CasRx K940L mutant by circular permutation results in a robust scaffold for the tethering of a deaminase domain. We benchmark our tool against the REPAIR system and show that xPERT exhibits strong on-target activity like REPAIRv1 but low off-target editing like REPAIRv2. Our xPERT platform can be used to alter RNA sequence information without risking genome damage, effect temporary cellular changes and customize protein function. Site-specific and efficient RNA editing is achieved with a CasRx editor.},

  abstract     = {The attainable resolution of fluorescence microscopy has reached the subnanometer range, but this technique still fails to image the morphology of single proteins or small molecular complexes. Here, we expand the specimens at least tenfold, label them with conventional fluorophores and image them with conventional light microscopes, acquiring videos in which we analyze fluorescence fluctuations. One-step nanoscale expansion (ONE) microscopy enables the visualization of the shapes of individual membrane and soluble proteins, achieving around 1-nm resolution. We show that conformational changes are readily observable, such as those undergone by the ~17-kDa protein calmodulin upon Ca2+ binding. ONE is also applied to clinical samples, analyzing the morphology of protein aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid from persons with Parkinson disease, potentially aiding disease diagnosis. This technology bridges the gap between high-resolution structural biology techniques and light microscopy, providing new avenues for discoveries in biology and medicine. Combining expansion microscopy with super-resolution radial fluctuations captures the morphology of single proteins.},

  abstract     = {Transcriptional effectors are protein domains known to activate or repress gene expression; however, a systematic understanding of which effector domains regulate transcription across genomic, cell type and DNA-binding domain (DBD) contexts is lacking. Here we develop dCas9-mediated high-throughput recruitment (HT-recruit), a pooled screening method for quantifying effector function at endogenous target genes and test effector function for a library containing 5,092 nuclear protein Pfam domains across varied contexts. We also map context dependencies of effectors drawn from unannotated protein regions using a larger library tiling chromatin regulators and transcription factors. We find that many effectors depend on target and DBD contexts, such as HLH domains that can act as either activators or repressors. To enable efficient perturbations, we select context-robust domains, including ZNF705 KRAB, that improve CRISPRi tools to silence promoters and enhancers. We engineer a compact human activator called NFZ, by combining NCOA3, FOXO3 and ZNF473 domains, which enables efficient CRISPRa with better viral delivery and inducible control of chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Improved effectors for CRISPRi/CRISPRa are developed following high-throughput screening of transcriptional domains.},

We demonstrate that PIONEER outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and experimentally validate its predictions. We show that disease-associated mutations are enriched in PIONEER-predicted protein–protein interfaces and explore their impact on disease prognosis and drug responses. We identify 586 significant protein–protein interactions (PPIs) enriched with PIONEER-predicted interface somatic mutations (termed oncoPPIs) from analysis of approximately 11,000 whole exomes across 33 cancer types and show significant associations of oncoPPIs with patient survival and drug responses. PIONEER, implemented as both a web server platform and a software package, identifies functional consequences of disease-associated alleles and offers a deep learning tool for precision medicine at multiscale interactome network levels.

  abstract     = {Strategies to enhance the anti-tumor immune response of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) at primary tumors and abscopal sites are under intensive investigation. Here we report a metabolizable binary supracluster (BSCgal) that combines gold nanoclusters as radiosensitizing adjuvants with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the immunosuppressive mediator galectin-1 (Gal-1). BSCgal comprises reversibly crosslinked cationic gold nanoclusters and siRNA complexes in a polymer matrix that biodegrades over weeks, facilitating clearance (90.3% in vivo clearance at 4 weeks) to reduce toxicity. The particle size well above the renal filtration threshold facilitates passive delivery to tumors. Using mouse models of head and neck cancer, we show that BSCgal augments the radiodynamic and immunotherapeutic effects of SABR at the primary and metastatic tumors by promoting tumor-inhibitory leukocytes, upregulating cytotoxic granzyme B and reducing immunosuppressive cell populations. It outperforms SABR plus Gal-1 antagonists, chemoradiation drug cisplatin or PD-1 inhibitor. This work presents a translatable strategy to converge focal radiosensitization with targeted immune checkpoint silencing for personalized radioimmunotherapy. Gold-siRNA clusters boost the immune response of radiotherapy against primary and distant tumors.},

Despite this, EV mRNA remains underused due to its low abundance in liquid biopsies, and large sample volumes or specialized techniques for analysis are required. Here we introduce Self-amplified and CRISPR-aided Operation to Profile EVs (SCOPE), a platform for EV mRNA detection. SCOPE leverages CRISPR-mediated recognition of target RNA using Cas13 to initiate replication and signal amplification, achieving a sub-attomolar detection limit while maintaining single-nucleotide resolution. As a proof of concept, we designed probes for key mutations in KRAS, BRAF, EGFR and IDH1 genes, optimized protocols for single-pot assays and implemented an automated device for multi-sample detection. We validated SCOPE’s ability to detect early-stage lung cancer in animal models, monitored tumor mutational burden in patients with colorectal cancer and stratified patients with glioblastoma. SCOPE can expedite readouts, augmenting the clinical use of EVs in precision oncology. SCOPE detects low-abundance extracellular vesicle mRNA with high sensitivity for clinical applications.},

PEER-seq introduces both intended SNVs and synonymous marker mutations using prime editing and deep sequences the endogenous target regions to identify the introduced SNVs. We generate and functionally evaluate 2,476 SNVs in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR), including 99% of all possible variants in the canonical tyrosine kinase domain. We determined resistance profiles of 95% of all possible EGFR protein variants encoded in the whole tyrosine kinase domain against the common tyrosine kinase inhibitors afatinib, osimertinib and osimertinib in the presence of the co-occurring substitution T790M, in PC-9 cells. Our study has the potential to substantially improve the precision of therapeutic choices in clinical settings. PEER-seq characterizes the drug resistance profiles of thousands of genetic variants.},

Using tissue-selective LNP formulations, we observe genome-editing levels of 16‒37% in the liver and lungs of reporter mice that receive single intravenous injections of iGeoCas9 RNP–LNPs. In addition, iGeoCas9 RNPs complexed to biodegradable LNPs edit the disease-causing SFTPC gene in lung tissue with 19% average efficiency, representing a major improvement over genome-editing levels observed previously using viral or nonviral delivery strategies.

  abstract     = {Understanding the structural dynamics of ligands and their interaction with catalytic centres under reaction conditions remains a fundamental challenge, yet it is essential for catalyst design. Here we reveal an in situ transformation of Ni–Fe hydroxide into a stable superoxo-hydroxide phase, which is accompanied by the formation of lattice O–O (Olatt–Olatt) ligands, as demonstrated using operando 18O-labelling spectroelectrochemistry and machine-learning-assisted global optimization. By correlating the intrinsic activity of Fe with the Olatt–Olatt concentration across a series of Fe-incorporated transition-metal hydroxides and oxides, we demonstrate that Olatt–Olatt triggers Fe activation for oxygen evolution electrocatalysis—a finding further supported by first-principles calculations. Oxygen production proceeds via an adsorbate evolution mechanism, and the enhanced reaction kinetics stem from the lowered activation energy at surface Fe sites in the newly formed superoxo-hydroxide structure. This work offers a strategic framework for designing high-performance Fe-incorporated electrocatalysts and underscores the pivotal role of ligand dynamics in activating catalytic centres. While the ligand coordination microenvironment surrounding catalytic centres influences reactivity, dynamic oxygen reconstruction during water oxidation electrocatalysis complicates structure-based mechanistic insights. Now the in situ formation of lattice O–O ligands has been shown to activate Fe centres in metal oxides and hydroxides, thereby enhancing their oxygen evolution reaction activity.},

  abstract     = {Incorporating unnatural amino acids, such as hindered N-methylated or α,α-disubstituted amino acid(s), into peptides can improve their properties for application in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields. However, the current solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) faces sluggish reaction rates and low yields when incorporating sterically hindered amino acids, owing to the poor kinetics of the two-phase acyl-transfer process from solution to solid. Here we introduce an immobilized ribosome-mimicking molecular reactor to facilitate on-resin proximity-induced intra(inter)-reactor acyl transfers. This strategy bypasses the two-phase acyl-transfer mechanism in conventional SPPS and boosts coupling efficiency in the solid-phase synthesis of N-methylated and/or α,α-disubstituted amino acid(s)-containing sterically hindered peptides, including cyclosporin A and alamethicin F analogues. The ribosome-mimicking molecular reactor SPPS can be integrated into existing SPPS platforms using commercially available resins and reagents, and displays high compatibility with standard synthesizers, enabling the automated synthesis of pharmaceutically important, sterically hindered difficult peptides. Current solid-phase peptide synthesis methods struggle to incorporate sterically hindered amino acids. Now researchers have developed a ribosome-mimicking molecular reactor that bypasses two-phase acyl transfer to boost the coupling efficiency of peptides containing N-methylated and/or α,α-disubstituted amino acids.},

  abstract     = {Among all enzymatic metallocofactors, those found in nitrogenases, the P and L or M clusters, stand out for their intricate structures. They are assembled by proteins of the Nif gene cluster from Fe2S2 rhombs—the smallest building blocks in FeS cluster chemistry—through a sequence of reactions constructing a Fe8S8 precursor. To advance our understanding of how enzymes selectively build such elaborate inorganic molecules, here we parallel the biosynthetic pathway by reporting the rational stepwise assembly of [Fe8S8]m+ (m = 2, 4, 6) clusters from [Fe2S2]2+ rhombs within an extensive cyclic synthetic network. A [Fe8S8]4+ cluster of unique topology is identified, for which we coin the term ‘interlocked’ double cubane. As a molecular analogue of the NifB K cluster, a proposed precursor to both the P and L or M clusters, its preparation and the characterization of all related intermediates, offers fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly of both biogenic and synthetic FeS clusters. Elucidating the nature of the metallocofactors in nitrogenase enzymes, and preparing synthetic analogues of these clusters, is a classic target for bioinorganic chemists. Now the transformation of [Fe2S2]2+ rhombs to [Fe8S8]n+ clusters has been achieved through a series of redox- and ligand-substitution reactions.},

  abstract     = {Azoles are important synthetic targets due to their diverse applications in areas ranging from human health to food security. Accordingly, access to N-functionalized azoles is an essential goal in modern synthetic chemistry. Surprisingly, however, the relied-upon azole N-alkylation strategies fundamentally limit the structural diversity of these important compounds that can be synthesized and studied. Here we introduce an approach to prepare a broad array of important but difficult-to-access N-alkyl azole compounds. We accomplish this through the introduction of a base-catalysed hydroazolation of readily accessible alkenylthianthrenium electrophiles. This strategy circumvents the classical challenge of azole alkylation regiocontrol through an unusual reversible C–N-bond-forming step that exploits the thermodynamic differences between azole N-alkylation isomers. This reaction furnishes a class of versatile azolothianthrenium building blocks that provides a general platform to investigate diverse N-alkyl azole molecules. More broadly, the distinctive approach outlined through this project is poised to impact the design and development of diverse regioselective alkylation reactions. Azoles are important synthetic targets due to their diverse applications in areas ranging from human health to food security. Now it has been shown that the hydroazolation of alkenylthianthrenium salts provides a modular platform to access diverse, densely functionalized N-alkyl azole compounds with high N-regioselectivity.},

  abstract     = {Aggregation of microtubule-associated protein tau into conformationally distinct fibrils underpins neurodegenerative tauopathies. Fluorescent probes (fluoroprobes) such as thioflavin T have been essential tools for studying tau aggregation; however, most of them do not discriminate between amyloid fibril conformations (polymorphs). This gap is due, in part, to a lack of high-throughput methods for screening large, diverse chemical collections. Here we leverage advances in protein-adaptive differential scanning fluorimetry to screen the Aurora collection of 300+ fluoroprobes against multiple synthetic fibril polymorphs, including those formed from tau, α-synuclein and islet amyloid polypeptide. This screen—coupled with excitation-multiplexed bright-emission recording (EMBER) imaging and orthogonal secondary assays—revealed pan-fibril-binding chemotypes, as well as fluoroprobes selective for fibril subsets. One fluoroprobe recognized tau pathology in ex vivo brain slices from Alzheimer’s disease and rodent models. We propose that these scaffolds represent entry points for developing fibril-selective ligands. Amyloid fibrils can adopt a range of distinct conformations, yet it is challenging to rapidly discriminate between these polymorphs. Now methods have been developed to screen large, diverse libraries of turn-on fluorescent dyes to rapidly identify probes that recognize fibril subsets.},

Although commonly utilized as nitrogen nucleophiles, their application as alkyl sources for constructing (sp3)C–C(sp3) bonds remains a notable challenge. Here we present an approach integrating nitrogen-atom deletion into the aza-Michael reaction, thereby redirecting the classical pathway from (sp3)C–N bond formation to (sp3)C–C(sp3) bond construction. Leveraging commercially available O-diphenylphosphinylhydroxylamine as an efficient nitrogen-deletion reagent, this method enables a wide variety of primary aliphatic amines to serve as alkyl sources in couplings with structurally diverse electron-deficient olefins. This Giese-type reaction proceeds under mild conditions, achieves completion within 10 min and exhibits broad functional-group compatibility. By bridging two foundational transformations—the aza-Michael reaction and the Giese-type reaction—this approach interlinks their product spaces through a unified precursor library, substantially enhancing synthetic utility. Primary aliphatic amines are abundant building blocks but underutilized as alkyl sources in C–C bond formation. Now it has been shown that integrating nitrogen-atom deletion into the aza-Michael reaction redirects the classical pathway from (sp3)C–N bond formation to Giese-type (sp3)C–C(sp3) bond construction.},

Here we report two-dimensional vertical ladder polymer cathode materials that feature layered nanosheets with rich intralayer pores and structural defects alongside weak interlayer interactions. This structural design allows lithium ions to migrate vertically across the intrinsic pores and/or defects accompanied by horizontal intercalation, thus establishing a cross-flow pathway for lithium storage. Such an effective ion-transport method enables flash charging of an ultrahigh-power polymer cathode to ~70% state-of-charge within 30 s at a high current density. Even operated at −50 °C, the polymer cathode achieves 3-min charging to ~55% state-of-charge. Furthermore, we propose an organic–inorganic hybrid strategy that overall improves the electrode-level specific energy at high rates for meeting practical metrics. This work demonstrates the potential of organic electrodes for high-power output under extreme operational conditions. Electrochemical energy-storage devices require rapid charge–discharge profiles, but the dense electrode packing required to achieve high energy densities results in sluggish ion-transport kinetics. Now a two-dimensional vertical ladder polymer cathode has been shown to achieve promising performance and tolerance by using a cross-flow lithium migration pathway.},

We use this approach to quantitatively characterize fatty-acyl-dependent transport of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine lipids between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, the nucleus or lysosomes. Further experiments revealed the relative contributions of various biosynthesis pathways to the phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine lipid compositions in the mitochondria, nucleus and lysosomes. Lysosome-specific photocatalytic labelling revealed the impact of the mTOR kinase pathway on lysosomal lipid metabolism. Together, this subcellularly localized photocatalytic labelling of lipids quantitatively deciphers the subcellular lipid composition and transport, enhancing our understanding of lipid metabolism in living organisms. Subcellular lipid transport between organelles and turnover remain poorly explored due to the technical challenges associated with selective lipid labelling.

  abstract     = {Metal–sulfur active sites play a central role in catalytic processes such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, yet the majority of active sites in these compounds reside on the surfaces and edges of catalyst particles, limiting overall efficiency. Here we present a strategy to embed metal–sulfur active sites into metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) by converting bridging or terminal chloride ligands into hydroxide and subsequently into sulfide groups through post-synthetic modification. We apply this method to two representative MOF families: one featuring one-dimensional metal–chloride chains and another containing discrete multinuclear metal clusters. Crystallographic and spectroscopic analyses confirm structural integrity and sulfide incorporation, and the transformation is monitored by in situ total scattering methods. The sulfided MOFs display enhanced catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes using molecular hydrogen. Density functional theory calculations indicate that sulfur incorporation promotes homolytic metal–ligand bond cleavage and facilitates H2 activation. This work establishes an approach to construct MOFs featuring accessible metal–sulfide sites. Metal–sulfur motifs are commonly found in enzymatic active sites and heterogeneous catalysis, but they remain underexplored in porous solids. Now, sulfur-based ligands have been incorporated into metal–organic frameworks through post-synthetic modifications. The resulting sulfide MOFs exhibit enhanced catalytic performance in the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes compared with their parent MOFs containing terminal or bridging chloride and hydroxyl groups.},

Herein we demonstrate a versatile flame synthesis process to fabricate high-entropy metallic single atoms and/or nanoparticles supported on soot-like carbon via blending organometallic precursors into fuel (namely, paraffin wax) and subsequent burning. The high flame temperature (~1,800 K) enables strong metal–carbon association with tailorable chemistry and homogeneous bonding between dissimilar metallic elements (up to 25 metals studied), regardless of their thermodynamic compatibility. Additionally, we show high-performance electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide to highlight this approach as a promising method for electrocatalyst development. High-entropy nanomaterials, which incorporate multiple homogeneously dispersed elements, are promising for energy conversion, but typically require complex, high-temperature synthesis.

Chemisorption of Ni(COD)2 (COD, 1,5-cyclooctadiene) onto Brønsted acidic sulfated alumina (AlS) yields a highly electrophilic Ni(I) precatalyst, AlS/Ni(COD)2, which is converted under H2 to the active AlS/NiIIH catalyst. This single-site system exhibits unique hydrogenolysis selectivity that favours cleaving branched polyolefin C–C linkages, enabling the hydrogenolytic separation of polyethylene and isotactic polypropylene (iPP) mixtures. Moreover, AlS/NiIIH remains highly selective and active for hydrogenolysis of iPP admixed with polyvinyl chloride, and the spent catalyst can be repeatedly regenerated by AlEt3 treatment. Experimental mechanistic analysis and density functional theory modelling reveal a turnover-limiting C–C scission pathway featuring β-alkyl transfer and strong olefin binding. These results highlight the potential of nickel-based systems for the selective upcycling of complex plastic waste streams. Selective chemical upcycling of polyolefin mixtures remains challenging due to the structural similarity of their backbones. Now it has been shown that a single-site nickel catalyst can preferentially and efficiently cleave branched C–C bonds, enabling the hydrogenolytic separation of isotactic polypropylene from mixtures containing both isotactic polypropylene and polyethylene.},

  abstract     = {The growing demand for fluorochemicals has increased the production of toxic hydrogen fluoride (HF)—a widely used fluorination agent—from mineral fluorspar (CaF2). Although potassium fluoride (KF) is a safer alternative fluorination agent, its production still involves HF as an intermediate. Simultaneously, the disposal of fluoropolymer waste, especially polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), poses environmental challenges. We present a mechanochemical protocol that decomposes PVDF to generate KF as a nucleophilic fluorinating agent. As an advantage over traditional batch reactions, mechanochemical protocols can be performed quickly, and with or without modest volumes of solvents. We show that KF produced using this method can be used to efficiently construct S–F, C(sp2)–F and C(sp3)–F bonds, providing a sustainable solution to fluorine resource depletion and hazardous HF usage. Our approach also addresses fluoropolymer waste disposal and reduces reliance on natural fluorspar resources, marking a notable advancement in fluorine chemistry and paving the way for safer and eco-friendly fluorination techniques. The production of fluorination agents generally involves the formation of toxic hydrogen fluoride. Now, a mechanochemical protocol to decompose the fluoropolymer polyvinylidene fluoride has been developed, generating potassium fluoride as a fluorinating agent. This approach provides a safer and sustainable fluorination strategy for efficient S–F, C(sp2)–F and C(sp3)–F bond formation.},

  abstract     = {Catalytic hydrogenation is essential in synthetic chemistry, with ongoing innovations aimed at enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of these reactions. The hydrogenation of multisubstituted allenes, however, presents a long-standing challenge due to the difficulty of controlling multiple selectivity factors simultaneously. Here we introduce a series of chiral pincer cobalt catalysts featuring multiple metal–ligand cooperative functionalities. These catalysts feature an ‘N–H’ moiety as an outer-sphere binding site and an N-heterocycle group as a hemilabile basic site, enabling the use of structurally diverse tridentate ligands for selective hydrogenation of functionalized allenes. This design liberates a coordination site for H2 activation and enhances selectivity control through the structural tuning of the N-heterocycle group. The catalysts exhibit exceptional chemo-, regio-, enantio- and Z/E-selectivities, along with broad functional group tolerance, enabling access to all possible semihydrogenation products of multisubstituted allenes. Mechanistic studies uncover a distinctive redox-neutral Co(I) catalytic cycle that facilitates heterolytic cleavage of H2, assisted by the basic N-heterocycle on the ligand. The hydrogenation of multisubstituted allenes presents a long-standing challenge due to the difficulty in simultaneously controlling multiple selectivity parameters. Now a class of pincer cobalt catalysts featuring multiple metal–ligand cooperation functionalities has been developed that enables the regio- and stereodivergent hydrogenation of allenes to provide all possible multisubstituted alkene products.},

  abstract     = {The structural dynamics of biopolymers, such as proteins and DNA, feature the unique combination of simultaneous conformational adaptivity and configurational reversibility. However, it remains challenging to design a synthetic system featuring dynamic covalent bonds with secondary structural folding and full recycling capabilities. Here we present a synthetic covalent polymer, constructed from biologically relevant units (amino acids and disulfides), that can reversibly adapt between disordered and helical conformations and can recycle itself to the original small molecules. This dual dynamic feature arises from the subtle synergy of noncovalent bonds (H bonds) and dynamic covalent bonds within a coupled chemical equilibrium, of which thermodynamics is found to follow a nonlinear van’t Hoff equation with nonzero heat capacity change. The covalent polymers show conformational dynamics between structured helices and disordered coils and the ability to convert back to the original monomers. This system demonstrates how dual dynamic function can control helical and recyclable polymer formation. Covalent polymers with helical conformations offer an adaptive scaffold for smart materials, but polymer-to-monomer deconstruction is inhibited by the covalent backbone. Now it has been shown that poly(disulfide)s can be folded into helices driven by side-chain hydrogen-bonding self-assembly, resulting in a synthetic helical polymer that can be fully recycled.},

Real-time observation of chemical bonding at the single-molecule level offers insights into transient intermediates that are normally inaccessible via ensemble measurements. Protein nanopores, with their unique geometries, can be tailored into nanoreactors. Molecular bond-making and -cleavage at the reactive site of a protein nanopore’s interior wall can be visualized by monitoring ionic current changes. Therefore, nanopore-based techniques can enhance the understanding of complex binding kinetics and reaction mechanisms. In this Review we summarize recent advances in using biological nanopores as both single-molecule nanoreactors and single-molecule biosensors. The discussion covers the kinetics of single-molecule reactions under nanopore confinement, the strategies for designing biological nanopores and the latest progress in revealing reaction intermediates and pathways at the single-molecule level. Finally, we emphasize unresolved challenges and anticipate future developments in this rapidly evolving field. Real-time single-molecule observation provides insights into transient intermediates that are normally inaccessible using ensemble measurements. This Review discusses the use of nanopores as both single-molecule nanoreactors and single-molecule sensors for elucidating reaction pathways and kinetics, while highlighting their potential to control covalent reactions under confinement.},

  abstract     = {Cell atlas projects have revealed that common cell types often comprise distinct, recurrent transcriptional states, but the function and regulation of these states remain poorly understood. Here, we show that systematic activation of transcription factors can recreate such states in vitro, providing tractable models for mechanistic and functional studies. Using a scalable CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) Perturb-seq platform, we activated 1,836 transcription factors in two cell types. CRISPRa induced gene expression within physiological ranges, with chromatin features predicting responsiveness. Comparisons with atlas datasets showed that transcription factor perturbations recapitulated key fibroblast states and identified their regulators, including KLF2 and KLF4 for a universal state present in many tissues, and PLAGL1 for a disease-associated inflammatory state. Inducing the universal state suppressed the inflammatory state, suggesting therapeutic potential. These findings position CRISPRa as a nuanced tool for perturbing differentiated cells and establish a general strategy for studying clinically relevant transcriptional states ex vivo. CRISPR activation of 1,836 human transcription factors recapitulates fibroblast transcriptional states observed in vivo and identifies regulators that can revert inflammatory states.},

  abstract     = {Comprehensive maps of functional variation at transcription factor (TF) binding sites (cis-elements) are crucial for elucidating how genotype shapes phenotype. Here, we report the construction of a pan-cistrome of the maize leaf under well-watered and drought conditions. We quantified haplotype-specific TF footprints across a pan-genome of 25 maize hybrids and mapped over 200,000 variants, genetic, epigenetic, or both (termed binding quantitative trait loci (bQTL)), linked to cis-element occupancy. Three lines of evidence support the functional significance of bQTL: (1) coincidence with causative loci that regulate traits, including vgt1, ZmTRE1 and the MITE transposon near ZmNAC111 under drought; (2) bQTL allelic bias is shared between inbred parents and matches chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing results; and (3) partitioning genetic variation across genomic regions demonstrates that bQTL capture the majority of heritable trait variation across ~72% of 143 phenotypes. Our study provides an auspicious approach to make functional cis-variation accessible at scale for genetic studies and targeted engineering of complex traits. Pan-cistrome of the maize leaf under well-watered and drought conditions profiled by haplotype-specific MOA-seq highlights the relevance of transcription factor binding QTLs for understanding phenotypic diversity in maize.},

Widespread field P. brassicae pathotypes frequently overcome the pathotype-specific resistance of modern varieties, posing a challenge for durable control of this disease. Here a genome-wide association study of 3 years of data comprising field clubroot phenotyping of 244 genome-resequenced Brassica napus accessions identified a strong association of β-1,3-glucan synthase-like 5 (GSL5) with clubroot susceptibility. GSL5 was evolutionarily conserved, and inactivation of GSL5 by genome editing in Arabidopsis, B. napus, Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea conferred broad-spectrum, high-level resistance to P. brassicae pathotypes without yield penalties in B. napus. GSL5 inactivation derepressed the jasmonic acid-mediated immunity during P. brassicae secondary infection, and this immune repression was possibly reinforced through stabilization of GSL5 by a P. brassicae effector, facilitating clubroot susceptibility. Our study provides durable resistance resources for cruciferous clubroot disease control and insights into plant resistance against intracellular eukaryotic phytopathogens. This study implicates GSL5 inactivation in high, broad-spectrum resistance to the clubroot pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae in Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica napus, Brassica oleracea and Brassica rapa.},

  abstract     = {Making sense of whole-genome polymorphism data is challenging, but it is essential for overcoming the biases in SNP data. Here we analyze 27 genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana to illustrate these issues. Genome size variation is mostly due to tandem repeat regions that are difficult to assemble. However, while the rest of the genome varies little in length, it is full of structural variants, mostly due to transposon insertions. Because of this, the pangenome coordinate system grows rapidly with sample size and ultimately becomes 70% larger than the size of any single genome, even for n = 27. Finally, we show how short-read data are biased by read mapping. SNP calling is biased by the choice of reference genome, and both transcriptome and methylome profiling results are affected by mapping reads to a reference genome rather than to the genome of the assayed individual. New concepts for comparing the genomes of 27 naturally inbred Arabidopsis thaliana accessions provide essential insights into obtaining a less biased view of whole-genome polymorphism.},

The fully resolved phylogenomic analysis unveils the origin and evolutionary scenario of Avena species, and the super-pangenome analysis identifies 26.62% and 59.93% specific genes and haplotypes in wild species. We delineate the landscape of structural variations (SVs) and the transcriptome profile based 1,401 RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) samples from diverse abiotic stress treatments in oat. We highlight the crucial role of SVs in modulating gene expression and shaping adaptation to diverse stresses. Further combining SV-based genome-wide association studies (GWASs), we characterize 13 candidate genes associated with drought resistance such as AsARF7, validated by transgenic oat lines. Our study provides unprecedented genomic resources to facilitate genomic, evolution and molecular breeding research in oat.

  abstract     = {Locusts are characterized by a large genome size, polyphenism and an X0 sex determination system. Here we generated chromosome-level genomes for both desert and migratory locusts, as well as a comprehensive chromatin map for the latter. We found that genome enlargement is associated with an increased number of enhancers in expanded intronic regions. To explore the function of expanded enhancers, we identified a distal enhancer that contributes to behavioral differences between solitary and gregarious locusts. In the X0 sex system, H4K16ac enrichment and H4K20me1 depletion maintain balanced X-linked expression in male soma. Notably, the distance-dependent H4K16ac enrichment diminishes gradually in intergenic regions, revealing a special dosage compensation mechanism in large genomes. Furthermore, the distance-dependent H4K16ac results in a lag in the evolution of dosage compensation for the X-linked genes translocated recently from autosomes. Therefore, expanded intronic and intergenic regions shape a distinct chromatin regulation landscape in large genomes. Chromosome-level genome assemblies of migratory and desert locusts, coupled with epigenomic profiling of migratory locusts, reveal chromatin dynamics underlying polyphenism and X-linked dosage compensation following autosomal gene translocation.},

Inadequate expression of mSWI/SNF in heterozygous mice can lead to developmental defects, indicating dosage-sensitive effects of mSWI/SNF. However, how its dosage affects function has remained unclear. Using a targeted protein degradation system, we investigated its dosage-sensitive effects by precisely controlling protein levels of BRG1, the ATPase subunit of the mSWI/SNF complex. We found that binding of BRG1 to chromatin exhibited a linear response to the BRG1 protein level. Although chromatin accessibility at most promoters and insulators was largely unaffected by BRG1 depletion, 44% of enhancers, including 84% of defined superenhancers, showed reduced accessibility. Notably, half of the BRG1-regulated enhancers, particularly superenhancers, exhibited a buffered response to BRG1 loss. Consistently, transcription exhibited a predominantly buffered response to changes in BRG1 levels. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a genomic feature-specific response to BRG1 dosage, shedding light on the dosage-sensitive effects of mSWI/SNF complex defects in cancer and other diseases. This study investigates the dosage-sensitive effects of BRG1, a core SWI/SNF subunit, on chromatin binding, accessibility and transcriptional regulation by precisely controlling its protein level.},

Here, we elucidate the epigenomic landscape across SAT cell types using snm3C-seq. We find that SAT CG methylation (mCG) displays pronounced hypermethylation in myeloid cells and hypomethylation in adipocytes and adipose stem and progenitor cells, driving nearly half of the 705,063 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Moreover, TET1 and DNMT3A are identified as plausible regulators of the cell-type-level mCG profiles. Both global mCG profiles and chromosomal compartmentalization reflect SAT cell-type lineage. Notably, adipocytes display more short-range chromosomal interactions, forming complex local 3D genomic structures that regulate transcriptional functions, including adipogenesis. Furthermore, adipocyte DMRs and A compartments are enriched for abdominal obesity genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants and polygenic risk, while myeloid A compartments are enriched for inflammation. Together, we characterize the SAT single-cell-level epigenomic landscape and link GWAS variants and partitioned polygenic risk of abdominal obesity and inflammation to the SAT epigenome. This multiomic study, including single-nucleus DNA methylation and chromatin conformation matched with single-nuclei RNA sequencing, provides insights into the epigenomic landscape of human subcutaneous adipose tissue.},

To explore this, we performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing on 217 tumor and matched normal regions from 59 patients with non-small cell lung cancer from the TRACERx study to deconvolve tumor methylation. We developed two metrics for integrative evolutionary analysis with DNA and RNA sequencing data. Intratumoral methylation distance quantifies intratumor DNA methylation heterogeneity. MR/MN classifies genes based on the rate of hypermethylation at regulatory (MR) versus nonregulatory (MN) CpGs to identify driver genes exhibiting recurrent functional hypermethylation. We identified DNA methylation-linked dosage compensation of essential genes co-amplified with neighboring oncogenes. We propose two complementary mechanisms that converge for copy number alteration-affected chromatin to undergo the epigenetic equivalent of an allosteric activity transition. Hypermethylated driver genes under positive selection may open avenues for therapeutic stratification of patients.

  abstract     = {The mechanisms through which mutations in splicing factor genes drive clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and myeloid malignancies, and their close association with advanced age, remain poorly understood. Here we show that telomere maintenance plays an important role in this phenomenon. First, by studying 454,098 UK Biobank participants, we find that, unlike most CH subtypes, splicing-factor-mutant CH is more common in those with shorter genetically predicted telomeres, as is CH with mutations in PPM1D and the TERT gene promoter. We go on to show that telomere attrition becomes an instrument for clonal selection in advanced age, with splicing factor mutations ‘rescuing’ HSCs from critical telomere shortening. Our findings expose the lifelong influence of telomere maintenance on hematopoiesis and identify a potential shared mechanism through which different splicing factor mutations drive leukemogenesis. Understanding the mechanistic basis of these observations can open new therapeutic avenues against splicing-factor-mutant CH and hematological or other cancers. This study explores the relationship between telomere length and clonal hematopoiesis. Splicing factor and PPM1D gene mutations are more frequent in people with genetically predicted shorter telomere lengths, suggesting that these mutations protect against the consequences of telomere attrition.},

  abstract     = {Multiple myeloma evolution is characterized by the accumulation of genomic drivers over time. To unravel this timeline and its impact on clinical outcomes, we analyzed 421 whole-genome sequences from 382 patients. Using clock-like mutational signatures, we estimated a time lag of two to four decades between the initiation of events and diagnosis. We demonstrate that odd-numbered chromosome trisomies in patients with hyperdiploidy can be acquired simultaneously with other chromosomal gains (for example, 1q gain). We show that hyperdiploidy is acquired after immunoglobulin heavy chain translocation when both events co-occur. Finally, patients with early 1q gain had adverse outcomes similar to those with 1q amplification (&gt;1 extra copy), but fared worse than those with late 1q gain. This finding underscores that the 1q gain prognostic impact depends more on the timing of acquisition than on the number of copies gained. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the life history of myeloma and may have prognostic implications. This analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from 421 multiple myeloma samples elucidates the timing of key genomic events and shows associations between the timing of 1q gain and clinical outcome.},

  abstract     = {Mutagenic processes and clonal selection contribute to the development of therapy-associated secondary neoplasms, a known complication of cancer treatment. The association between tamoxifen therapy and secondary uterine cancers is uncommon but well established; however, the genetic mechanisms underlying tamoxifen-driven tumorigenesis remain unclear. We find that oncogenic PIK3CA mutations, common in spontaneously arising estrogen-associated de novo uterine cancer, are significantly less frequent in tamoxifen-associated tumors. In vivo, tamoxifen-induced estrogen receptor stimulation activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in normal mouse uterine tissue, potentially eliminating the selective benefit of PI3K-activating mutations in tamoxifen-associated uterine cancer. Together, we present a unique pathway of therapy-associated carcinogenesis in which tamoxifen-induced activation of the PI3K pathway acts as a non-genetic driver event, contributing to the multistep model of uterine carcinogenesis. While this PI3K mechanism is specific to tamoxifen-associated uterine cancer, the concept of treatment-induced signaling events may have broader applicability to other routes of tumorigenesis. Sequencing analysis of tamoxifen-associated uterine cancers and further in vivo analyses suggest that the drug tamoxifen can activate the PI3K pathway in the absence of oncogenic mutations.},

  abstract     = {Despite the high prevalence of ERG transcription factor translocations in prostate cancer, the mechanism of tumorigenicity remains poorly understood. Using lineage tracing, we find the tumor-initiating activity of ERG resides in a subpopulation of murine basal cells that coexpress luminal genes (BasalLum) and not in the larger population of ERG+ luminal cells. Upon ERG activation, BasalLum cells give rise to highly proliferative intermediate (IM) cells with stem-like features that coexpress basal, luminal, hillock and club marker genes, before transitioning to Krt8+ luminal cells. Transcriptomic analysis of ERG+ human prostate cancers confirms the presence of rare ERG+ BasalLum cells, as well as IM cells whose presence is associated with a worse prognosis. Single-cell analysis revealed a chromatin state in ERG+ IM cells enriched for STAT3 transcription factor binding sites and elevated expression of the KMT2A/MLL1 and DOT1L, all three of which are essential for ERG-driven tumorigenicity in vivo. In addition to providing translational opportunities, this work illustrates how single-cell approaches combined with lineage tracing can identify cancer vulnerabilities not evident from bulk analysis. Lineage tracing in mice identifies a subpopulation of basal cells that express Tmprss2 and Nkx3 as the origin of ERG-driven prostate cancer. Upon expansion, these cells show an enrichment for STAT3 chromatin binding and elevated expression of KMT2A and DOT1L as dependencies for ERG oncogenicity.},

  abstract     = {African American (AA) women have the highest incidence of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) among all racial groups, but are underrepresented in cancer genomic studies. In 462 AA women with TNBC, we characterized the tumor mutational landscape by whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing. We unveiled a high-resolution mutational portrait of TNBC in AA women reminiscent of that in Asian and non-Hispanic white women, with no evidence of associations of mutational features with African ancestry. We also made some distinctive discoveries, including an almost complete dominance of TP53 mutations, low frequency of PIK3CA mutations and mutational signature-based subtypes with etiologic and prognostic significance. These findings do not support major racial differences in TNBC biology at the level of somatic mutations. Our study contributes considerably to diversifying the knowledge base of breast cancer genomics and provides insights into the disease etiology, disparities and therapeutic vulnerability of TNBC in AA women. This study explores the genomic and transcriptomic landscapes of triple-negative breast cancer in African American women. The authors show that the mutational profile is broadly similar to that observed in European and East Asian ancestry women while highlighting some interesting differences.},

Among the pQTLs that multiancestry fine-mapping MESuSiE confidently assigned as putative causal pQTLs in a specific population, most were shared across the three studied populations and are referred to as multiancestry causal pQTLs. These multiancestry causal pQTLs were enriched for exonic and promoter regions. To investigate their effects on disease, we modeled the 858 multiancestry causal pQTLs as instrumental variables using Mendelian randomization and genome-wide association study results for neurologic and psychiatric conditions (21 traits in participants with European ancestry, 10 in those with African ancestry and 4 in Hispanic participants). We identified 119 multiancestry pQTL–protein pairs consistent with a causal role in these conditions. Remarkably, 29% of the multiancestry pQTLs in these pairs were coding variants. These results lay an important foundation for the creation of new molecular models of neurologic and psychiatric conditions that are likely to be relevant to individuals across different genetic ancestries.

Given that &gt;98% of the genome is available for exploration, the selection of noncoding variants remains a critical yet unresolved challenge in these analyses. Here we leverage knowledge of blood gene regulation and deleteriousness scores to select noncoding variants pertinent for association with blood-related traits. Integrating WGS and 42 blood cell count and biomarker measurements for 166,740 UK Biobank samples, we perform variant collapsing tests, identifying hundreds of gene–trait associations involving noncoding variants. However, we demonstrate that most of these noncoding rare variant associations (1) reproduce associations known from previous studies and (2) are driven by linkage disequilibrium between nearby common and rare variants. This study underscores the prevailing challenges in rare variant analysis and the need for caution when interpreting noncoding rare variant association results. Noncoding rare variant analyses using whole-genome sequencing data from the UK Biobank identify gene–trait associations for 42 blood cell traits but find that most signals are driven by linkage disequilibrium between common and rare variants.},

While PGS generalizability has been studied, less is known about PheRS generalizability across healthcare systems and whether PheRS are complementary to PGS. We trained elastic-net-based PheRS to predict the onset of 13 common diseases for 845,929 individuals (age = 32–70 years) from three biobank-based studies in Finland (FinnGen), the UK (UKB) and Estonia (EstB). All PheRS were statistically significantly associated with the diseases of interest and most generalized well without retraining when applied to other studies. PheRS and PGS were only moderately correlated and models including both predictors improved onset prediction compared to PGS alone for 8 of 13 diseases. Our results indicate that EHR-based risk scores can transfer well between EHRs, capture largely independent information from PGS, and provide additive benefits for disease risk prediction. Comparison of electronic health record-based phenotype risk scores (PheRS) and polygenic scores (PGS) across 13 common diseases and three biobank-based studies indicates that PheRS and PGS may provide additive benefits for risk prediction.},

Recent advancements have substantially increased ARG reconstruction scalability, but they rely on approximations that can reduce accuracy, especially under model misspecification. Moreover, they reconstruct only a single ARG topology and cannot quantify the considerable uncertainty associated with ARG inferences. Here, to address these challenges, we introduce SINGER (sampling and inferring of genealogies with recombination), a method that accelerates ARG sampling from the posterior distribution by two orders of magnitude, enabling accurate inference and uncertainty quantification for hundreds of whole-genome sequences. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate SINGER’s enhanced accuracy and robustness to model misspecification compared to existing methods. We demonstrate the utility of SINGER by applying it to individuals of British and African descent within the 1000 Genomes Project, identifying signals of population differentiation, archaic introgression and strong support for ancient polymorphism in the human leukocyte antigen region shared across primates. SINGER is a method for creating ancestral recombination graphs to understand the genealogical history of genomes. The method has increased speed, and thus scalability, without sacrificing accuracy.},

Here we design and synthesize 72 BBB-crossing lipids fabricated by conjugating BBB-crossing modules and amino lipids, and use them to assemble BBB-crossing lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery. Screening and structure optimization studies resulted in a lead formulation that has substantially higher mRNA delivery efficiency into the brain than those exhibited by FDA-approved lipid nanoparticles. Studies in distinct mouse models show that these BBB-crossing lipid nanoparticles can transfect neurons and astrocytes of the whole brain after intravenous injections, being well tolerated across several dosage regimens. Moreover, these nanoparticles can deliver mRNA to human brain ex vivo samples. Overall, these BBB-crossing lipid nanoparticles deliver mRNA to neurons and astrocytes in broad brain regions, thereby being a promising platform to treat a range of central nervous system diseases. A lipid-nanoparticle-based formulation incorporating engineered lipids containing a blood–brain-barrier-crossing moiety effectively delivers mRNA to neurons and astrocytes following systemic administration in mice.},

Here we describe a modular approach to protein nanomaterial design inspired by the rich chemical diversity that can be generated from the small number of atomic valencies. We design protein building blocks using deep learning-based generative tools, incorporating regular coordination geometries and tailorable bonding interactions that enable the assembly of diverse closed and open architectures guided by simple geometric principles. Experimental characterization confirms the successful formation of more than 20 multicomponent polyhedral protein cages, two-dimensional arrays and three-dimensional protein lattices, with a high (10%–50%) success rate and electron microscopy data closely matching the corresponding design models. Due to modularity, individual building blocks can assemble with different partners to generate distinct regular assemblies, resulting in an economy of parts and enabling the construction of reconfigurable networks for designer nanomaterials. Deep learning-based generative tools are used to design protein building blocks with well-defined directional bonding interactions, allowing the generation of a variety of scalable protein assemblies from a small set of reusable subunits.},

However, nearly all nanoparticles designed so far exhibit strict point group symmetry, which limits structural diversity and precludes anisotropic functionalization. Here we describe a computational strategy for designing multicomponent bifaceted protein nanomaterials with two distinctly addressable sides. The method centres on docking pseudosymmetric hetero-oligomeric building blocks in architectures with dihedral symmetry and designing an asymmetric protein–protein interface between them. We obtain an initial 30-subunit assembly with pseudo-D5 symmetry and generate variants in which we alter the size and morphology of the bifaceted nanoparticles by designing extensions to one of the subunits. Functionalization of the two nanoparticle faces with protein minibinders enables the specific colocalization of two populations of polystyrene microparticles coated with the target protein receptors. The ability to accurately design anisotropic protein nanoparticles could be broadly useful in applications requiring the colocalization of distinct target moieties. Predictive protein design and experiments are combined to develop anisotropic bifaceted protein nanomaterials using pseudosymmetric hetero-oligomeric building blocks.},

  abstract     = {The cathode interfacial layer (CIL) critically influences electron extraction and charge recombination, thereby playing a pivotal role in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, most state-of-the-art CILs are constrained by limited conductivity, high recombination and poor morphology, which collectively hinder device efficiency and stability. Here we report an inorganic–organic hybrid CIL (AZnO-F3N), developed by a dual-component synergy strategy, which integrates organic material PNDIT-F3N with two-dimensional amorphous zinc oxide. This design leverages the synergistic interactions between two-dimensional amorphous zinc oxide and PNDIT-F3N, resulting in reduced interfacial defect, enhanced conductivity and improved film uniformity. OSCs incorporating the AZnO-F3N CIL exhibit more efficient charge extraction and transport, along with reduced recombination. Consequently, a D18:L8-BO-based binary OSC achieves an efficiency of 20.6%. The introduction of BTP-eC9 as the third component further elevates the efficiency to 21.0% (certified as 20.8%). Moreover, the CIL demonstrates versatility across various active layers, thick-film configuration and flexible devices, underscoring its great potential to advance OSC technology. A hybrid cathode interfacial layer (AZnO-F3N) is developed, delivering 21.0% efficiency along with excellent stability, mechanical robustness and broad versatility, highlighting its potential to advance organic solar cells.},

Despite important advances in macroscopic frames, the realization and phonon imaging of nanoscale mechanical metamaterials has remained challenging. Here we extend the principle of topologically engineered mechanical frames to self-assembled nanoparticle lattices, resolving phonon dynamics using liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. The vibrations of nanoparticles in Maxwell lattices are used to measure properties that have been difficult to obtain, such as phonon band structures, nanoscale spring constants and nonlinear lattice deformation paths. Studies of five different lattices reveal that these properties are modulated by nanoscale colloidal interactions. Our discrete mechanical model and simulations capture these interactions and the critical role of effects beyond nearest neighbours, bridging mechanical metamaterials with nanoparticle self-assembly. Our study provides opportunities for understanding and manufacturing self-assembled nanostructures for phonon manipulation, offering solution processability, transformability and emergent functions at underexplored scales of length, frequency and energy density. The realization and phonon imaging of nanoscale mechanical metamaterials has remained challenging. Here the authors resolve the phonon dynamics and band structures of five different self-assembled nanoparticle lattices, revealing the role of nanoscale colloidal interactions in modulating the lattice properties.},

These flexible fuel cells operate across a broad temperature range, from –22 °C to 70 °C, showcasing cuttability, water resistance and fast refuelling capabilities, with full refuelling being achieved within 1 min. Furthermore, the fuel cells maintain consistent discharge performance, even after enduring 2,000 continuous flexing cycles. With an energy density of 161.36 Wh kg−1, these fibre-shaped direct methanol fuel cells surpass the energy densities of typical fibre-based power systems. This technology mitigates many of the technical challenges related to the lightweight and flexible application of fuel cells or fuel cell stacks for powering high-energy flexible devices. Cotton yarns encapsulated by a gel layer show dynamic swelling in methanol, creating interfacial self-reinforcement and pressure modulation mechanisms that enable the fabrication of fibre-shaped methanol fuel cells.},

  abstract     = {The ever-increasing demand for lithium-ion batteries has necessitated the development of high-performance cathode materials. However, previous studies have predominantly focused on crystal cathodes comprising the octahedral coordination of metal atoms and a well-ordered layered topology. This omits other cathode materials with other structures or coordination that could potentially surpass conventional counterparts in terms of performance. Here, using X-ray diffraction, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering and X-ray absorption near-edge spectra experiments, we investigated an amorphous Li–V–O–F cathode (a-LVOF) with tetrahedral coordination and elucidated an O–O formal redox mechanism at a moderate voltage of 4.1 V, without a conventional octahedral Li–O–Li configuration. The electrochemically amorphized material fosters randomly distributed VO4 units and scattered dangling oxygen bonds, which facilitated O–O binding. Moreover, a-LVOF demonstrates a high capacity of 230 mAh g−1. Our findings reveal a low-voltage O–O formal redox mechanism in an amorphized cathode material. Cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries typically possess octahedral coordination, which may exclude other possible solutions to degradation during deep cycling. A series of tetrahedral-framework-based amorphous Li–V–O–F materials are investigated, and shown to demonstrate O–O formal redox at 4.1 V.},

Here we report the signatures of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) embedded in hexagonal boron nitride. Hexagonal boron nitride provides crucial edge stabilization, enabling the direct probing of this intrinsic magnetism. Scanning nitrogen-vacancy-centre microscopy initially confirmed magnetism in zGNR. Subsequently, an ~9-nm-wide zGNR transistor was fabricated with a sub-50-nm channel length. Magnetotransport measurements at 4 K revealed distinct Fabry–Pérot-like interference patterns, indicating coherent transport. A large, anisotropic magnetoresistance (~175 Ω, ~1.3%) was observed, persisting well above room temperature. These findings strongly corroborate the existence of robust magnetic ordering in the zGNR edge state. This hexagonal-boron-nitride-embedded zGNR system offers an effective platform for future graphene-based spintronic devices. Nitrogen-vacancy-centre microscopy and anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements reveal the evidence of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons embedded in hexagonal boron nitride.},

  abstract     = {Optically excited quantum materials exhibit non-equilibrium states with remarkable emergent properties, but these phenomena are usually transient, decaying on picosecond timescales and limiting practical applications. Advancing the design and control of non-equilibrium phases requires the development of targeted strategies to achieve long-lived, metastable phases. Here we report the discovery of symmetry-protected electronic metastability in the model cuprate ladder Sr14Cu24O41. Using femtosecond resonant X-ray scattering and spectroscopy, we show that this metastability is driven by a transfer of holes from chain-like charge reservoirs into the ladders. This ultrafast charge redistribution arises from the optical dressing and activation of a hopping pathway that is forbidden by symmetry at equilibrium. Relaxation back to the ground state is, hence, suppressed after the pump coherence dissipates. Our findings highlight how dressing materials with electromagnetic fields can dynamically activate terms in the electronic Hamiltonian, and provide a rational design strategy for non-equilibrium phases of matter. A long-lived photoinduced metastable state in a quasi-one-dimensional cuprate, Sr14Cu24O41, is reported.},

  abstract     = {In polycyclic heteroaromatic (PHA) emitters, which possess great potential for application in ultrahigh-definition displays, the origin of a small singlet–triplet energy gap (ΔES1T1) and its relationship with the molecular structure still remain poorly established. Here we derive an effective expression for ΔES1T1, in which ΔES1T1 positively depends on 2KHL (where KHL is the exchange energy between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)) and on the energy gap between LUMO and LUMO + 1 (ΔELUMO–LUMO+1). This expression for ΔES1T1 is validated over a series of 100 reported PHA emitters. It allows us to easily identify various molecular design approaches for managing ΔES1T1 by synergistically regulating 2KHL and ΔELUMO–LUMO+1. The proof-of-concept PHA molecules were synthesized and characterized to further confirm the validity of this expression for ΔES1T1. Overall, our work provides a physical picture to not only modulate ΔES1T1 in emerging PHA emitters but also design and screen such materials with small ΔES1T1. Insight into the singlet–triplet energy gap and molecular structure relationship in polycyclic heteroaromatic molecules enables organic light-emitting diodes based on multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence, with improved efficiency and roll-off.},

Conversely, leaky waves can convert radiation from confined sources towards the far field. Here we combine hyperbolic polaritons and leaky wave radiation to demonstrate flatland leaky polaritonic wakes. We employ a mixed-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure consisting of a nanoscale waveguide strip on a van der Waals film. The waveguide mode, confined inside the hyperbolic light cone of the background film, enables efficient directional in-plane emission of fast phonon polaritons. The constructive interference of these leaky polaritons generates highly directional polaritonic wakes. Their spatial symmetry can be tailored through the orientation of the heterostructure with respect to the hyperbolic film dispersion. Leveraging van der Waals stacking, we also demonstrate effective acceleration and deceleration of polaritonic wakes by locally tailoring the leaky nano-waveguide dispersion through gradient thickness design. Our findings demonstrate that polaritonic wakes hold promise for integrated nanophotonic circuits. The authors combine the strong confinement of hyperbolic polaritons with leaky nano-waveguides to demonstrate directional in-plane emission of fast phonon polaritons and their acceleration and deceleration by tailoring waveguide dispersion.},

  abstract     = {Material fractures are typically irreversible, marking a one-time event leading to failure. Great efforts have been made to enhance both strength and fracture toughness of bulk materials for engineering applications, such as by introducing self-recovery and secondary breaking behaviours. In low-dimensional structures, two-dimensional materials often exhibit exceptional strength but accompanied by extreme brittleness. Here we discover that the toughness of two-dimensional materials can be enhanced without sacrificing strength—by simply twisting the layers. Through in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, supported by nanoindentation and theoretical analysis, we reveal that twisted bilayer structures enable sequential fracture events: initial cracks heal to form stable grain boundaries, which then shield subsequent fracture tips from stress concentration. This process consumes additional energy compared with conventional fracture, with toughness enhancement tunable through twist angle adjustment. The intrinsic toughening mechanism via twisting, along with the emerging electronic properties of twistronics that are currently attracting substantial attention, presents an exciting opportunity for future devices. Intrinsic toughening in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides can be achieved simply by twisting the layers. This twisting promotes cross-layer healing and grain boundary formation, which shield fracture tips from stress concentration.},

Here we reveal an anomalous mechanical interlayer coupling that involves interlayer-friction toughening and edge-reconstruction embrittlement during the fracture of multilayer h-BN. Both asynchronous and synchronous fracture modes and their flaw-size dependence are identified. Edge reconstruction in the synchronous fracture mode can eliminate a toughening mechanism induced by lattice asymmetry in monolayer h-BN, leading to embrittlement of the multilayer h-BN, while the asynchronous fracture mode results in greater fracture resistance. Such findings will provide fundamental guidelines for engineering interlayer interactions in vdW materials including heterostructures and layered architectures for better mechanical and functional performances.

However, this process often results in catastrophic fracture when applied to most inorganic semiconductors owing to their inherent brittleness.

Once subject to external stress, the crystalline Te/S sublattice undergoes a uniform transformation into an amorphous state, whereas the Ag cations continuously bond with Te/S anions, endowing bulk Ag2Te1–xSx with exceptional plastic deformability. Remarkably, even slight polishing can induce sublattice amorphization in the surface layers. Furthermore, this sublattice amorphization can be reversed to crystals through simple annealing, enlightening the iterative sublattice amorphization strategy, with which metal-like wire drawing, curving, forging and ultrahigh ductility have been obtained in bulk Ag2Te1–xSx at room temperature. These results highlight sublattice amorphization as a critical plastic deformation mechanism in silver chalcogenide inorganic semiconductors, which will facilitate their applications in flexible electronics and drive further exploration of more plastic inorganic semiconductors. Sublattice amorphization is revealed as the deformation mechanism of Ag2Te1–xSx (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.6), based on which an iterative crystalline–amorphous transition strategy is proposed to enable these bulk inorganic semiconductors with metal-like processability.},

Because of their brittleness, semiconductors are usually processed by the complicated techniques of sputtering or deposition2–4, instead of the effective and versatile metalworking methods like rolling, extrusion and pressing used with metals5. Here we show that brittle semiconductors can be plastically manufactured with an extensibility as large as ~3,000% using warm metalworking, that is, plastic manufacturing at slightly elevated temperatures (empirically below 500 K). Many bulk brittle semiconductors, such as Cu2Se, Ag2Se and Bi90Sb10, can be processed like metals below 400–500 K into free-standing, large and high-quality films with a thickness from the macro-scale to the micrometre scale. A model based on temperature-dependent collective atomic displacement and thermal vibration is proposed to explain the superior plasticity. The warm-metalworked films can retain the excellent and tunable physical properties of the bulk versions, such as a high carrier mobility up to ~5,000 cm2 V−1 s−1 and tunable electrical conductivities over six orders of magnitude by adjusting the chemical composition. A case study in film thermoelectric devices demonstrates ultra-high normalized output power densities of 43–54 μW cm−2 K−2. This work suggests that brittle semiconductors can be manufactured by warm metalworking for applications in various electronics.

  abstract     = {Despite 10% of the Earth’s surface being covered by ice, ice power remains untapped. Although ice is known to generate electricity upon bending via flexoelectricity1, the generated electric polarization per curvature, that is, the flexoelectric coefficient, is too small (~1–10 nC m−1) to be utilized for electromechanical devices. Here we demonstrate that doping ice with NaCl can enhance its flexoelectric coefficient 1,000-fold, to ~1–10 μC m−1. We find that this enhancement is due to the bending-induced streaming current along ice grain boundaries. On the basis of this mechanism, we fabricated flexural devices with an effective piezoelectric coefficient of ~4,000 pC N−1, which is comparable to that of the best piezoelectric materials. The high flexoelectricity of saline ice brings the vision of harnessing ice power one step closer to reality, and may also be relevant to the electrical activity of ice-covered terrestrial regions and icy ocean worlds such as Europa or Enceladus. In addition, the model for coupling between strain gradients and streaming currents is not limited to ice and provides a general framework for extracting electromechanical activity from liquid-infused porous solids. By doping ice with NaCl, it is shown that a flexoelectric coefficient of up to 10 μC m−1 is generated, enabling effective piezoelectric coefficients that are comparable to those of ceramics. This arises from the streaming current of quasi-liquid flow through grain boundaries from one side of the sample to the other.},

We cover how sustainable software and computational methods have accelerated materials design while becoming more open source and collaborative in nature. Next, we present cases where the Materials Project was used to understand and discover functional materials. We then describe our efforts to meet the needs of an expanding user base, through technical infrastructure updates ranging from data architecture and cloud resources to interactive web applications. Finally, we discuss opportunities to better aid the research community, with the vision that more accessible and easy-to-understand materials data will result in democratized materials knowledge and an increasingly collaborative community. Materials design and informatics have become increasingly prominent over the past several decades. Using the Materials Project as an example, this Perspective discusses how properties are calculated and curated, how this knowledge can be used for materials discovery, and the challenges in modelling complex material systems or managing software architecture.},

Here we introduce HippoMaps, an open access toolbox and online data warehouse for the mapping and contextualization of subregional hippocampal data in the human brain ( http://hippomaps.readthedocs.io ). HippoMaps capitalizes on a unified hippocampal unfolding approach as well as shape intrinsic registration capabilities to allow for cross-participant and cross-modal data aggregation. We initialize this repository with a combination of hippocampal data spanning three-dimensional ex vivo histology, ex vivo 9.4-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as in vivo structural MRI and resting-state functional MRI obtained at 3 Tesla and 7 Tesla, together with intracranial encephalography recordings in patients with epilepsy. All code, data and tools are openly available online, with the aim of fostering further community contributions.

As a solution to this problem, we developed a robotic nonlinear optical system for iterative multiphoton microscopy and opto-micromachining. Adaptive control enabled days-long autonomous operation, while spatiotemporal line-focused ablation increased the machining efficiency by 100-fold over prior configurations. Using the intact murine craniocerebral system as a test bed, our approach demonstrates the potential for whole-body submicrometer resolution imaging and anatomical reconstruction.

  abstract     = {Volumetric functional imaging of transient cellular signaling and motion dynamics is often limited by hardware bandwidth and the scarcity of photons under short exposures. To overcome these challenges, we introduce squeezed light field microscopy (SLIM), a computational imaging approach that rapidly captures high-resolution three-dimensional light signals using only a single, low-format camera sensor. SLIM records over 1,000 volumes per second across a 550-µm diameter field of view and 300-µm depth, achieving 3.6-µm lateral and 6-µm axial resolution. Here we demonstrate its utility in blood cell velocimetry within the embryonic zebrafish brain and in freely moving tails undergoing high-frequency swings. Millisecond-scale temporal resolution further enables precise voltage imaging of neural membrane potentials in the leech ganglion and hippocampus of behaving mice. Together, these results establish SLIM as a versatile and robust tool for high-speed volumetric microscopy across diverse biological systems. Squeezed light field microscopy (SLIM) combines ideas from tomography and compressed sensing with light field microscopy to enable volumetric imaging at kilohertz rates, as demonstrated in blood flow imaging in zebrafish and voltage imaging in leeches and mice.},

Histopathological diagnosis of disease and most multiplexed spatial profiling relies on inspecting thin (4–5 µm) specimens. Here we describe a high-plex cyclic immunofluorescence method for three-dimensional tissue imaging and use it to show that few, if any, cells are intact in conventional thin tissue sections, reducing the accuracy of cell phenotyping and interaction analysis. However, three-dimensional cyclic immunofluorescence of sections eightfold to tenfold thicker enables accurate morphological assessment of diverse protein markers in intact tumor, immune and stromal cells. Moreover, the high resolution of this confocal approach generates images of cells in a preserved tissue environment at a level of detail previously limited to cell culture. Precise imaging of cell membranes also makes it possible to detect and map cell–cell contacts and juxtracrine signaling complexes in immune cell niches. Confocal microscopy enables high-resolution, high-plex 3D cyclic immunofluorescence of 30- to 50-µm-thick tissue sections. The approach allows for rich phenotypic assessments of intact cells and intercellular interactions with subcellular resolution.},

  abstract     = {High-resolution tissue imaging is often compromised by sample-induced optical aberrations that degrade resolution and contrast. Although wavefront sensor-based adaptive optics (AO) can measure these aberrations, such hardware solutions are typically complex, expensive to implement and slow when serially mapping spatially varying aberrations across large fields of view. Here we introduce AOViFT (adaptive optical vision Fourier transformer)—a machine learning-based aberration sensing framework built around a three-dimensional multistage vision transformer that operates on Fourier domain embeddings. AOViFT infers aberrations and restores diffraction-limited performance in puncta-labeled specimens with substantially reduced computational cost, training time and memory footprint compared to conventional architectures or real-space networks. We validated AOViFT on live gene-edited zebrafish embryos, demonstrating its ability to correct spatially varying aberrations using either a deformable mirror or postacquisition deconvolution. By eliminating the need for the guide star and wavefront sensing hardware and simplifying the experimental workflow, AOViFT lowers technical barriers for high-resolution volumetric microscopy across diverse biological samples. Adaptive optical vision Fourier transformer (AOViFT) is a machine learning-based framework for accurately inferring aberrations and restoring diffraction-limited performance in diverse biological specimens.},

  abstract     = {Multiplexed imaging offers a powerful approach to characterize the spatial topography of tissues in both health and disease. To analyze such data, the specific combination of markers that are present in each cell must be enumerated to enable accurate phenotyping, a process that often relies on unsupervised clustering. We constructed the Pan-Multiplex (Pan-M) dataset containing 197 million distinct annotations of marker expression across 15 different cell types. We used Pan-M to create Nimbus, a deep learning model to predict marker positivity from multiplexed image data. Nimbus is a pretrained model that uses the underlying images to classify marker expression of individual cells as positive or negative across distinct cell types, from different tissues, acquired using different microscope platforms, without requiring any retraining. We demonstrate that Nimbus predictions capture the underlying staining patterns of the full diversity of markers present in Pan-M, and that Nimbus matches or exceeds the accuracy of previous approaches that must be retrained on each dataset. We then show how Nimbus predictions can be integrated with downstream clustering algorithms to robustly identify cell subtypes in image data. We have open-sourced Nimbus and Pan-M to enable community use at https://github.com/angelolab/Nimbus-Inference . Nimbus, a deep learning model, uses a large multiplexed imaging dataset to predict the likelihood of marker positivity in single cells.},

  abstract     = {Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy (SMFM) can reveal important biological insights. However, uncovering rare but critical intermediates often demands manual inspection of time traces and iterative ad hoc approaches. To facilitate systematic and efficient discovery from SMFM time traces, we introduce META-SiM, a transformer-based foundation model pretrained on diverse SMFM analysis tasks. META-SiM rivals best-in-class algorithms on a broad range of tasks including trace classification, segmentation, idealization and stepwise photobleaching analysis. Additionally, the model produces embeddings that encapsulate detailed information about each trace, which the web-based META-SiM Projector ( https://www.simol-projector.org ) casts into lower-dimensional space for efficient whole-dataset visualization, labeling, comparison and sharing. Combining this Projector with the objective metric of local Shannon entropy enables rapid identification of condition-specific behaviors, even if rare or subtle. Applying META-SiM to an existing single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer dataset, we discover a previously undetected intermediate state in pre-mRNA splicing. META-SiM removes bottlenecks, improves objectivity and both systematizes and accelerates biological discovery in single-molecule data. META-SiM brings foundation model power to single-molecule time traces, excelling across diverse analysis tasks. Paired with the web-based META-SiM Projector and entropy mapping, it rapidly reveals hidden molecular behaviors inaccessible by other means.},

  abstract     = {Cryogenic electron microscopy is a powerful tool in structural biology. In thick specimens, challenges arise as an exponentially larger fraction of the transmitted electrons lose energy from inelastic scattering and can no longer be properly focused as a result of chromatic aberrations in the post-specimen optics. Rather than filtering out the inelastic scattering at the price of reducing potential signal, as is done in energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy, we show how a dose-efficient and unfiltered image can be rapidly obtained using tilt-corrected bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy data collected on a pixelated detector. Enhanced contrast and a 3–5× improvement in dose efficiency are observed for two-dimensional images of intact bacterial cells and large organelles using tilt-corrected bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy compared to energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy for thicknesses beyond 500 nm. As a proof of concept for the technique’s performance in structural determination, we present a single-particle analysis map at sub-nanometer resolution for a highly symmetric virus-like particle determined from 789 particles. Tilt-corrected bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy offers enhanced cryogenic electron microscopy contrast and substantial improvement in dose efficiency for thick samples such as bacterial cells and large organelles, while still being able to perform single-particle analysis.},

Native top-down mass spectrometry promises to preserve the critical link between modifications and interactions. However, current methods often fail to detect uncharacterized or low-abundance modifications, limiting insights into proteoform diversity. To address this gap, we introduce precise and accurate Identification Of Native proteoforms (precisION), an interactive end-to-end software package that leverages a robust, data-driven fragment-level open search to detect, localize and quantify ‘hidden’ modifications within intact protein complexes. Applying precisION to four therapeutically relevant targets—PDE6, ACE2, osteopontin (SPP1) and a GABA transporter (GAT1)—we discover undocumented phosphorylation, glycosylation and lipidation, and resolve previously uninterpretable density in an electron cryo-microscopy map of GAT1. As an open-source software package, precisION offers an intuitive means for interpreting complex protein fragmentation data. This tool will empower the community to unlock the potential of native top-down mass spectrometry, advancing integrative structural biology, molecular pathology and drug development. precisION discovers, localizes and quantifies protein modifications within complex proteoform assemblies through data-driven analysis of native top-down mass spectra.},

The emergence of new methods designed to tackle the heterogeneity challenge reflects this new paradigm, enabling users to gain a better understanding of protein dynamics. However, the question of how intrinsically different heterogeneity algorithms compare remains unsolved, which is crucial for determining the reliability, stability and correctness of the estimated conformational landscapes. Here, to overcome the previous challenge, we introduce FlexConsenus: a multi-autoencoder neural network able to learn the commonalities and differences among several conformational landscapes, enabling them to be placed in a shared consensus space with enhanced reliability. The consensus space enables the measurement of reproducibility in heterogeneity estimations, allowing users to either focus their analysis on particles with a stable estimation of their structural variability or concentrate on specific particle subsets detected by only certain methods. FlexConsensus is a multi-autoencoder-based algorithm for merging different conformational landscapes from cryogenic electron microscopy heterogeneity analysis into a common latent space for the identification of similarities and differences among various methods. This helps in the validation of estimated conformational landscape and provides tools to streamline the heterogeneity workflow.},

Here we present a systematic framework to extract and analyze interpretable features from PLMs using sparse autoencoders. Training sparse autoencoders on ESM-2 embeddings, we identify thousands of interpretable features highlighting biological concepts including binding sites, structural motifs and functional domains. Individual neurons show considerably less conceptual alignment, suggesting PLMs store concepts in superposition. This superposition persists across model scales and larger PLMs capture more interpretable concepts. Beyond known annotations, ESM-2 learns coherent patterns across evolutionarily distinct protein families. To systematically analyze these numerous features, we developed an automated interpretation approach using large language models for feature description and validation. As practical applications, these features can accurately identify missing database annotations and enable targeted steering of sequence generation. Our results show PLM representations can be decomposed into interpretable components, demonstrating the feasibility and utility of mechanistically interpreting these models. InterPLM is a computational framework to extract and analyze interpretable features from protein language models using sparse autoencoders. By training sparse autoencoders on ESM-2 embeddings, this study identifies thousands of interpretable biological features learned by the different layers of the ESM-2 model.},

Here we present CaCoFold-R3D, a probabilistic grammar that predicts these RNA 3D motifs (also termed modules) jointly with RNA secondary structure over a sequence or alignment. CaCoFold-R3D uses evolutionary information present in an RNA alignment to reliably identify canonical helices (including pseudoknots) by covariation. Here we further introduce the R3D grammars, which also exploit helix covariation that constrains the positioning of the mostly noncovarying RNA 3D motifs. Our method runs predictions over an almost-exhaustive list of over 50 known RNA motifs (‘everything’). Motifs can appear in any nonhelical loop region (including three-way, four-way and higher junctions) (‘everywhere’). All structural motifs as well as the canonical helices are arranged into one single structure predicted by one single joint probabilistic grammar (‘all-at-once’). Our results demonstrate that CaCoFold-R3D is a valid alternative for predicting the all-residue interactions present in a RNA 3D structure. CaCoFold-R3D is fast and easily customizable for novel motif discovery and shows promising value both as a strong input for deep learning approaches to all-atom structure prediction as well as toward guiding RNA design as drug targets for therapeutic small molecules. CaCoFold-R3D is a probabilistic model that simultaneously predicts the RNA 3D motifs jointly with the secondary structure in a structural RNA using evolutionary information.},

  abstract     = {Genome editing enables sequence-function profiling of endogenous cis-regulatory elements, driving understanding of their mechanisms. However, these approaches lack direct, scalable readouts of chromatin accessibility across long single-molecule chromatin fibers. Here we leverage double-stranded DNA cytidine deaminases to profile chromatin accessibility at endogenous loci of interest through targeted PCR and long-read sequencing, a method we term targeted deaminase-accessible chromatin sequencing (TDAC-seq). With high sequence coverage at targeted loci, TDAC-seq can be integrated with CRISPR perturbations to link genetic edits and their effects on chromatin accessibility on the same single chromatin fiber at single-nucleotide resolution. We employed TDAC-seq to parse CRISPR edits that activate fetal hemoglobin in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) during erythroid differentiation as well as in pooled CRISPR and base-editing screens tiling an enhancer controlling the globin locus. We further scaled the method to interrogate 947 variants in a GFI1B-linked enhancer associated with myeloproliferative neoplasm risk in a single pooled CRISPR experiment in CD34+ HSPCs. Together, TDAC-seq enables high-resolution sequence-function mapping of single-molecule chromatin fibers by genome editing.

Making the most of such data for inference and prediction requires modeling approaches that can relate species occurrences to environmental and spatial predictors, while incorporating information about their taxonomic or phylogenetic placement. Even if the scalability of joint species distribution models to large communities has greatly advanced, incorporating hundreds of thousands of species has not been feasible to date, leading to compromised analyses. Here we present a ‘common to rare transfer learning’ (CORAL) approach, based on borrowing information from the common species to enable statistically and computationally efficient modeling of both common and rare species. We illustrate that CORAL leads to much improved prediction and inference in the context of DNA metabarcoding data from Madagascar, comprising 255,188 arthropod species detected in 2,874 samples. CORAL can infer the occurrence of rare species based on common species, using DNA metabarcoding data or other high-dimensional biodiversity data.

To find homologous protein matches, Spacedust uses fast and sensitive structure comparison with Foldseek. Partially conserved clusters are detected using novel clustering and order conservation P values. We demonstrate Spacedust’s sensitivity with an all-versus-all analysis of 1,308 bacterial genomes, identifying 72,843 conserved gene clusters containing 58% of the 4.2 million genes.

  abstract     = {DNA methylation and histone modifications encode epigenetic information. Recently, major progress was made to measure either mark at a single-cell resolution; however, a method for simultaneous detection is lacking, preventing study of their interactions. Here, to bridge this gap, we developed scEpi2-seq. Our technique provides a readout of histone modifications and DNA methylation at the single-cell and single-molecule level. Application in a cell line with the FUCCI cell cycle reporter system reveals how DNA methylation maintenance is influenced by the local chromatin context. In addition, profiling of H3K27me3 and DNA methylation in the mouse intestine yields insights into epigenetic interactions during cell type specification. Differentially methylated regions also demonstrated independent cell-type regulation in addition to H3K27me3 regulation, which reinforces that CpG methylation acts as an additional layer of control in facultative heterochromatin. This work presents scEpi2-seq, a method for simultaneous single-cell profiling of DNA methylation and histone modifications, enabling direct investigation of the interplay between these two epigenomic marks.},

  abstract     = {Genetic variants (both coding and noncoding) can impact gene function and expression, driving disease mechanisms such as cancer progression. The systematic study of endogenous genetic variants is hindered by inefficient precision editing tools, combined with technical limitations in confidently linking genotypes to gene expression at single-cell resolution. We developed single-cell DNA–RNA sequencing (SDR-seq) to simultaneously profile up to 480 genomic DNA loci and genes in thousands of single cells, enabling accurate determination of coding and noncoding variant zygosity alongside associated gene expression changes. Using SDR-seq, we associate coding and noncoding variants with distinct gene expression in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in primary B cell lymphoma samples, cells with a higher mutational burden exhibit elevated B cell receptor signaling and tumorigenic gene expression. SDR-seq provides a powerful platform to dissect regulatory mechanisms encoded by genetic variants, advancing our understanding of gene expression regulation and its implications for disease. This study introduces SDR-seq, a droplet-based single-cell DNA–RNA sequencing platform, enabling the study of gene expression profiles linked to both noncoding and coding variants.},

  abstract     = {The set of quantum logic gates that can be easily implemented is fundamental to the performance of quantum computers, as it governs the accuracy of basic quantum operations and dictates the complexity of implementing quantum algorithms. Traditional approaches to extending gate sets often require operating devices outside the ideal parameter regimes used to realize qubits, leading to increased control complexity while offering only a limited set of gates. Here we experimentally demonstrate a unified and versatile gate scheme capable of generating arbitrary two-qubit gates using only an exchange interaction and qubit driving on a superconducting quantum processor. We achieve high fidelities averaging 99.38% across a wide range of commonly used two-qubit unitaries, enabling precise multipartite entangled state preparation. Furthermore, we successfully produce a B gate, which efficiently synthesizes the entire family of two-qubit gates. Our results establish that fully exploiting the capabilities of the exchange interaction can yield a comprehensive and highly accurate gate set. With maximum expressivity, optimal gate time, demonstrated high fidelity and easy adaption to other quantum platforms, our unified control scheme offers the prospect of improved performance in quantum hardware and algorithm development. The efficiency of a quantum computer depends on which basic operations it can implement. Now a scheme that can implement any two-qubit logic gate has been demonstrated on a superconducting architecture.},

Microfabricated high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonators (μHBARs) support high-frequency mechanical modes above 10 GHz with coherence times exceeding one millisecond. Here we demonstrate a μHBAR-based cavity optomechanical system that permits quantum optomechanical control of individual high-coherence phonon modes. We perform laser cooling of the phonon modes from an occupation of approximately 22 phonons to fewer than 0.4, corresponding to laser-based ground-state cooling of a mechanical object with a mass of 7.5 μg. During the cooling process we do not observe any absorption-induced heating, demonstrating the resilience of the HBAR optomechanical systems against parasitic heating. Our work demonstrates that μHBARs are promising as the basis for quantum optomechanical systems with robustness to decoherence that is necessary for efficient, low-noise photon–phonon conversion. A massive phonon mode in a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator has been laser cooled close to its ground state. Its robustness to decoherence establishes the potential of these devices for quantum technologies.},

To incorporate these devices into quantum networks, a spin–photon interface is required. Currently, the best on-demand single-photon sources use a semiconductor quantum dot in an engineered photonic environment. However, it is difficult to achieve coherent spin control in a high-performance single-photon source, and spin coherence is limited by magnetic noise from nuclear spins in the semiconductor host material. Here we combine all-optical spin control with a quantum dot in an open microcavity. We demonstrate fast coherent rotations of a hole spin around an arbitrary axis of the Bloch sphere with a maximum π-pulse fidelity of 98.6%. To suppress the slow magnetic noise, we laser cool the nuclear spins using the hole as a central spin. This extends the hole spin free-induction-decay time by more than an order of magnitude. It becomes much larger than both rotation time and radiative recombination time of the spin, enabling the creation of many spin–photon pairs before the loss of spin coherence. Spin–photon interfaces provide a connection between quantum information stored in atomic or electronic spins and optical communications networks. A quantum photon emitter with long-lived, controllable coherent spin has now been demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Superconducting qubits possess outstanding capabilities for processing quantum information in the microwave domain; however they have limited coherence times. An interface between photons and phonons could allow quantum information to be stored in long-lived mechanical oscillators. Here, we introduce a platform that relies on electrostatic forces in nanoscale structures to achieve strong coupling between a superconducting qubit and a nanomechanical oscillator with an energy decay time (T1) of approximately 25 ms, well beyond those achieved in integrated superconducting circuits. We use quantum operations in this system to investigate the microscopic origins of mechanical decoherence and mitigate its impact. By using two-pulse dynamical decoupling sequences, we can extend the coherence time (T2) from 64 μs to 1 ms. These findings establish that mechanical oscillators can act as quantum memories for superconducting devices, with potential future applications in quantum computing, sensing and transduction. Superconducting qubits, a leading platform for quantum information processing, suffer from decoherence. Interfacing them with nanomechanical oscillators allows quantum information to be stored in motional states with longer lifetimes.},

Quantum optical skyrmions with local topological textures are expected to reshape the landscape of quantum photonic technology, although their experimental implementation has not yet been demonstrated. Here we present experimental realizations of nanophotonic quantum skyrmions using a semiconductor cavity quantum electrodynamics system. By manipulating the photonic spin–orbit coupling in a Gaussian microcavity, we obtained a confined optical mode whose polarizations feature skyrmionic topologies. With pronounced cavity quantum electrodynamics effects, we generated and detected single-photon skyrmions from a solid-state quantum emitter deterministically coupled to the Gaussian microcavity. The polarity associated with single-photon skyrmions can be swapped by flipping the polarization of the quantum emitter through the Zeeman effect. We also investigated the topological protection of quantum optical skyrmions under different perturbations. Our work opens an unexplored aspect of quantum light–matter interactions in the nanoscale and might advance resilient photonic quantum technology with high-dimensional qubits and high-capacity quantum memories. Quantum optical skyrmions are promising for quantum photonic applications but have not been experimentally realized.

It involves successive cycles of confinement and release that drive important morphological changes. However, it remains unclear whether migrating cells can retain a memory of their past morphological states that could potentially facilitate their navigation through confined spaces. We demonstrate that local geometry governs a switch between two cell morphologies, thereby facilitating cell passage through long and narrow gaps. We combined cell migration assays on standardized microsystems with biophysical modelling and biochemical perturbations to show that migrating cells have a long-term memory of past confinement events. The morphological cell states correlate across transitions through actin cortex remodelling. These findings indicate that mechanical memory in migrating cells plays an active role in their migratory potential in confined environments. Cells often navigate through confined spaces. Now it is shown that cells retain a mechanical memory of previous confinement events, which makes them more efficient at migrating through narrow microenvironments.},

Here we show that the water menisci formed around bacteria lead to capillary attraction between cells while still allowing them to slide past one another. We develop an experimental apparatus that allows us to control bacterial collective behaviour by varying the strength and range of capillary forces. Combining three-dimensional imaging and cell tracking with agent-based modelling, we demonstrate that capillary attraction organizes rod-shaped bacteria into densely packed nematic groups and influences their collective dynamics and morphologies. Our results suggest that capillary forces may be a ubiquitous physical ingredient in shaping microbial communities in partially hydrated environments. Bacteria tend to live in thin layers of water on surfaces. Now the capillary forces in these layers are shown to help organize the bacteria into dense packs.},

Central to this process is the formation of molecular clutches, which are dynamic linkages between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton mediated by integrins and adaptor proteins. Although it is well known that force-dependent interactions between molecular-clutch components are essential for sensing substrate rigidity, the influence of nonlinear adaptor-protein elasticity is poorly understood. Here we show that adaptor-protein elasticity and local interactions between molecular clutches and the extracellular matrix are key to cellular perception of substrate stiffness. We present a semi-analytical theory that integrates experimentally measured force responses of adaptor proteins to describe cell-adhesion sensing. We propose that molecular clutches probe local mechanical substrate properties and collectively function as a differential that allows a retrograde actin flow and substrate movement to occur at different rates while maintaining a stable mechanical coupling between them. Our model reproduces experimentally measured force-loading rates of individual molecular clutches and correctly predicts cell-adhesion behaviour for a range of substrate stiffnesses. The framework presented can be extended to study complex phenomena such as focal-adhesion maturation and cell-type-specific mechanosensing. The cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix are linked by molecular clutches that enable cells to sense their environment. Now it is shown that the elastic properties of the clutches underpin stiffness sensing.},

Although the exposed microtubule exterior is readily accessible to proteins, the mechanism governing the accessibility of the confined microtubule lumen to luminal particles remains unknown. Here we show that certain tubulin family proteins (isotypes) facilitate luminal accessibility because of the mechanical properties and lateral interactions that they confer to the microtubules. We characterized the microtubules reconstituted from defined compositions of Caenorhabditis elegans tubulin isotypes. These tubulin isotypes form microtubules with comparable protofilament numbers but different luminal accessibility. We further revealed the role of tubulin isotypes in regulating the strength of inter-protofilament lateral interactions, which determines luminal accessibility through the mechanosensitivity of reversible protofilament separation. Deformation of the microtubule lattice, which generates stresses exceeding the strength of the lateral interactions, creates gaps between adjacent protofilaments, enhancing the accessibility of the lumen. Together, our findings uncovered the tubulin isotype-dependent mechanical plasticity that confers force sensitivity to the microtubule lattice and modulates the energy barrier for luminal proteins to access the lumen. Proteins interact with both the exterior and interior of microtubules. Here the relationship between microtubule building blocks and the accessibility of the microtubule interior to proteins is clarified.},

  abstract     = {Motility-induced phase separation occurs in assemblies of self-propelled units when activity is coupled negatively to density. By contrast, the consequences of a positive coupling between density and activity on the collective behaviour of active matter remain unexplored. Here we show that collective activity can emerge from such a positive coupling among non-motile building blocks. We perform experiments with self-sustained oscillators powered by contact-charge electrophoresis. Although the oscillators are non-motile by design, they spontaneously form an active gas when confined together. The super-elastic nature of collisions constitutes a positive density–activity coupling and underlies the active gas properties. Elucidating the origin of binary collisions allows us to precisely control the structure of the active gas and its eventual crystallization. Beyond considering the overlooked positive coupling between density and activity, our work suggests that rich collective properties can emerge not only from the symmetry of interactions between active building blocks but also from their adaptable and responsive behaviour. In active matter systems, increasing density usually reduces activity.

  abstract     = {The ability to manipulate polar entities with multiple external fields could enable functionalities and applications in spin systems, photonics, metamaterials and soft matter. Liquid crystals that exhibit both a crystalline structure and liquid fluidity represent a promising platform for manipulating phases with polar molecular order, notably ferroelectric ones. However, achieving a polar symmetry is challenging with rod-shaped liquid crystal molecules, which form predominantly apolar nematic phases. Here we report an approach in which a geometric lattice confinement of nematic liquid crystals is used to induce planar polar order on the scale of a mesoscopic metamaterial. We confine the nematic liquid crystal in a micropillar array, forming topological defect–pillar pairs of elastic dipoles with a free top interface in contact with an immiscible fluid. The resulting dipole lattice configurations can be programmed rheologically by flowing the top fluid and maintained even after flow cessation, a phenomenon attributed to orientational multistability of the dipoles. This multimemory effect enables the encoding and reconfiguration of directional information. Overall, these results advance our understanding of topological dipoles under confinement and shear flow, enabling the detection, tracking and recording of flow profiles and could facilitate the development of stimuli-responsive materials. Programmable topological dipoles could be used in stimuli-responsive materials. Now it is shown that confinement of an apolar liquid crystal results in controllable polar arrangements of elastic dipoles.},

  abstract     = {Topological defects give rise to non-trivial excitations—such as solitons, vortices and skyrmions—characterized by integer-valued topological charges. However, their classification becomes difficult when singularities are present in the order parameter field, complicating the computation of these charges. Although exotic nonlinear excitations have been theoretically proposed in the superfluid 3He-A phase and spinor Bose–Einstein condensates, they have not been experimentally observed and their stability has not been investigated. Here we demonstrate the presence of a singular skyrmion that goes beyond the framework of topology in a ferromagnetic superfluid. These skyrmions emerge from anomalous symmetry-breaking associated with an eccentric spin singularity and carry half the elementary charge—a feature that distinguishes them from conventional skyrmions and merons. We realize the universal regime of the quantum Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, and we identify the unconventional fractional skyrmions produced by emission from a magnetic domain wall and the spontaneous splitting of an integer skyrmion with spin singularities. The singular skyrmions are stable even after 2 s of hold time. Our results confirm the universality between classical and quantum Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities and broaden our understanding of complex nonlinear dynamics for a non-trivial texture in topological quantum systems. The quantum Kelvin–Helmholtz instability can induce non-trivial topological excitations. Now a proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates the emergence of a stable singular fractional skyrmion spin texture originating from this quantum instability.},

  abstract     = {Fractional quantum statistics are the defining characteristic of anyons. Measuring the phase generated by an exchange of anyons is challenging, as standard interferometry set-ups—such as the Fabry–Pérot interferometer—suffer from charging effects that obscure the interference signal. Here we present the observation of anyonic interference and exchange phases in an optical-like Mach–Zehnder interferometer based on co-propagating interface modes. By avoiding backscattering and deleterious charging effects, this set-up enables pristine and robust Aharonov–Bohm interference without any phase slips. At various fractional filling factors, the observed flux periodicities agree with the fundamental fractionally charged excitations that correspond to Jain states and depend only on the bulk topological order. To probe the anyonic statistics, we used a small, charged top gate in the interferometer bulk to induce localized quasiparticles without modifying the Aharonov–Bohm phase. The added quasiparticles introduce periodic phase slips. The sign and magnitude of the observed phase slips align with the expected value at filling 1/3, but their direction shows systematic deviations at fillings 2/5 and 3/7. Control over added individual quasiparticles in this design is essential for measuring the coveted non-abelian statistics in the future. An interferometer design allows systematic investigation of the anyonic statistics of bulk fractional quantum Hall states.},

  abstract     = {In condensed matter, angular momentum is intimately related to the emergence of topological quantum states, including chiral superconductivity, quantum spin liquids and various chiral quasiparticles. Recently, it has been predicted that microscopic lattice excitations, known as phonons, can carry finite angular momentum, leading to specific physical properties of materials. However, phonon angular momentum has not yet been observed directly. Here we demonstrate that angular momentum conservation results in a macroscopic mechanical torque when applying a time-reversal symmetry-breaking thermal gradient along the chiral axis of single-crystal tellurium. We probe this torque using a cantilever-based device and establish that it changes sign by flipping the chirality or thermal gradient. This behavior disappears in polycrystalline samples that lack a preferred chirality. Our experimental results align well with theoretical calculations. We provide compelling evidence for phonon angular momentum, which might enable quantum states with potential applications in microelectronics. Theory predicts that phonons—quanta of lattice vibrations—can carry finite angular momentum and thus influence physical properties of materials. Now phonons with angular momentum have been seen in tellurium with a chiral crystal structure.},

  abstract     = {Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene hosts a variety of strongly correlated states at partial fillings of its flat bands. In a magnetic field, these flat bands evolve into a Hofstadter spectrum renormalized by strong Coulomb interactions. Here we study the interacting Hofstadter states that spontaneously form within the topological magnetic sub-bands of an ultraclean magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene device, including symmetry-broken Chern insulator states and fractional quantum Hall states. The observed symmetry-broken Chern insulator states form a cascade, with their Chern numbers mimicking the main sequence of correlated Chern insulators. The fractional quantum Hall states form in a Jain sequence. However, they disappear at high magnetic field, in contrast to conventional fractional quantum Hall states that strengthen with increasing magnetic field. We reveal a magnetic-field-driven phase transition from composite fermion phases to a dissipative Fermi liquid. Our theoretical analysis of the magnetic sub-bands hosting the fractional quantum Hall states predicts non-uniform quantum geometric properties far from the lowest Landau level. This points towards a more natural interpretation of these states as in-field fractional Chern insulators of the magnetic sub-bands. Interacting electrons in Hofstadter bands can form symmetry-broken topological states. These are now revealed in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, and their properties are influenced by non-uniform quantum geometry.},

  abstract     = {Close to the Dirac point, graphene is expected to exist in a quantum critical Dirac fluid state, where the flow of both charge and heat can be described with a characteristic d.c. electrical conductivity and thermodynamic variables such as entropy and enthalpy densities. Although the fluid-like viscous flow of charge has been reported in state-of-the-art graphene devices, the value of conductivity, predicted to be quantized and determined only by the universality class of the critical point, has not been established experimentally so far. Here we have discerned the quantum critical universality in graphene transport by combining the electrical and thermal conductivities in very high-quality devices close to the Dirac point. We find that they are inversely related, as expected from relativistic hydrodynamics, and the characteristic conductivity converges to a quantized value. We also observe a giant violation of the Wiedemann–Franz law, where the Lorentz number exceeds the semiclassical value by more than 200 times close to the Dirac point at low temperatures. At high temperatures, the effective dynamic viscosity to entropy density ratio close to the Dirac point in the cleanest devices approaches that of a minimally viscous quantum fluid within a factor of four. Critical behaviour is expected in graphene when the carrier density is tuned to the Dirac point. Now, universality associated with the critical point is observed in electronic and thermal transport.},
