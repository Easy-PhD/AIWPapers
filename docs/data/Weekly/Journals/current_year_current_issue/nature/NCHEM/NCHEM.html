  abstract     = {Understanding the structural dynamics of ligands and their interaction with catalytic centres under reaction conditions remains a fundamental challenge, yet it is essential for catalyst design. Here we reveal an in situ transformation of Ni–Fe hydroxide into a stable superoxo-hydroxide phase, which is accompanied by the formation of lattice O–O (Olatt–Olatt) ligands, as demonstrated using operando 18O-labelling spectroelectrochemistry and machine-learning-assisted global optimization. By correlating the intrinsic activity of Fe with the Olatt–Olatt concentration across a series of Fe-incorporated transition-metal hydroxides and oxides, we demonstrate that Olatt–Olatt triggers Fe activation for oxygen evolution electrocatalysis—a finding further supported by first-principles calculations. Oxygen production proceeds via an adsorbate evolution mechanism, and the enhanced reaction kinetics stem from the lowered activation energy at surface Fe sites in the newly formed superoxo-hydroxide structure. This work offers a strategic framework for designing high-performance Fe-incorporated electrocatalysts and underscores the pivotal role of ligand dynamics in activating catalytic centres. While the ligand coordination microenvironment surrounding catalytic centres influences reactivity, dynamic oxygen reconstruction during water oxidation electrocatalysis complicates structure-based mechanistic insights. Now the in situ formation of lattice O–O ligands has been shown to activate Fe centres in metal oxides and hydroxides, thereby enhancing their oxygen evolution reaction activity.},

However, the current solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) faces sluggish reaction rates and low yields when incorporating sterically hindered amino acids, owing to the poor kinetics of the two-phase acyl-transfer process from solution to solid. Here we introduce an immobilized ribosome-mimicking molecular reactor to facilitate on-resin proximity-induced intra(inter)-reactor acyl transfers. This strategy bypasses the two-phase acyl-transfer mechanism in conventional SPPS and boosts coupling efficiency in the solid-phase synthesis of N-methylated and/or α,α-disubstituted amino acid(s)-containing sterically hindered peptides, including cyclosporin A and alamethicin F analogues. The ribosome-mimicking molecular reactor SPPS can be integrated into existing SPPS platforms using commercially available resins and reagents, and displays high compatibility with standard synthesizers, enabling the automated synthesis of pharmaceutically important, sterically hindered difficult peptides. Current solid-phase peptide synthesis methods struggle to incorporate sterically hindered amino acids. Now researchers have developed a ribosome-mimicking molecular reactor that bypasses two-phase acyl transfer to boost the coupling efficiency of peptides containing N-methylated and/or α,α-disubstituted amino acids.},

  abstract     = {Among all enzymatic metallocofactors, those found in nitrogenases, the P and L or M clusters, stand out for their intricate structures. They are assembled by proteins of the Nif gene cluster from Fe2S2 rhombs—the smallest building blocks in FeS cluster chemistry—through a sequence of reactions constructing a Fe8S8 precursor. To advance our understanding of how enzymes selectively build such elaborate inorganic molecules, here we parallel the biosynthetic pathway by reporting the rational stepwise assembly of [Fe8S8]m+ (m = 2, 4, 6) clusters from [Fe2S2]2+ rhombs within an extensive cyclic synthetic network. A [Fe8S8]4+ cluster of unique topology is identified, for which we coin the term ‘interlocked’ double cubane. As a molecular analogue of the NifB K cluster, a proposed precursor to both the P and L or M clusters, its preparation and the characterization of all related intermediates, offers fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly of both biogenic and synthetic FeS clusters. Elucidating the nature of the metallocofactors in nitrogenase enzymes, and preparing synthetic analogues of these clusters, is a classic target for bioinorganic chemists. Now the transformation of [Fe2S2]2+ rhombs to [Fe8S8]n+ clusters has been achieved through a series of redox- and ligand-substitution reactions.},

  abstract     = {Azoles are important synthetic targets due to their diverse applications in areas ranging from human health to food security. Accordingly, access to N-functionalized azoles is an essential goal in modern synthetic chemistry. Surprisingly, however, the relied-upon azole N-alkylation strategies fundamentally limit the structural diversity of these important compounds that can be synthesized and studied. Here we introduce an approach to prepare a broad array of important but difficult-to-access N-alkyl azole compounds. We accomplish this through the introduction of a base-catalysed hydroazolation of readily accessible alkenylthianthrenium electrophiles. This strategy circumvents the classical challenge of azole alkylation regiocontrol through an unusual reversible C–N-bond-forming step that exploits the thermodynamic differences between azole N-alkylation isomers. This reaction furnishes a class of versatile azolothianthrenium building blocks that provides a general platform to investigate diverse N-alkyl azole molecules. More broadly, the distinctive approach outlined through this project is poised to impact the design and development of diverse regioselective alkylation reactions. Azoles are important synthetic targets due to their diverse applications in areas ranging from human health to food security. Now it has been shown that the hydroazolation of alkenylthianthrenium salts provides a modular platform to access diverse, densely functionalized N-alkyl azole compounds with high N-regioselectivity.},

  abstract     = {Aggregation of microtubule-associated protein tau into conformationally distinct fibrils underpins neurodegenerative tauopathies. Fluorescent probes (fluoroprobes) such as thioflavin T have been essential tools for studying tau aggregation; however, most of them do not discriminate between amyloid fibril conformations (polymorphs). This gap is due, in part, to a lack of high-throughput methods for screening large, diverse chemical collections. Here we leverage advances in protein-adaptive differential scanning fluorimetry to screen the Aurora collection of 300+ fluoroprobes against multiple synthetic fibril polymorphs, including those formed from tau, α-synuclein and islet amyloid polypeptide. This screen—coupled with excitation-multiplexed bright-emission recording (EMBER) imaging and orthogonal secondary assays—revealed pan-fibril-binding chemotypes, as well as fluoroprobes selective for fibril subsets. One fluoroprobe recognized tau pathology in ex vivo brain slices from Alzheimer’s disease and rodent models. We propose that these scaffolds represent entry points for developing fibril-selective ligands. Amyloid fibrils can adopt a range of distinct conformations, yet it is challenging to rapidly discriminate between these polymorphs. Now methods have been developed to screen large, diverse libraries of turn-on fluorescent dyes to rapidly identify probes that recognize fibril subsets.},

Although commonly utilized as nitrogen nucleophiles, their application as alkyl sources for constructing (sp3)C–C(sp3) bonds remains a notable challenge. Here we present an approach integrating nitrogen-atom deletion into the aza-Michael reaction, thereby redirecting the classical pathway from (sp3)C–N bond formation to (sp3)C–C(sp3) bond construction. Leveraging commercially available O-diphenylphosphinylhydroxylamine as an efficient nitrogen-deletion reagent, this method enables a wide variety of primary aliphatic amines to serve as alkyl sources in couplings with structurally diverse electron-deficient olefins. This Giese-type reaction proceeds under mild conditions, achieves completion within 10 min and exhibits broad functional-group compatibility. By bridging two foundational transformations—the aza-Michael reaction and the Giese-type reaction—this approach interlinks their product spaces through a unified precursor library, substantially enhancing synthetic utility. Primary aliphatic amines are abundant building blocks but underutilized as alkyl sources in C–C bond formation. Now it has been shown that integrating nitrogen-atom deletion into the aza-Michael reaction redirects the classical pathway from (sp3)C–N bond formation to Giese-type (sp3)C–C(sp3) bond construction.},

Here we report two-dimensional vertical ladder polymer cathode materials that feature layered nanosheets with rich intralayer pores and structural defects alongside weak interlayer interactions. This structural design allows lithium ions to migrate vertically across the intrinsic pores and/or defects accompanied by horizontal intercalation, thus establishing a cross-flow pathway for lithium storage. Such an effective ion-transport method enables flash charging of an ultrahigh-power polymer cathode to ~70% state-of-charge within 30 s at a high current density. Even operated at −50 °C, the polymer cathode achieves 3-min charging to ~55% state-of-charge. Furthermore, we propose an organic–inorganic hybrid strategy that overall improves the electrode-level specific energy at high rates for meeting practical metrics. This work demonstrates the potential of organic electrodes for high-power output under extreme operational conditions. Electrochemical energy-storage devices require rapid charge–discharge profiles, but the dense electrode packing required to achieve high energy densities results in sluggish ion-transport kinetics. Now a two-dimensional vertical ladder polymer cathode has been shown to achieve promising performance and tolerance by using a cross-flow lithium migration pathway.},

We use this approach to quantitatively characterize fatty-acyl-dependent transport of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine lipids between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, the nucleus or lysosomes. Further experiments revealed the relative contributions of various biosynthesis pathways to the phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine lipid compositions in the mitochondria, nucleus and lysosomes. Lysosome-specific photocatalytic labelling revealed the impact of the mTOR kinase pathway on lysosomal lipid metabolism. Together, this subcellularly localized photocatalytic labelling of lipids quantitatively deciphers the subcellular lipid composition and transport, enhancing our understanding of lipid metabolism in living organisms.

  abstract     = {Metal–sulfur active sites play a central role in catalytic processes such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, yet the majority of active sites in these compounds reside on the surfaces and edges of catalyst particles, limiting overall efficiency. Here we present a strategy to embed metal–sulfur active sites into metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) by converting bridging or terminal chloride ligands into hydroxide and subsequently into sulfide groups through post-synthetic modification. We apply this method to two representative MOF families: one featuring one-dimensional metal–chloride chains and another containing discrete multinuclear metal clusters. Crystallographic and spectroscopic analyses confirm structural integrity and sulfide incorporation, and the transformation is monitored by in situ total scattering methods. The sulfided MOFs display enhanced catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes using molecular hydrogen. Density functional theory calculations indicate that sulfur incorporation promotes homolytic metal–ligand bond cleavage and facilitates H2 activation. This work establishes an approach to construct MOFs featuring accessible metal–sulfide sites. Metal–sulfur motifs are commonly found in enzymatic active sites and heterogeneous catalysis, but they remain underexplored in porous solids. Now, sulfur-based ligands have been incorporated into metal–organic frameworks through post-synthetic modifications. The resulting sulfide MOFs exhibit enhanced catalytic performance in the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes compared with their parent MOFs containing terminal or bridging chloride and hydroxyl groups.},

  abstract     = {The flexible and modular design of synthetic cells, comprising lipid vesicles capable of imitating the structure and function of living cells, facilitates their application as drug delivery devices. The ability to control the synthesis of biomolecules within synthetic cells using a tissue-penetrating stimulus opens up additional levels of functionality that has the potential to improve biological potency and circumvent drug leakage from preloaded vesicles. To this end, we have designed spherical nucleic acids comprising DNA promoter sequences decorating magnetic nanoparticle cores. These spherical nucleic acids allowed us to harness the heat dissipated from magnetic hyperthermia (a clinically approved anticancer therapy) to regulate cell-free protein synthesis and release cargo on demand. Furthermore, this magnetic regulation of biosynthesis was achieved using clinically tolerable magnetic field strengths and frequencies. We then deployed an opaque blocking material that is impenetrable by current activation methods to highlight the potential of this technology for targeting and controlling the in situ synthesis of biomolecules using tissue-penetrating magnetic fields deep within the body. The programmability of synthetic cells, comprising lipid vesicles that are capable of imitating the structure and function of living cells, facilitates their application as drug delivery devices. Now, magnetic hyperthermia has been used to control the on-demand synthesis and release of biomolecules from within synthetic cells.},

  abstract     = {High-entropy metal-containing nanomaterials have garnered interest in diverse fields such as electrocatalysis and energy conversion. Their synthesis typically requires high temperatures (&gt;1,000 K) to facilitate homogeneous mixing and rapid transformation of metal precursors. However, current state-of-the-art approaches typically involve complex reaction environments and require specialized equipment and operations. Herein we demonstrate a versatile flame synthesis process to fabricate high-entropy metallic single atoms and/or nanoparticles supported on soot-like carbon via blending organometallic precursors into fuel (namely, paraffin wax) and subsequent burning. The high flame temperature (~1,800 K) enables strong metal–carbon association with tailorable chemistry and homogeneous bonding between dissimilar metallic elements (up to 25 metals studied), regardless of their thermodynamic compatibility. Additionally, we show high-performance electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide to highlight this approach as a promising method for electrocatalyst development. High-entropy nanomaterials, which incorporate multiple homogeneously dispersed elements, are promising for energy conversion, but typically require complex, high-temperature synthesis. Now a scalable flame synthesis method has been shown to produce tunable, high-entropy nanomaterials under facile conditions, enabling the design of advanced electrocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide production and other relevant applications.},

  abstract     = {Current methods of processing accumulated polyolefin waste typically require harsh conditions, precious metals or high metal loadings to achieve appreciable activities. Here we examined supported, single-site organonickel catalysts for polyolefin upcycling. Chemisorption of Ni(COD)2 (COD, 1,5-cyclooctadiene) onto Brønsted acidic sulfated alumina (AlS) yields a highly electrophilic Ni(I) precatalyst, AlS/Ni(COD)2, which is converted under H2 to the active AlS/NiIIH catalyst. This single-site system exhibits unique hydrogenolysis selectivity that favours cleaving branched polyolefin C–C linkages, enabling the hydrogenolytic separation of polyethylene and isotactic polypropylene (iPP) mixtures. Moreover, AlS/NiIIH remains highly selective and active for hydrogenolysis of iPP admixed with polyvinyl chloride, and the spent catalyst can be repeatedly regenerated by AlEt3 treatment. Experimental mechanistic analysis and density functional theory modelling reveal a turnover-limiting C–C scission pathway featuring β-alkyl transfer and strong olefin binding. These results highlight the potential of nickel-based systems for the selective upcycling of complex plastic waste streams. Selective chemical upcycling of polyolefin mixtures remains challenging due to the structural similarity of their backbones. Now it has been shown that a single-site nickel catalyst can preferentially and efficiently cleave branched C–C bonds, enabling the hydrogenolytic separation of isotactic polypropylene from mixtures containing both isotactic polypropylene and polyethylene.},

  abstract     = {The growing demand for fluorochemicals has increased the production of toxic hydrogen fluoride (HF)—a widely used fluorination agent—from mineral fluorspar (CaF2). Although potassium fluoride (KF) is a safer alternative fluorination agent, its production still involves HF as an intermediate. Simultaneously, the disposal of fluoropolymer waste, especially polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), poses environmental challenges. We present a mechanochemical protocol that decomposes PVDF to generate KF as a nucleophilic fluorinating agent. As an advantage over traditional batch reactions, mechanochemical protocols can be performed quickly, and with or without modest volumes of solvents. We show that KF produced using this method can be used to efficiently construct S–F, C(sp2)–F and C(sp3)–F bonds, providing a sustainable solution to fluorine resource depletion and hazardous HF usage. Our approach also addresses fluoropolymer waste disposal and reduces reliance on natural fluorspar resources, marking a notable advancement in fluorine chemistry and paving the way for safer and eco-friendly fluorination techniques. The production of fluorination agents generally involves the formation of toxic hydrogen fluoride. Now, a mechanochemical protocol to decompose the fluoropolymer polyvinylidene fluoride has been developed, generating potassium fluoride as a fluorinating agent. This approach provides a safer and sustainable fluorination strategy for efficient S–F, C(sp2)–F and C(sp3)–F bond formation.},

  abstract     = {Catalytic hydrogenation is essential in synthetic chemistry, with ongoing innovations aimed at enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of these reactions. The hydrogenation of multisubstituted allenes, however, presents a long-standing challenge due to the difficulty of controlling multiple selectivity factors simultaneously. Here we introduce a series of chiral pincer cobalt catalysts featuring multiple metal–ligand cooperative functionalities. These catalysts feature an ‘N–H’ moiety as an outer-sphere binding site and an N-heterocycle group as a hemilabile basic site, enabling the use of structurally diverse tridentate ligands for selective hydrogenation of functionalized allenes. This design liberates a coordination site for H2 activation and enhances selectivity control through the structural tuning of the N-heterocycle group. The catalysts exhibit exceptional chemo-, regio-, enantio- and Z/E-selectivities, along with broad functional group tolerance, enabling access to all possible semihydrogenation products of multisubstituted allenes. Mechanistic studies uncover a distinctive redox-neutral Co(I) catalytic cycle that facilitates heterolytic cleavage of H2, assisted by the basic N-heterocycle on the ligand. The hydrogenation of multisubstituted allenes presents a long-standing challenge due to the difficulty in simultaneously controlling multiple selectivity parameters. Now a class of pincer cobalt catalysts featuring multiple metal–ligand cooperation functionalities has been developed that enables the regio- and stereodivergent hydrogenation of allenes to provide all possible multisubstituted alkene products.},

  abstract     = {The structural dynamics of biopolymers, such as proteins and DNA, feature the unique combination of simultaneous conformational adaptivity and configurational reversibility. However, it remains challenging to design a synthetic system featuring dynamic covalent bonds with secondary structural folding and full recycling capabilities. Here we present a synthetic covalent polymer, constructed from biologically relevant units (amino acids and disulfides), that can reversibly adapt between disordered and helical conformations and can recycle itself to the original small molecules. This dual dynamic feature arises from the subtle synergy of noncovalent bonds (H bonds) and dynamic covalent bonds within a coupled chemical equilibrium, of which thermodynamics is found to follow a nonlinear van’t Hoff equation with nonzero heat capacity change. The covalent polymers show conformational dynamics between structured helices and disordered coils and the ability to convert back to the original monomers. This system demonstrates how dual dynamic function can control helical and recyclable polymer formation. Covalent polymers with helical conformations offer an adaptive scaffold for smart materials, but polymer-to-monomer deconstruction is inhibited by the covalent backbone. Now it has been shown that poly(disulfide)s can be folded into helices driven by side-chain hydrogen-bonding self-assembly, resulting in a synthetic helical polymer that can be fully recycled.},

Real-time observation of chemical bonding at the single-molecule level offers insights into transient intermediates that are normally inaccessible via ensemble measurements. Protein nanopores, with their unique geometries, can be tailored into nanoreactors. Molecular bond-making and -cleavage at the reactive site of a protein nanopore’s interior wall can be visualized by monitoring ionic current changes. Therefore, nanopore-based techniques can enhance the understanding of complex binding kinetics and reaction mechanisms. In this Review we summarize recent advances in using biological nanopores as both single-molecule nanoreactors and single-molecule biosensors. The discussion covers the kinetics of single-molecule reactions under nanopore confinement, the strategies for designing biological nanopores and the latest progress in revealing reaction intermediates and pathways at the single-molecule level. Finally, we emphasize unresolved challenges and anticipate future developments in this rapidly evolving field. Real-time single-molecule observation provides insights into transient intermediates that are normally inaccessible using ensemble measurements.
