Here we design and synthesize 72 BBB-crossing lipids fabricated by conjugating BBB-crossing modules and amino lipids, and use them to assemble BBB-crossing lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery. Screening and structure optimization studies resulted in a lead formulation that has substantially higher mRNA delivery efficiency into the brain than those exhibited by FDA-approved lipid nanoparticles. Studies in distinct mouse models show that these BBB-crossing lipid nanoparticles can transfect neurons and astrocytes of the whole brain after intravenous injections, being well tolerated across several dosage regimens. Moreover, these nanoparticles can deliver mRNA to human brain ex vivo samples. Overall, these BBB-crossing lipid nanoparticles deliver mRNA to neurons and astrocytes in broad brain regions, thereby being a promising platform to treat a range of central nervous system diseases. A lipid-nanoparticle-based formulation incorporating engineered lipids containing a blood–brain-barrier-crossing moiety effectively delivers mRNA to neurons and astrocytes following systemic administration in mice.},

Here we describe a modular approach to protein nanomaterial design inspired by the rich chemical diversity that can be generated from the small number of atomic valencies. We design protein building blocks using deep learning-based generative tools, incorporating regular coordination geometries and tailorable bonding interactions that enable the assembly of diverse closed and open architectures guided by simple geometric principles. Experimental characterization confirms the successful formation of more than 20 multicomponent polyhedral protein cages, two-dimensional arrays and three-dimensional protein lattices, with a high (10%–50%) success rate and electron microscopy data closely matching the corresponding design models. Due to modularity, individual building blocks can assemble with different partners to generate distinct regular assemblies, resulting in an economy of parts and enabling the construction of reconfigurable networks for designer nanomaterials. Deep learning-based generative tools are used to design protein building blocks with well-defined directional bonding interactions, allowing the generation of a variety of scalable protein assemblies from a small set of reusable subunits.},

However, nearly all nanoparticles designed so far exhibit strict point group symmetry, which limits structural diversity and precludes anisotropic functionalization. Here we describe a computational strategy for designing multicomponent bifaceted protein nanomaterials with two distinctly addressable sides. The method centres on docking pseudosymmetric hetero-oligomeric building blocks in architectures with dihedral symmetry and designing an asymmetric protein–protein interface between them. We obtain an initial 30-subunit assembly with pseudo-D5 symmetry and generate variants in which we alter the size and morphology of the bifaceted nanoparticles by designing extensions to one of the subunits. Functionalization of the two nanoparticle faces with protein minibinders enables the specific colocalization of two populations of polystyrene microparticles coated with the target protein receptors. The ability to accurately design anisotropic protein nanoparticles could be broadly useful in applications requiring the colocalization of distinct target moieties. Predictive protein design and experiments are combined to develop anisotropic bifaceted protein nanomaterials using pseudosymmetric hetero-oligomeric building blocks.},

  abstract     = {The cathode interfacial layer (CIL) critically influences electron extraction and charge recombination, thereby playing a pivotal role in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, most state-of-the-art CILs are constrained by limited conductivity, high recombination and poor morphology, which collectively hinder device efficiency and stability. Here we report an inorganic–organic hybrid CIL (AZnO-F3N), developed by a dual-component synergy strategy, which integrates organic material PNDIT-F3N with two-dimensional amorphous zinc oxide. This design leverages the synergistic interactions between two-dimensional amorphous zinc oxide and PNDIT-F3N, resulting in reduced interfacial defect, enhanced conductivity and improved film uniformity. OSCs incorporating the AZnO-F3N CIL exhibit more efficient charge extraction and transport, along with reduced recombination. Consequently, a D18:L8-BO-based binary OSC achieves an efficiency of 20.6%. The introduction of BTP-eC9 as the third component further elevates the efficiency to 21.0% (certified as 20.8%). Moreover, the CIL demonstrates versatility across various active layers, thick-film configuration and flexible devices, underscoring its great potential to advance OSC technology. A hybrid cathode interfacial layer (AZnO-F3N) is developed, delivering 21.0% efficiency along with excellent stability, mechanical robustness and broad versatility, highlighting its potential to advance organic solar cells.},

Despite important advances in macroscopic frames, the realization and phonon imaging of nanoscale mechanical metamaterials has remained challenging. Here we extend the principle of topologically engineered mechanical frames to self-assembled nanoparticle lattices, resolving phonon dynamics using liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. The vibrations of nanoparticles in Maxwell lattices are used to measure properties that have been difficult to obtain, such as phonon band structures, nanoscale spring constants and nonlinear lattice deformation paths. Studies of five different lattices reveal that these properties are modulated by nanoscale colloidal interactions. Our discrete mechanical model and simulations capture these interactions and the critical role of effects beyond nearest neighbours, bridging mechanical metamaterials with nanoparticle self-assembly. Our study provides opportunities for understanding and manufacturing self-assembled nanostructures for phonon manipulation, offering solution processability, transformability and emergent functions at underexplored scales of length, frequency and energy density. The realization and phonon imaging of nanoscale mechanical metamaterials has remained challenging.

However, previous studies have predominantly focused on crystal cathodes comprising the octahedral coordination of metal atoms and a well-ordered layered topology. This omits other cathode materials with other structures or coordination that could potentially surpass conventional counterparts in terms of performance. Here, using X-ray diffraction, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering and X-ray absorption near-edge spectra experiments, we investigated an amorphous Li–V–O–F cathode (a-LVOF) with tetrahedral coordination and elucidated an O–O formal redox mechanism at a moderate voltage of 4.1 V, without a conventional octahedral Li–O–Li configuration. The electrochemically amorphized material fosters randomly distributed VO4 units and scattered dangling oxygen bonds, which facilitated O–O binding. Moreover, a-LVOF demonstrates a high capacity of 230 mAh g−1. Our findings reveal a low-voltage O–O formal redox mechanism in an amorphized cathode material. Cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries typically possess octahedral coordination, which may exclude other possible solutions to degradation during deep cycling. A series of tetrahedral-framework-based amorphous Li–V–O–F materials are investigated, and shown to demonstrate O–O formal redox at 4.1 V.},

Here we report the signatures of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) embedded in hexagonal boron nitride. Hexagonal boron nitride provides crucial edge stabilization, enabling the direct probing of this intrinsic magnetism. Scanning nitrogen-vacancy-centre microscopy initially confirmed magnetism in zGNR. Subsequently, an ~9-nm-wide zGNR transistor was fabricated with a sub-50-nm channel length. Magnetotransport measurements at 4 K revealed distinct Fabry–Pérot-like interference patterns, indicating coherent transport. A large, anisotropic magnetoresistance (~175 Ω, ~1.3%) was observed, persisting well above room temperature. These findings strongly corroborate the existence of robust magnetic ordering in the zGNR edge state. This hexagonal-boron-nitride-embedded zGNR system offers an effective platform for future graphene-based spintronic devices.

Advancing the design and control of non-equilibrium phases requires the development of targeted strategies to achieve long-lived, metastable phases. Here we report the discovery of symmetry-protected electronic metastability in the model cuprate ladder Sr14Cu24O41. Using femtosecond resonant X-ray scattering and spectroscopy, we show that this metastability is driven by a transfer of holes from chain-like charge reservoirs into the ladders. This ultrafast charge redistribution arises from the optical dressing and activation of a hopping pathway that is forbidden by symmetry at equilibrium. Relaxation back to the ground state is, hence, suppressed after the pump coherence dissipates. Our findings highlight how dressing materials with electromagnetic fields can dynamically activate terms in the electronic Hamiltonian, and provide a rational design strategy for non-equilibrium phases of matter. A long-lived photoinduced metastable state in a quasi-one-dimensional cuprate, Sr14Cu24O41, is reported.},

  abstract     = {In polycyclic heteroaromatic (PHA) emitters, which possess great potential for application in ultrahigh-definition displays, the origin of a small singlet–triplet energy gap (ΔES1T1) and its relationship with the molecular structure still remain poorly established. Here we derive an effective expression for ΔES1T1, in which ΔES1T1 positively depends on 2KHL (where KHL is the exchange energy between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)) and on the energy gap between LUMO and LUMO + 1 (ΔELUMO–LUMO+1). This expression for ΔES1T1 is validated over a series of 100 reported PHA emitters. It allows us to easily identify various molecular design approaches for managing ΔES1T1 by synergistically regulating 2KHL and ΔELUMO–LUMO+1. The proof-of-concept PHA molecules were synthesized and characterized to further confirm the validity of this expression for ΔES1T1. Overall, our work provides a physical picture to not only modulate ΔES1T1 in emerging PHA emitters but also design and screen such materials with small ΔES1T1. Insight into the singlet–triplet energy gap and molecular structure relationship in polycyclic heteroaromatic molecules enables organic light-emitting diodes based on multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence, with improved efficiency and roll-off.},

  abstract     = {Hyperbolic polaritons facilitate nanoscale light manipulation, but strong field confinement limits their transmission across interfaces. Conversely, leaky waves can convert radiation from confined sources towards the far field. Here we combine hyperbolic polaritons and leaky wave radiation to demonstrate flatland leaky polaritonic wakes. We employ a mixed-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure consisting of a nanoscale waveguide strip on a van der Waals film. The waveguide mode, confined inside the hyperbolic light cone of the background film, enables efficient directional in-plane emission of fast phonon polaritons. The constructive interference of these leaky polaritons generates highly directional polaritonic wakes. Their spatial symmetry can be tailored through the orientation of the heterostructure with respect to the hyperbolic film dispersion. Leveraging van der Waals stacking, we also demonstrate effective acceleration and deceleration of polaritonic wakes by locally tailoring the leaky nano-waveguide dispersion through gradient thickness design. Our findings demonstrate that polaritonic wakes hold promise for integrated nanophotonic circuits. The authors combine the strong confinement of hyperbolic polaritons with leaky nano-waveguides to demonstrate directional in-plane emission of fast phonon polaritons and their acceleration and deceleration by tailoring waveguide dispersion.},

  abstract     = {Material fractures are typically irreversible, marking a one-time event leading to failure. Great efforts have been made to enhance both strength and fracture toughness of bulk materials for engineering applications, such as by introducing self-recovery and secondary breaking behaviours. In low-dimensional structures, two-dimensional materials often exhibit exceptional strength but accompanied by extreme brittleness. Here we discover that the toughness of two-dimensional materials can be enhanced without sacrificing strength—by simply twisting the layers. Through in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, supported by nanoindentation and theoretical analysis, we reveal that twisted bilayer structures enable sequential fracture events: initial cracks heal to form stable grain boundaries, which then shield subsequent fracture tips from stress concentration. This process consumes additional energy compared with conventional fracture, with toughness enhancement tunable through twist angle adjustment. The intrinsic toughening mechanism via twisting, along with the emerging electronic properties of twistronics that are currently attracting substantial attention, presents an exciting opportunity for future devices. Intrinsic toughening in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides can be achieved simply by twisting the layers. This twisting promotes cross-layer healing and grain boundary formation, which shield fracture tips from stress concentration.},

While monolayer 2D materials exhibit impressive fracture resistance, as demonstrated in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), preserving these remarkable properties in vdW materials remains a challenge. Here we reveal an anomalous mechanical interlayer coupling that involves interlayer-friction toughening and edge-reconstruction embrittlement during the fracture of multilayer h-BN. Both asynchronous and synchronous fracture modes and their flaw-size dependence are identified. Edge reconstruction in the synchronous fracture mode can eliminate a toughening mechanism induced by lattice asymmetry in monolayer h-BN, leading to embrittlement of the multilayer h-BN, while the asynchronous fracture mode results in greater fracture resistance. Such findings will provide fundamental guidelines for engineering interlayer interactions in vdW materials including heterostructures and layered architectures for better mechanical and functional performances. Fracture behaviours in multilayer h-BN, involving interlayer-friction toughening and edge-reconstruction embrittlement, are identified through in situ experiments and theoretical analyses.},

  abstract     = {Cold-forming processing is a crucial means for the cost-effective production of metal and alloy products. However, this process often results in catastrophic fracture when applied to most inorganic semiconductors owing to their inherent brittleness. Here we report the unique room-temperature plastic deformation mechanism involving sublattice amorphization coupled with Ag-ion diffusion in inorganic semiconductors Ag2Te1–xSx (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.6), and an ultrahigh extensibility of up to 10,150%. Once subject to external stress, the crystalline Te/S sublattice undergoes a uniform transformation into an amorphous state, whereas the Ag cations continuously bond with Te/S anions, endowing bulk Ag2Te1–xSx with exceptional plastic deformability. Remarkably, even slight polishing can induce sublattice amorphization in the surface layers. Furthermore, this sublattice amorphization can be reversed to crystals through simple annealing, enlightening the iterative sublattice amorphization strategy, with which metal-like wire drawing, curving, forging and ultrahigh ductility have been obtained in bulk Ag2Te1–xSx at room temperature. These results highlight sublattice amorphization as a critical plastic deformation mechanism in silver chalcogenide inorganic semiconductors, which will facilitate their applications in flexible electronics and drive further exploration of more plastic inorganic semiconductors. Sublattice amorphization is revealed as the deformation mechanism of Ag2Te1–xSx (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.6), based on which an iterative crystalline–amorphous transition strategy is proposed to enable these bulk inorganic semiconductors with metal-like processability.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductors are the core of modern electronics1. Because of their brittleness, semiconductors are usually processed by the complicated techniques of sputtering or deposition2–4, instead of the effective and versatile metalworking methods like rolling, extrusion and pressing used with metals5. Here we show that brittle semiconductors can be plastically manufactured with an extensibility as large as ~3,000% using warm metalworking, that is, plastic manufacturing at slightly elevated temperatures (empirically below 500 K). Many bulk brittle semiconductors, such as Cu2Se, Ag2Se and Bi90Sb10, can be processed like metals below 400–500 K into free-standing, large and high-quality films with a thickness from the macro-scale to the micrometre scale. A model based on temperature-dependent collective atomic displacement and thermal vibration is proposed to explain the superior plasticity. The warm-metalworked films can retain the excellent and tunable physical properties of the bulk versions, such as a high carrier mobility up to ~5,000 cm2 V−1 s−1 and tunable electrical conductivities over six orders of magnitude by adjusting the chemical composition. A case study in film thermoelectric devices demonstrates ultra-high normalized output power densities of 43–54 μW cm−2 K−2. This work suggests that brittle semiconductors can be manufactured by warm metalworking for applications in various electronics. The authors show that bulk brittle semiconductors can be plastically manufactured like metals by warm metalworking into free-standing, metre-scale films with decent physical properties.},

  abstract     = {Despite 10% of the Earth’s surface being covered by ice, ice power remains untapped. Although ice is known to generate electricity upon bending via flexoelectricity1, the generated electric polarization per curvature, that is, the flexoelectric coefficient, is too small (~1–10 nC m−1) to be utilized for electromechanical devices. Here we demonstrate that doping ice with NaCl can enhance its flexoelectric coefficient 1,000-fold, to ~1–10 μC m−1. We find that this enhancement is due to the bending-induced streaming current along ice grain boundaries. On the basis of this mechanism, we fabricated flexural devices with an effective piezoelectric coefficient of ~4,000 pC N−1, which is comparable to that of the best piezoelectric materials. The high flexoelectricity of saline ice brings the vision of harnessing ice power one step closer to reality, and may also be relevant to the electrical activity of ice-covered terrestrial regions and icy ocean worlds such as Europa or Enceladus. In addition, the model for coupling between strain gradients and streaming currents is not limited to ice and provides a general framework for extracting electromechanical activity from liquid-infused porous solids. By doping ice with NaCl, it is shown that a flexoelectric coefficient of up to 10 μC m−1 is generated, enabling effective piezoelectric coefficients that are comparable to those of ceramics. This arises from the streaming current of quasi-liquid flow through grain boundaries from one side of the sample to the other.},

We cover how sustainable software and computational methods have accelerated materials design while becoming more open source and collaborative in nature. Next, we present cases where the Materials Project was used to understand and discover functional materials. We then describe our efforts to meet the needs of an expanding user base, through technical infrastructure updates ranging from data architecture and cloud resources to interactive web applications. Finally, we discuss opportunities to better aid the research community, with the vision that more accessible and easy-to-understand materials data will result in democratized materials knowledge and an increasingly collaborative community. Materials design and informatics have become increasingly prominent over the past several decades. Using the Materials Project as an example, this Perspective discusses how properties are calculated and curated, how this knowledge can be used for materials discovery, and the challenges in modelling complex material systems or managing software architecture.},
