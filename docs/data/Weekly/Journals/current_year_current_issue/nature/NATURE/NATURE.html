  abstract     = {Action potentials are generated by opening of voltage-activated sodium (Nav) and potassium (Kv) channels1, which can rapidly inactivate to shape the nerve impulse and contribute to synaptic facilitation and short-term memory1–4. The mechanism of fast inactivation was proposed to involve an intracellular domain that blocks the internal pore in both Nav5,6 and Kv7–9 channels; however, recent studies in Nav10,11 and Kv12,13 channels support a mechanism in which the internal pore closes during inactivation. Here we investigate the mechanism of fast inactivation in the Shaker Kv channel using cryo-electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and electrophysiology. We resolved structures of a fully inactivated state in which the non-polar end of the N terminus plugs the internal pore in an extended conformation. The N-terminal methionine is deleted, leaving an alanine that is acetylated and interacts with a pore-lining isoleucine residue where RNA editing regulates fast inactivation14. Opening of the internal activation gate is required for fast inactivation because it enables the plug domain to block the pore and repositions gate residues to interact with and stabilize that domain. We also show that external K+ destabilizes the inactivated state by altering the conformation of the ion selectivity filter rather than by electrostatic repulsion. These findings establish the mechanism of fast inactivation in Kv channels, revealing how it is regulated by RNA editing and N-terminal acetylation, and providing a framework for understanding related mechanisms in other voltage-activated channels. This paper explores how voltage-gated potassium channels can plug the pore to prevent the conductance of ions during inactivation.},

  abstract     = {The&nbsp;poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) class of drugs&nbsp;represents a remarkable advance in the treatment of patients with homologous recombination-deficient tumours, but resistance remains a challenge1–5. Although most research has focused on the downstream consequences of PARPi exposure to tackle resistance, the immediate effect of PARP inhibition on the chromatin environment and its contribution to PARPi toxicity remains elusive. Here we show that PARP inhibition induces histone release from the chromatin. This presents a vulnerability of PARPi-resistant cancer cells, which require histone homeostasis mechanisms to sustain elevated DNA replication rates and survival. Through functional genetic screens, we identified NASP as a key factor in maintaining the stability of evicted histones via its TPR motifs. Loss of NASP renders tumour cells hypersensitive to PARPi treatment in vitro and in vivo, impairs replication fork progression and elevates levels of replication-associated DNA damage. Moreover, NASP acts together with the INO80 complex and the chaperoning activity of PARP1 to ensure efficient histone turnover and prevent the accumulation of lethal DNA damage. Collectively, our work reports on histone eviction as an immediate cellular response to PARPi treatment and provides a promising avenue for targeting histone supply pathways to overcome PARPi resistance. PARP inhibitor treatment triggers&nbsp;histone release from the chromatin in cancer cells; consequently, targeting the histone chaperone NASP renders cells vulnerable to PARP inhibition.},

  abstract     = {Unravelling how genomes are spatially organized and how their three-dimensional (3D) architecture drives cellular functions remains a major challenge in biology1,2. In bacteria, genomic DNA is compacted into a highly ordered, condensed state called nucleoid3–5. Despite progress in characterizing bacterial 3D genome architecture over recent decades6–8, the fine structure and functional organization of the nucleoid remain elusive due to low-resolution contact maps from methods such as Hi-C9–11. Here we developed an enhanced Micro-C chromosome conformation capture, achieving 10-base&nbsp;pair (bp) resolution. This ultra-high-resolution analysis reveals elemental spatial structures in the Escherichia coli nucleoid, including chromosomal hairpins (CHINs) and chromosomal hairpin domains (CHIDs). These structures, organized by histone-like proteins H-NS and StpA, have key roles in repressing horizontally transferred genes. Disruption of H-NS causes drastic reorganization of the 3D genome, decreasing CHINs and CHIDs, whereas removing both H-NS and StpA results in their complete disassembly, increased transcription of horizontally transferred genes and delayed growth. Similar effects are observed with netropsin, which competes with H-NS and StpA for AT-rich DNA binding. Interactions between CHINs further organize the genome into isolated loops, potentially insulating active operons. Our Micro-C analysis reveals that all actively transcribed genes form distinct operon-sized chromosomal interaction domains (OPCIDs) in a transcription-dependent manner. These structures appear as square patterns on Micro-C maps, reflecting continuous contacts throughout transcribed regions. This work unveils the fundamental structural elements of the E. coli nucleoid, highlighting their connection to nucleoid-associated proteins and transcription machinery. An ultra-high-resolution chromatin organization map of E. coli, using Micro-C, reveals intricate chromatin structures involved in the silencing of horizontally transferred genes and those associated with active operons.},

Here, using spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigate the role of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) in high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Mechanistically, NNMT-induced H3K27me3 hypomethylation drives complement secretion from CAFs, attracting immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to the tumour. Nnmt knockout in immunocompetent mice impairs tumour growth in syngeneic ovarian, breast and colon tumour models through enhanced CD8+ T cell activation. Using high-throughput screening, we develop a potent and specific NNMT inhibitor that reduces the tumour burden and metastasis in multiple mouse cancer models and restores immune checkpoint blockade efficacy by decreasing CAF-mediated recruitment of MDSCs and reinvigorating CD8+ T cell activation. Our findings establish NNMT as a central CAF regulator and a promising therapeutic target to mitigate immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment.

  abstract     = {T cells respond to cytokines through receptor dimers that have been selected over the course of evolution to activate canonical JAK–STAT signalling and gene expression programs1. However, the potential combinatorial diversity of JAK–STAT receptor pairings can be expanded by exploring the untapped biology of alternative non-natural pairings. Here we exploited the common γ chain (γc) receptor as a shared signalling hub on T cells and enforced the expression of both natural and non-natural heterodimeric JAK–STAT receptor pairings using an orthogonal cytokine receptor platform2–4 to expand the γc signalling code. We tested receptors from γc cytokines as well as interferon, IL-10 and homodimeric receptor families that do not normally pair with γc or are not naturally expressed on T cells. These receptors simulated their natural counterparts but also induced contextually unique transcriptional programs. This led to distinct T cell fates in tumours, including myeloid-like T cells with phagocytic capacity driven by orthogonal GSCFR (oGCSFR), and type 2 cytotoxic T&nbsp;(TC2) and helper T (TH2) cell differentiation driven by orthogonal IL-4R (o4R). T cells with orthogonal IL-22R (o22R) and oGCSFR, neither of which are natively expressed on T cells, exhibited stem-like and exhaustion-resistant transcriptional and chromatin landscapes, enhancing anti-tumour properties. Non-native receptor pairings and their resultant JAK–STAT signals open a path to diversifying T cell states beyond those induced by natural cytokines. Orthogonal chimeric receptors containing intracellular domains for IL-4R, IL-20R, IL-22R and GCSFR reprogram T cells to promote distinct natural and synthetic cell states with functional and therapeutic implications.},

  abstract     = {Cardiolipin (CL) is the signature phospholipid of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it stabilizes electron transport chain protein complexes1. The final step in CL biosynthesis relates to its remodelling: the exchange of nascent acyl chains with longer, unsaturated chains1. However, the enzyme responsible for cleaving nascent CL&nbsp;(nCL) has remained elusive. Here, we describe ABHD18 as a candidate deacylase in the CL biosynthesis pathway. Accordingly, ABHD18 converts CL into monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) in vitro, and its inactivation in cells and mice results in a shift to nCL in serum and tissues. Notably, ABHD18 deactivation rescues the mitochondrial defects in cells and the morbidity and mortality in mice associated with Barth syndrome. This rare genetic disease is characterized by the build-up of MLCL resulting from inactivating mutations in TAFAZZIN (TAZ), which encodes the final enzyme in the CL-remodelling cascade1. We also identified a selective, covalent, small-molecule inhibitor of ABHD18 that rescues TAZ mutant phenotypes in fibroblasts from human&nbsp;patients&nbsp;and in&nbsp;fish embryos. This study highlights a striking example of genetic suppression of a monogenic disease revealing a canonical enzyme in the CL biosynthesis pathway.

  abstract     = {Despite advances in HIV-1 prophylaxis, vertical transmission remains a pressing problem in developing countries1. Given the promise of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) for HIV-1 prevention2, we hypothesized that neonatal delivery of bNAbs using adeno-associated virus (AAV) could provide durable HIV-1 immunity during infancy. Here, using infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) as a model, we show that a one-time administration of an AAV vector encoding bNAb 3BNC117 at birth led to sustained bNAb expression for more than three years without redosing. This approach significantly protected both infant and pre-adolescent rhesus macaques from infection with simian–human immunodeficiency virus in mucosal challenge models that mimic HIV-1 transmission through breastfeeding and sexual intercourse. Age at the time of AAV-3BNC117 administration was a main determinant of success and was inversely correlated with the incidence of host anti-drug antibodies that restricted bNAb expression. Consistent with principles of neonatal tolerance3,4, newborn rhesus macaques exhibited higher levels of bNAb expression than older infants and juveniles following AAV-3BNC117 dosing. Furthermore, in utero exposure to recombinant 3BNC117 suppressed anti-drug antibodies and improved AAV-vectored delivery of this bNAb in older infants. Thus, our results suggest that neonatal and fetal immunological tolerance can be leveraged to improve postnatal AAV delivery of HIV-1 bNAbs in primates. Since years-long HIV-1 immunity can be generated in rhesus macaques from a one-time AAV vector administration at birth, future studies should evaluate the ability of this strategy to prevent perinatal and adolescent HIV-1 infections in humans. A single dose of an adeno-associated virus vector encoding an HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody given shortly after birth results in persistent antibody expression and protection from infection in rhesus macaque models of human HIV-1 transmission through breastfeeding and sexual intercourse.},

  abstract     = {Acute tubular necrosis mediates acute kidney injury (AKI) and nephron loss1, the hallmark of end-stage renal disease2–4. For decades, it has been known that female kidneys are less sensitive to AKI5,6. Acute tubular necrosis involves dynamic cell death propagation by ferroptosis along the tubular compartment7,8. Here we demonstrate abrogated ferroptotic cell death propagation in female kidney tubules. 17β-oestradiol establishes an anti-ferroptotic state through non-genomic and genomic mechanisms. These include the potent direct inhibition of ferroptosis by hydroxyoestradiol derivatives, which function as radical trapping antioxidants, are present at high concentrations in kidney tubules and, when exogenously applied, protect male mice from AKI. In cells, the oxidized hydroxyoestradiols are recycled by FSP19,10, but FSP1-deficient female mice were not sensitive to AKI. At the genomic level, female ESR1-deficient kidney tubules partially lose their anti-ferroptotic capacity, similar to ovariectomized mice. While ESR1 promotes the anti-ferroptotic hydropersulfide system, male tubules express pro-ferroptotic proteins of the ether lipid pathway which are suppressed by ESR1 in female tissues until menopause. In summary, we identified non-genomic and genomic mechanisms that collectively explain ferroptosis resistance in female tubules and may function as therapeutic targets for male and postmenopausal female individuals. 17β-oestradiol establishes an anti-ferroptotic state in female kidney tubules.},

  abstract     = {Enteric pathogens engage in complex interactions with the host and the resident microbiota to establish gut colonization1–3. Although mechanistic interactions between enteric pathogens and bacterial commensals have been extensively studied, whether and how commensal fungi affect enteric infections remain largely unknown1. Here we show that colonization with the common human gut commensal fungus Candida albicans worsened infections with the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. The presence of C. albicans in the mouse gut increased Salmonella caecal colonization and systemic dissemination. We investigated the underlying mechanism and found that Salmonella binds to C. albicans via type 1 fimbriae and uses its type 3 secretion system to deliver effector proteins into C. albicans. A specific effector, SopB, was sufficient to manipulate C. albicans metabolism and trigger the release of millimolar amounts of arginine into the extracellular environment. The released arginine, in turn, induced expression of the type 3 secretion system in Salmonella, increasing its invasion of epithelial cells. C. albicans deficient in arginine production was unable to increase Salmonella virulence. Arginine-producing C. albicans also dampened the inflammatory response during Salmonella infection. Arginine supplementation in the absence of C. albicans increased the systemic spread of Salmonella and decreased the inflammatory response, phenocopying the presence of C. albicans. In summary, we identified C. albicans colonization as a susceptibility factor for disseminated Salmonella infection and arginine as a central metabolite in the cross-kingdom interaction between fungi, bacteria and host. Commensal Candida albicans enhances the virulence and dissemination of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium.},

  abstract     = {Social interaction can be regarded as a dynamic feedback loop between interacting individuals as they act and react to each other1,2. Here, to understand the neural basis of these interactions, we investigated inter-brain neural dynamics across individuals in both mice and artificial intelligence systems. By measuring activities of molecularly defined neurons in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of socially interacting mice, we find that the multi-dimensional neural space within each individual can be partitioned into two distinct subspaces—a shared neural subspace that represents shared neural dynamics across animals and a unique neural subspace that represents activity unique to each animal. Notably, compared with glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) neurons in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex contain a considerably larger shared neural subspace, which arises from behaviours of both self and others. We extended this framework to artificial intelligence agents and observed that, as social interactions emerged, so too did shared neural dynamics between interacting agents. Importantly, selectively disrupting the neural components that contribute to shared neural dynamics substantially reduces the agents’ social actions. Our findings suggest that shared neural dynamics represent a fundamental and generalizable feature of interacting neural systems present in both biological and artificial agents and highlight the functional significance of shared neural dynamics in driving social interactions. Shared inter-brain neural dynamics, reflecting aspects of social interaction including self and other’s behaviours, arise in GABAergic neurons of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of socially interacting mice, as well as in the neurons of socially interacting artificial intelligence agents.},

  abstract     = {Across mammalian species, new mothers undergo behavioural changes to nurture their offspring and meet the caloric demands of milk production1–5. Although many neural circuits underlying feeding and parenting behaviours are well characterized6–9, it is unclear how these different circuits interact and adapt during lactation. Here we performed transcriptomic profiling of the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the mouse hypothalamus in response&nbsp;to lactation and hunger. Furthermore, we showed that heightened appetite in lactating mice was accompanied by increased activity of hunger-promoting agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the ARC (ARCAgRP neurons). To assess the strength of hunger versus maternal drives, we designed a conflict assay in which female mice chose between a food source or pups and nesting material. Although food-deprived lactating mothers prioritized parenting over feeding, hunger reduced the duration and disrupted the sequences of parenting behaviours in both lactating and virgin females. We found that ARCAgRP neurons inhibit bombesin receptor subtype&nbsp;3 (BRS3) neurons in the MPOA (MPOABRS3 neurons), which become more active postpartum and govern parenting and satiety. Activation of this ARCAgRP-to-MPOABRS3 circuit shifted behaviours from parenting to food-seeking. Thus, hypothalamic networks are modulated by physiological states and work antagonistically during the prioritization of competing motivated behaviours. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of mouse hypothalamus and behavioural experiments show that specific hypothalamic networks regulate conflicting feeding versus parenting behaviours of female mice.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive functions for navigation and memory rely on emergent properties of neural ensembles in the hippocampus, such as activity replay1–5 and theta sequences6–9. However, whether and how these phenomena generalize across species with distinct navigational demands and neurophysiological properties remains unclear. Here we wirelessly recorded neural activity from large populations of cells and local field potentials from the hippocampus of freely flying Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) engaged in free, spontaneous foraging behaviour. During rest, we identified time-compressed forward and reverse replays of multiple flight trajectories coinciding with sharp-wave ripples. Notably, replays occurred predominantly at locations that were both spatially and temporally distant from the replayed behaviour, and their speed scaled with trajectory length, challenging present models of replay mechanisms. During flight, neural ensembles exhibited fast representational sweeps, in which the decoded location moved ahead of the bat’s position cyclically. In contrast to reports in rodents, sweeps occurred in the absence of theta oscillations, and were instead phase locked to a prominent motor behavioural rhythm—the bat’s wing-beat cycle. This suggests that behaviourally relevant sensorimotor rhythms can interact with hippocampal ensemble dynamics in a highly structured manner. Combined, our findings challenge existing models of ensemble dynamics in the mammalian hippocampus, and highlight the importance of comparative studies in ethologically relevant conditions for elucidating brain function. Wireless large-scale&nbsp;recordings of neural activity in freely flying fruit bats reveal that hippocampal ensemble properties are associated with sensorimotor rhythms, and that previous models of replay and sequential dynamics, based on experiments in rodents, might not be applicable to other species.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of animal phyla, each with their unique body plan, was a rapid event in the history of animal life, yet its genomic underpinnings are still poorly understood1. Here we investigate at the genomic, regulatory and cellular levels, the origin of one of the most distinctive animal phyla, the chaetognaths, whose organismal characteristics have historically complicated their phylogenetic placement2,3. We show that these characteristics are reflected at the cell-type level by the expression of genes that originated in the chaetognath lineage, contributing to adaptation to planktonic life at the sensory and structural levels4. Similarly to other members of gnathiferans (which also include rotifers and several other microscopic phyla)5,6, chaetognaths have undergone accelerated genomic evolution with gene loss and chromosomal fusions7,8. Furthermore, they secondarily duplicated thousands of genes9,10, without evidence for a whole-genome duplication, yielding, for instance, tandemly expanded Hox genes, as well as many phylum-specific genes. We also detected repeat-rich highly methylated neocentromeres and a simplified DNA methylation toolkit that is involved in mobile element repression rather than transcriptional control. Consistent with fossil evidence11,12, our observations suggest that chaetognaths emerged after a phase of morphological simplification through a reinvention of organ systems paralleled by massive genomic reorganization, explaining the uniqueness of their body plan. Genomic, single-cell transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses show that chaetognaths, following extensive gene loss in the gnathiferan lineage, relied on newly evolved genes and lineage-specific tandem duplications, not caused by a whole-genome duplication event, to shape their distinctive body plan.},

It is made possible by the familiar, bowl-shaped pelvis, whose short, wide iliac blades curve along the sides of the body to stabilize walking and support internal organs and a large-brained, broad-shouldered baby4–6. The ilium changes compared with living primates are an evolutionary novelty7. However, how this evolution came about remains unknown. Here, using a multifaceted histological, comparative genomic and functional genomic approach, we identified the developmental bases of the morphogenetic shifts in the human pelvis that made bipedalism possible. First, we observe that the human ilium cartilage growth plate underwent a heterotopic shift, residing perpendicular to the orientation present in other primate (and mouse) ilia. Second, we observe heterochronic and heterotopic shifts in ossification that are unlike those in non-human primate ilia or human long bones. Ossification initiates posteriorly, resides externally with fibroblast (and perichondral) cells contributing to osteoblasts, and is delayed compared with other bones in humans and with primate ilia. Underlying these two shifts are regulatory changes in an integrated chondrocyte–perichondral–osteoblast pathway, involving complex hierarchical interactions between SOX9–ZNF521–PTH1R and RUNX2–FOXP1/2. These innovations facilitated further growth of the human pelvis and the unique formation of the ilium among primates. The human pelvis exhibits distinct spatiotemporal ossification patterns and an ilium cartilage growth plate that is shifted perpendicularly compared with those of other mammals and non-human primates—two key adaptations that underlie bipedalism.},

  abstract     = {There is ongoing debate about the vulnerability of arthropods to climate change1,2. Long-term impacts of climate change on arthropod communities could manifest through short-term weather patterns3. Arthropods in the tropics are hyper-diverse4,5 and contribute many crucial ecosystem functions6,7, but are comparatively less studied than in temperate regions1,8,9. Tropical forest arthropods and the functions that they provide may be vulnerable to intensified El Niño events under climate change10–12. Here we perform time-series analysis of data from primary tropical forests, which reveal long-term declines in arthropod diversity and function that were linked to El Niño occurrence. In the Americas, species losses correlated with El Niño sensitivity, and abundant species fluctuated according to feeding traits and level of ecological specialization. Parallel declines in butterflies in Southeast Asia suggested that impacts spanned continents. Predicted arthropod diversity changes correlated with observed rates of invertebrate-mediated decomposition and leaf herbivory, which were oscillating and crashing, respectively, across the tropics. Our analyses suggest that an intensified El Niño immediately threatens tropical forest arthropods and the ecosystem functions that they provide. The broader consequences remain unknown, but such widespread changes could fundamentally alter tropical forest ecosystems13. Long-term monitoring of arthropod diversity and forest functioning across the tropics is paramount, as is researching the potential mechanisms that underly this novel threat. Time-series data from tropical forests tracking weather and declines in arthropod diversity and function show that fluctuations in species were largely dependent on their El Niño sensitivity and ecological specialization.},

Although the highly explosive volcanoes of Santorini and Kolumbo1,2 in the Greek Aegean Sea are just 7 km apart, their potentially coupled deep magmatic feeding systems are only poorly understood3,4. The 2025 volcano–tectonic crisis of Santorini simultaneously affected both volcanic centres, providing insights into a complex, multistorage feeder system. Here we integrate onshore and marine seismological data with geodetic measurements to reconstruct magma migration before and during the crisis. Gradual inflation in the Santorini caldera, beginning in mid-2024, preceded the January 2025 intrusion of a magma-filled dike sourced from a mid-crustal reservoir beneath Kolumbo, indicating a link between the two volcanoes. Joint inversion of ground and satellite-based deformation data indicates that approximately 0.31 km3 of magma intruded as an approximately 13-km-long dike, reactivating principal regional faults and arresting 3–5 km below the seafloor. The 2024–2025 resurgence of magmatic activity beneath both volcanic centres and their apparent coupling provides insights into the dynamic interplay of magma storage, transport and reservoir failure beneath neighbouring volcanoes. Seismological and geodetic data are used together with a machine learning earthquake catalogue to reconstruct magma migration before and during the 2025 volcano–tectonic crisis at Santorini volcano, indicating a coupling between Santorini and Kolumbo.},

  abstract     = {The enantioselective construction of small-ring carbocycles provides organic chemists with an enduring challenge1. Despite their commercial importance, enantioselective synthetic routes towards alkylidenecyclopropanes, a class of small-ring carbocycles, remain underdeveloped2,3. Alkylidenecyclopropanes can be converted into cyclopropanes, a common feature in drug molecules (for example, Nirmatrelvir 1)4, as well as both naturally occurring and synthetic agrochemicals (for example, permethrin 2)5,6. Here we describe the facile synthesis of highly enantioenriched alkylidenecyclopropanes through the use of a bifunctional iminophosphorane catalysed, stereo-controlled, strain-relieving deconjugation. Small modifications to the basic catalyst system were used to broaden the scope of the reaction to substrates containing ester, amide, phosphine oxide and ketone functionalities. Through the design of a suitable substrate and retuning of the catalyst’s iminophosphorane moiety, the transformation was effectively applied to the synthesis of a single stereoisomer of the commonplace insecticide permethrin as well as a range of cyclopropane-based insecticide cores. State-of-the-art computational studies were performed to provide detailed insights into the mechanistic pathway and origin of both diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities. &nbsp;A bifunctional iminophosphorane-catalysed, stereo-controlled deconjugation for the synthesis of highly enantioenriched alkylidenecyclopropanes is described, alongside computational studies elucidating the mechanistic pathway and origins of diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity.},

  abstract     = {Despite decades of investigation, it remains unclear (and hard to predict1–4) how the outcomes of chemical reactions change over multidimensional ‘hyperspaces’ defined by reaction conditions5. Whereas human chemists can explore only a limited subset of these manifolds, automated platforms6–12 can generate thousands of reactions in parallel. Yet, purification and yield quantification remain bottlenecks, constrained by time-consuming and resource-intensive analytical techniques. As a result, our understanding of reaction hyperspaces remains fragmentary7,9,13–16. Are yield distributions smooth or corrugated? Do they conceal mechanistically new reactions? Can major products vary across different regions? Here, to address these questions, we developed a low-cost robotic platform using primarily optical detection to quantify yields of products and by-products at unprecedented throughput and minimal cost per condition. Scanning hyperspaces across thousands of conditions, we find and prove mathematically that, for continuous variables (concentrations, temperatures), individual yield distributions are generally slow-varying. At the same time, we uncover hyperspace regions of unexpected reactivity as well as switchovers between major products. Moreover, by systematically surveying substrate proportions, we reconstruct underlying reaction networks and expose hidden intermediates and products—even in reactions studied for well over a century. This hyperspace-scanning approach provides a versatile and scalable framework for reaction optimization and discovery. Crucially, it can help identify conditions under which complex mixtures can be driven cleanly towards different major products, thereby expanding synthetic diversity while reducing chemical input requirements. A low-cost robotic platform using mainly optical detection to quantify yields of products and by-products allows the analysis of multidimensional chemical reaction hyperspaces and networks much faster than is possible by human chemists.},

  abstract     = {Amino acids (AAs) have a long history of being used as stabilizers for biological media1. For example, they are important components in biomedical formulations. The effect of AAs on biological systems is also starting to be appreciated. For example, it is believed that water-stressed cells increase the levels of AAs to prevent protein aggregation2. Several hypotheses have been put forward regarding their function, ranging from water-structuring3 to hydrotropic4 to specific effects such as&nbsp;stabilization against misfolding, yet it is not known whether their stabilizing function is protein specific or a generic colloidal property. Here we deduce that AAs possess a new and broad colloidal property: they stabilize patchy nanoscale colloids by adsorbing onto their surfaces through weak interactions. We demonstrate this general property by careful experimental evaluation of the stabilizing effect of AAs on dispersions of various proteins, plasmid DNA and non-biological nanoparticles. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework that captures this phenomenon and&nbsp;experimentally corroborate several new broad theoretical implications that apply beyond AAs. In vivo experiments further demonstrate that the addition of 1 M proline to insulin doubles its bioavailability in blood. Overall, our results indicate that the role of small molecules is as important as that of ionic strength and should always be reported in biophysics experiments. Amino acids possess a new and broad colloidal property: they stabilize patchy nanoscale colloids,&nbsp;such as proteins, by adsorbing onto their surfaces through weak interactions.},

  abstract     = {Van der Waals (vdW) materials offer unique opportunities for 3D integration1,2 of planar circuits towards higher-density transistors and energy-efficient computation3–7. Owing to the high thermal budget and special substrate requirement for the synthesis of high-quality vdW materials8–10, an advanced transfer technique is required that can simultaneously meet a broad range of industrial requirements, including high intactness, cleanliness and speed, large scale, low cost and versatility. However, previous efforts based on either etching or etching-free mechanisms typically only improve one or two of the aforementioned aspects11–13 and a comprehensive and systematic solution remains lacking. Here we demonstrate an electrostatic-repulsion-enabled advanced transfer technique that is etching free, high yield, fast, wafer scale, low cost and widely applicable, using ammonia solution compatible with the complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) industry. The high material intactness and interface cleanliness enable superior device performances in 2D field-effect transistors with 100% yield, near-zero hysteresis (7 mV) and near-ideal subthreshold swing (65.9 mV dec−1). The combination with bismuth contact further enables an ultrahigh on-current of 1.3 mA μm−1 under 1 V bias. This advanced transfer approach offers a facile and manufacturing-viable solution for vdW-materials-based electronics, paving the way for advanced 3D integration in the future. An electrostatic-repulsion-enabled advanced transfer technique based on ammonia solution is introduced for separating van der Waals thin-film materials from their substrates, demonstrating suitability for its use in the complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) industry.},

  abstract     = {Controlling spin currents, that is, the flow of spin angular momentum, in small magnetic devices, is the principal objective of spin electronics, a main contender for future energy-efficient information technologies1,2. A pure spin current has never been measured directly because the associated electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection methods optimized for charge transport3,4. Here we report that resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current carried by magnons—the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic order—in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator. This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics. Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering can be used to measure the spin current carried by magnons in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator.},

  abstract     = {Directly visualizing vibrational anisotropy in individual phonon modes is essential for understanding a wide range of intriguing optical, thermal and elastic phenomena in materials1–5. Although conventional optical and diffraction techniques have been used to estimate vibrational anisotropies, they fall short in achieving the spatial and energy resolution necessary to provide detailed information4–7. Here, we introduce a new form of momentum-selective electron energy-loss spectroscopy, which enables the element-resolved imaging of frequency- and symmetry-dependent vibrational anisotropies with atomic resolution. Vibrational anisotropies manifest in different norms of orthogonal atomic displacements, known as thermal ellipsoids. Using the centrosymmetric strontium titanate as a model system, we observed two distinct types of oxygen vibrations with contrasting anisotropies: oblate thermal ellipsoids below 60 meV and prolate ones above 60 meV. In non-centrosymmetric barium titanate, our approach can detect subtle distortions of the oxygen octahedra by observing the unexpected modulation of q-selective signals between apical and equatorial oxygen sites near 55 meV, which originates from reduced crystal symmetry and may also be linked to ferroelectric polarization. These observations are quantitatively supported by theoretical modelling, which demonstrates the reliability of our approach. The measured frequency-dependent vibrational anisotropies shed new light on the dielectric and thermal behaviours governed by acoustic and optical phonons. The ability to visualize phonon eigenvectors at specific crystallographic sites with unprecedented spatial and energy resolution opens new avenues for exploring dielectric, optical, thermal and superconducting properties. A new form of momentum-selective electron energy-loss spectroscopy enables the element-resolved imaging of frequency- and symmetry-dependent vibrational anisotropies with atomic resolution.},

However, modern-day processors often cannot meet the restrained power and time budgets of edge systems because of intrinsic limitations imposed by their architecture (von Neumann bottleneck) or domain conversions (analogue to digital and time to frequency). Here we propose an edge temporal-signal processor based on two in-materia computing systems for both feature extraction and classification, reaching near-software accuracy for the TI-46-Word1 and Google Speech Commands2 datasets. First, a nonlinear, room-temperature reconfigurable-nonlinear-processing-unit3,4 layer realizes analogue, time-domain feature extraction from the raw audio signals, similar to the human cochlea. Second, an analogue in-memory computing chip5, consisting of memristive crossbar arrays, implements a compact neural network trained on the extracted features for classification. With submillisecond latency, reconfigurable-nonlinear-processing-unit-based feature extraction consuming roughly 300 nJ per inference, and the analogue in-memory computing-based classifier using around 78 µJ (with potential for roughly 10 µJ)6, our findings offer a promising avenue for advancing the compactness, efficiency and performance of heterogeneous smart edge processors through in materia computing hardware. A temporal-signal processor based on two in-materia computing hardware platforms—reconfigurable nonlinear-processing units (RNPUs) and analogue in-memory computing (AIMC)—is used for both feature extraction and classification, advancing compactness, efficiency, and performance of heterogeneous smart edge devices.},

  abstract     = {The rise of green industrial policy is transforming efforts to decarbonize the global economy and mitigate climate change. The first three decades of climate policy centred on international cooperation on dividing up the costs of mitigation. In the new era of green industrial policy, geoeconomic competition for the benefits of decarbonization has emerged alongside international cooperation on emissions reductions. Governments invest in the manufacturing and deployment of clean technologies to advance economic development, energy security and emissions cuts. Geoeconomic competition has the potential to accelerate global decarbonization by facilitating greater technology deployment, speeding up technology cost declines and, thus, lowering the barriers to climate action. However, it also creates major pitfalls by facilitating the rise of trade protectionism, creating international conflict, and reproducing economic divides between richer and poorer, yet growing, countries. It is thus uncertain how the geoeconomic turn will impact global decarbonization. Meanwhile, policymakers are asking fundamental questions about how to design industrial policy, manage politics, develop institutions, and deal with the trade-offs between economic, climate and security goals. This Perspective demonstrates the recent geoeconomic turn in decarbonization, lays out its implications for policymaking, identifies global spillovers and addresses research needs. The rise of green industrial policy is transforming decarbonization efforts; the implications for policymaking and global spillovers are discussed, as well as research needs.},
