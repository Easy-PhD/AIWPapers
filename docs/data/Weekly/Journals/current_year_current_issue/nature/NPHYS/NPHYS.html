  abstract     = {The set of quantum logic gates that can be easily implemented is fundamental to the performance of quantum computers, as it governs the accuracy of basic quantum operations and dictates the complexity of implementing quantum algorithms. Traditional approaches to extending gate sets often require operating devices outside the ideal parameter regimes used to realize qubits, leading to increased control complexity while offering only a limited set of gates. Here we experimentally demonstrate a unified and versatile gate scheme capable of generating arbitrary two-qubit gates using only an exchange interaction and qubit driving on a superconducting quantum processor. We achieve high fidelities averaging 99.38% across a wide range of commonly used two-qubit unitaries, enabling precise multipartite entangled state preparation. Furthermore, we successfully produce a B gate, which efficiently synthesizes the entire family of two-qubit gates. Our results establish that fully exploiting the capabilities of the exchange interaction can yield a comprehensive and highly accurate gate set. With maximum expressivity, optimal gate time, demonstrated high fidelity and easy adaption to other quantum platforms, our unified control scheme offers the prospect of improved performance in quantum hardware and algorithm development. The efficiency of a quantum computer depends on which basic operations it can implement. Now a scheme that can implement any two-qubit logic gate has been demonstrated on a superconducting architecture.},

Microfabricated high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonators (μHBARs) support high-frequency mechanical modes above 10 GHz with coherence times exceeding one millisecond. Here we demonstrate a μHBAR-based cavity optomechanical system that permits quantum optomechanical control of individual high-coherence phonon modes. We perform laser cooling of the phonon modes from an occupation of approximately 22 phonons to fewer than 0.4, corresponding to laser-based ground-state cooling of a mechanical object with a mass of 7.5 μg. During the cooling process we do not observe any absorption-induced heating, demonstrating the resilience of the HBAR optomechanical systems against parasitic heating. Our work demonstrates that μHBARs are promising as the basis for quantum optomechanical systems with robustness to decoherence that is necessary for efficient, low-noise photon–phonon conversion. A massive phonon mode in a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator has been laser cooled close to its ground state. Its robustness to decoherence establishes the potential of these devices for quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Many of the most promising quantum information platforms store quantum information in electronic or atomic spins. To incorporate these devices into quantum networks, a spin–photon interface is required. Currently, the best on-demand single-photon sources use a semiconductor quantum dot in an engineered photonic environment. However, it is difficult to achieve coherent spin control in a high-performance single-photon source, and spin coherence is limited by magnetic noise from nuclear spins in the semiconductor host material. Here we combine all-optical spin control with a quantum dot in an open microcavity. We demonstrate fast coherent rotations of a hole spin around an arbitrary axis of the Bloch sphere with a maximum π-pulse fidelity of 98.6%. To suppress the slow magnetic noise, we laser cool the nuclear spins using the hole as a central spin. This extends the hole spin free-induction-decay time by more than an order of magnitude. It becomes much larger than both rotation time and radiative recombination time of the spin, enabling the creation of many spin–photon pairs before the loss of spin coherence. Spin–photon interfaces provide a connection between quantum information stored in atomic or electronic spins and optical communications networks. A quantum photon emitter with long-lived, controllable coherent spin has now been demonstrated.},

An interface between photons and phonons could allow quantum information to be stored in long-lived mechanical oscillators. Here, we introduce a platform that relies on electrostatic forces in nanoscale structures to achieve strong coupling between a superconducting qubit and a nanomechanical oscillator with an energy decay time (T1) of approximately 25 ms, well beyond those achieved in integrated superconducting circuits. We use quantum operations in this system to investigate the microscopic origins of mechanical decoherence and mitigate its impact. By using two-pulse dynamical decoupling sequences, we can extend the coherence time (T2) from 64 μs to 1 ms. These findings establish that mechanical oscillators can act as quantum memories for superconducting devices, with potential future applications in quantum computing, sensing and transduction. Superconducting qubits, a leading platform for quantum information processing, suffer from decoherence. Interfacing them with nanomechanical oscillators allows quantum information to be stored in motional states with longer lifetimes.},

Quantum optical skyrmions with local topological textures are expected to reshape the landscape of quantum photonic technology, although their experimental implementation has not yet been demonstrated. Here we present experimental realizations of nanophotonic quantum skyrmions using a semiconductor cavity quantum electrodynamics system. By manipulating the photonic spin–orbit coupling in a Gaussian microcavity, we obtained a confined optical mode whose polarizations feature skyrmionic topologies. With pronounced cavity quantum electrodynamics effects, we generated and detected single-photon skyrmions from a solid-state quantum emitter deterministically coupled to the Gaussian microcavity. The polarity associated with single-photon skyrmions can be swapped by flipping the polarization of the quantum emitter through the Zeeman effect. We also investigated the topological protection of quantum optical skyrmions under different perturbations. Our work opens an unexplored aspect of quantum light–matter interactions in the nanoscale and might advance resilient photonic quantum technology with high-dimensional qubits and high-capacity quantum memories. Quantum optical skyrmions are promising for quantum photonic applications but have not been experimentally realized.

It involves successive cycles of confinement and release that drive important morphological changes. However, it remains unclear whether migrating cells can retain a memory of their past morphological states that could potentially facilitate their navigation through confined spaces. We demonstrate that local geometry governs a switch between two cell morphologies, thereby facilitating cell passage through long and narrow gaps. We combined cell migration assays on standardized microsystems with biophysical modelling and biochemical perturbations to show that migrating cells have a long-term memory of past confinement events. The morphological cell states correlate across transitions through actin cortex remodelling. These findings indicate that mechanical memory in migrating cells plays an active role in their migratory potential in confined environments. Cells often navigate through confined spaces. Now it is shown that cells retain a mechanical memory of previous confinement events, which makes them more efficient at migrating through narrow microenvironments.},

Here we show that the water menisci formed around bacteria lead to capillary attraction between cells while still allowing them to slide past one another. We develop an experimental apparatus that allows us to control bacterial collective behaviour by varying the strength and range of capillary forces. Combining three-dimensional imaging and cell tracking with agent-based modelling, we demonstrate that capillary attraction organizes rod-shaped bacteria into densely packed nematic groups and influences their collective dynamics and morphologies. Our results suggest that capillary forces may be a ubiquitous physical ingredient in shaping microbial communities in partially hydrated environments. Bacteria tend to live in thin layers of water on surfaces. Now the capillary forces in these layers are shown to help organize the bacteria into dense packs.},

Central to this process is the formation of molecular clutches, which are dynamic linkages between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton mediated by integrins and adaptor proteins. Although it is well known that force-dependent interactions between molecular-clutch components are essential for sensing substrate rigidity, the influence of nonlinear adaptor-protein elasticity is poorly understood. Here we show that adaptor-protein elasticity and local interactions between molecular clutches and the extracellular matrix are key to cellular perception of substrate stiffness. We present a semi-analytical theory that integrates experimentally measured force responses of adaptor proteins to describe cell-adhesion sensing. We propose that molecular clutches probe local mechanical substrate properties and collectively function as a differential that allows a retrograde actin flow and substrate movement to occur at different rates while maintaining a stable mechanical coupling between them. Our model reproduces experimentally measured force-loading rates of individual molecular clutches and correctly predicts cell-adhesion behaviour for a range of substrate stiffnesses. The framework presented can be extended to study complex phenomena such as focal-adhesion maturation and cell-type-specific mechanosensing. The cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix are linked by molecular clutches that enable cells to sense their environment. Now it is shown that the elastic properties of the clutches underpin stiffness sensing.},

Although the exposed microtubule exterior is readily accessible to proteins, the mechanism governing the accessibility of the confined microtubule lumen to luminal particles remains unknown. Here we show that certain tubulin family proteins (isotypes) facilitate luminal accessibility because of the mechanical properties and lateral interactions that they confer to the microtubules. We characterized the microtubules reconstituted from defined compositions of Caenorhabditis elegans tubulin isotypes. These tubulin isotypes form microtubules with comparable protofilament numbers but different luminal accessibility. We further revealed the role of tubulin isotypes in regulating the strength of inter-protofilament lateral interactions, which determines luminal accessibility through the mechanosensitivity of reversible protofilament separation. Deformation of the microtubule lattice, which generates stresses exceeding the strength of the lateral interactions, creates gaps between adjacent protofilaments, enhancing the accessibility of the lumen. Together, our findings uncovered the tubulin isotype-dependent mechanical plasticity that confers force sensitivity to the microtubule lattice and modulates the energy barrier for luminal proteins to access the lumen. Proteins interact with both the exterior and interior of microtubules. Here the relationship between microtubule building blocks and the accessibility of the microtubule interior to proteins is clarified.},

  abstract     = {Motility-induced phase separation occurs in assemblies of self-propelled units when activity is coupled negatively to density. By contrast, the consequences of a positive coupling between density and activity on the collective behaviour of active matter remain unexplored. Here we show that collective activity can emerge from such a positive coupling among non-motile building blocks. We perform experiments with self-sustained oscillators powered by contact-charge electrophoresis. Although the oscillators are non-motile by design, they spontaneously form an active gas when confined together. The super-elastic nature of collisions constitutes a positive density–activity coupling and underlies the active gas properties. Elucidating the origin of binary collisions allows us to precisely control the structure of the active gas and its eventual crystallization. Beyond considering the overlooked positive coupling between density and activity, our work suggests that rich collective properties can emerge not only from the symmetry of interactions between active building blocks but also from their adaptable and responsive behaviour. In active matter systems, increasing density usually reduces activity. Now, in a system where density enhances activity, collective motion is shown to arise from non-motile oscillators when they are confined.},

  abstract     = {The ability to manipulate polar entities with multiple external fields could enable functionalities and applications in spin systems, photonics, metamaterials and soft matter. Liquid crystals that exhibit both a crystalline structure and liquid fluidity represent a promising platform for manipulating phases with polar molecular order, notably ferroelectric ones. However, achieving a polar symmetry is challenging with rod-shaped liquid crystal molecules, which form predominantly apolar nematic phases. Here we report an approach in which a geometric lattice confinement of nematic liquid crystals is used to induce planar polar order on the scale of a mesoscopic metamaterial. We confine the nematic liquid crystal in a micropillar array, forming topological defect–pillar pairs of elastic dipoles with a free top interface in contact with an immiscible fluid. The resulting dipole lattice configurations can be programmed rheologically by flowing the top fluid and maintained even after flow cessation, a phenomenon attributed to orientational multistability of the dipoles. This multimemory effect enables the encoding and reconfiguration of directional information. Overall, these results advance our understanding of topological dipoles under confinement and shear flow, enabling the detection, tracking and recording of flow profiles and could facilitate the development of stimuli-responsive materials. Programmable topological dipoles could be used in stimuli-responsive materials. Now it is shown that confinement of an apolar liquid crystal results in controllable polar arrangements of elastic dipoles.},

  abstract     = {Topological defects give rise to non-trivial excitations—such as solitons, vortices and skyrmions—characterized by integer-valued topological charges. However, their classification becomes difficult when singularities are present in the order parameter field, complicating the computation of these charges. Although exotic nonlinear excitations have been theoretically proposed in the superfluid 3He-A phase and spinor Bose–Einstein condensates, they have not been experimentally observed and their stability has not been investigated. Here we demonstrate the presence of a singular skyrmion that goes beyond the framework of topology in a ferromagnetic superfluid. These skyrmions emerge from anomalous symmetry-breaking associated with an eccentric spin singularity and carry half the elementary charge—a feature that distinguishes them from conventional skyrmions and merons. We realize the universal regime of the quantum Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, and we identify the unconventional fractional skyrmions produced by emission from a magnetic domain wall and the spontaneous splitting of an integer skyrmion with spin singularities. The singular skyrmions are stable even after 2 s of hold time. Our results confirm the universality between classical and quantum Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities and broaden our understanding of complex nonlinear dynamics for a non-trivial texture in topological quantum systems. The quantum Kelvin–Helmholtz instability can induce non-trivial topological excitations. Now a proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates the emergence of a stable singular fractional skyrmion spin texture originating from this quantum instability.},

  abstract     = {Fractional quantum statistics are the defining characteristic of anyons. Measuring the phase generated by an exchange of anyons is challenging, as standard interferometry set-ups—such as the Fabry–Pérot interferometer—suffer from charging effects that obscure the interference signal. Here we present the observation of anyonic interference and exchange phases in an optical-like Mach–Zehnder interferometer based on co-propagating interface modes. By avoiding backscattering and deleterious charging effects, this set-up enables pristine and robust Aharonov–Bohm interference without any phase slips. At various fractional filling factors, the observed flux periodicities agree with the fundamental fractionally charged excitations that correspond to Jain states and depend only on the bulk topological order. To probe the anyonic statistics, we used a small, charged top gate in the interferometer bulk to induce localized quasiparticles without modifying the Aharonov–Bohm phase. The added quasiparticles introduce periodic phase slips. The sign and magnitude of the observed phase slips align with the expected value at filling 1/3, but their direction shows systematic deviations at fillings 2/5 and 3/7. Control over added individual quasiparticles in this design is essential for measuring the coveted non-abelian statistics in the future. An interferometer design allows systematic investigation of the anyonic statistics of bulk fractional quantum Hall states.},

  abstract     = {In condensed matter, angular momentum is intimately related to the emergence of topological quantum states, including chiral superconductivity, quantum spin liquids and various chiral quasiparticles. Recently, it has been predicted that microscopic lattice excitations, known as phonons, can carry finite angular momentum, leading to specific physical properties of materials. However, phonon angular momentum has not yet been observed directly. Here we demonstrate that angular momentum conservation results in a macroscopic mechanical torque when applying a time-reversal symmetry-breaking thermal gradient along the chiral axis of single-crystal tellurium. We probe this torque using a cantilever-based device and establish that it changes sign by flipping the chirality or thermal gradient. This behavior disappears in polycrystalline samples that lack a preferred chirality. Our experimental results align well with theoretical calculations. We provide compelling evidence for phonon angular momentum, which might enable quantum states with potential applications in microelectronics. Theory predicts that phonons—quanta of lattice vibrations—can carry finite angular momentum and thus influence physical properties of materials. Now phonons with angular momentum have been seen in tellurium with a chiral crystal structure.},

  abstract     = {Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene hosts a variety of strongly correlated states at partial fillings of its flat bands. In a magnetic field, these flat bands evolve into a Hofstadter spectrum renormalized by strong Coulomb interactions. Here we study the interacting Hofstadter states that spontaneously form within the topological magnetic sub-bands of an ultraclean magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene device, including symmetry-broken Chern insulator states and fractional quantum Hall states. The observed symmetry-broken Chern insulator states form a cascade, with their Chern numbers mimicking the main sequence of correlated Chern insulators. The fractional quantum Hall states form in a Jain sequence. However, they disappear at high magnetic field, in contrast to conventional fractional quantum Hall states that strengthen with increasing magnetic field. We reveal a magnetic-field-driven phase transition from composite fermion phases to a dissipative Fermi liquid. Our theoretical analysis of the magnetic sub-bands hosting the fractional quantum Hall states predicts non-uniform quantum geometric properties far from the lowest Landau level. This points towards a more natural interpretation of these states as in-field fractional Chern insulators of the magnetic sub-bands. Interacting electrons in Hofstadter bands can form symmetry-broken topological states. These are now revealed in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, and their properties are influenced by non-uniform quantum geometry.},

  abstract     = {Close to the Dirac point, graphene is expected to exist in a quantum critical Dirac fluid state, where the flow of both charge and heat can be described with a characteristic d.c. electrical conductivity and thermodynamic variables such as entropy and enthalpy densities. Although the fluid-like viscous flow of charge has been reported in state-of-the-art graphene devices, the value of conductivity, predicted to be quantized and determined only by the universality class of the critical point, has not been established experimentally so far. Here we have discerned the quantum critical universality in graphene transport by combining the electrical and thermal conductivities in very high-quality devices close to the Dirac point. We find that they are inversely related, as expected from relativistic hydrodynamics, and the characteristic conductivity converges to a quantized value. We also observe a giant violation of the Wiedemann–Franz law, where the Lorentz number exceeds the semiclassical value by more than 200 times close to the Dirac point at low temperatures. At high temperatures, the effective dynamic viscosity to entropy density ratio close to the Dirac point in the cleanest devices approaches that of a minimally viscous quantum fluid within a factor of four. Critical behaviour is expected in graphene when the carrier density is tuned to the Dirac point. Now, universality associated with the critical point is observed in electronic and thermal transport.},
