  abstract     = {Since 2013, the Spanish fleet of EF-18 fighters has not received major updates nor any other jet has been proposed for their replacement. Thereby, a decision problem of interest to the Spanish Air Force is addressed in this study. In this regard, a collection of six potential alternatives (Eurofighter Typhoon, F-35 Lightning II, F/A-18 Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, F-15 EX, and Saab 39 Gripen) and 14 criteria (3 of which being qualitative) are evaluated based on expert consensus by a combination of fuzzy logic and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches (AHP-VIKOR/AHP-TOPSIS). The weights of the criteria and the valuation of the qualitative ones (via questionnaires) were made possible by the participation of two independent groups of experts, all of them fighter pilots. Once the extraction of knowledge was carried out via a fuzzy version of a modified AHP, it was found that the two most important criteria (“air superiority over neighbor countries” and “tactical capability”) were qualitative. A comparison between the rankings of the alternatives provided by fuzzy VIKOR and fuzzy TOPSIS approaches highlights that the fuzzy VIKOR ranking appears highly influenced by the most important criteria. On the contrary, fuzzy TOPSIS presents a more compensatory behavior than fuzzy VIKOR. Given the differences observed when comparing such rankings of alternatives, a triple sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure robustness. Our results highlight the Dassault Rafale as the most promising option for replacement. This finding suggests its potential as a benchmark for future fighter selection and next-generation fighter planning.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify undervalued stocks, addressing the limitations of traditional investment strategies that rely heavily on fundamental analysis. As financial markets become more complex, characterized by volatility and information asymmetry, conventional valuation methods often struggle to capture these dynamics. In contrast, ML offers the ability to analyze large datasets and uncover intricate patterns, presenting a data-driven alternative for stock selection and portfolio optimization. A comprehensive predictive framework was developed, integrating traditional financial ratios with novel features derived from value investing principles and technical analysis. Several ML models — Random Forest, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Machines — were assessed for their ability to predict high-return stocks. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, were used to evaluate model effectiveness. Among the models tested, the LSTM demonstrated the highest accuracy at 0.81, proving its robustness in identifying undervalued stocks. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on ML in finance by offering a practical framework that bridges theoretical concepts with real-world applications. The study also emphasizes the importance of refining ML algorithms to improve model interpretability and transparency, crucial for fostering trust in these systems. Future research should explore the use of ensemble methods and alternative data sources to further enhance prediction accuracy, while addressing challenges related to accountability in ML-driven investment strategies. This work advances the conversation around algorithmic trading and the future of data-driven finance.},

  abstract     = {In the domain of association rule mining, evaluating the interestingness of discovered rules plays a crucial role in extracting meaningful patterns. However, the context of interestingness poses challenges that call for improvements in rule evaluation. This study focuses on addressing this problem by enhancing the evaluation of interestingness in ontology-based association rules. In this study, we present the effective rule evaluation using the ontology (EREO) model, which aims to evaluate the interestingness of ontology-based association rules in the context of US birth data. The EREO model incorporates three levels of rule evaluation: the utilization of proposed effective measures, consultation with domain experts, and the utilization of AI-based methods. To indirectly evaluate the interestingness of ontology-based rules, we propose two effective measures: Ontology-based rule specificity (ORS) and ontology-based rule complexity (ORC). Rule evaluation is further facilitated by domain experts and AI-based methods, employing an interestingness measurement scale (IMS). Furthermore, we compare the average interestingness scores obtained from ORS, ORC, and the EREO model with those derived from traditional interestingness measures. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed interestingness measures consistently outperform the traditional ones, as indicated by higher average scores. Additionally, we observe a positive relationship between the interestingness scores obtained using the three levels of the EREO model. Overall, this study effectively showcases the efficacy of ontology-based association rule evaluation in improving the quality of discovered rules and supporting informed decision-making processes.},

To enhance the interactivity and efficiency of credit allocation in multi-agent reinforcement learning, we introduce a credit allocation for interactive multi-agents method (CAIM). CAIM not only considers the effects of various actions on other agents but also leverages attention mechanisms to handle the mismatch between observations and actions. With a unique credit allocation strategy, agents can more precisely assess their contributions during collaboration. Experiments in various adversarial scenarios within the SMAC benchmark environment indicate that CAIM markedly outperforms existing multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches. Further ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each CAIM component. This research presents a new paradigm for enhancing collaboration efficiency and overall performance in MAS.},

  abstract     = {Universities are transitioning to applied education models within the framework of university–industry cooperation. In this case, both students and universities face the problem of choosing suitable companies. There is no study in the literature that deals with the solution of this problem. Thus, this study discusses companies’ evaluation and selection for the applied education model. A new hybrid methodology is proposed. The methodology consists of the following activities: determining the evaluation criteria with expert opinions, weighting the criteria with AHP, and ranking the companies with TOPSIS and PROMETHEE. The methodology has been tested in a case study with real data from an industrial university. While TOPSIS is effective for certain criteria, the findings suggest that PROMETHEE may provide more effective results specifically for company evaluations within the applied education model, aligning better with the study’s objectives. The applied education model is expected to yield several key outcomes: For company managers, it will lead to increased efficiency by hiring graduates who already have practical experience. From the educators’ perspective, it will result in the training of graduates who are both experienced and highly employable. For students, the model will enhance their employability aligning their skills with their career aspirations and increasing their chances of employment in companies, that match their competencies and preferences after graduation.},

  abstract     = {Association rule mining is a method for searching databases for patterns or co-occurrences in data. The fundamental step in extracting association rules is mining frequent item sets. However, the itemsets extracted were found to have redundancy in them. This study aims to tackle the redundancy present in the generated association rules and itemsets. One commonly used technique to address redundancy is extracting nonderivable itemsets. The traditional approach in mining such itemsets involved checking for upper and lower bound inequalities by making a breadth-wise search of the dataset. However, this generated many candidate itemsets, increasing the algorithm’s run time and memory consumption. Therefore, it became imperative to develop a technique that addressed these shortcomings. A new approach utilizing a genetic algorithm has been proposed to extract the necessary nonderivable itemsets. To our knowledge, such an approach has not been incorporated so far in extracting nonderivable itemsets. Here operations such as crossover and mutation are applied to generate the required itemsets and this was found to be faster and more efficient in memory in comparison to existing approaches based on distribution and discretization of data. Another problem of pressing concern is the redundancy that prevailed in the association rules that were extracted from the mined itemsets. Traditional approaches involved making repeated scans of the mined collection of association rules to prune out redundant rules. Due to this, the algorithm’s runtime increased. To handle this drawback our work proposes a novel approach based on tree-based pruning to remove redundant association rules. The left and right expansion principles provide the foundation of the tree’s construction. The Minimal Antecedent and Maximal Consequent concepts are used to eliminate redundant rules and produce the necessary set of nonderivable association rules. Based on the findings of this study, it is evident that the suggested method improves run time overall by 48.77% and memory by 35.65%. Concerning metrics such as Precision, Recall, and Accuracy an aggregate improvement of 94.92%, 90.8%, and 91.21% was observed in comparison to existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Trauma patients often face complex health consequences and are at a risk of rapid deterioration. Prioritizing trauma patients in intensive care units (ICUs) is essential for timely intervention. Current prioritization approaches are challenging tasks that involve considering multiple evaluation criteria, trade-offs and criteria importance, thus requiring a robust multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. In this study, we propose a novel MCDM framework for the evaluation and benchmarking of trauma patients on the basis of health control (HC) criteria derived from real trauma data. The framework consists of two main phases. In the first phase, a dataset of adult trauma patients referred to a trauma network in the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom is identified and preprocessed. This dataset covers the period from 15 May 2014 to 16 December 2016, providing continuous monitoring of the patients. In the second phase, MCDM methods are employed to develop a dynamic decision matrix (DM) that assesses 35 trauma patients on the basis of 16 HC trauma criteria. Using 2-tuple spherical fuzzy linguistic numbers with fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (2TSFLNs-FWZIC), the framework ensures accurate weighting of the criteria, with C1=PS14 and C5=NISS receiving the highest weight values (0.062606) and C2=CD3+8+(106/L) receiving the lowest weight value (0.062353). This weighting process is guided by the input and expertise of a panel of five emergency medicine specialists who have experience in trauma patient management. The results indicate that CoCoSo effectively ranks patients from the least critical ( k = 1 . 3 4 8 7 2 5 ) to the most critical cases ( k = 1 . 6 2 2 0 5 3 ) for ICU admission. The proposed framework is evaluated via systematic ranking and sensitivity analysis, providing validation measures for its performance, robustness and reliability.},

Evaluation of IESs is a major part of the implementation of IES projects, while the current evaluations are based on complete information and single decision making. Given this background, this paper studies the IES evaluation with incomplete information and focuses on the group decision. First, the singular value decomposition algorithm is adopted to predict the missing data. Then, when calculating the index weights, a new method based on standard deviation modified unique reference comparison judgment method is proposed, which not only integrates subjective and objective decision information, but also avoids the problem that the combination coefficients of subjective and objective weights cannot be reasonably allocated. Next, on the basis of the comprehensive weights of indexes and normalized evaluation matrix, the weighted evaluation matrix for each expert is constructed, and the expert weights are calculated by genetic algorithm. Finally, the ranking of IES schemes can be realized by integrating expert weights and expert scoring values. Based on the data of IES at a hospital in Henan, the performance of the proposed method is verified experimentally. Experiments results show that the proposed method is reasonable and effective.},
