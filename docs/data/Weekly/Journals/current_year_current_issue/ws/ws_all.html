  abstract     = {Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have increasingly transformed the healthcare sector, promoting the development of models aimed at improving the efficiency and accuracy of diagnostic processes, with significant applications in medical imaging. Specifically, in the diagnosis of endometrial cancer, accurate staging typically requires pathological examination. This study aims to develop and evaluate an AI-based approach for automating this process, utilizing a combination of object detection and image classification models. The YOLOv4 model was employed to localize the endometrium in medical images, followed by image classification using Inceptionv3, EfficientNet-b0, and MobileNetv2 for performance comparison. The YOLOv4 algorithm achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) score > 0 . 9 , indicating high localization accuracy. In the classification task, all three models achieved training accuracies > 9 0 % and test accuracies > 7 5 % . The proposed approach, combining YOLOv4 for localization and Inceptionv3 for classification, achieved a test accuracy of 77.64%. This study presents an AI-driven method for automated endometrial cancer staging, integrating YOLOv4-based localization with deep learning-based classification. The model demonstrates potential for assisting obstetricians and gynecologists in the early identification of endometrial cancer, improving diagnostic efficiency and accuracy in clinical settings.},

In this research, we have introduced a VLP system tailored to align with the hospital setting. We have developed the power delay profile for the received signal and subsequently assessed the presence of the line-of-sight (LoS) link by extracting the root mean square (RMS) delay spread. Following this, we presented a modified deep Gaussian process (MDGP) that employs multiple kernels to accurately estimate user locations in scenarios where the LoS link is not available.

It remains a serious threat to the world, particularly affecting children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. The fractional-order pneumonia model has been developed in this study to determine the disease dynamics in the system. The model stability is proved for the existing equilibrium points. Global sensitivity analysis was carried out utilizing Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) to find the key parameters influencing disease transmission. Control analysis is considered as an effective strategy for preventing the spread of the disease pneumonia. It is often necessary to combine timely treatment, immunization, and boosting immunity. However, eliminating this disease in the population will be challenging if control strategies aren’t given at the appropriate time and in sufficient quantity. We conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of four optimal control strategies utilizing numerical methods. Our findings indicate that vaccination is the most cost-effective and efficient control intervention among the strategies compared.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in Taiwan, and it is also the type of cancer with the largest incidence worldwide. Early detection and treatment can effectively reduce mortality. In Taiwan, mammography is widely used to screen for microcalcifications in early breast cancer lesions. However, the characteristics of microcalcifications are difficult to observe, and helping radiologists more quickly and effectively identify microcalcifications is an important challenge. This article proposes a method for automatic lesion prediction and image segmentation using microcalcification cluster labeling data. U-Net and V-Net, two convolutional network architectures, are used for comparison, combining the standardized convolutional network architectures dropout and binary cross-entropy (BCE) with Dice as a loss function to detect microcalcification groups. Other preprocessing methods are used to optimize detection results, including window adjustment, image preprocessing, and data augmentation. Finally, the trained model is applied to mammography images to predict lesions through the image segmentation of microcalcification groups, thereby assisting radiologists in making diagnoses. The experimental results on the private dataset show that U-Net outperforms V-Net with an accuracy rate of 72% when using the original images for training, rising to 81% for training using preprocessed images, and 85% when applying the composite method to preprocessed images. V-Net training with preprocessed images only achieves 70% accuracy, rising to 72% by applying the composite method to preprocessed images.},

Recent advances in sepsis prediction have attempted to incorporate machine learning (ML) methods and traditional clinical diagnosis to identify and intervene early in the care process. This review compares supervised learning approaches, such as decision trees and support vector machines, with unsupervised approaches, including clustering and anomaly detection, to identify sepsis in complex, multimodal, real-time clinical datasets. Supervised learning approaches generally yield higher predictive accuracy when trained on labeled datasets. However, unsupervised learning approaches have the utility of identifying new patterns and subtle physiological changes without labeled training data, resulting in improved sensitivity of the system. Given the acute and time-sensitive nature of sepsis, sensitivity is the most critical performance measure, as missing a valid case can be deadly. Overall accuracy is also essential, as is model interoperability (the ability for various systems to integrate, likely due to the heterogeneous nature of health systems). These elements are crucial for scalability and trust in the clinical workspace. In this review, we further compare and contrast these ML approaches to traditional scoring/boundary biomarker approaches, discuss the difficulties of integration, and suggest ways for developing clinically deployable, interpretable, and sensitive sepsis detection systems.},

However, prolonged exposure to potentially infectious materials increases the risk to healthcare workers during sample handling. To address this, we developed a novel Mini-Cult System that integrates both an incubator and a fume hood into a single compact unit. This system revolutionizes laboratory workflows by providing a sterile, contamination-free environment for both cell culture and microbiological applications. It supports essential parameters such as CO 2 concentration, temperature, and humidity, ensuring optimal conditions for cell growth while enabling rapid sample processing. By combining these functions, the Mini-Cult eliminates the need for culture transfers between devices—one of the primary sources of contamination. Its space-saving design enhances laboratory efficiency, and the integrated fume hood offers continuous protection against airborne contaminants.

  abstract     = {Intraoperative cardiovascular surgery demands fast and precise decision-making utilizing patient data in real time. Unfortunately, centralized artificial intelligence (AI) models have inherent drawbacks, including high latency, scalability such as low scalability, and privacy related to sharing raw patient data. This study outlines a federated learning (FL)-powered real-time decision support system (FDSS) capable of functioning over multiple distributed surgical nodes while ensuring the privacy of patient information. We developed a federated real-time surgical decision support (FRSDS) algorithm, which embodies the operational logic of the FDSS framework. The FDSS includes individual model training at the edge, differentially private updates, secure aggregation using Federated Averaging (FedAvg), and real-time inference at the surgical site. The framework was evaluated under multicenter cardiovascular datasets. We assess performance through accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and system performance is assessed through latency and communication overhead. FDSS achieved 95.4% accuracy, 94.6% sensitivity, 95.0% specificity, 93.2% precision, and an AUC-ROC of 0.98. The averages exceeded those of centralized and baseline FL benchmark models. The average inference latency in real time was 120 ms, which is appropriate for intraoperative use. The expected convergence was very strong; communication overhead was lessened with top-k gradient compression, and differential privacy was maintained with ( ∈ = 1 . 2 , δ = 1 0 − 5 ) protection. The system proposed with the FDSS framework is an inoperative cardiovascular care option for supporting surgical performance that preserves patient privacy. And, because no raw patient data is transferred internally with the system, the FRSDS algorithm provides rapid inference and enables real-time, scalable decision-support policymaking capability even in intraoperative circumstances poised with patient risk.},

This article aims to improve the limitations of MAFFT in solving the MSA problem by using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to enhance the quality of the iterative search. To this end, a new three-objective model is defined, and a novel MOEA is proposed to optimize this model. Four mutation and two crossover operators are designed to generate promising offspring individuals during the evolutionary process. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, computational experiments are conducted on 60 instances randomly selected from the BAliBASE 3.0 database. The results show that the proposed method can improve the quality of the iterative search and output alignment of MAFFT in terms of the Q and TC metric scores.

  abstract     = {Segmentation of brain tumors in low-quality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains a challenge, especially in resource-limited regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. Variations in MRI data quality lead to poor model generalization, and low-quality data is difficult to acquire and annotate. To address these issues, this article proposes a few-shot cross-domain segmentation model, BrainAdaptNet, aimed at improving segmentation performance from high-quality to low-quality MRI. BrainAdaptNet uses DinoV2 as a self-supervised feature extraction backbone, enhancing dataset adaptability through contrastive learning and simulating image quality degradation with wavelet transform style transfer to improve the model’s robustness to changes in image distribution. In the data preprocessing phase, CutMix augmentation is introduced for feature fusion, reducing the distribution gap between source and target data. Additionally, a task-adaptive cross-attention (TACA) feature transformation module is designed to further enhance the interaction and alignment of features between the support and query sets, optimizing segmentation performance under few-shot conditions. To rigorously evaluate the proposed method, fivefold cross-validation was conducted on data migration tasks with BraTS 2021 and BraTS 2020 as the source domains and BraTS Africa as the target domain. Experimental results show that, compared to the baseline model PATNet, BrainAdaptNet achieved a 1.5–2.0 percentage point improvement in the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and a 4.8–5.2 percentage point reduction in Hausdorff distance (HD95) in cross-dataset segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of BrainAdaptNet on low-quality MRI data.},

  abstract     = {Background and Objectives: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a prevalent malignant hematologic tumor with no current cure, highlighting the pressing need for novel drug development. Biochemical approaches to drug development involve extensive and costly biological experiments, underscoring the urgency to integrate new technologies for enhanced efficiency. Materials and Methods: This article presents a mathematical model to assess MM drug efficacy, aiming to guide drug development strategies and improve drug development efficiency. The model employs ordinary differential equations to simulate interactions among osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and MM cells within the bone microenvironment, as well as changes in the NF- κ B and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways post-MM invasion. Our study investigates the role of the first-line drugs denosumab and bisphosphonates, which are clinical treatments for bone-related complications caused by MM, and compares the effects of the drugs DTP3 and Japonicone A (JA), currently under development for the treatment of MM. Results: Our findings regarding denosumab align with existing experimental data, thus validating the model. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that denosumab exhibits the same anti-MM effect as bisphosphonates but reveals that denosumab acts more quickly due to its direct action on RANKL through monoclonal antibodies, whereas bisphosphonates act more slowly by targeting osteoclasts. Additionally, both DTP3 and JA effectively inhibit MM cell proliferation, positioning them as potential therapeutic agents, with DTP3 displaying superior efficacy compared to JA. Conclusions: We utilize mathematical models as alternatives to biological models to investigate the effects of drugs. These models not only elucidate the mechanisms of action of clinically used medications but also enhance our understanding of drug utilization, providing valuable guidance for physicians in their decision-making. Additionally, for drugs in development, these models can assess both efficacy and side effects, informing the drug development process. They also facilitate comparisons between different drugs to identify less effective options, thereby reducing costs. For example, in the case of DTP3 and JA, where DTP3 proves superior, the models help reduce research and development (R&D) costs associated with JA, saving both resources and time.},

  abstract     = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare systems holds transformative potential to redefine healthcare delivery and accelerate progress toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the socioeconomic and ethical implications of AI adoption remain underexplored, particularly in real-world deployment contexts. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining AI’s impact on healthcare efficiency, cost savings, and workforce dynamics while addressing barriers to equitable access and ethical concerns such as data privacy, transparency, and algorithmic bias. A mixed-methods approach, including statistical modeling, economic analysis, and stakeholder interviews, was employed to evaluate AI’s potential to enhance healthcare delivery and mitigate disparities. Key findings demonstrate AI’s capacity to improve health outcomes, drive economic growth, and optimize resource allocation but underscore the need for robust governance frameworks to ensure ethical and inclusive AI adoption. These insights offer actionable recommendations for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and technology developers seeking to harness AI for sustainable healthcare transformation.},

  abstract     = {The eradication of Triatoma infestans and similar vector species has been the focus of the fight against Chagas disease for several decades. The standard control method continues to be the fumigation with pyrethroids, which has led to the emergence of resistant bug populations in many regions of South America and, especially, in the Gran Chaco. It is therefore essential to develop alternative methods of T. infestans control. Paint with microcapsules containing organophosphate substances has been shown to have a positive impact on the reduction of house infestation. In this study, we investigate the effects of the application of organophosphate-based insecticidal paints on a T. infestans population in a chicken coop, the recovery of this population, and the frequencies of application required to control the insect under realistic conditions. We extended a recently proposed model of all stages of T. infestans populations in chicken coops to include paint-induced mortality. Considering climate and bug migration variations, we find the paint application frequencies that guarantee low levels of infestation. A strong and stable decrease in the triatomine population can be achieved by paint applications separated by 4 years or more. This work, taken together with previous experimental results, strongly suggests that painting with organophosphate microcapsules would be a highly efficient method to control T. infestans in regions where it has developed immunity to pyrethroids.},

The structure is novel based on the silkworm-derived protein, in such a manner as to render its controlled release possible, increasing efficacy and consistency for drugs. Besides, the addition of silk-derived materials in drug formulation can address crucial problems such as drug solubility and site-specific delivery.

  abstract     = {Brucellosis is a prevalent zoonotic infection, primarily in the developing world. Treatment regimens for brucellosis involve multiple medications, including doxycycline (DOX), which regulates the immune system and macrophage activity. Nevertheless, the treatment of Brucella infection is constrained by its presence within macrophages, which exhibit unique anti-immune mechanisms. The internal pathway for DOX against Brucella melitensis and its molecular docking is crucial for targeting macrophages, for enhancing efficacy, and decreasing the dose and time of treatment. Method: This research aimed to accurately predict the targeting efficiency of doxycycline-loaded chitosan alginate (DOX-N) nanoparticles to macrophages. Mannose-decorated chitosan–sodium alginate nanoparticles were chosen for this purpose. In silico analysis was performed to predict the targeting efficacy of the nanocarrier. Result: The study found that Nano DOX and macrophage mannose receptors exhibited binding interactions on their surfaces. The ligand DOX interacted with hydrogen bonds to the macrophage target receptor with a −7.5 kcal/mol interaction and four hydrogen bonds on the mannose receptor of the macrophage. Similarly, sodium alginate exhibited a (−6.2 kcal/mol) docking score, while conventional DOX was (−5.1 kcal/mol). The computational study confirmed that DOX-N has the potential to be a promising lead molecule for regulating the incidence of brucellosis infections. The binding affinity and efficacy of DOX-N loaded on chitosan and sodium alginate were designed and assessed. Conclusion: The results indicated that Nano DOX had a strong affinity for the specific macrophage receptor and specific protein site in B. melitensis .},

The article shares a model of IvE, which includes the establishment and expansion of design studios as hands-on prototyping spaces for technology design, curricular integration of active learning and problem-based learning across engineering departments, and establishment of innovation ecosystem partnerships. Invention Education is a novel, transdisciplinary approach to engineering education that fosters technical innovation, improves health outcomes, and reduces poverty. While global evidence of IvE’s impact in high-income settings is well-documented, few successful models have been developed by and collaboratively created with universities in Africa. Our multi-institutional team, representing institutions from Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, the United States, and Ethiopia, has developed a scalable IvE model designed to empower engineering students in sub-Saharan Africa to solve real-world challenges. This article presents key outcomes of the IvE model, including the establishment of design studios as hubs for innovation, curricular integration of active learning methodologies, and the strengthening of partnerships within local innovation ecosystems. Drawing on 8 years of implementation, this work provides critical insights into the advancement of engineering education and innovation ecosystems in a geographical region that has untapped potential for these models.

It examines relevant studies in the telecommunication sector, with a focus on technologies that enhance connectivity, performance, and innovative applications across industries. The review highlights advancements such as fifth-generation (5G) networks, which offer faster data speeds, lower latency, and increased network capacity, enabling the development of applications like autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. IoT devices are increasingly connecting physical objects, driving innovation in sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing. Edge computing, by enabling real-time processing and reducing latency, supports IoT applications requiring immediate responses. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are being integrated to optimize network resources, improve spectrum management, and facilitate intelligent decision-making. Technologies such as massive multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) enhance spectral efficiency, network capacity, and interference reduction. Millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies are being explored for high-speed wireless communication, enabling multi-gigabit data rates and applications in 5G, wireless backhaul, and ultra-high-definition video streaming. Software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) enable centralized management and greater network flexibility, while beam steering improves signal quality and coverage by directing wireless signals toward specific receivers. Quantum communication, leveraging quantum principles, provides secure communication channels, while quantum key distribution (QKD) ensures data confidentiality. Visible light communication (VLC) utilizes visible light for high-speed data transfer in environments where RF-based communication is not feasible. Despite the potential of these technologies, the article identifies challenges such as limited practical implementation, standardization issues, resource constraints, security and privacy concerns, and sustainability challenges. It concludes by discussing the practical implications of these emerging technologies, including enhanced data transfer speeds, improved network capacity, low-latency communication, IoT connectivity, ubiquitous coverage, industry transformation, and the security and privacy considerations that accompany these advancements.},

  abstract     = {Rapid growth of medical data in both hospitals and healthcare industries has made data handling increasingly challenging. Fast access to relevant medical information in an emergency is essential, but the huge data in databases makes this difficult. The management of data in the public domain is made more difficult by privacy and security concerns, which calls for the creation of a safe data handling system. The primary objective of this research is to propose and implement an intelligent framework, Smart MedDB, for real-time tracking of medical records. The framework highlights privacy and security considerations while addressing the difficulties of managing massive medical databases effectively and providing prompt access to individual patient information. The platform also aims to make e-Token booking with healthcare providers easier and simplify the process of filing health insurance claims. The proposed methodology involves the development and implementation of Smart MedDB, an intelligent framework that employs advanced data handling techniques to ensure quick and secure access to medical records. Patient databases can only be handled or shared by authorized personnel thanks to the integration of authentication measures. Smart MedDB makes use of state-of-the-art protocols and technology to automate the health insurance claim procedure. User experience and system responsiveness are taken into consideration while evaluating the framework’s qualitative capacity to offer rapid and secure access to medical records. The quantity of medical records increased five times, and then the responsiveness and bandwidth of the present medical data handling system increased to 60 seconds and 1,200 KB. However, the proposed system maintains almost the same level throughout the entire operation since it is stream-based. Metrics including data processing speed, security precautions, and retrieval time are quantified and contrasted with current systems. This framework presents an effective way to expedite medical data access by resolving privacy, security, and efficiency concerns. It ensures prompt and safe retrieval during emergencies and automates associated activities for improved healthcare services.},

The research question is “How is lignin used in drug release?” Within the scope of the study, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Research, PubMed, Google Scholar, etc., the principal accepted indexes in the literature, were used. As a result of scanning these indexes, only 13 out of approximately 30-studies were selected. Keywords chosen as selection criteria: Lignin, extraction methods of lignin, place of lignin in drug release, use of lignin in drug release, materials produced with lignin in drug release. After the selection, the relevant studies were grouped and classified. Even lignin, which is used in different forms for drug release, has also been mentioned. This is a mini-review about the potential for use of lignin in drug release. As a result of the examination, it was understood that there are restrictions on the drug release use of lignin due to the problem of water dissolution. However, it is understood that it is a very suitable material for drug release due to its large amount, easy availability, and biocompatibility. Therefore, at the end of the study, it was recommended that the water-dissolved form of lignin and even the nano-sized form would benefit drug release for researchers who want to work in this field. In this respect, studies on lignin as a natural drug release product will accelerate. It will also be more beneficial for drug release of lignin in nanosize. These suggestions will guide researchers who want to work in this field. In the future, the researchers will study lignin for drug release.},

This scoping review examines how artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in breast surgery for older women with breast cancer over the past decade. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore databases was conducted for studies published between January 2015 and February 2025. Studies were included if they investigated AI applications in breast surgery and provided age-stratified analysis for women aged 65 and above. The findings were thematically analyzed to identify trends and gaps in the field. Six studies met the inclusion criteria and were categorized into two themes: AI-Driven Diagnostics and Risk Prediction (two studies) and AI-Guided Treatment and Decision Support (four studies). Deep learning (DL)- and radiomics-based models demonstrated superior accuracy in predicting axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis (area under curve [AUC] 0.906) compared to traditional clinical models. AI-guided treatment decision support tools showed improved survival outcomes, with one study reporting a 12% lower mortality rate for patients following AI recommendations. However, no studies specifically addressed AI applications in intraoperative decision-making for older women. While AI shows promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning for older women with breast cancer, significant gaps exist, particularly in intraoperative applications. Future research should focus on prospective validation of AI models, standardization of AI development, and investigation of AI’s potential in real-time surgical decision-making for this vulnerable population.},

  abstract     = {Organ-on-a-chip platforms have been widely promoted as imminent replacements for animal research, a theme prominently featured in Science (August 14, 2025, pp. 676–679). This commentary critically examines these claims in light of the current evidence base. While microphysiological systems provide useful adjunctive data, their predictive scope is limited by selective validation, material sorption effects, reliance on nonspecific endpoints, and unverified assumptions about metabolic competence. Economic projections of industry-wide savings rest on optimistic modeling rather than empirical demonstration. Moreover, premature policy initiatives to phase out animal studies risk undermining patient safety. This article argues for cautious integration of new approach methodologies (NAMs) alongside, rather than instead of established animal research, with emphasis on independent multisite validation and global regulatory harmonization.},

  abstract     = {The current investigation is to study the experimental analysis of wear and frictional force behavior on Al6063-T6 with zinc oxide (ZnO) and magnesium (Mg) nanoparticles. ZnO nanoparticles were extracted using Punica granatum peels by a green synthesis process. The extraction process of the nanoparticles was monitored with special temperature, time duration, and care of the extraction of the peels. This technique served as a representation of surface stabilization and a reducing agent for the fabrication of spherical ZnO nanoparticles. The aluminum (6063-T6) was combined with the optimized zinc (Zn) nanoparticles that had been produced. In general, aluminum has a low density and is lightweight, which increases its bearing strength and heat conductivity. The weight fractions of the Mg (1%, 1.5%, and 2.0%) and Zn (1.0%, 2.0%, and 3.0%) nanoparticles were mixed with aluminum. The mechanical properties of aluminum (Al6063-T6) with ZnO and Mg nanoparticles were determined experimentally at various volume fractions. Comparisons were made between the experimental outcomes with and without the addition of nanoparticles to the aluminum. The experimental findings show that Al6063-T6 with Zn and Mg nanoparticles can be employed in applications requiring wear resistance.},

  abstract     = {Previous animatronic faces struggle to express emotions effectively due to hardware and software limitations. On the hardware side, earlier approaches either used rigid-driven mechanisms, which provided precise control but were difficult to design within constrained spaces, or tendon-driven mechanisms, which are more space-efficient but challenging to control. In contrast, we propose a hybrid actuation approach that combines the best of both worlds. The eyes and mouth– key areas for emotional expression — are controlled using rigid mechanisms for precise movement, while the nose and cheek, which convey subtle facial microexpressions, are driven by strings. This design allows us to build a compact yet versatile hardware platform capable of expressing a wide range of emotions. On the algorithmic side, our method introduces a self-modeling network that maps motor actions to facial landmarks, allowing us to automatically establish the relationship between blendshape coefficients for different facial expressions and the corresponding motor control signals through gradient backpropagation. We then train a neural network to map speech input to corresponding blendshape controls. With our method, we can generate distinct emotional expressions such as happiness, fear, disgust, and anger, from any given sentence, each with nuanced, emotion-specific control signals — a feature that has not been demonstrated in earlier systems. We release the hardware design and code at https://github.com/ZZongzheng0918/Morpheus-Hardware and https://github.com/ZZongzheng0918/Morpheus-Software .},

The shape of this experimental world is a torus where squared fields are on the surface. The size can be changed, and any number of beings can be launched into it. There are energy sources and energy sinks in it. The creatures require energy and thus step from field to field to get energy. At the beginning of the process, beings are ignorant. They have no experience, but remember everything that happened to them. During the simulation, we observe the progress, destruction, or rise of the creatures. We examined their knowledge base, and the boom, or extinction of groups, families, and clans. In a completely hostile world, it is impossible to survive, but in a slightly hostile or friendly world, viable populations will certainly develop, that can use their knowledge base to assert themselves. The intelligence appears always if the circumstances are not too hostile and the existing entities can remember events that happened to them.

Tent Map Termite Colony Optimization (TM-TCO) optimizes pathways, whereas Terahertz Quantum Resistant Cryptographic Algorithm (Te-QRCA) guarantees secure data transfer.

Then, the Hierarchical Meta-Curiosity-based Federated Reinforcement Learning (HMC-FRL) classifier is used for anomaly detection. The trained local model is updated on the cloud server.

The process of turning a silkworm into a mature Bombyx mori moth yields peace of silk. Silkworms are more valuable because of their nutritional makeup, which includes vitamins, oils, proteins, minerals, and other beneficial elements. Silkworm diseases constitute a significant threat to the sericulture industry, causing substantial economic losses. However, there were research gaps in the areas of environmental factors and disease outbreaks. Existing diagnostic tools are limited in understanding complex disease interactions related to silkworm rearing. Addressing these research gaps is essential for improving silkworm disease prevention, control, and overall sericulture sustainability. Visual and time-consuming classification methods lead to errors, and it reduces productivity. Transfer learning was implemented for image classification. Gender classification of silkworm pupae using ResNetV2 architecture achieved 97% accuracy. The development of an automated system is done by employing a robotic arm integrated with a camera, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino Uno. A camera coupled with a Raspberry Pi captures high-resolution images of the pupae, subsequently processed for classification. Arduino Uno controls the robotic arm’s movements to classify each silkworm pupa by the category, like male, female or diseased. This automated AI based embedded hardware efficiently classifies the gender of silkworm pupa and hence reduces human intervention. The quality of silk production will be improved.},

This happens due to a lack of comprehensive datasets that capture the complex aspects of crime. This research aims to develop a Multi-modal Generative Adversarial Network (MM-GAN) framework to accurately model complicated synthetic crime data. The goal of MM-GAN, which integrates several GAN architectures, is to provide varied and high-fidelity data depicting many crime elements in a unified model. These features include geographical distribution, temporal patterns, and category information. MM-GAN uses Conditional GANs (cGANs) to regulate the kinds of data produced according to crime characteristics like time, place, and kind. To further enhance the usability of the produced data for model training and guarantee that it properly represents real-world classifications, Auxiliary Classifier GANs (AC-GANs) are included to classify synthetic data. As a data format bridge, CycleGAN allows MM-GAN to represent various sources by facilitating cross-domain conversions between structured and unstructured. The model’s capacity to simulate seasonality and trends is enhanced by adding temporal GAN layers, which allow the model to capture sequential crime patterns. A strong resource for predictive analysis, risk assessment, and simulation training, MM-GAN-generated synthetic data closely matches real crime patterns, according to experiments. This framework provides a user-friendly and privacy-protecting tool for creating enhanced datasets, which is useful for criminology academics and law enforcement authorities. MM-GAN provides a scalable solution via synthetic data simulation to empower secure environments with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven insights and models.},

  abstract     = {Osteoporosis is a progressive skeletal disorder characterized by decreased Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and structural deterioration, leading to an increased risk of fractures. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX), often fail to detect osteoporosis at an early stage due to their limited sensitivity and accessibility. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning (DL), and Machine Learning (ML) have shown significant potential in improving osteoporosis detection. However, existing models face challenges related to data privacy, explainability, computational complexity, and generalizability across diverse populations. This study introduces Federated Graph-based Multimodal Osteoporosis Diagnosis (FGMOD), a novel AI-driven framework that integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced osteoporosis risk assessment. Unlike traditional DL models that rely on centralized training, FL ensures privacy-preserving learning across multiple hospitals and institutions. Simultaneously, GNNs model trabecular bone connectivity, offering deeper insights into microarchitectural changes in osteoporotic bones. Multimodal data fusion, incorporating structured clinical data, DXA scans, and biochemical markers, significantly improves prediction accuracy and interpretability. The proposed FGMOD model was validated on a real-world dataset comprising 10 000 patient records, 5000 DXA scans, and biochemical profiles. Comparative evaluation with state-of-the-art AI models demonstrated superior performance, achieving 94.2% accuracy, 93.4% precision, 93.1% recall, and a ROC-AUC score of 0.96. Unlike CNN-based models, which rely heavily on high-resolution images, FGMOD effectively extracts clinically relevant features from graph-based bone connectivity analysis, ensuring robust and interpretable predictions. Furthermore, the use of SHAP-based feature importance analysis provides clinicians with an explainable AI decision-making process, enhancing trust in the model’s recommendations. Performance comparisons against CNN, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Transfer Learning models revealed that FGMOD outperformed all baselines, particularly in privacy-aware federated training, osteoporosis risk stratification, and real-time inference on edge AI devices. Additionally, FGMOD reduced inference latency to 45 ms per sample, making it suitable for real-time clinical deployment. FGMOD represents a significant advancement in AI-powered osteoporosis detection, addressing key challenges such as privacy, generalizability, and interpretability. Future research should focus on expanding FL collaborations across global hospitals, integrating wearable sensor data for continuous bone health monitoring, and enhancing GNN-based osteoporosis modeling for faster inference on mobile healthcare platforms. This study paves the way for clinically reliable, privacy-preserving, and scalable AI solutions in osteoporosis risk assessment and early detection.},

To address the challenges of inadequate user historical data extraction and the cold start problem inherent in traditional movie recommendation systems, we present a novel personalized movie recommendation model known as “movie recommendation with starring roles and ratings” (MSR). By incorporating a multi-head attention mechanism, the model captures intricate relationships among diverse data fields within users’ viewing records and facilitates the extraction of user features through the basic information-rating joint attention network (BRJA). The gate mechanism efficiently integrates fundamental movie information and average score into the movie representation vector, thereby generating candidate movie features. MSR can effectively provide recommendations even when confronted with limited user information, effectively mitigating the cold start problem. Comparative experiments on the movie lens dataset and ablation experiments focusing on key modules demonstrate the effectiveness of MSR in improving movie recommendations.},

  abstract     = {With the development of machine vision and multimedia technology, posture detection and related algorithms have become widely used in the field of human posture recognition. Traditional video surveillance methods have the disadvantages of slow detection speed, low accuracy, interference from occlusions, and poor real-time performance. This paper proposes a real-time pose detection algorithm based on deep learning, which can effectively perform real-time tracking and detection of single and multiple individuals in different indoor and outdoor environments and at different distances. First, a corresponding pose recognition dataset for complex scenes was created based on the YOLO network. Then, the OpenPose method was used to detect key points of the human body. Finally, the Kalman filter multi-object tracking method was used to predict the state of human targets within the occluded area. Real-time detection of human postures (sitting, stand up, standing, sit down, walking, fall down, and lying down) is achieved with corresponding alarms to ensure the timely detection and processing of emergencies.},

  abstract     = {As a component of the capital market, the stock market plays a very important role in economic development. How to predict the stock price more accurately is the key concern of researchers and investors. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an Informer based method for stock intraday price prediction. Informer based on attention mechanism can efficiently capture precise long-range dependencies between input and output to increase the prediction capacity. In this research, historical K-line data of traditional securities in China’s financial market are collected. Based on this data set, the intraday stock price prediction performance of Informer and Long Short-Term Memory neural network (LSTM) is compared. The experiment also uses the three-day K-line model to perform pattern recognition on the K-line data of candidate stocks. The results show that the prediction performance of Informer is significantly higher than that of LSTM, and the data information after three-day K-line pattern recognition can improve the prediction accuracy of Informer and reduce time and space overhead of Informer.},

To tackle the challenges of insufficient accuracy in image feature extraction and underutilization of visual information, we present a Swin Transformer-based model for image captioning with feature enhancement and multi-stage fusion (Swin-Caption). Initially, the Swin Transformer is employed in the capacity of an encoder for extracting images, while feature enhancement is adopted to gather additional image feature information. Subsequently, a multi-stage image and semantic fusion module is constructed to utilize the semantic information from past time steps. Lastly, a two-layer LSTM is utilized to decode semantic and image data, generating captions. The proposed model outperforms the baseline model in experimental tests and instance analysis on the public datasets Flickr8K, Flickr30K, and MS-COCO.},

  abstract     = {The microservice architecture breaks through the traditional cluster architecture mode based on virtual machines and uses containers as carriers to interact through lightweight communication mechanisms to reduce system coupling and provide more flexible system service support. With the expansion of the system scale, a large number of system logs with complex structures and chaotic relationships are generated. How to accurately analyze the system logs and make efficient fault prediction is particularly important for building a safe and reliable system. By studying neural network technology, this paper proposes an Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM). Combined with the dual channel convolutional neural network model (DCNN), it uses the attention mechanism to explore the differences between dimensional features, realizes multi-dimensional feature fusion, and establishes a BiLSTM-DCNN deep learning model that integrates the attention mechanism. From the perspective of social network analysis, a data preprocessing method is proposed to process fault redundant data and improve the accuracy of fault prediction under Microservices. Compare BiLSTM-DCNN with the mainstream system log analysis machine learning models SVM, CNN and Bi-LSTM, and explore the advantages of BiLSTM-DCNN in processing microservice system log text. The model is applied to simulation data and HDFS data set for experimental comparison, which proves the good generalization ability and universality of BiLSTM-DCNN.},

This paper also empirically analyzes the current situation of domestic private equity investment funds based on BP and Hopfield neural network models, then the results of the two models are compared. It is concluded that the accuracy of the BP neural network model can be more than 90%.

In particular, we point out that the quasi-metaparticle Green’s function interpolates between the canonical quasi-particle Green’s function and the result found in the context of the SYK model, which presents an exactly solvable model without quasiparticles. The linear dependence of resistivity with temperature is reproduced in the SYK limit. Also, the Cooper mechanism is possible in the quasi-metaparticle case. Finally, the new parameter that characterizes quasi-metaparticles can be extracted from ARPES data. Thus, the quasi-metaparticle could be a useful new concept in the study of strange metals and high-temperature superconductivity.},

AB15 indistinguishability obfuscation scheme is the first practical scheme. In order to avoid the ideal generator can be searched, authors of AB15 IO scheme set it to a relatively large size (In fact, such ideal generator should be a “small prime”). It causes the ratio of the standard deviation of Gaussian sampling and the size of ideal generator smaller. We call the ratio as “deviation ratio”. In this paper, we point that direct sampling and smaller deviation ratio makes the scheme insecure. A searching attack can reveal hidden coefficients of original boolean circuit from its obfuscator. Firstly, the attacker searches those level-0 encodings of 0, hoping that the code value is 0. Such event happens with probability 1 2 π σ ∗ or 1 4 π σ ∗ , where σ ∗ as the deviation ratio. By a series of searching, a weak obfuscator with prime module can be obtained. Then, the attacker can obtain all hidden coefficients of original boolean circuit. Take n as the dimension of independent variable, m as the dimension of coefficient of original boolean circuit. For Simple Obfuscator, searching time is 2 n + 2 m , and the probability that one successfully reveals hidden coefficients of original boolean circuit is about n + m 2 4 π σ ∗ ( 1 + 2 ) . For Robust Obfuscator, searching time and success probability are respectively n + m + C n + m 2 and n + m 2 2 π σ ∗ + C n + m 2 2 ( 4 π σ ∗ ) 2 . At last, we present a revised scheme with “conditionally accepted sampling” and smaller deviation ratio. The new scheme avoids above mentioned attack and greatly reduce the size complexity.},

  abstract     = {Since 2013, the Spanish fleet of EF-18 fighters has not received major updates nor any other jet has been proposed for their replacement. Thereby, a decision problem of interest to the Spanish Air Force is addressed in this study. In this regard, a collection of six potential alternatives (Eurofighter Typhoon, F-35 Lightning II, F/A-18 Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, F-15 EX, and Saab 39 Gripen) and 14 criteria (3 of which being qualitative) are evaluated based on expert consensus by a combination of fuzzy logic and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches (AHP-VIKOR/AHP-TOPSIS). The weights of the criteria and the valuation of the qualitative ones (via questionnaires) were made possible by the participation of two independent groups of experts, all of them fighter pilots. Once the extraction of knowledge was carried out via a fuzzy version of a modified AHP, it was found that the two most important criteria (“air superiority over neighbor countries” and “tactical capability”) were qualitative. A comparison between the rankings of the alternatives provided by fuzzy VIKOR and fuzzy TOPSIS approaches highlights that the fuzzy VIKOR ranking appears highly influenced by the most important criteria. On the contrary, fuzzy TOPSIS presents a more compensatory behavior than fuzzy VIKOR. Given the differences observed when comparing such rankings of alternatives, a triple sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure robustness. Our results highlight the Dassault Rafale as the most promising option for replacement. This finding suggests its potential as a benchmark for future fighter selection and next-generation fighter planning.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify undervalued stocks, addressing the limitations of traditional investment strategies that rely heavily on fundamental analysis. As financial markets become more complex, characterized by volatility and information asymmetry, conventional valuation methods often struggle to capture these dynamics. In contrast, ML offers the ability to analyze large datasets and uncover intricate patterns, presenting a data-driven alternative for stock selection and portfolio optimization. A comprehensive predictive framework was developed, integrating traditional financial ratios with novel features derived from value investing principles and technical analysis. Several ML models — Random Forest, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Machines — were assessed for their ability to predict high-return stocks. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, were used to evaluate model effectiveness. Among the models tested, the LSTM demonstrated the highest accuracy at 0.81, proving its robustness in identifying undervalued stocks. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on ML in finance by offering a practical framework that bridges theoretical concepts with real-world applications. The study also emphasizes the importance of refining ML algorithms to improve model interpretability and transparency, crucial for fostering trust in these systems. Future research should explore the use of ensemble methods and alternative data sources to further enhance prediction accuracy, while addressing challenges related to accountability in ML-driven investment strategies. This work advances the conversation around algorithmic trading and the future of data-driven finance.},

  abstract     = {In the domain of association rule mining, evaluating the interestingness of discovered rules plays a crucial role in extracting meaningful patterns. However, the context of interestingness poses challenges that call for improvements in rule evaluation. This study focuses on addressing this problem by enhancing the evaluation of interestingness in ontology-based association rules. In this study, we present the effective rule evaluation using the ontology (EREO) model, which aims to evaluate the interestingness of ontology-based association rules in the context of US birth data. The EREO model incorporates three levels of rule evaluation: the utilization of proposed effective measures, consultation with domain experts, and the utilization of AI-based methods. To indirectly evaluate the interestingness of ontology-based rules, we propose two effective measures: Ontology-based rule specificity (ORS) and ontology-based rule complexity (ORC). Rule evaluation is further facilitated by domain experts and AI-based methods, employing an interestingness measurement scale (IMS). Furthermore, we compare the average interestingness scores obtained from ORS, ORC, and the EREO model with those derived from traditional interestingness measures. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed interestingness measures consistently outperform the traditional ones, as indicated by higher average scores. Additionally, we observe a positive relationship between the interestingness scores obtained using the three levels of the EREO model. Overall, this study effectively showcases the efficacy of ontology-based association rule evaluation in improving the quality of discovered rules and supporting informed decision-making processes.},

To enhance the interactivity and efficiency of credit allocation in multi-agent reinforcement learning, we introduce a credit allocation for interactive multi-agents method (CAIM). CAIM not only considers the effects of various actions on other agents but also leverages attention mechanisms to handle the mismatch between observations and actions. With a unique credit allocation strategy, agents can more precisely assess their contributions during collaboration. Experiments in various adversarial scenarios within the SMAC benchmark environment indicate that CAIM markedly outperforms existing multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches. Further ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each CAIM component. This research presents a new paradigm for enhancing collaboration efficiency and overall performance in MAS.},

In this case, both students and universities face the problem of choosing suitable companies. There is no study in the literature that deals with the solution of this problem. Thus, this study discusses companies’ evaluation and selection for the applied education model. A new hybrid methodology is proposed. The methodology consists of the following activities: determining the evaluation criteria with expert opinions, weighting the criteria with AHP, and ranking the companies with TOPSIS and PROMETHEE. The methodology has been tested in a case study with real data from an industrial university. While TOPSIS is effective for certain criteria, the findings suggest that PROMETHEE may provide more effective results specifically for company evaluations within the applied education model, aligning better with the study’s objectives. The applied education model is expected to yield several key outcomes: For company managers, it will lead to increased efficiency by hiring graduates who already have practical experience. From the educators’ perspective, it will result in the training of graduates who are both experienced and highly employable. For students, the model will enhance their employability aligning their skills with their career aspirations and increasing their chances of employment in companies, that match their competencies and preferences after graduation.},

  abstract     = {Association rule mining is a method for searching databases for patterns or co-occurrences in data. The fundamental step in extracting association rules is mining frequent item sets. However, the itemsets extracted were found to have redundancy in them. This study aims to tackle the redundancy present in the generated association rules and itemsets. One commonly used technique to address redundancy is extracting nonderivable itemsets. The traditional approach in mining such itemsets involved checking for upper and lower bound inequalities by making a breadth-wise search of the dataset. However, this generated many candidate itemsets, increasing the algorithm’s run time and memory consumption. Therefore, it became imperative to develop a technique that addressed these shortcomings. A new approach utilizing a genetic algorithm has been proposed to extract the necessary nonderivable itemsets. To our knowledge, such an approach has not been incorporated so far in extracting nonderivable itemsets. Here operations such as crossover and mutation are applied to generate the required itemsets and this was found to be faster and more efficient in memory in comparison to existing approaches based on distribution and discretization of data. Another problem of pressing concern is the redundancy that prevailed in the association rules that were extracted from the mined itemsets. Traditional approaches involved making repeated scans of the mined collection of association rules to prune out redundant rules. Due to this, the algorithm’s runtime increased. To handle this drawback our work proposes a novel approach based on tree-based pruning to remove redundant association rules. The left and right expansion principles provide the foundation of the tree’s construction. The Minimal Antecedent and Maximal Consequent concepts are used to eliminate redundant rules and produce the necessary set of nonderivable association rules. Based on the findings of this study, it is evident that the suggested method improves run time overall by 48.77% and memory by 35.65%. Concerning metrics such as Precision, Recall, and Accuracy an aggregate improvement of 94.92%, 90.8%, and 91.21% was observed in comparison to existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Trauma patients often face complex health consequences and are at a risk of rapid deterioration. Prioritizing trauma patients in intensive care units (ICUs) is essential for timely intervention. Current prioritization approaches are challenging tasks that involve considering multiple evaluation criteria, trade-offs and criteria importance, thus requiring a robust multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. In this study, we propose a novel MCDM framework for the evaluation and benchmarking of trauma patients on the basis of health control (HC) criteria derived from real trauma data. The framework consists of two main phases. In the first phase, a dataset of adult trauma patients referred to a trauma network in the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom is identified and preprocessed. This dataset covers the period from 15 May 2014 to 16 December 2016, providing continuous monitoring of the patients. In the second phase, MCDM methods are employed to develop a dynamic decision matrix (DM) that assesses 35 trauma patients on the basis of 16 HC trauma criteria. Using 2-tuple spherical fuzzy linguistic numbers with fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (2TSFLNs-FWZIC), the framework ensures accurate weighting of the criteria, with C1=PS14 and C5=NISS receiving the highest weight values (0.062606) and C2=CD3+8+(106/L) receiving the lowest weight value (0.062353). This weighting process is guided by the input and expertise of a panel of five emergency medicine specialists who have experience in trauma patient management. The results indicate that CoCoSo effectively ranks patients from the least critical ( k = 1 . 3 4 8 7 2 5 ) to the most critical cases ( k = 1 . 6 2 2 0 5 3 ) for ICU admission. The proposed framework is evaluated via systematic ranking and sensitivity analysis, providing validation measures for its performance, robustness and reliability.},

Evaluation of IESs is a major part of the implementation of IES projects, while the current evaluations are based on complete information and single decision making. Given this background, this paper studies the IES evaluation with incomplete information and focuses on the group decision. First, the singular value decomposition algorithm is adopted to predict the missing data. Then, when calculating the index weights, a new method based on standard deviation modified unique reference comparison judgment method is proposed, which not only integrates subjective and objective decision information, but also avoids the problem that the combination coefficients of subjective and objective weights cannot be reasonably allocated. Next, on the basis of the comprehensive weights of indexes and normalized evaluation matrix, the weighted evaluation matrix for each expert is constructed, and the expert weights are calculated by genetic algorithm. Finally, the ranking of IES schemes can be realized by integrating expert weights and expert scoring values. Based on the data of IES at a hospital in Henan, the performance of the proposed method is verified experimentally. Experiments results show that the proposed method is reasonable and effective.},

However, in object detection tasks, the residual structures in conventional networks introduce nonspiking operations, posing a critical challenge for SNNs. To address this issue, we propose a multi-layer feature cascade fusion SNN (MFCF-SNN) for object detection. During feature extraction, our novel multi-level cascaded feature extraction module replaces residual connections with cascade operations, eliminating nonspiking computations while enhancing gradient propagation to deeper layers. For downsampling, we introduce a pooling-convolution module that combines max-pooling and spiking convolution, effectively preserving feature information and improving gradient flow. These two modules collectively ensure pure spike-based computation while facilitating deep network training, thereby enhancing detection accuracy. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and SSDD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in advancing SNN-based object detection.},

  abstract     = {Although a variety of deep learning-based methods have been introduced for Salient Object Detection (SOD) to RGB and Depth (RGB-D) images, existing approaches still encounter challenges, including inadequate cross-modal feature fusion, significant errors in saliency estimation due to noise in depth information, and limited model generalization capabilities. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative method for RGB-D SOD, TranSNP-Net, which integrates Nonlinear Spiking Neural P (NSNP) systems with Transformer networks. TranSNP-Net effectively fuses RGB and depth features by introducing an enhanced feature fusion module (SNPFusion) and an attention mechanism. Unlike traditional methods, TranSNP-Net leverages fine-tuned Swin (shifted window transformer) as its backbone network, significantly improving the model’s generalization performance. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical feature decoder (SNP-D) notably enhances accuracy in complex scenes where depth noise is prevalent. According to the experimental findings, the mean scores for the four metrics S-measure, F-measure, E-measure and MEA on the six RGB-D benchmark datasets are 0.9328, 0.9356, 0.9558 and 0.0288. TranSNP-Net achieves superior performance compared to 14 leading methods in six RGB-D benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Thermal and RGB images exhibit significant differences in information representation, especially in low-light or nighttime environments. Thermal images provide temperature information, complementing the RGB images by restoring details and contextual information. However, the spatial discrepancy between different modalities in RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation tasks complicates the process of multimodal feature fusion, leading to a loss of spatial contextual information and limited model performance. This paper proposes a channel-space fusion nonlinear spiking neural P system model network (CSPM-SNPNet) to address these challenges. This paper designs a novel color-thermal image fusion module to effectively integrate features from both modalities. During decoding, a nonlinear spiking neural P system is introduced to enhance multi-channel information extraction through the convolution of spiking neural P systems (ConvSNP) operations, fully restoring features learned in the encoder. Experimental results on public datasets MFNet and PST900 demonstrate that CSPM-SNPNet significantly improves segmentation performance. Compared with the existing methods, CSPM-SNPNet achieves a 0.5% improvement in mIOU on MFNet and 1.8% on PST900, showcasing its effectiveness in complex scenes.},

The model consists of three interacting layers of Hodgkin–Huxley–Mainen spiking neurons with excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections. Information patterns are stored in memory using a symmetric Hebbian matrix and can be retrieved in response to a specific stimulus pattern. Binary images are encoded using in-phase and anti-phase oscillations relative to a global clock signal. Utilizing the phase-locking effect allows for cluster synchronization of neurons (both on the input and output layers). Interneurons in the intermediate layer filter signal propagation pathways depending on the context of the input layer, effectively engaging only a portion of the synaptic connections within the Hebbian matrix for recognition. The stability of the oscillation phase is investigated for both in-phase and anti-phase synchronization modes when recognizing direct and inverse images. This context-dependent effect opens promising avenues for the development of analog hardware circuits for energy-efficient neurocomputing applications, potentially leading to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and cognitive computing.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer (BC) is the second most frequent malignancy, accounting for roughly 25% of all cases of cancer. BC is caused by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, and their interaction too. The diagnosis of a BC is a critical step in the treatment process, and histopathological imaging is required to determine the type of illness. Identifying a disease is an important stage in the treatment process. However, this time-consuming task is exhausting, and people are prone to making mistakes that go unnoticed, making it difficult to determine the severity of the condition and this diagnosing step also relies on a pathologist’s expertise. In this paper, we have developed a novel BC with microscopic biopsy images network (BC-MBINet) model using deep convolutional neural networks. Feature extraction is handled by a sequence of convolutional layers, nonlinearity is handled using LeakyReLU activations, and learning is stabilized by batch normalization. A last Softmax layer is employed for binary classification into benign and malignant tumors, and dropout layers are included to decrease overfitting. The model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and resilience in discriminating BC types by being trained on a publically available dataset of microscopic biopsy images. The proposed model is capable of classifying between the benign and malignant BC tumors with 99.04% accuracy. The model gives state-of-the-art results in its accuracy in classifying BC tumors into Benign or Malignant.},

Traditional machine learning (ML) models struggle with feature redundancy, data imbalance, and suboptimal performance due to inefficient feature selection and lack of robust deep learning (DL) architectures. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Cardiovascular Disease Stage Classification via the Mamdani Fuzzy-based Modified Mobile Network (CVD-M 3 Net) by integrating hybrid feature selection, DL network and Fuzzy logic for improved CVD stage classification. The proposed CVD-M 3 Net utilizes data from multiple sources including Cleveland, MIMIC-IV, UK Biobank, Statlog, Switzerland, Hungary, and VA Long Beach datasets. The Boruta-LASSO and Fast ICA techniques are used for feature selection by ensuring the retention of critical diagnostic attributes while eliminating irrelevant ones. The selected features undergo Z -score normalization for improved data consistency between the 15 features. The Modified MobileNet (MOMO-Net) is introduced with the integration of 1D convolutional and transformer layers in the MobileNet structure to categorize the tabular data for real-time CVD stage detection. The proposed CVD-M 3 Net utilizes the Mamdani fuzzy inference system (FIS) with a trapezoidal membership function to predict the CVD Stage Score (CSS). The efficiency of the proposed CVD-M 3 Net was estimated with the Accuracy, Sensitivity, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. From the experimental analysis, the proposed CVD-M 3 Net achieves an overall accuracy of 98.61% for efficient classification of CVD stages. The proposed CVD-M 3 Net increases the accuracy by 0.11%, 0.62%, 3.25%, and 0.38% better than ML algorithms, O-SBGC-LSTM, MaLCaDD, and DL-based CNN, respectively.},

  abstract     = {To make informed clinical decisions and plan successful treatments, it is essential that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identify and diagnose brain tumors accurately. This research introduces a new method for multi-stage tumor detection and classification that uses a hybrid classifier (HC) to improve the accuracy of diagnoses. The first step of the suggested method is to identify possible tumor areas by obtaining features from grey-scale intensity analysis of successive pixels, which captures important differences. A systematic categorization technique relates these traits to distinct tumor stages. The HC uses rectilinear classifiers to analyze linear pixel changes and expanded classifiers to find bounded edges within regional pixel distributions. With this two-pronged strategy, tumors of any shape or size may be detected. Training classifiers on datasets with restricted edge characteristics and linear variation patterns allows for exact stage distinction, which is essential for learning. Compared to traditional classification approaches, the multi-stage framework greatly improves the capacity to detect complicated and nuanced tumor traits. Our powerful diagnostic approach permits precise and effective tumor identification and stage categorization to facilitate prompt treatments. The hybrid technique highlights its promise as a dependable, scalable solution to improve patient outcomes in medical imaging applications and advance brain tumor diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Traditional content-based image retrieval (CBIR) searches a database for pictures that match a single, unannotated query image. A comprehensive (or worldwide) perspective of the picture is essential for this kind of search. However, the intended picture content is frequently not global rather regional. Computer vision, pattern recognition, and CBIR are just a few of the applications that have long faced the “semantic gap” issue: how to bridge the gap between human perception of low-level semantic concepts and machine collection of high-level image pixels. In light of the recent achievements in deep learning research, there is hope for bridging the semantic gap. Therefore, the deep learning-assisted localized content-based image retrieval framework (DL-LCBIRF) was suggested in this study to rank photos in the database according to a similarity metric dependent upon specific areas inside the image. The first layer consists of “generic” descriptors that stand in for groups of feature vectors that are comparable and rotationally invariant. The combined probability of the frequencies of the “generic” descriptions over neighborhoods makes up the second layer. The proposed DL-LCBIR uses labelled images combined with a multiple-instance learning algorithm (MILA) to locate the target item and adjust the feature weights. This multi-modal probability is shown as a collection of “spatial frequency” clusters. It augments rotationally invariant statistical spatial constraints. In addition to enhancing the model’s performance, choosing a unique structure determines the model’s distinguishing features, which are common in good cases and seldom in negative ones.},

  abstract     = {The card game Dou Di Zhu (competitive two-against-one game) presents a challenging multiplayer imperfect-information game problem due to its large action space. We developed a deep Monte Carlo (DMC) reinforcement learning (RL) framework called ASP-DouZero, which employs dynamic programming (DP) to prune the action space effectively, using statistical analysis results. The pruned action space was then applied to self-play data generation and neural network decision processes. We evaluated ASP-DouZero against the state-of-the-art DouZero framework under identical training conditions. Results showed the proposed approach achieved a 5% higher win rate in standardized matches after convergence while requiring 50% less training time on equivalent hardware. These findings demonstrate that action space pruning significantly improves decision-making performance and training efficiency in DMC-based approaches for Dou Di Zhu.},

  abstract     = {Real-time object detection in aerial videos captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) plays a vital role in applications such as traffic surveillance, disaster response, and intelligent aerial operations. However, deploying deep learning models directly on UAV platforms faces significant challenges due to limited onboard computing capabilities and strict power constraints imposed by the aircraft’s propulsion system. The efficiency of the detection algorithm directly impacts not only processing latency but also the energy consumption and endurance of the UAVs flight dynamics. To address these challenges, this paper presents UAVDet, a lightweight object detection framework optimized for edge-deployed UAVs operating under propulsion-aware constraints. UAVDet comprises three modules: a Multi-Scale Lightweight Backbone (MSLB) for efficient multi-resolution feature extraction, a Temporal-Consistent Feature Alignment (TCFA) module that enhances inter-frame stability under aerial motion, and an Adaptive Context Enhancement Head (ACEH) for spatially and semantically precise detection. Extensive experiments on a custom UAV dataset demonstrate that UAVDet achieves a superior balance between detection accuracy and runtime efficiency. Moreover, its low computational overhead supports deployment on energy-constrained UAV platforms, reducing the burden on the propulsion system and enabling longer, smarter missions.},

However, the subterranean environment is often complex and prone to unexpected obstacles, particularly pedestrians, which pose substantial safety risks. To mitigate these risks, we developed an automated collision avoidance system. Additionally, we established an information network enabling real-time map tracking of UUVs to facilitate efficient dispatch and operation. Advanced deep learning algorithms detect tracks, obstacles, and pedestrians. Within the track detection zone, the system employs the Hough transform to identify line segments. These segments are then assigned weighting factors based on clarity, clustering, and fitting techniques, enabling accurate reconstruction of the track’s left and right boundaries. Furthermore, a defined safety zone effectively assesses the distance between pedestrians and vehicles. In practical operation, UUVs autonomously trigger audible alarms or initiate braking when pedestrians enter a critical proximity, when other UUVs obstruct the roadway, or when vehicles approach from the opposite direction. This integrated system significantly enhances safety for underground coal mine transportation.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous advancement of computer vision, human–computer interaction, and intelligent sensing technologies, accurate line-of-sight (LOS) tracking has become a critical research topic. However, traditional gaze tracking systems face significant limitations under conditions of natural head movement. The direction of human vision is determined jointly by head posture and eye movement, and precise acquisition of head pose remains a key challenge in gaze tracking technology. To address the limitations imposed by head movement, this study aims to improve the robustness of gaze tracking in natural interaction scenarios. This paper proposes a novel head pose estimation method based on the 3D spatial information of facial feature points. The method utilizes stereo vision to reconstruct 3D feature points and employs a geometric model to calculate head pose, effectively decoupling head movement from eye movement in gaze tracking. In the experimental setup, two interaction modalities were tested: head pointing combined with key pressing, and gaze estimation combined with head pointing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves interaction latency between 100 ms and 200 ms, with a fast capture success rate of up to 85%, slightly outperforming traditional visual target acquisition algorithms. These results indicate the method’s superior responsiveness and stability under natural head movement conditions. The research provides an important technical foundation for achieving natural, efficient human–computer interaction in complex environments.},

However, it can be affected by pollution, weakened immunity, and unhealthy lifestyles, leading to various skin diseases. Early detection of these conditions is crucial for timely treatment and better outcomes. Existing research has often overlooked skin diseases with similar visual characteristics, making it challenging to distinguish between different conditions using visual inspection alone. To address this, the paper proposes an AI-enabled prediction framework for skin disease prediction using EN-QNN and Grad-CAM. Initially, the images are collected using IoMT devices of skin diseases and undergo preprocessing, which includes resizing, noise removal and contrast enhancement using AK-CLAHE, followed by color analysis and segmentation using YCbCr and DF-U-Net. Morphological operations are then applied during post-processing. The shape and structure of lesions are analyzed using CMED. Meanwhile, using Grad-CAM, Contextual Information Analysis (CIA) is performed on preprocessed data. Concurrently, disease symptom prediction data (i.e. clinical data) are collected, and features are extracted from this data, including boundary localization and CIA. Finally, skin diseases are classified using EN-QNN. The proposed model achieved a high accuracy of 98.68051%, surpassing current techniques.},

  abstract     = {As software complexity increases, integrating vulnerability detection becomes essential to ensure the security and integrity of modern systems. Traditional static and dynamic analysis methods face limitations in efficiency and accuracy, particularly for large-scale vulnerability detection, while existing deep learning methods struggle to fully capture structural information and dependencies in code, leading to incomplete identification of vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose VulEPEDE, an innovative function-level vulnerability detection method. VulEPEDE leverages Program Dependency Graphs (PDG) to represent function code and constructs a Vulnerability Semantic Dependency Graph (VSDG) using slicing techniques, introducing function parameter nodes as slicing candidates to capture more comprehensive vulnerability trigger chains. It integrates two core modules: the Enhanced Positional Encoding (EPE) module and the Dependency Embedding (DE) module. The EPE module combines node attribute encoding with positional encoding using a Transformer and multi-head attention mechanism to capture complex features and contextual semantics of code, while the DE module learns dependency embeddings between code nodes through convolutional neural networks. We evaluate VulEPEDE on three widely used datasets, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that VulEPEDE outperforms the best baseline methods by 1.66%, 17.54%, and 28.96% in F1-score across the three datasets, with considerable computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {During the new era of technology with unusual image forging equipment and procedures, digital imaging has become basic. Digital images cannot even be used as evidence anywhere, since it is widely recognized that they may be faked. In order to assist in relieving such derelictions, the problem is examined in an incomprehensible manner. In the digital era, copy-move and splicing of images to produce a fabricated one are commonplace. While the latter entails combining two images to drastically alter the original and produce a new, forged image, copy-move entails copying a portion of the image and pasting it onto another portion of the image. Therefore, to address the limitation of the existing model, a novel hybrid Deep Learning (DL) model is developed. To enhance image details before detecting a tampered image, high pass filtering is employed. The high pass filter might reveal information that has emerged due to the tampered image. To extract the visual semantic features and statistical features, Attention-based Residual Network (AttResNet) and Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) are utilized. An Attention-based Feature Fusion (AttFF) module is used to fuse the extracted features. A Dual Branch Deep Stacked Convolutional Network (DB-DSCN) is employed to classify the tampered image. The experimental results of the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 98.26%, a precision of 96.28%, a recall of 95.98% and an F 1-score of 96%. The proposed model seems to be a superior model for detecting tampered images compared to existing models. It acquired higher accuracy than other existing models. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F 1-score, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The Poisson regression model is widely used in statistical data modeling in diverse fields, such as epidemiology, economics, engineering, and sports. Its popularity stems from its ability to effectively describe the relationship between a statistical response variable and a set of explanatory variables. However, multicollinearity among predictors and outliers in the data can severely affect the reliability of parameter estimation, leading to inflated variances and biased results. Multicollinearity increases the sensitivity of estimators to small changes in the data, while outliers can disproportionately affect the model fit, especially in the maximum likelihood estimation framework. To address these issues, robust biased estimation techniques, such as the ridge estimator and modified ridge-type estimator, have been introduced to mitigate multicollinearity by introducing shrinkage parameters. However, the transformed M-estimator remains sensitive to outliers. In this study, we propose robust and non-robust modified Liu estimators for the Poisson regression model. The non-robust method reduces the effect of multicollinearity by developing a Liu estimator, while the proposed robust method combines transformed M-estimation with a modified form of the Liu estimator to simultaneously address multicollinearity and reduce the influence of outliers. We derive the theoretical properties of the estimators and investigate their performance through extended Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate that the non-robust modified Liu estimator provides more stable and accurate estimates than maximum likelihood estimation, ridge estimator, and modified ridge-type estimators in the case of multicollinearity, but the robust version of the modified Liu estimator generally outperforms, especially in the presence of both multicollinearity and outliers. We also analyze a real-world dataset to demonstrate the practical value of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Due to the widespread increase of online reviews, sentiment classification is now a fascinating study in both academic and industrial research. Annotated training data is difficult to obtain, so reviews help in many domains. Numerous methods have been created for sentiment classification, but the process of retrieving information is not exact, less effective, and has a slower rate of convergence. To overcome these problems, this research proposes and evaluates a novel technique for information retrieval and sentiment classification called Dynamically Stabilized Recurrent Neural Network Optimized with Binary Emperor Penguin Optimization Algorithm (SCIR-DSRNN-BEPOA). This approach seeks to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of sentiment analysis by integrating advanced optimization techniques and also to address the challenges such as slow convergence and inefficiency in sentiment analysis, ultimately achieving superior performance metrics. The input data is gathered through Amazon unlocked mobile reviews database and telecom tweets for sentiment categorization with information retrieval. Afterward, the data is fed to the preprocessing. By using the Unscented Trainable Kalman Filter, the preprocessing process removes noise from reviews by fixing typos and removing ellipsis. These pre-processed data is fed to Adaptive and Concise Empirical Wavelet Transform (ACEWT) to extract the features, such as elongated words, punctuation, hash tag, numerical values. The extracted features are given to the DSRNN which classifies the sentiment, like neutral, positive and negative. In general, DSRNN does not show any optimization adaption methods to determine the optimum parameter to offer accurate sentiment classification. Therefore, Binary Emperor Penguin Optimization Algorithm (BEPOA) is proposed to optimize the DSRNN classifier that categorizes the sentiment precisely. Attention Enhanced Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (AETGCN) method is used to extract the necessary review. The proposed SCIR-DSRNN-BEPOA is implemented in MATLAB. To classify the sentiment, the performance metrics, like Precision, Accuracy, F1-score, Recall (Sensitivity), Specificity, Error rate, Computation time, False Alarm Rate, RoC is considered. The performance of the SCIR-DSRNN-BEPOA approach attains 20.11%, 21.12%, 27.73% higher accuracy, 11.13%, 23.04%, 9.51% lesser computation time, 15.29%, 19.43%, 12.45% greater ROC, 28.65%, 23.98%, 27.03% lower false alarm rate when compared with existing methods: Deep Learning improved spider monkey crow optimization algorithm for sentiment analysis and information recovery (SCIR-DRNN), Deep Learning topical level sentiment analysis of social media data (SCIR-LSTM), and a machine learning-based term weighting and feature selection strategy for sentiment analysis of online product evaluations (SCIR-ENN).},

  abstract     = {In recent days, e-commerce platforms have grown at an unexpected level worldwide. These sites usually rely on recommendation algorithms, which employ user terms to identify related goods or products. Most e-commerce applications are based on customer reviews, which are knowledge-based recommendations. Moreover, customers wish for an interactive platform to buy their needs, where interactions increase interest. In general, recommendations based on images that solve the interaction problem are rarely studied in the literature. Hence, the proposed paper focuses on an Image-Based Recommendation System using Deep Feature Extraction and Ensemble Machine Learning Approach. In the technique, initially, the image is pre-processed by removing the background using Adaptive Otsu thresholding-based segmentation. Secondly, the Stacked ResNET pyramid dilated convolution (PDC-ResNET) model is employed to extract the high-level features from the images. The extracted features are then selected using Binary Hunger Games search optimization (BHGO). Lastly, the product’s class or kind is categorized using a voting-based Ensemble of AdaBoost XG-Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (AX-BDT). There are two main levels in the suggested recommendation system: Level 1 and Level 2. The suggested model determines the product’s class and category at Level 1. The suggested recommendation algorithm in Level 2 retrieves products that are closely matched and similar. Two datasets, the Fashion product dataset and the Amazon product dataset, are used to assess the suggested approach. In the fashion product dataset, the proposed model results in 96.99% accuracy. In the Amazon product dataset, the proposed model results in 97.94% accuracy.},

  abstract     = {As an alternative model to the data envelopment analysis (DEA), the free disposal hull (FDH) model has excellent performance in measuring decision making unit (DMU) efficiency under the condition that the production possibilities do not satisfy the convexity assumption. However, in actual production and life, many data are difficult to collect and cannot obtain accurate values, such as carbon dioxide emissions. In the case of imprecise data, the FDH model cannot evaluate the efficiency of DMU. In this context, a new uncertain FDH model based on uncertainty theory is proposed. In this paper, the uncertain FDH model is solved precisely by means of the uncertain chance constraint method and the expected value method. Finally, an application example of measuring the efficiency of 30 banks in China in 2019 is given to documenting the feasibility of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of the stock market is still a complicated task to pursue in the field of machine learning as it relies on previous and past data, which is generally unstable and noisy. Existing methods of predicting the stock market are usually supervised approaches in which the prior labeling of the data as negative as well as positive moments is necessary to provide accurate results. However, this method of training the machine learning algorithms is complicated as it is vulnerable to overfitting issues as the behavior of the market usually relies on certain constraints like political events, marketing trends, and so on. The functioning of the actual portfolio optimization framework can be enhanced by fusing the return prediction in the conventional time series systems in the process of generating portfolios. Thus, the implementation of a better portfolio optimization system, which has a return prediction system integrated along with making the investors obtain more stable profits, is the major goal of this work. The modeling of the return forecasting model initially begins with the gathering of past stock marketing data. Then, the returns are estimated with the development of the Serial Cascaded Deep Residual Networks (SCDRN), where the deep learning models are utilized for predicting the future return of each stock. The risk level of each stock is also determined during the return prediction process. Then, with the aid of the developed optimization strategy named Enhanced Heap-based optimizer (EHO), the optimal portfolio is formulated, where the up-to-date market conditions are captured to rebalance the portfolio. The optimal selection of asset trading systems functions on the basis of the Sharpe ratio, and it maximizes the profit relative to the risk taken. An extensive analysis is executed to test the efficacy of the proposed portfolio optimization model regarding several baseline works with heuristic strategies.},

  abstract     = {Neural operators (NOs) employ deep neural networks to learn the mappings between infinitedimensional function spaces. Deep operator network (DeepONet), a popular NO architecture, has demonstrated success in the real-time prediction of complex dynamics across various scientific and engineering applications. In this work, we introduce a random sampling technique to be adopted during the training of DeepONet, aimed at improving the generalization ability of the model, while significantly reducing the computational time. The proposed approach targets the trunk network of the DeepONet model that outputs the basis functions corresponding to the spatiotemporal locations of the bounded domain on which the physical system is defined. While constructing the loss function, DeepONet training traditionally considers a uniform grid of spatiotemporal points at which all the output functions are evaluated for each iteration. This approach leads to a larger batch size, resulting in poor generalization and increased memory demands, due to the limitations of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer. The proposed random sampling over the inputs of the trunk net mitigates these challenges, improving generalization and reducing the memory requirements during training, resulting in significant computational gains. We validate our hypothesis through three benchmark examples, demonstrating substantial reductions in training time while achieving comparable or lower overall test errors relative to the traditional training approach. Our results indicate that incorporating randomization in the trunk network inputs during training enhances the efficiency and robustness of DeepONet, offering a promising avenue for improving the framework’s performance in modeling complex physical systems.},
