  abstract     = {The Poisson regression model is widely used in statistical data modeling in diverse fields, such as epidemiology, economics, engineering, and sports. Its popularity stems from its ability to effectively describe the relationship between a statistical response variable and a set of explanatory variables. However, multicollinearity among predictors and outliers in the data can severely affect the reliability of parameter estimation, leading to inflated variances and biased results. Multicollinearity increases the sensitivity of estimators to small changes in the data, while outliers can disproportionately affect the model fit, especially in the maximum likelihood estimation framework. To address these issues, robust biased estimation techniques, such as the ridge estimator and modified ridge-type estimator, have been introduced to mitigate multicollinearity by introducing shrinkage parameters. However, the transformed M-estimator remains sensitive to outliers. In this study, we propose robust and non-robust modified Liu estimators for the Poisson regression model. The non-robust method reduces the effect of multicollinearity by developing a Liu estimator, while the proposed robust method combines transformed M-estimation with a modified form of the Liu estimator to simultaneously address multicollinearity and reduce the influence of outliers. We derive the theoretical properties of the estimators and investigate their performance through extended Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate that the non-robust modified Liu estimator provides more stable and accurate estimates than maximum likelihood estimation, ridge estimator, and modified ridge-type estimators in the case of multicollinearity, but the robust version of the modified Liu estimator generally outperforms, especially in the presence of both multicollinearity and outliers. We also analyze a real-world dataset to demonstrate the practical value of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Due to the widespread increase of online reviews, sentiment classification is now a fascinating study in both academic and industrial research. Annotated training data is difficult to obtain, so reviews help in many domains. Numerous methods have been created for sentiment classification, but the process of retrieving information is not exact, less effective, and has a slower rate of convergence. To overcome these problems, this research proposes and evaluates a novel technique for information retrieval and sentiment classification called Dynamically Stabilized Recurrent Neural Network Optimized with Binary Emperor Penguin Optimization Algorithm (SCIR-DSRNN-BEPOA). This approach seeks to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of sentiment analysis by integrating advanced optimization techniques and also to address the challenges such as slow convergence and inefficiency in sentiment analysis, ultimately achieving superior performance metrics. The input data is gathered through Amazon unlocked mobile reviews database and telecom tweets for sentiment categorization with information retrieval. Afterward, the data is fed to the preprocessing. By using the Unscented Trainable Kalman Filter, the preprocessing process removes noise from reviews by fixing typos and removing ellipsis. These pre-processed data is fed to Adaptive and Concise Empirical Wavelet Transform (ACEWT) to extract the features, such as elongated words, punctuation, hash tag, numerical values. The extracted features are given to the DSRNN which classifies the sentiment, like neutral, positive and negative. In general, DSRNN does not show any optimization adaption methods to determine the optimum parameter to offer accurate sentiment classification. Therefore, Binary Emperor Penguin Optimization Algorithm (BEPOA) is proposed to optimize the DSRNN classifier that categorizes the sentiment precisely. Attention Enhanced Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (AETGCN) method is used to extract the necessary review. The proposed SCIR-DSRNN-BEPOA is implemented in MATLAB. To classify the sentiment, the performance metrics, like Precision, Accuracy, F1-score, Recall (Sensitivity), Specificity, Error rate, Computation time, False Alarm Rate, RoC is considered. The performance of the SCIR-DSRNN-BEPOA approach attains 20.11%, 21.12%, 27.73% higher accuracy, 11.13%, 23.04%, 9.51% lesser computation time, 15.29%, 19.43%, 12.45% greater ROC, 28.65%, 23.98%, 27.03% lower false alarm rate when compared with existing methods: Deep Learning improved spider monkey crow optimization algorithm for sentiment analysis and information recovery (SCIR-DRNN), Deep Learning topical level sentiment analysis of social media data (SCIR-LSTM), and a machine learning-based term weighting and feature selection strategy for sentiment analysis of online product evaluations (SCIR-ENN).},

  abstract     = {In recent days, e-commerce platforms have grown at an unexpected level worldwide. These sites usually rely on recommendation algorithms, which employ user terms to identify related goods or products. Most e-commerce applications are based on customer reviews, which are knowledge-based recommendations. Moreover, customers wish for an interactive platform to buy their needs, where interactions increase interest. In general, recommendations based on images that solve the interaction problem are rarely studied in the literature. Hence, the proposed paper focuses on an Image-Based Recommendation System using Deep Feature Extraction and Ensemble Machine Learning Approach. In the technique, initially, the image is pre-processed by removing the background using Adaptive Otsu thresholding-based segmentation. Secondly, the Stacked ResNET pyramid dilated convolution (PDC-ResNET) model is employed to extract the high-level features from the images. The extracted features are then selected using Binary Hunger Games search optimization (BHGO). Lastly, the product’s class or kind is categorized using a voting-based Ensemble of AdaBoost XG-Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (AX-BDT). There are two main levels in the suggested recommendation system: Level 1 and Level 2. The suggested model determines the product’s class and category at Level 1. The suggested recommendation algorithm in Level 2 retrieves products that are closely matched and similar. Two datasets, the Fashion product dataset and the Amazon product dataset, are used to assess the suggested approach. In the fashion product dataset, the proposed model results in 96.99% accuracy. In the Amazon product dataset, the proposed model results in 97.94% accuracy.},

  abstract     = {As an alternative model to the data envelopment analysis (DEA), the free disposal hull (FDH) model has excellent performance in measuring decision making unit (DMU) efficiency under the condition that the production possibilities do not satisfy the convexity assumption. However, in actual production and life, many data are difficult to collect and cannot obtain accurate values, such as carbon dioxide emissions. In the case of imprecise data, the FDH model cannot evaluate the efficiency of DMU. In this context, a new uncertain FDH model based on uncertainty theory is proposed. In this paper, the uncertain FDH model is solved precisely by means of the uncertain chance constraint method and the expected value method. Finally, an application example of measuring the efficiency of 30 banks in China in 2019 is given to documenting the feasibility of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of the stock market is still a complicated task to pursue in the field of machine learning as it relies on previous and past data, which is generally unstable and noisy. Existing methods of predicting the stock market are usually supervised approaches in which the prior labeling of the data as negative as well as positive moments is necessary to provide accurate results. However, this method of training the machine learning algorithms is complicated as it is vulnerable to overfitting issues as the behavior of the market usually relies on certain constraints like political events, marketing trends, and so on. The functioning of the actual portfolio optimization framework can be enhanced by fusing the return prediction in the conventional time series systems in the process of generating portfolios. Thus, the implementation of a better portfolio optimization system, which has a return prediction system integrated along with making the investors obtain more stable profits, is the major goal of this work. The modeling of the return forecasting model initially begins with the gathering of past stock marketing data. Then, the returns are estimated with the development of the Serial Cascaded Deep Residual Networks (SCDRN), where the deep learning models are utilized for predicting the future return of each stock. The risk level of each stock is also determined during the return prediction process. Then, with the aid of the developed optimization strategy named Enhanced Heap-based optimizer (EHO), the optimal portfolio is formulated, where the up-to-date market conditions are captured to rebalance the portfolio. The optimal selection of asset trading systems functions on the basis of the Sharpe ratio, and it maximizes the profit relative to the risk taken. An extensive analysis is executed to test the efficacy of the proposed portfolio optimization model regarding several baseline works with heuristic strategies.},
