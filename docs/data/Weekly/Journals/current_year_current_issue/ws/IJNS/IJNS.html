  abstract     = {Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as a biologically inspired computational model, have garnered significant attention in object detection and image classification due to their event-driven mechanism and low-power characteristics. However, in object detection tasks, the residual structures in conventional networks introduce nonspiking operations, posing a critical challenge for SNNs. To address this issue, we propose a multi-layer feature cascade fusion SNN (MFCF-SNN) for object detection. During feature extraction, our novel multi-level cascaded feature extraction module replaces residual connections with cascade operations, eliminating nonspiking computations while enhancing gradient propagation to deeper layers. For downsampling, we introduce a pooling-convolution module that combines max-pooling and spiking convolution, effectively preserving feature information and improving gradient flow. These two modules collectively ensure pure spike-based computation while facilitating deep network training, thereby enhancing detection accuracy. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and SSDD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in advancing SNN-based object detection.},

These virus machines are recognized for their computational power (functioning as algorithms) and their ability to tackle computationally difficult problems. In this paper, we introduce a new extension of the matrix-based representation of virus machines. In this way, hosts, the number of viruses and the instructions to control virus transmission are represented as vectors and matrices, describing the computations of virus machines by linear algebra operations. We also use our matrix representation to show invariants, useful in the proofs, of such machines. In addition, an explicit example is shown to clarify the computation and invariants using the representation. That is, a virus machine that computes the discrete logarithm, which relies on the presumed intractability of cryptosystems such the digital signature algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Although a variety of deep learning-based methods have been introduced for Salient Object Detection (SOD) to RGB and Depth (RGB-D) images, existing approaches still encounter challenges, including inadequate cross-modal feature fusion, significant errors in saliency estimation due to noise in depth information, and limited model generalization capabilities. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative method for RGB-D SOD, TranSNP-Net, which integrates Nonlinear Spiking Neural P (NSNP) systems with Transformer networks. TranSNP-Net effectively fuses RGB and depth features by introducing an enhanced feature fusion module (SNPFusion) and an attention mechanism. Unlike traditional methods, TranSNP-Net leverages fine-tuned Swin (shifted window transformer) as its backbone network, significantly improving the model’s generalization performance. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical feature decoder (SNP-D) notably enhances accuracy in complex scenes where depth noise is prevalent. According to the experimental findings, the mean scores for the four metrics S-measure, F-measure, E-measure and MEA on the six RGB-D benchmark datasets are 0.9328, 0.9356, 0.9558 and 0.0288. TranSNP-Net achieves superior performance compared to 14 leading methods in six RGB-D benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Thermal and RGB images exhibit significant differences in information representation, especially in low-light or nighttime environments. Thermal images provide temperature information, complementing the RGB images by restoring details and contextual information. However, the spatial discrepancy between different modalities in RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation tasks complicates the process of multimodal feature fusion, leading to a loss of spatial contextual information and limited model performance. This paper proposes a channel-space fusion nonlinear spiking neural P system model network (CSPM-SNPNet) to address these challenges. This paper designs a novel color-thermal image fusion module to effectively integrate features from both modalities. During decoding, a nonlinear spiking neural P system is introduced to enhance multi-channel information extraction through the convolution of spiking neural P systems (ConvSNP) operations, fully restoring features learned in the encoder. Experimental results on public datasets MFNet and PST900 demonstrate that CSPM-SNPNet significantly improves segmentation performance. Compared with the existing methods, CSPM-SNPNet achieves a 0.5% improvement in mIOU on MFNet and 1.8% on PST900, showcasing its effectiveness in complex scenes.},

Additionally, we prove that the inclusion of budding rules extends the model’s capability to solve all problems in the complexity class PSPACE . These findings advance research on Spiking Neural P Systems and their application to complex problems; however, whether both budding rules and division rules are required to extend these methods to problem domains beyond the NP class remains an open question.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a spiking neural network model with Hebbian connectivity for implementing energy-efficient associative memory, whose activity is determined by input stimuli. The model consists of three interacting layers of Hodgkin–Huxley–Mainen spiking neurons with excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections. Information patterns are stored in memory using a symmetric Hebbian matrix and can be retrieved in response to a specific stimulus pattern. Binary images are encoded using in-phase and anti-phase oscillations relative to a global clock signal. Utilizing the phase-locking effect allows for cluster synchronization of neurons (both on the input and output layers). Interneurons in the intermediate layer filter signal propagation pathways depending on the context of the input layer, effectively engaging only a portion of the synaptic connections within the Hebbian matrix for recognition. The stability of the oscillation phase is investigated for both in-phase and anti-phase synchronization modes when recognizing direct and inverse images. This context-dependent effect opens promising avenues for the development of analog hardware circuits for energy-efficient neurocomputing applications, potentially leading to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and cognitive computing.},
