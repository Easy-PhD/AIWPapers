  abstract     = {In cloud storage services, burst I/O workloads from data analytics and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) applications present significant challenges to Quality of Service (QoS) management. Existing scheduling models like dmClock ensure fair and stable I/O bandwidth allocation in typical scenarios. However, they falter under frequent burst traffic, leading to lower resource utilization and higher task latency. To address this, we propose BAQoS, a Burst I/O Aware Quality of Service Optimization for Cloud Storage Service. BAQoS employs refined request classification, a burst-aware hierarchical scheduling algorithm, and a high-performance scheduler architecture (HPSA). These features enable dynamic resource allocation and efficient scheduling for both burst and regular requests. Experiments show that BAQoS markedly enhances performance under burst workloads, accelerating burst request processing by up to 7.09 and improving overall system performance by 48.86%. Furthermore, BAQoS ensures superior performance for non-burst users, achieving a 51.15% performance boost for high-priority users, a 5.34% increase in system throughput, and an over 50% reduction in IOPS standard deviation among same-priority users.},

  abstract     = {Accurate modeling of influence relationships between events is critical to achieving effective sequential recommendation. Representing event sequences as a Hawkes process is a widely adopted approach; however, it is suboptimal in practical applications because it overlooks the contextual information of events and assumes that all historical events exert a positive influence on current events. To address these limitations, we propose a category-aware next event prediction method. This method computes both the event-level and category-level influences of all historical events associated with the target user on candidate events and recommends the Top-k ones with the highest predicted event intensities. Specifically, it captures the temporal influence between events from the perspectives of event features and the features of the categories to which the events belong. Using embedding learning, the method derives feature vectors for both events and their corresponding categories, as well as their mutual influence relationships, thereby allowing more accurate prediction of the next event. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance across multiple evaluation metrics compared to conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {The analysis of large volumes of data to derive new insights is commonly referred to as data science, and its widespread adoption is increasingly necessary. One critical step in data science workflows is feature extraction from data, known as feature engineering. This process heavily depends on expert experience, which has led to current research efforts aimed at its automation. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to automate feature extraction from the textual information found in data column names. Specifically, we employ natural language processing and source code analysis techniques on existing source code and column names, with a particular focus on datetime features, to construct a knowledge database. Utilizing this knowledge database, we propose a system that recommends datetime features based on newly provided textual information. Departing from conventional methods such as one-hot encoding and Word2Vec word embeddings, our approach is informed by prior research and shifts toward Doc2Vec, which vectorizes at the document level. In our experiments, we validate the classification accuracy of the knowledge database and demonstrate its application in predictive tasks, such as housing price prediction, where it shows improved prediction accuracy. Our proposed approach, which utilizes a Doc2Vec model pre-trained on Wikipedia, results in enhanced prediction accuracy during vectorization.},

  abstract     = {Program path analysis is an essential component of software defect detection and quality assurance. Accurately identifying infeasible paths can prevent false positives caused by invalid paths, enabling developers to pinpoint actual defects more efficiently and enhancing overall software quality and reliability. This paper proposes an integrated approach for determining infeasible paths based on program path features and constraint-based reinforcement learning. First, a loop-structure path search and reduction algorithm is proposed to systematically simplify path explosion induced by loops. Then, a global subgraph-based path reduction algorithm is introduced to effectively remove redundant and irrelevant paths. Subsequently, we propose a path set generation algorithm guided by control and implication relationships to construct an optimized path set. Path constraints and symbolic path constraints are used to enhance semantic representation. Finally, a reinforcement learning-based model utilizing reachability rewards and exploration rewards to dynamically determine path reachability. Experimental results show that our proposed approach significantly reduces path explosion, accurately identifies infeasible paths and outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Automated Test Case Generation for Path Coverage (ATCG-PC) is a critical yet challenging task in software testing, especially for large-scale programs where metaheuristic algorithms often suffer from premature convergence and inefficient exploration. This paper proposes a novel algorithm, Isomap-DQN-MOPSO (IDMOPSO), which significantly enhances the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) framework. Our approach introduces an iterative, prefix-based path grouping strategy to manage complexity. Crucially, it integrates two machine learning-based enhancements: an Isomap manifold learning strategy for more effective leader selection to guide the swarm and escape local optima, and a hybrid Deep Q-Network (DQN) for dynamically adapting learning factors to balance exploration and exploitation. Comprehensive experiments on a diverse set of 18 programs demonstrate that IDMOPSO achieves superior performance, particularly on large-scale programs where it attains significantly higher path coverage rates than state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies confirm the synergistic effect of combining Isomap and DQN, validating our approach as a robust and scalable solution for complex ATCG-PC problems.},

However, existing automatic evaluation methods still face challenges in diverse scenarios, particularly in terms of limited generalization and low alignment with human judgment. To address these issues, we propose a paraphrase-based evaluation framework that integrates Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) with general-purpose language models (GPT). This approach generates diverse paraphrases across lexical, syntactic and stylistic dimensions to enhance the coverage of traditional evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that incorporating paraphrase augmentation significantly improves the correlation between automatic metrics and human evaluation on multiple datasets. Additionally, extensive experiments on six mainstream LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method. This study offers new insights into improving the human alignment of automatic evaluation and lays a foundation for the application and optimization of LLMs in open-domain dialogue systems.},
