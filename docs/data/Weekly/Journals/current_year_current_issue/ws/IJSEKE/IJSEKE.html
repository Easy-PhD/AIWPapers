  abstract     = {The advanced metering infrastructure AMI is an essential component of the smart grid (SG), providing essential support for two-way communication and real-time data exchange between users and utility providers. However, due to the potential untrustworthiness of the open channel, protecting the confidentiality and integrity of communication data is challenging. Previously, a number of privacy-preserving authentication and key agreement (AKA) schemes have been proposed for securing SGs. However, these solutions either have some security and privacy vulnerabilities or require expensive computational and communication costs that cannot be applied to resource-constrained smart meters. In this work, we propose a novel, lightweight and privacy-preserving AKA scheme for SGs based on the elliptic curve cryptography and physically uncloneable function. The security analysis shows that our construction is secure against several security attacks. In addition, performance comparison with several related works shows the practicality of our design.},

  abstract     = {The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into new power system (NPS) represents a crucial approach for reducing carbon emissions (CEs) and mitigating resource consumption in cloud computing centers. However, the inherent uncertainties of RES generation, such as randomness, volatility, and intermittency, pose significant challenges to the scheduling of NPS. A data-driven multi-energy complementary uncertainty scheduling method is proposed to address these issues and ensure a stable power supply from NPS to cloud computing centers. First, we constructed a stochastic differential equation (SDE) to represent the uncertainty characteristics of renewable energy generation, and proposed a SDE deep network based on LSTM (LSTM-SDE Net) to capture and learn the aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty of units; subsequently, we established the multi-energy complementary uncertain many-objective scheduling model (MuC-UMaOSM) by utilizing the interval parametric estimation, which aims to optimize grid total cost (TC), RES consumption rate (CR), CEs, grid economic benefits (EB) and load balancing (LB); finally, in order to obtain trade-off solutions with improved convergence, diversity, and uncertainty, we designed a two-population cooperative interval many-objective evolutionary algorithm (T-PIMaOEA) to solve the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of our method in the multi-energy complementary scheduling (MECS).},

  abstract     = {The widespread global adoption of credit card payments has significantly increased convenience for consumers. However, this shift has also heightened the demand for robust fraud detection systems across various financial institutions. While numerous fraud detection algorithms have been proposed in both academia and industry, significant challenges remain in the accurate identification of minority class samples and the effective capture of time series information during feature extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a long short-term memory-logistic regression stacked ensemble model (LLSE) that integrates long short-term memory (LSTM) and logistic regression (LR). The first layer of the model extracts time series features by combining three independently trained LSTM base learners whose outputs are concatenated and passed to the second layer, an LR meta-learner, to generate the final predictions. This dual-layer decision-making mechanism effectively captures spatiotemporal correlation features in fraudulent transactions, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the model. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated via two publicly available credit card datasets. This study innovatively combines the TS-N2VA feature extraction model with the LLSE classifier to comprehensively enhance credit card fraud detection performance through both hidden feature extraction and classifier improvement. Experiments on two public credit card datasets demonstrate that the LLSE classifier achieves significantly better performance in identifying minority class samples while maintaining overall recognition accuracy, outperforming other fraud detection models in the experiments.},

  abstract     = {In the field of robotic control, the interdisciplinary and complex nature of knowledge leads to issues such as knowledge fragmentation and a steep learning curve, posing significant challenges to mastering domain expertise. Recommendation systems, as typical information-filtering tools, are often employed to facilitate knowledge retrieval. Nevertheless, they inherently suffer from cold-start and data sparsity problems, which compromise recommendation accuracy. To overcome these limitations, this study first combines the recommendation system with the knowledge graph and improves upon the traditional BERT-BiLSTM-CRF entity recognition model by incorporating an attention mechanism to enhance entity extraction performance. Verified on the public dataset, the accuracy rate, recall rate and F1 value of the improved model were 91.6%, 94.5% and 93.1%, respectively, which increased by 1.4%, 2.9% and 2.3%, respectively, compared with the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model. Subsequently, by using the YOLOv5 object detection network to extract image features from the self-built robot image dataset, a multimodal robot control knowledge graph was constructed. Finally, to address the limitations of conventional KGAT, a Personalized Knowledge Graph Attention Network (PKGAT) model is proposed by integrating the recommendation system with the constructed knowledge graph and incorporating a cold-start mitigation module. This results in a knowledge graph-based recommendation system tailored for robotic control domain knowledge. The results from the experiments show that the AUC value and F1 value of the PKGAT model in the MovieLens dataset are 94.56% and 94.20% respectively, which have increased by 2.35% and 2.07%, respectively, compared with the KGAT model. The AUC value and F1 value in the Book-Crossing dataset were 75.30% and 73.60%, respectively, which increased by 2.02% and 1.48%, respectively, compared with the KGAT model.},

  abstract     = {Code summarization aims to automatically generate natural language descriptions for code snippets, thereby enhancing programmersâ€™ comprehension of the code and significantly improving code maintainability and development efficiency. Code reuse is a prevalent practice in software development, and information retrieval approaches, which leverage similar summaries from a corpus, have shown promising results. However, these approaches often heavily rely on the quality of the corpus, and discrepancies between retrieved and target summaries may result in inaccuracies or incomplete descriptions. In this paper, we propose RAPRSUM, a retrieval-augmented code summarization framework that integrates information retrieval and deep learning techniques. Specifically, RAPRSUM refines retrieved summary prototypes using a deep learning model to preserve essential information while eliminating redundancy. A pretrained large language model is then employed to generate the final summary by jointly considering the input code and the refined prototype. We evaluated RAPRSUM on three public datasets, demonstrating its significant improvement over existing baseline methods. Additional ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed modules. Finally, through case analysis and robustness verification, we highlight RAPRSUMâ€™s superior performance in generating high-quality code summaries.},

  abstract     = {Legacy software, particularly from the 1990s, often becomes obsolete due to aging hardware and outdated software environments. Traditionally, software modernization required extensive manual effort, involving reverse engineering, code rewriting, and re-architecting. However, advancements in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new possibilities for automating software translation and modernization. This paper explores the feasibility of using LLMs for modernizing 90s-era Windows applications, specifically migrating legacy C and C + + code to Python. Our methodology includes decompilation, source code analysis, automated translation using ChatGPT, and user interface reconstruction. We empirically evaluate three software projects by analyzing LLM-based translation accuracy across different code structures, including algorithmic logic, file handling, and graphical interfaces. Results indicate that while LLMs achieve high translation accuracy ( âˆ’ 8 8 % ) for structured code, challenges persist in handling decompiled code and user interface generation. The study provides insights into the effectiveness and limitations of LLMs in real-world software renovation, offering guidelines for leveraging machine learning in legacy system modernization. These findings contribute to both academic research and practical applications, suggesting a pathway for cost-effective and scalable legacy software migration.},
