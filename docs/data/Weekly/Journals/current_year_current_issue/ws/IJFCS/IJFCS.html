For 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ k ‚àí 1 , the minimum i -degree Œ¥ i ( G ) of G is the minimum integer such that every i vertices are contained in at least Œ¥ i ( G ) edges. Let c i ( n , F ) be the largest minimum i -degree among all n -vertex k -uniform hypergraphs that have no F -covering. In this paper, we mainly consider the F -covering problem in 3 -uniform hypergraphs. When F is a generalized triangle T , we give the exact value of c 2 ( n , T ) and asymptotically determine c 1 ( n , T ) . Moreover, when F is a linear k -path P k or a star S k , we provide bounds of c i ( n , P k ) and c i ( n , S k ) for k ‚â• 3 , where i = 1 , 2 .},

A batch of jobs can be processed simultaneously in some available processing time interval as long as the total size of these jobs doesn‚Äôt exceed the machine capacity. The processing time of a job batch is the largest processing time of the jobs contained in this batch and the production progress is non-resumable. Our objective is to minimize the last maintenance completion time. For the case where jobs have unit processing times, we show the problem is strongly NP-hard and present a 2 -approximation algorithm. For the case where jobs have unit sizes, we show the problem is also strongly NP-hard and provide a 3 2 -approximation algorithm. Finally, we study the general case where jobs have non-identical processing times and sizes and propose a 3 -approximation algorithm.},

Each batch can process up to B jobs, and each job has a load l j > 0 . The start time of the jobs in the same batch is the same, and the completion time of the jobs in the same batch is the same. If the start time of job J j is t , then its actual load is l j = a j t . The load of a batch is the load of the longest job in the batch, i.e., the load of a batch is the load of the job with the largest deterioration rate in the batch. The processing time of a batch on machine M i is the ratio between the load of a batch and the speed s i .

One is the truss decomposition problem, which is to compute the truss number of every edge; the other is the truss maintenance problem, which is to update the truss numbers of the affected edges in a dynamic graph while avoiding the truss number recomputation of all edges. However, few results are known on edge-weighted graphs. In this paper, we focus on the truss maintenance problem on edge-weighted graphs. Firstly, we propose a basic algorithm for the truss decomposition problem on edge-weighted graphs. Then we propose two indices, weighted growth potential support (WGPS) and weighted remaining potential support (WRPS), to help find the edges with potential changes on their truss numbers. Finally, we propose algorithms for the truss maintenance problem on edge-weighted graphs.},

In this paper, we observe that NDE is caused by different diffusion heights (the number of fins) between two adjacent cells, and consider reducing the number of height differences in single row to reduce NDE violations. Ignoring the movement of the cells, we first propose a Hamiltonian-completion-based algorithm that reorders the cells in the row such that the number of NDE violations is reduced to a near-optimal value. Then, for a given fixed integer Œ∑ > 0 , we devise an algorithm to compute the new positions of cells, such that the number of NDE violations is bounded by Œ∑ + 1 and the maximum displacement is minimized. Moreover, we extend our algorithm for legalization in multiple rows against mixed-height cells. Experimental results show that our algorithm reduces the NDE violations to a near-optimal minimum without any area overheads while achieving a better practical running time compared to baselines conforming with the theoretical analysis.},

The concept of LPS function was proposed to describe the properties of some discrete functions or nonconvex continuous functions. It is a generalization of the lattice submodular function. For the real LPS maximization problem, we design the monotone Pseudo Frank-Wolfe (PFW) algorithm by taking advantage of the second derivative bound. The PFW algorithm iterates by constantly optimize linear gradient function v T ‚àá œï ( x ) , and finally outputs the solution. We theoretically prove that PFK algorithm has an approximation ratio of ( 1 ‚àí e ‚àí ( Œ≤ Œ≤ + 1 ) 2 ) (where Œ≤ ‚àà ( 0 , 1 ] ), and it needs at least O ( n Œ∂ ) rounds (where Œ∂ is a parameter given in advance).

PMMS is an important concept in the fair division. However, whether PMMS for indivisible items exists is still open. This work concentrates on PMMS by proving the existence of PMMS on linear graphs with binary valuation functions. Besides, this paper designs an algorithm to approximate PMMS in the case where different agents have identical valuations among the same items, achieving a ratio strictly greater than 0.8, which outperforms the state-of-the-art ratio of 0.781 from Kurokawa [22].

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the single-machine scheduling problems with DeJong‚Äôs learning effect and deteriorating maintenance activity, where DeJong‚Äôs learning effect is a special position-based learning effect and the duration of the deteriorating maintenance activity is a linear increasing function of its starting time. Our goal is to determine the job sequence of all jobs and the position of the maintenance activity to minimize some performance measures. When the performance measures are the makespan and the total completion time, we show that both of them can be solved in polynomial time. When the performance measure is the total weighted completion time, we develop a pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm under a special case. When the performance measure is the maximum lateness, we show that the earliest due date first (EDD) order is a bad algorithm for the general case, and develop a polynomial time algorithm under a special case.},

  abstract     = {Sparsest cut problems are very important graph partitions, which have been widely applied in expander graphs, Markov chains, and image segmentation. In this paper, we study the edge-weighted version of the Sparse Cut Problem, which minimizes the ratio of the total weight of edges between blocks and the total weight of edges incident to vertices in one block. We first prove that the problem is even NP-hard for an edge-weighted graph with bridges. Then, we combine and generalize submodular functions and principal partition to design a graph algorithm to improve the initial bipartition, which runs in polynomial time by using network flow as its subroutines.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised image clustering is a challenging task in computer vision. Recently, various deep clustering algorithms based on contrastive learning have achieved promising performance and some distinguishable features representation were obtained only by taking different augmented views of same image as positive pairs and maximizing their similarities, whereas taking other images‚Äô augmentations in the same batch as negative pairs and minimizing their similarities. However, due to the fact that there is more than one image in a batch belong to the same class, simply pushing the negative instances apart will result in inter-class conflictions and lead to the clustering performance degradation. In order to solve this problem, we propose a deep clustering algorithm based on supported nearest neighbors (SNDC), which constructs positive pairs of current images by maintaining a support set and find its k nearest neighbors from the support set. By going beyond single instance positive, SNDC can learn more generalized features representation with inherent semantic meaning and therefore alleviating inter-class conflictions. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets show that the performance of SNDC is superior to the state-of-the-art clustering models, with accuracy improvement of 6.2% and 20.5% on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-Dogs respectively.},
