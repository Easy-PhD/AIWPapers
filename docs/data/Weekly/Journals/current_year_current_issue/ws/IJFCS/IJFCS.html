  abstract     = {The diagnosability is a prominent parameter to estimate the fault diagnosis capability of multiprocessor systems, which is the maximum number of faulty processors that can be identified by the system. Compared to traditional diagnosability, strong diagnosability proposed by Lai et¬†al. [ 16 ] is a more pinpoint term for gauging multiprocessor systems‚Äô reliability. A system is strongly t -diagnosable if it is t -diagnosable and can attain ( t + 1 ) -diagnosability, excepting certain circumstance in which all neighbors of some processor are faulty. In this paper, we obtain the strong diagnosability of regular networks as well as connected networks subject to certain circumstances under the PMC model, respectively. The previous result in Hsieh et¬†al. [ 7 ] is extended.},

  abstract     = {With the advantage of transmitting messages efficiently along with switching frequencies at set intervals by each user, frequency-hopping sequence (FHS) has been widely applied in the frequency-hopping multiple access spread spectrum systems. In such systems, the Hamming correlation property of FHS is an important standard to measure the system performance. In this paper, a combinatorial description of difference-balanced function from ùîΩ q n ‚àó onto ùîΩ q m is given, and the sizes of its preimage sets are determined without resorting to d -homogeneous property, where m and n are two positive integers with m | n . Afterwards, we construct new near-optimal FHSs and optimal FHS sets by virtue of the Chinese Remainder Theorem and d -homogeneous functions with difference-balanced property, which generalize some earlier constructions of optimal FHS sets and produce optimal FHS sets which are not covered in the foregoing literature.},

The first class of codes can correct all single errors and detect all double adjacent (DA) errors within a b -bit byte, while the second class of codes has the ability to correct all single errors and detect all DA errors. Both classes of codes are defined over integer rings and are generated by computer search. To evaluate the performance of the proposed codes, we analyze the probability of incorrect decoding for different error rates. In addition, the paper shows that the proposed codes have a slightly higher redundancy than linear SEC-DAED codes, but also a much simpler decoding algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Indistinguishable Obfuscation (IO) is a very critical cryptography primitive. It can be used to construct almost any other cryptography schemes. AB15 indistinguishability obfuscation scheme is the first practical scheme. In order to avoid the ideal generator can be searched, authors of AB15 IO scheme set it to a relatively large size (In fact, such ideal generator should be a ‚Äúsmall prime‚Äù). It causes the ratio of the standard deviation of Gaussian sampling and the size of ideal generator smaller. We call the ratio as ‚Äúdeviation ratio‚Äù. In this paper, we point that direct sampling and smaller deviation ratio makes the scheme insecure. A searching attack can reveal hidden coefficients of original boolean circuit from its obfuscator. Firstly, the attacker searches those level-0 encodings of 0, hoping that the code value is 0. Such event happens with probability 1 2 œÄ œÉ ‚àó or 1 4 œÄ œÉ ‚àó , where œÉ ‚àó as the deviation ratio. By a series of searching, a weak obfuscator with prime module can be obtained. Then, the attacker can obtain all hidden coefficients of original boolean circuit. Take n as the dimension of independent variable, m as the dimension of coefficient of original boolean circuit. For Simple Obfuscator, searching time is 2 n + 2 m , and the probability that one successfully reveals hidden coefficients of original boolean circuit is about n + m 2 4 œÄ œÉ ‚àó ( 1 + 2 ) . For Robust Obfuscator, searching time and success probability are respectively n + m + C n + m 2 and n + m 2 2 œÄ œÉ ‚àó + C n + m 2 2 ( 4 œÄ œÉ ‚àó ) 2 . At last, we present a revised scheme with ‚Äúconditionally accepted sampling‚Äù and smaller deviation ratio. The new scheme avoids above mentioned attack and greatly reduce the size complexity.},
