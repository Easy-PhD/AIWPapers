  abstract     = {Personalized recommendation systems play a crucial role in alleviating information overload and satisfying users’ specific preferences. To address the challenges of inadequate user historical data extraction and the cold start problem inherent in traditional movie recommendation systems, we present a novel personalized movie recommendation model known as “movie recommendation with starring roles and ratings” (MSR). By incorporating a multi-head attention mechanism, the model captures intricate relationships among diverse data fields within users’ viewing records and facilitates the extraction of user features through the basic information-rating joint attention network (BRJA). The gate mechanism efficiently integrates fundamental movie information and average score into the movie representation vector, thereby generating candidate movie features. MSR can effectively provide recommendations even when confronted with limited user information, effectively mitigating the cold start problem. Comparative experiments on the movie lens dataset and ablation experiments focusing on key modules demonstrate the effectiveness of MSR in improving movie recommendations.},

Traditional video surveillance methods have the disadvantages of slow detection speed, low accuracy, interference from occlusions, and poor real-time performance. This paper proposes a real-time pose detection algorithm based on deep learning, which can effectively perform real-time tracking and detection of single and multiple individuals in different indoor and outdoor environments and at different distances. First, a corresponding pose recognition dataset for complex scenes was created based on the YOLO network. Then, the OpenPose method was used to detect key points of the human body. Finally, the Kalman filter multi-object tracking method was used to predict the state of human targets within the occluded area. Real-time detection of human postures (sitting, stand up, standing, sit down, walking, fall down, and lying down) is achieved with corresponding alarms to ensure the timely detection and processing of emergencies.},

  abstract     = {As a component of the capital market, the stock market plays a very important role in economic development. How to predict the stock price more accurately is the key concern of researchers and investors. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an Informer based method for stock intraday price prediction. Informer based on attention mechanism can efficiently capture precise long-range dependencies between input and output to increase the prediction capacity. In this research, historical K-line data of traditional securities in China’s financial market are collected. Based on this data set, the intraday stock price prediction performance of Informer and Long Short-Term Memory neural network (LSTM) is compared. The experiment also uses the three-day K-line model to perform pattern recognition on the K-line data of candidate stocks. The results show that the prediction performance of Informer is significantly higher than that of LSTM, and the data information after three-day K-line pattern recognition can improve the prediction accuracy of Informer and reduce time and space overhead of Informer.},

To tackle the challenges of insufficient accuracy in image feature extraction and underutilization of visual information, we present a Swin Transformer-based model for image captioning with feature enhancement and multi-stage fusion (Swin-Caption). Initially, the Swin Transformer is employed in the capacity of an encoder for extracting images, while feature enhancement is adopted to gather additional image feature information. Subsequently, a multi-stage image and semantic fusion module is constructed to utilize the semantic information from past time steps. Lastly, a two-layer LSTM is utilized to decode semantic and image data, generating captions. The proposed model outperforms the baseline model in experimental tests and instance analysis on the public datasets Flickr8K, Flickr30K, and MS-COCO.},

  abstract     = {The microservice architecture breaks through the traditional cluster architecture mode based on virtual machines and uses containers as carriers to interact through lightweight communication mechanisms to reduce system coupling and provide more flexible system service support. With the expansion of the system scale, a large number of system logs with complex structures and chaotic relationships are generated. How to accurately analyze the system logs and make efficient fault prediction is particularly important for building a safe and reliable system. By studying neural network technology, this paper proposes an Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM). Combined with the dual channel convolutional neural network model (DCNN), it uses the attention mechanism to explore the differences between dimensional features, realizes multi-dimensional feature fusion, and establishes a BiLSTM-DCNN deep learning model that integrates the attention mechanism. From the perspective of social network analysis, a data preprocessing method is proposed to process fault redundant data and improve the accuracy of fault prediction under Microservices. Compare BiLSTM-DCNN with the mainstream system log analysis machine learning models SVM, CNN and Bi-LSTM, and explore the advantages of BiLSTM-DCNN in processing microservice system log text. The model is applied to simulation data and HDFS data set for experimental comparison, which proves the good generalization ability and universality of BiLSTM-DCNN.},

In this paper, all NEEQ companies that implemented private placement in 2017 are used as the study sample. This paper also empirically analyzes the current situation of domestic private equity investment funds based on BP and Hopfield neural network models, then the results of the two models are compared. It is concluded that the accuracy of the BP neural network model can be more than 90%.
