  abstract     = {The detection and monitoring of anomalies in the underwater ecosystem are necessary to mitigate disasters. None of the traditional works concentrated on detecting the underwater anomalies regarding boundaries of the tectonic plates. Therefore, anomaly detection in the underwater ecosystem, particularly in relation to tectonic plate boundaries, is proposed. Using Dynamic Bit Permutation-SHA (DBP-SHA) hashing, Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) devices are registered in a Multi-Hop Network. Tent Map Termite Colony Optimization (TM-TCO) optimizes pathways, whereas Terahertz Quantum Resistant Cryptographic Algorithm (Te-QRCA) guarantees secure data transfer. Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DB-SCAN) balances workload, while edge servers use the Exponential Gaussian Peak (EGP)-Fuzzy model to train local models that assess less sensor data, spot disaster trends, and produce labels. Then, the Hierarchical Meta-Curiosity-based Federated Reinforcement Learning (HMC-FRL) classifier is used for anomaly detection. The trained local model is updated on the cloud server. Thus, the communication is optimized and the anomaly is detected effectively in the IoUT with an accuracy of 98.671%.},

  abstract     = {In India, silkworms are essential to the production of silk. Silkworms have a 6–8 week life cycles. The process of turning a silkworm into a mature Bombyx mori moth yields peace of silk. Silkworms are more valuable because of their nutritional makeup, which includes vitamins, oils, proteins, minerals, and other beneficial elements. Silkworm diseases constitute a significant threat to the sericulture industry, causing substantial economic losses. However, there were research gaps in the areas of environmental factors and disease outbreaks. Existing diagnostic tools are limited in understanding complex disease interactions related to silkworm rearing. Addressing these research gaps is essential for improving silkworm disease prevention, control, and overall sericulture sustainability. Visual and time-consuming classification methods lead to errors, and it reduces productivity. Transfer learning was implemented for image classification. Gender classification of silkworm pupae using ResNetV2 architecture achieved 97% accuracy. The development of an automated system is done by employing a robotic arm integrated with a camera, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino Uno. A camera coupled with a Raspberry Pi captures high-resolution images of the pupae, subsequently processed for classification. Arduino Uno controls the robotic arm’s movements to classify each silkworm pupa by the category, like male, female or diseased. This automated AI based embedded hardware efficiently classifies the gender of silkworm pupa and hence reduces human intervention. The quality of silk production will be improved.},

  abstract     = {Crime analysis and predictive modeling in criminology face challenges due to data scarcity and privacy limitations. This happens due to a lack of comprehensive datasets that capture the complex aspects of crime. This research aims to develop a Multi-modal Generative Adversarial Network (MM-GAN) framework to accurately model complicated synthetic crime data. The goal of MM-GAN, which integrates several GAN architectures, is to provide varied and high-fidelity data depicting many crime elements in a unified model. These features include geographical distribution, temporal patterns, and category information. MM-GAN uses Conditional GANs (cGANs) to regulate the kinds of data produced according to crime characteristics like time, place, and kind. To further enhance the usability of the produced data for model training and guarantee that it properly represents real-world classifications, Auxiliary Classifier GANs (AC-GANs) are included to classify synthetic data. As a data format bridge, CycleGAN allows MM-GAN to represent various sources by facilitating cross-domain conversions between structured and unstructured. The model’s capacity to simulate seasonality and trends is enhanced by adding temporal GAN layers, which allow the model to capture sequential crime patterns. A strong resource for predictive analysis, risk assessment, and simulation training, MM-GAN-generated synthetic data closely matches real crime patterns, according to experiments. This framework provides a user-friendly and privacy-protecting tool for creating enhanced datasets, which is useful for criminology academics and law enforcement authorities. MM-GAN provides a scalable solution via synthetic data simulation to empower secure environments with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven insights and models.},

  abstract     = {Osteoporosis is a progressive skeletal disorder characterized by decreased Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and structural deterioration, leading to an increased risk of fractures. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX), often fail to detect osteoporosis at an early stage due to their limited sensitivity and accessibility. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning (DL), and Machine Learning (ML) have shown significant potential in improving osteoporosis detection. However, existing models face challenges related to data privacy, explainability, computational complexity, and generalizability across diverse populations. This study introduces Federated Graph-based Multimodal Osteoporosis Diagnosis (FGMOD), a novel AI-driven framework that integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced osteoporosis risk assessment. Unlike traditional DL models that rely on centralized training, FL ensures privacy-preserving learning across multiple hospitals and institutions. Simultaneously, GNNs model trabecular bone connectivity, offering deeper insights into microarchitectural changes in osteoporotic bones. Multimodal data fusion, incorporating structured clinical data, DXA scans, and biochemical markers, significantly improves prediction accuracy and interpretability. The proposed FGMOD model was validated on a real-world dataset comprising 10 000 patient records, 5000 DXA scans, and biochemical profiles. Comparative evaluation with state-of-the-art AI models demonstrated superior performance, achieving 94.2% accuracy, 93.4% precision, 93.1% recall, and a ROC-AUC score of 0.96. Unlike CNN-based models, which rely heavily on high-resolution images, FGMOD effectively extracts clinically relevant features from graph-based bone connectivity analysis, ensuring robust and interpretable predictions. Furthermore, the use of SHAP-based feature importance analysis provides clinicians with an explainable AI decision-making process, enhancing trust in the model’s recommendations. Performance comparisons against CNN, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Transfer Learning models revealed that FGMOD outperformed all baselines, particularly in privacy-aware federated training, osteoporosis risk stratification, and real-time inference on edge AI devices. Additionally, FGMOD reduced inference latency to 45 ms per sample, making it suitable for real-time clinical deployment. FGMOD represents a significant advancement in AI-powered osteoporosis detection, addressing key challenges such as privacy, generalizability, and interpretability. Future research should focus on expanding FL collaborations across global hospitals, integrating wearable sensor data for continuous bone health monitoring, and enhancing GNN-based osteoporosis modeling for faster inference on mobile healthcare platforms. This study paves the way for clinically reliable, privacy-preserving, and scalable AI solutions in osteoporosis risk assessment and early detection.},
