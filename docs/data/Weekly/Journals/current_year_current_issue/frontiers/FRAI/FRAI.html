  abstract     = {In recent decades, advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have opened up unprecedented horizons in educational research. The ability to recognize, interpret and respond to students' emotions presents education with a crucial challenge: to design methodologies that integrate the affective dimension as a fundamental part of the learning process. With this objective in mind, the research topic "Methodology for Emotion-Aware Education Based on Artificial Intelligence" was born. Its purpose was to bring together work that explores theoretical approaches, technological applications and empirical evidence on Educational AI linked to emotions, bridging affective computing, pedagogy, and human–computer interaction to foster more responsive and ethical emotion-aware learning environments. This research topic offers a pluralistic overview, both in terms of methods and contexts, which allows for reflection on the advances and challenges that arise when introducing AI systems capable of detecting and responding to emotional states in the educational field. The contributions range from the analysis of the social impact of scientific production to the application of deep learning models, the integration of pedagogical beliefs in the adoption of generative technologies, and the design of innovative sentiment analysis models. They also highlight ethical, methodological, and practical challenges in the field. In particular, Ni and Ni (2024) presents ECO-SAM, an innovative sentiment analysis model that combines self-attention techniques with pre-trained neural networks to improve emotion classification in texts with notable increases in accuracy. Its educational relevance lies in the potential of text analysis systems to interpret interactions on learning platforms, forums, and student social networks. The study also opens possibilities for transferring these techniques to the analysis of written work in school environments, enriching formative assessment and identifying emotional patterns in students' academic and personal writing. From another perspective, Govea et al. (2024) apply deep reinforcement learning models in hybrid learning environments, developing a system capable of detecting emotions in real time by integrating convolutional and recurrent networks. Using data from 500 students collected through cameras, microphones and biometric sensors, the authors show significant improvements in emotional detection accuracy and learning personalization. This work invites us to rethink hybrid environments as spaces where AI supports cognition and, at the same time, responds to the emotional dimension. However, it also highlights the urgent need to establish regulatory and pedagogical frameworks, so that the pursuit of efficiency does not compromise the privacy and emotional well-being of students. Cabero-Almenara et al. (2024) focuses on a decisive aspect: teacher acceptance of AI in higher education. The study, involving 425 university professors, uses the UTAUT2 model to analyze how pedagogical beliefs shape willingness to integrate generative AI tools. The results show that teachers with a constructivist orientation are more willing to incorporate these technologies than those with transmissive approaches. This emphasizes that the adoption of AI does not depend solely on technical availability, but also on the pedagogical concepts that guide teaching practice. This conclusion highlights the need for professional training programs that address the diversity of beliefs and contexts. In this sense, we see that the future of AI in education will not be played out solely in laboratories, but also in the ability of institutions to support their teachers in processes of pedagogical reflection and continuous professional development. Zhou et al. (2024) provide a novel approach by applying Item Response Theory (IRT) from a student state-aware perspective. Their SAD-IRT model incorporates parameters derived from facial expression analysis using advanced deep learning techniques, which allows for the estimation of item ability and difficulty, as well as an additional parameter linked to the cognitive-affective state of the students. The study demonstrates that this approach improves predictive capacity compared to traditional IRT models and even allows responses to be anticipated before they occur. Beyond its technical value, the article proposes a paradigm shift in educational assessment: considering students' emotions and states as part of the measurement, moving towards more personalized, sensitive and useful assessment systems to guide teaching and learning. Finally, Roda-Segarra et al. (2024) offers a pioneering study that goes beyond traditional bibliometric indicators, by examining more than 6,000 social impact records across 243 publications. They reveal that research on AI and emotions in education has a considerable impact on social media and scientific repositories, although academic impact and social visibility do not always align. This finding prompts reflection on how research reaches communities, and how social networks shape knowledge circulation. In addition, the study opens the door to reflection on the role of scientific communication in building trust around the use of AI in education, an essential aspect for building a balanced dialogue between innovation, society and schools. As we can see, the articles gathered in this research topic show that AI-mediated emotion-aware education is not a distant goal, but a field in full swing. From a social perspective, research still faces the challenge of extending its impact beyond the academic sphere and ensuring a true transfer to educational communities. From a pedagogical perspective, it is clear that teachers' beliefs influence the adoption of AI, which requires the design of training processes that are sensitive to this diversity. Finally, from a technological perspective, advanced models of deep learning and sentiment analysis open up unprecedented possibilities for creating adaptive environments capable of addressing both student performance and emotional well-being. The research published in this research topic shows that the combination of pedagogy, AI and emotion-awareness can transform the way we conceive of teaching and learning in the 21st century. The path ahead is not without ethical and practical challenges. Issues such as privacy, transparency, and fairness in personalization processes must be non-negotiable principles when using AI in an educational context. The results presented here show that this is possible, but at the same time, they reveal that there is still a long way to go in terms of academic research.},

  abstract     = {BackgroundAccurate prediction of kidney graft failure at different phases post-transplantation is critical for timely intervention and long-term allograft preservation. Traditional survival models offer limited capacity for dynamic, time-specific risk estimation. Machine learning (ML) approaches, with their ability to model complex patterns, present a promising alternative.MethodsThis study developed and dynamically evaluated phase-specific ML models to predict kidney graft failure across five post-transplant intervals: 0–3 months, 3–9 months, 9–15 months, 15–39 months, and 39–72 months. Clinically relevant retrospective data from deceased donor kidney transplant recipients were used for training and internal validation, with performance further confirmed on a blinded external validation cohort. Predictive performance was assessed using ROC AUC, F1 score, and G-mean.ResultsThe ML models demonstrated varying performance across time intervals. Short-term predictions in the 0–3 month and 3–9 month intervals yielded moderate accuracy (ROC AUC = 0.73 ± 0.07 and 0.72 ± 0.04, respectively). The highest predictive accuracy observed in mid-term or the 9–15-month window (ROC AUC = 0.92 ± 0.02; F1 score = 0.85 ± 0.03), followed by the 15–39-month period (ROC AUC = 0.84 ± 0.04; F1 score = 0.76 ± 0.04). Long-term prediction from 39 to 72 months was more challenging (ROC AUC = 0.70 ± 0.07; F1 score = 0.65 ± 0.06).ConclusionPhase-specific ML models offer robust predictive performance for kidney graft failure, particularly in mid-term periods, supporting their integration into dynamic post-transplant surveillance strategies. These models can aid clinicians in identifying high-risk patients and tailoring follow-up protocols to optimize long-term transplant outcomes.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionThe intersection of big data analytics and financial risk management has spurred significant methodological innovation and organizational change. Despite growing research activity, the literature remains fragmented, with notable gaps in comparative effectiveness, cross-sectoral applicability, and the use of non-traditional data sources.MethodsFollowing the PRISMA 2020 protocol, a systematic review was conducted on 21 peer-reviewed studies published between 2016 and June 2025. The review evaluated the methodological diversity and effectiveness of machine learning and hybrid approaches in financial risk management.ResultsThe analysis mapped the relative strengths and limitations of neural networks, ensemble learning, fuzzy logic, and hybrid optimization across credit, fraud, systemic, and operational risk. Advanced machine learning techniques consistently demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, yet real-world deployment remained geographically concentrated, primarily in Chinese and European banking and fintech sectors. Applications involving alternative and unstructured data, such as IoT signals and behavioral analytics, were largely experimental and faced both technical and governance challenges.Discussion/conclusionThe findings underscore the scarcity of systematic benchmarking across risk types and organizational contexts, as well as the limited attention to explainability in current implementations. This review identifies an urgent need for comparative, cross-jurisdictional studies, stronger field validation, and open science practices to bridge the gap between technical advances and their operational impact in big data–enabled financial risk management.},

  abstract     = {BackgroundAutoimmune encephalitis (AIE) is challenging to diagnose, especially in primary hospitals in China with limited medical resources. DeepSeek, a newly developed AI, shows potential as a cost-effective tool for improving diagnostic efficiency. However, no studies have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of DeepSeek for AIE.MethodsThis retrospective study included 100 patients with anti-neuronal antibody-positive AIE treated at Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. After removing personally identifiable information, antibody results, and history of immunotherapy from patients’ medical histories, the following information was sequentially input into DeepSeek: sex, age, chief complaint, medical history, EEG findings, head MRI description, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results. The positive rates of AIE diagnoses predicted by DeepSeek were then categorized as most likely diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and total diagnosis.ResultsUsing DeepSeek, the probabilities of AIE appearing as the most likely diagnosis and total diagnosis accuracy were 49 and 65%. When patient data were input stepwise, both the total diagnosis accuracy and the most likely diagnosis accuracy did not significantly increase. AIE patients with anti-MOG and anti-GABAbR positivity had predicted total diagnostic positivity rates of 88 and 100%, respectively. Patients presenting with headache and epilepsy were more likely to be diagnosed with AIE (96 and 100%).ConclusionDeepSeek shows limited positive diagnostic accuracy for predicting the diagnosis of AIE. The application of this new AI technology could be used to promote early screening for AIE in primary hospitals in China, improve medical education, and lead to research advances in AIE.},

This study explores how technical university students perceive and leverage ChatGPT in academic tasks, focusing on motivation, learning outcomes, and ethical awareness. Using the Technology Acceptance Model and Self-Determination Theory, the research surveyed 84 students from a technical university via a 5-point Likert-scale questionnaire. Six salient dimensions of student engagement with ChatGPT emerged: perceived usefulness for problem solving, learning retention and skill acquisition, structured interaction with familiar content, consultation on unfamiliar topics, preference for conciseness, and confidence in the accuracy of AI responses. Students who perceived ChatGPT as a valuable resource for addressing academic problems reported enhanced motivation and competence, and frequent structured interaction was linked to the practice of verifying uncertain information, indicating the emergence of AI literacy. However, extensive reliance was correlated with dependence and limited citation practices, revealing risks to academic integrity. By examining ChatGPT’s role in STEM education, this study substantiates the relevance of AI literacy training and institutional policies to ensure responsible use.

  abstract     = {Emotions in educational settings are often studied through self-reports or lab experiments, limiting insights into their real-world dynamics. This study examines learner emotions in authentic foreign language classrooms using a multimodal longitudinal approach. Over 16 consecutive sessions, we collected heart rate (HR) signals, emotional facial expressions (EFE), classroom observations, and self-reports on enjoyment, anxiety, and boredom to capture both physiological and self-perceived emotional responses. Rather than aggregating data across students, we focused on individualized emotional patterns to understand variations in emotional experiences. Each dataset included extensive video recordings, continuous HR monitoring, detailed observational notes, and post-session questionnaires, providing a high-resolution picture of emotional dynamics. Using unsupervised clustering techniques, we identified key emotional episodes—peaks and drops in physiological arousal (heart rate variation) and facial expression—relative to individual emotional baselines. These moments were cross-referenced with classroom observations and self-reports for validation. Findings highlight moments of positive emotional contagion during peer interactions, emphasizing the social dimension of language learning. This multimodal approach captures the interplay of physiological, behavioral, and subjective responses, offering a scalable method for studying classroom emotions. Methodologically, it demonstrates how multimodal analytics can uncover transient emotional states in real-world settings, while practically informing adaptive teaching strategies, such as leveraging peer interactions to enhance engagement or reduce anxiety. By integrating physiological, behavioral, and subjective data, this study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the affective dimensions of learning.},
