  abstract     = {IntroductionVision Transformers (ViTs) show promise for image recognition but struggle with medical image segmentation due to a lack of inductive biases for local structures and an inability to adapt to diverse modalities like CT, endoscopy, and dermatology. Effectively combining multi-scale features from CNNs and ViTs remains a critical, unsolved challenge.MethodsWe propose a Pyramid Feature Fusion Network (PFF-Net) that integrates hierarchical features from pre-trained CNN and Transformer backbones. Its dual-branch architecture includes: (1) a region-aware branch for global-to-local contextual understanding via pyramid fusion, and (2) a boundary-aware branch that employs orthogonal Sobel operators and low-level features to generate precise, semantic boundaries. These boundary predictions are iteratively fed back to enhance the region branch, creating a mutually reinforcing loop between segmenting anatomical regions and delineating their boundaries.ResultsPFF-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance across three clinical segmentation tasks. On polyp segmentation, PFF-Net attained a Dice score of 91.87%, surpassing the TransUNet baseline (86.96%) by 5.6% and reducing the HD95 metric from 22.25 to 11.68 (a 47.5% reduction). For spleen CT segmentation, it reached a Dice score of 95.33%, outperforming ESFPNet-S (94.92%) by 4.3% while reducing the HD95 from 6.99 to 3.35 (a 52.1% reduction). In skin lesion segmentation, our model achieved a Dice score of 90.29%, which represents a 7.3% improvement over the ESFPNet-S baseline (89.64%).DiscussionThe results validate the effectiveness of our pyramid fusion strategy and dual-branch design in bridging the domain gap between natural and medical images. The framework demonstrates strong generalization on small-scale datasets, proving its robustness and potential for accurate segmentation across highly heterogeneous medical imaging modalities.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of e-commerce and online auction markets, malicious bidding activities have severely disrupted market order. Traditional detection methods face limitations due to their inability to effectively address the covert nature, dynamic characteristics, and massive data volumes associated with such behaviors. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a detection method for users engaging in malicious bidding based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). This approach first models target users as specialized agents, then integrates their historical bidding data, and finally learns optimal strategies through competitive games with adversarial agents. Additionally, this paper designs a dynamic adjustment mechanism for the maliciousness coefficient to simulate user behavior changes, enabling precise assessment of malicious intent. Compared to existing fraud detection approaches based on reinforcement learning, the fundamental innovation lies not merely in applying MARL technology, but in introducing the novel “dynamic maliciousness coefficient” mechanism. This mechanism achieves dynamic and precise maliciousness assessment through mathematical modeling and real-time iteration, addressing the shortcomings of traditional MARL models in capturing user behavioral heterogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that this method exhibits higher detection accuracy and adaptability in complex dynamic market environments. It effectively captures bidder interaction relationships, significantly enhancing the detection of malicious behavior.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionThe integration of deep learning models into Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) has shown promising advancements in distinguishing normal network traffic from cyber-attacks due to their capability to learn complex non-linear patterns. These approaches typically rely on both benign and malicious network traffic during training. However, in many organizations, collecting malicious traffic is challenging due to privacy restrictions, high costs of manual labeling, and requirement for advanced security expertise.MethodsIn this study, we introduce a deep one-class classification model that is trained exclusively on flow-based benign network traffic data, with the goal of identifying attacks during inference. The proposed anomaly detection model consists of two steps, a One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) and a deep AutoEncoder (AE). While autoencoders have shown great potential in anomaly detection, their effectiveness can be undermined by spurious network activity located on the boundaries of their discriminating capabilities, thus failing to identify malicious behavior. Our model leverages the topological structure of the OC-SVM to generate decision scores for each traffic flow, which are subsequently incorporated into an autoencoder as part of the input feature space.ResultsThis approach enhances the ability of the autoencoder to detect incidents that deviate from normal patterns. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic method for tuning the trade-off parameter of the OC-SVM, based only on one-class data, achieving comparable performance to grid-based methods that require both benign and malicious labeled data. Experimental results on a benchmark network intrusion data set, the UNSW-NB15, suggest that OCSVM-AE performs well on unseen attacks and is more effective than traditional and deep-learning based one-class classifiers.DiscussionThe method makes no specific assumptions about the data distribution, making it broadly applicable and suitable as a complementary tool to signature-based intrusion detection systems.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionWith the recent breakthroughs in driving automation and the development of smart vehicles, human-technology interaction issues, such as detecting comfort levels in automated driving, have been gaining increasing attention. Given the evidence of discomfort levels being an evolving psychological state in time, the tracking of discomfort levels for passengers of an automated vehicle can be considered a time-varying phenomenon.MethodsWe assessed a passenger's discomfort level in a smart, automated vehicle using physiological, environmental, and vehicle automation features from different sensors. Our approach is to dynamically predict discomfort levels using time-dependent models, particularly the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), an advanced attention-based deep learning architecture providing an interpretable explanation of temporal dynamics as well as high-performance forecasting over multiple horizons. The models are trained and evaluated using a dataset of 100 participants of a simulated automated driving experiment, during which they signaled their level of discomfort using a manual device. Two TFT models, TFT-full and TFT-restricted, are investigated depending on which physiological, environmental, and vehicle automation signals are used as inputs. The results are compared with the auto-regressive model DeepAR. Different window sizes are used to analyze the impact of the window size on the model's performance.ResultsAmong the tested models, TFT-restricted with a window size of 300-time steps (about 5 s) demonstrates the best performance in predicting discomfort levels on our data, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.037 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.131.DiscussionIn our study, TFT-restricted outperformed TFT-full and the autoregressive model DeepAR in discomfort prediction, delivering superior results for all metrics. Finally, our study shows that the TFT can capture temporal dependencies in the data and help us interpret the model for detecting discomfort, which is essential for analyzing and improving people's acceptance of automated vehicles.},

Social information processing theory explains that virtual communication can be just as effective as face-to-face communication if communicators understand how to adapt their communication to the virtual channel. This study seeks to better understand the roles of camera distance and gestures in adapting lectures to virtual classrooms. An experiment examined the impact of student gender, camera distance from the instructor, and gesture use on instructor credibility, as measured by caring, competence, and trustworthiness. The results indicate that while camera distance did not impact students’ perceptions of instructor competence, the absence of gestures did impact how trustworthy and caring male students perceived the instructor to be. In the absence of gestures, male students perceived the instructor to be less caring and trustworthy. This indicates that instructors should make efforts to speak with gestures in virtual lectures, especially for male students, just as they do in the traditional classroom.},

Many prevailing works have utilized Uniform Resource Locator (URL) links and Document Object Model (DOM) tree structures for Phishing Website Detection (PWD). However, since phishing websites imitate legitimate websites, these approaches often produce inaccurate detection results.MethodsTo enhance detection efficiency, we propose a PWD system that focuses on important website features and components. The process begins with collecting URL links from phishing website datasets, followed by the generation of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) formats. A DOM tree structure is then constructed from the HTML, and components are extracted along with Natural Language Processing (NLP) features, credentials, URL, DOM tree similarity, and component features. The DOM-tree components are converted into score values using Feature Hasher-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (FH-BERT). These score values are fused with component features, and significant features are selected using an Entropy-based Chameleon Swarm Algorithm (ECSA).ResultsThe final classification is performed by Scaled Exponential Linear Unit Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (SELU-CRNN). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique improves PWD performance, achieving higher accuracy (98.42%) and reduced training time (63,003 ms) compared to prevailing methods.DiscussionBy integrating component, semantic, and structural features, the proposed model enhances both robustness and efficiency, making it an effective solution for phishing website detection.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of misinformation on social media threatens public trust, public health, and democratic processes. We propose three models that analyze fake news propagation and evaluate intervention strategies. Grounded in epidemiological dynamics, the models include: (1) a baseline Awareness Spread Model (ASM), (2) an Extended Model with fact-checking (EM), and (3) a Generative AI-Influenced Spread model (GIFS). Each incorporates user behavior, platform-specific dynamics, and cognitive biases such as confirmation bias and emotional contagion. We simulate six distinct scenarios: (1) Accurate Content Environment, (2) Peer Network Dynamics, (3) Emotional Engagement, (4) Belief Alignment, (5) Source Trust, and (6) Platform Intervention. All models converge to a single, stable equilibrium. Sensitivity analysis across key parameters confirms model robustness and generalizability. In the ASM, forwarding rates were lowest in scenarios 1, 4, and 6 (1.47%, 3.41%, 2.95%) and significantly higher in 2, 3, and 5 (19.67%, 56.52%, 29.47%). The EM showed that fact-checking reduced spread to as low as 0.73%, with scenario-based variation from 1.16 to 17.47%. The GIFS model revealed that generative AI amplified spread by 5.7%–37.8%, depending on context. ASM highlights the importance of awareness; EM demonstrates the effectiveness of fact-checking mechanisms; GIFS underscores the amplifying impact of generative AI tools. Early intervention, coupled with targeted platform moderation (scenarios 1, 4, 6), consistently yields the lowest misinformation spread, while emotionally resonant content (scenario 3) consistently drives the highest propagation.},
