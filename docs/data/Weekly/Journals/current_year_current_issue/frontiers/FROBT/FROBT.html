  abstract     = {INTRODUCTION First published in 2015, the United Nations announced 17 Sustainable Development Goals [UN SDG] as part of their 2030 agenda for sustainable development providing a "plan of action for people, planet and prosperity" UN2 (2015). SDG 12 aims to "ensure sustainable production and consumption patterns" to tackle the impacts of open loop consumption UN2 (2015). These impacts include climate change, biodiversity loss and deforestation, and pollution which harms people, animals and habitats UN2 (2015); Dauvergne and Lister (2010); Carlisle and Hanlon (2007). With 80 percent of a product's environmental impact decided during the design and development phases of a product's life cycle Charter (2019) and human open-loop consumption impacting so heavily on climate change Łukasz Kurowski et al. (2022), building sustainable consumption patterns requires the buy-in and leadership of the product manufacturers to develop systems which are better suited to closed-loop consumption, also referred to as the 'Circular Economy'UKR (2021); Elzinga et al. (2020). Many electronic product manufacturers rely on the concept of recycling as a method to tackle open-loop consumption. However, across the globe, there is evidence of huge inefficiencies in the process of recycling. Globally, in 2019, only 17.4 percent of electronic waste created annually was recycled through formally managed systems Forti et al. (2020). Individuals living within the EU produce the highest levels of e-waste globally at 16.2kgs per capita per year Forti et al. (2020). Recycling rates are also highest in the EU, though rates only reach 42.5 percent Forti et al. (2020). In comparison, annually (in 2019), individuals in Oceania produce 16.1 kgs per capita and recycled 8.8 percent, in the Americas they produced 13.3 kg per capita and recycled 9.4 percent, Asia produced 5.6 kg per capita and formally recycled 11.7 percent, while in Africa per capita, e-waste production annually was 2.5 kg and recycling rates were 0.9 percent Forti et al. (2020). Consumer robots, generally being systems which require electrical current or electromagnetic fields to meet their functional purpose, could be considered as Electronic or Electrical Equipment [EEE] under the current standard accepted definition 200 (2003). Therefore, when a consumer robot reaches the end of its useful life it will also then be classed as Waste Electronic or Electrical Equipment [WEEE], also known as e-waste. And, taking the global data for recycling rates of other electronic products, it would be reasonable to assume that, without specific intervention from the robotics industry, recycling rates for robotic systems will be similarly low to those seen for other types of e-waste due to the consistently poor actions and habits of the general population in managing e-waste from the home. Alternatives to recycling and landfill for robotic systems are; repurposing, reusing, remanufacturing, reconditioning and repairing the systems at the end of their primary life. These options extend beyond the traditional 3 R's: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle HMG (2018), recognising the additional alternatives of Repair, Reconditioning, Remanufacturing and Repurposing. Reuse, recondition and repair are well-established processes; remanufacturing is a less common but well-documented method outside of the robotics industry for breaking down a system to component level and rebuilding it as new Nasr (2019); Steinhilper (1998); Steinhilper et al. (2017); while repurposing is a new concept for robotic systems which is under investigation by the authors of this paper McGloin et al. (2023). Each of these alternative methods to recycling aims to increase the working life of a product, which in turn reduces waste production by delaying the time until the system needs to be recycled or sent to landfill, and forms the basis of a circular economy (UN SDG #12). In addition to this, the forming of a circular economy for robotic products for domestic settings will also; increase accessibility to technology through opportunities for lower-cost second-hand systems (UN SDG #8); reduce deforestation of land used for mining materials needed for production (UN SDG #15) and reduce emissions associated with the production of electronic products such as robots (UN SDG #13). However, a critical element in making a circular economy viable lies in the participation of consumers in this business model and the ability to sell the resultant second-hand product to customers Elzinga et al. (2020). Consumers often require both push and pull influence factors to be in place to overcome established habits and be persuaded to purchase second-hand over new products Hazen et al. (2017). Push factors include the opportunity to purchase second-hand products at favourable rates to new ones, and the introduction of laws driving consumer habit changes. Pull factors might include tax breaks, government-or business-led incentives, and the purchaser's personal perspective on environmental issues Hazen et al. (2017); Łukasz Kurowski et al. (2022). Additionally, social media may create both push and pull influence factors for consumer purchasing habits. The aim of this study, therefore, was to assess the difference in consumer attitudes towards the purchase of new and second-hand robotic systems for domestic settings and to identify key factors which could progress or hinder the uptake of second-hand robots amongst potential users of robots for the home. This research was carried out using a survey method described in Section 2. Understanding potential consumer behaviours towards second-hand robotic systems provides an opportunity for researchers, developers and manufacturers of robots for the home to build more sustainable practices into the products they create before they become ubiquitous. Once in an accepted ubiquitous state, lock-in factors inhibit changes by both consumers and the Original Equipment Manufacturers from easily making more sustainable practice choices Aminoff and Sundqvist-Andberg (2021); Mac (2023). Additionally, the results of this research are part of a wider program which is also investigating the attitudes of the robotics industry towards sustainability, and the reuse and repurposing of robotic systems. The results of the industrial attitudes research will be presented in a separate paper. METHODOLOGY 2.1 Research Aim The aim of this research was to assess consumer interest in second-hand robots - such as those which have been reconditioned or repurposed, in comparison to new systems, and to identify key factors which could affect the uptake of second-hand systems. In order to meet the aims of the study, an appropriate research philosophy was selected (Section 2.2) which influenced the development of the study design (Section 2.3). Data was then collected (Section 3) and analysed (Section 4), with conclusions being presented in Section 5. 2.2 Research Methodology Saunders et al. (2019) present the 'research onion' (Figure 1) which summarises the methodological choices, strategies, data collection and analysis methods, which together form the widely accepted methodologies used in research strategies. The methodologies utilised in this research were; An Inductive research approach due to there being limited existing data available from the robotics field that could produce a theory which might, in turn, validate or invalidate a hypothesis based on the data collected. A survey method for data collection was selected as very few people already own robots, so observational data could not be collected for the purpose of this research. Instead, data collection relied on participants' opinions based on the information provided to them and utilised a Likert Scale system with free-text open-response questions for additional participant responses. Likert Scales were selected because they are easy for participants to use, resulting in increased response rates and reliability Jupp (2006). Quantitative analysis methods were selected for the Likert Scale survey data which was then transcribed from ordinal data to interval data during the analysis process. This transcription allows for the conversion of the opinions of participants into numerical-based data Fleetwood (2014). Figure 1. The 'research onion' (pg 130 Saunders et al. (2019).

The research onion is © 2018 Mark Saunders, Philip Lewis and Adrian Thornhill and is reproduced in this article with their written permission Qualitative analysis methods were selected for the analysis of the free-text survey responses via Thematic analysis which aims to understand the core themes presented both in a participant's individual responses and also between participants' responses Bryman (2016). 2.3 Study Design Following the selection of the research methodology (Section 2.2), a survey was developed which was designed for access by the general public via the Qualtrics online platform. The survey was divided into the following sections: • Demographics and lifestyle factors - individuals were required to provide demographic data such as age range and country of residence, alongside a broad range of personal lifestyle indicator factors that the research team felt could influence the likelihood of uptake second-hand robotics. These lifestyle factors included attitudes to environmental topics, home ownership status, prior ownership of robotic systems in the home, uptake of internet-enabled technology devices in the home and previous purchasing decisions for home technology. In this survey, internet-enabled devices were defined as a device which requires connection to WiFi or mobile data in order to function, but does not include mobile phones, laptops, computers or tablets. All questions in this section provided participants with multiple-choice options for their responses. A concentration test question was also placed at the end of this section, to reduce the effect of random selection responses. • Purchasing attitudes - participants were presented with a variety of robot types that could possibly be purchased in the future via different purchasing conditions; new, second-hand with a guarantee, and second-hand without a guarantee. For each robot type, a short description was given, and examples were also provided (see Figure 2). Participants were then asked for their opinions on if they would or would not be inclined to purchase the robots in the different purchase conditions. The proposed robot types included; robots used to provide security, perform household chores, to have as pets, work Figure 2. Types of consumer robots presented to participants in the online survey, along with examples of each robot type. Note, graphic not used in survey, only wording. as personal assistants, and act as health and fitness instructors. Participants were asked to respond to questions using a 3-point Likert Scale to demonstrate their interest in a given system. • Concern factors - for each purchase condition, (new, second-hand with a guarantee and second-hand without a guarantee) participants were asked to rate their concern levels on a 5-point Likert scale for factors including cost, security, environmental impact and safety. The 5 -point Likert Scale gave participants the option to respond Very Concerned, Slightly Concerned, Neutral, Slightly Unconcerned and Unconcerned for a given factor. In addition to this, a free-text answer box was provided to collect additional comments from participants. Lastly, the participant survey design included the presentation of a downloadable participant information sheet and a data privacy policy. 2.4 Data collection and analysis procedure The participant study gained ethical approval through the University of West England. Following this, the study was shared through both social media platforms and via surveycircle - a website for finding survey participants. The survey was open to any individual who was over the age of 18 years old and consented to take part in the research. The responses submitted by participants were checked and rendered anonymous after 7 days. Excel was used to analyse the demographic and Likert scale data, while NViVo was utilised for the analysis of free-text responses. The Nvivo analysis followed a Thematic approach (as described in Section 2.2). The method to complete the thematic analysis within Nvivo was: • Phase I – Open Coding: this required the line-by-line analysis of raw data (from the survey free-text responses) to draw out concepts presented within the data Khaksar et al. (2015); Charmaz (2006). The purpose of this phase was to find meaning and actions behind the words given by the participant. Each concept was labelled (referred to as a code), to enable repeating concepts to be highlighted under the same code Hutchison et al. (2010). At this stage it was expected that as wide a range of coded concepts be identified as possible since fitting answers under pre-existing data labels would limit the analysis and stop new ideas from emerging Charmaz (2006)). The codes were considered provisional and could be amended at any time. The overall aim was to "make the codes fit the data" rather than "forcing the data to fit" the codes Charmaz (2006). • Phase II – Thematic framework: during this phase, codes were grouped into categories and sub-categories and the links between the codes which form categories were noted Khaksar et al. (2015). In this way, the data which was analysed at a line-for-line level in the open coding was brought back together and reassembled by identifying the connections between the codes Hutchison et al. (2010), thereby highlighting the key themes in the research. 2.5 Participant demographics and Lifestyle factors A total of 111 individuals responded to the online survey, including responses from 16 individuals who did not fully complete the survey and whose responses were removed from further data analysis. Of the remaining responses, 72 were from individuals in the UK and 23 were from individuals outside of the UK. Those responses from individuals outside of the UK covered 9 different countries and, for the purpose of the study presented within this paper, were not included in the data analysis set due to the small sample size. Age group (years) 18-25 26-35 36-45 46-55 56-65 66-75 76+ Survey Participants, n=72 13% 29% 21% 11% 18% 7% 1% UK Population Sta (2021) 11% 17% 16% 16% 16% 13% 12% Table 1. Percentage of population in each age group (listed in years) Of the 72 responses from UK residents carried forward for analysis, 60 percent of participants were female, compared to 51 percent of the UK populationGov (2018). A comparison of the age demographic of the survey participants versus the UK population is shown in Table 1. The age group with the greatest over-representation in comparison to the UK population was those aged 26-35, while the greatest underrepresentation was in the 76+ age group which highlights the limitation of using online platforms to both advertise and complete the survey. Additionally, the participants for the study represented the following demographics: • Home ownership rate - 67 percent of participants lived in owned (with or without a mortgage) accommodation, versus 63 percent of people in the UK Gov (2020). • At-home dependants - 29 percent of participants lived in homes with children under the age of 18 in them, compared to 45 percent of people in the UK living in households containing one or more dependant child ONS (2022). • Climate emergency beliefs - 96 percent of participants who completed the survey selected that they believe there is a climate emergency, versus 71 percent in the general UK population Booth-Dale (2022). RESULTS 3.1 Purchasing habits by consumers for non-robotic products To better understand the attitudes of participants towards second-hand robots, prior electronic purchasing habits were investigated as part of the participant demographics. Excluding mobile phones and laptops, Figure 3. Conditions which participants bought other electronic items participants were asked for the number of internet-enabled devices in their homes. The results of this are shown in table 2. Number of internet-enabled devices zero 1-3 4-6 7-9 10+ Percentage of participants (n=72) 15% 47% 21% 4% 13% Table 2. Numbers of Internet-enabled devices in the homes of participants The majority of participants (47 percent) owned one to three internet-enabled devices in their homes, while only 15 percent did not own any internet-enabled devices. Those without internet-enabled devices were generally women (23 percent of the women surveyed did not have internet-enabled devices in the home compared to 4 percent of men). Participants' willingness to purchase second-hand electronics was established through survey questions which required them to identify the condition in which they last bought a given type of electronic device (Figure 3). Purchase of electronics second-hand with guarantees was highest for the items in which there are multiple outlets available to make that type of purchase, such as mobile phones and laptops. Overall, second-hand purchases (with or without a guarantee) accounted for 23 percent of mobile phone purchases, 22 percent of TV or games console purchases, 18 percent of laptop or computer or tablet purchases, 10 percent of internet-enabled security devices and 9 percent of thermostat purchases. The only category where no participants had bought second-hand devices was the smart assistant devices (such as Amazon Echo or Google Home). Ownership levels for the different electronic devices varied, with all participants owning a mobile phone and only a single participant not owning a laptop, computer or tablet. 17 percent of respondents indicated they had not purchased a TV or games console, with 27, 59 and 70 percent of participants respectively indicating they had not purchased electronic thermostats, smart assistance devices and internet-enabled security devices. It should be noted though that TV ownership in the UK shows only 3 percent of households in the UK do not have a TV Sta (2022) compared to the 17 percent of survey participants. However, Sta (2022) statistics do highlight that only 70 percent of UK households own a smart TV. It is possible that either the participants had lower TV ownership than in comparison to the UK, or, more likely, that the writing of the survey did not highlight that the TV did not need to be internet-enabled and this requirement was assumed by participants due to the prior question on internet-enabled devices. Consumer attitudes towards purchasing of second-hand robots Across all robot types presented to participants, 27 percent of participants indicated they would purchase a robot new, 27 percent would purchase one second-hand with a guarantee but only 10 percent would purchase one without a guarantee. The specific type of consumer robot presented to the participants affected the indicated purchase rate, with the highest interest seen for household chores robots at 64 percent for a new system, and the least interest was shown for a second-hand pet robot without a guarantee at 3 percent of participants indicating they would be willing to purchase such a system. In Figure 4 the purchase indication rates for each robot type and condition are presented. Figure 4. Purchase indication by participants for a given robot type, based on the purchase conditions: New, Second-hand with guarantee [2nd w guarantee], Second-hand without guarantee [2nd w/o guarantee] For each demographic and lifestyle factor surveyed, the percentage of participants in each group indicating they would purchase a robot for a given sale condition is shown in Figure 5a, and is detailed in the Supplementary Material along with numbers for participants responding they were 'unsure' if they would purchase a robot of a given category. Women were more likely than men to indicate a positive response towards purchasing a robot, regardless of the condition, and those without children were also more likely to purchase a robot in all condition types. Interest in the purchase of new systems new generally decreased with age, with a 52 percent interest for those aged 18-25 years, down to 11 percent for those aged 66+. Only those aged 36-45 did not follow this trend, with their interest levels being 4 percent lower than for 56-65 year olds. Individuals were also more likely to select that they would purchase a new or second-hand robotic system if they already owned a robot in the home (such as a vacuum cleaner or lawn mower) compared to those who did not. Figure 5a. Participants responding positively to purchase a robot in a given condition Figure 5b. Combined responses for participants responding positively and unsure to purchase a robot in a given condition Figure 5. Effect of demographics on participants responding if they would purchase a robot based on the purchase conditions: New, Second-hand with guarantee, Second-hand without guarantee. Notes: [a] Prior ownership includes vacuum or mower-type robotic systems for the home. [b] Numbers of internet-enabled devices includes connected devices already in the home] Generally, a +/- 3 percent difference was seen when comparing the attitudes of participants to new robots, to second-hand robotic systems with guarantees. Exceptions to this were for those aged 18-25 which had a drop of 11 percent between new and second-hand with guarantee, the age category 66+ years which saw an 8 percent increase, prior ownership of robots which had a 7 percent increase and those with 7 or more internet-enabled devices in the home which had a 6 percent increase respectively. Across all factors and purchase conditions investigated the most popular type of robot was a robot for household chores, generally followed by robots for security systems. Only in the second-hand with no guarantee condition were robotic security systems not the second-place preference option. Instead no trends were found shown in the responses across demographic factors for this condition, beyond the initial preference by participants for household chore robots. Combining the positive and neutral responses (Figure 5) resulted in response rates of over 40 percent for new robots in all demographic categories except those aged 56-65 and 66+. The same trend was seen for second-hand robots with guarantees but with the addition of those who have 1-3 internet-enabled devices in the home having a response rate of 39 percent. 3.3 Concern factors for consumers when purchasing second-hand robots In addition to providing purchase indicators, concern factors recorded on a Likert scale were provided by participants. The response options were very concerned, slightly concerned, neutral, slightly unconcerned and unconcerned. Table 3 summarises the percentage of respondents selecting Very or Slightly concerned for each factor. The breakdown of the remaining Likert scale responses is given in the Supplementary Material. Purchase New Secondhand with guarantee Secondhand no guarantee Cost of purchase 90% 88% 76% Cost to maintain 83% 89% 92% Physical safety for people in the home 56% 67% 69% Physical damage to the home 58% 64% 71% Data security for people in the home 85% 90% 86% Manufacturing environmental impact 72% 63% 65% Environmental impact of disposal 82% 78% 72% Table 3. Percentage of participants selecting 'Very concerned' or 'Slightly concerned' for each factor described, based on a robot's sale condition Those who own robots were generally less concerned by these factors than those who did not own robots. The greatest difference in responses of very or slightly concerned to new, second-hand with guarantee, and second-hand without guarantee was for the factors: • Physical safety for people in the home (19, 32 and 35 percent difference respectively) • Physical damage to the home (22, 17, 24 percent difference respectively) The only instances where those who own robots had a greater level of concern shown than those who did not own robots were; the cost to maintain second-hand robots without guarantees (10 percent higher), the security of personal data and the environmental manufacturing impact on new robotic systems (6 and 8 percent higher). Figure 6. Graph of the number of coding references for each theme identified during the qualitative analysis Of the 72 participants in the study, 19 provided responses in the free-text sections of the survey requesting additional comments relating to concerns which had not been highlighted in the Likert Scale responses. Qualitative analysis of those free-text responses from participants identified over 32 additional areas of concern (codes), which together formed 8 key themes: • Concerns about the appearance of a robot • Concerns around the purchasing source and guarantees for robots • Concerns about the cost of a robot across its life-cycle • Negative effects of robots on people during the robots use • Concerns relating to the technical capability of robots • Concerns around data security and privacy for robot owners • People not wanting, or not able, to operate robots • Impacts on society of greater robot use Figure 6 summarises the number of references given for each of the themes identified, split by the condition of purchase. The theme with the greatest level of responses was those not wanting or not able to operate robots with comments from participants including; "I can't imagine a circumstance where I would buy a new robot for my home." [Participant #22], and concern about the purchase being "complicated operation or setting up of a unit" [Participant #25]. For new robots, the second greatest number of responses were related to the technical capability of the systems purchased. Comments within this theme included: "Could it cope with an old cottage with uneven floors" [Participant #18] and "How well would it actually do the job I purchased it to do?" [Participant #38]. For second-hand robots, both those with a guarantee and those without, respondents' key concern centred on the purchasing source, continued support for the systems and guarantees relating to the second-hand product. Examples included; "problems with robot not identified or lied about" [Participant #59, comments for second-hand robots with no guarantee], "Spares and support. Mobiles are only supported for a few years. Given the likely cost of a robot I'd want 15 years or more, like cars." [Participant #9, with guarantee], and "Credibility and viability of the organisation supporting product/guarantee" [Participant #56, with guarantee]. A variety of factors relating to cost were highlighted in the responses across all three robot conditions (new, second-hand and second-hand with guarantees), with concerns about ongoing maintenance, energy consumption and resale costs highlighted. Participants' comments relating to the cost of systems included; "whether I would use it enough to justify buying it" [Participant #19, new robots], "I could be spending a lot of money and have no means of refund or exchange if the robot went wrong or ceased to work." [Participant #38, second-hand no guarantee robots], "device energy consumption" [Participant #2 - new] and "cost of software updates" [Participant #20 - both new and second-hand with guarantee robots]. 3.4 Comparison of purchasing indications for robots to other electronic products Participant responses regarding concern levels for environmental issues were compared to robot purchasing conditions (shown in Figure 7). Those who indicated concern for e-waste levels were less likely to respond positively about purchasing new and second-hand robot products than those who indicated they were neutral towards concerns about e-waste. In comparison, those who were concerned about plastic waste levels were slightly more likely to respond positively about purchasing new and second-hand robot products than those who indicated they were neutral towards concerns about plastic waste levels. It was not possible to compare these results to responses about concern levels for the Climate Crisis, Deforestation and Pollution as the numbers responding neutral or unconcerned to these topics accounted for only 4 percent of the respondents (or 3 individual participants). Future surveys would need to address the recruitment and self-selection process found in this research that resulted in the majority of participants having high concern levels for topics such as the climate crisis, and therefore making sample sizes for those responding neutral or unconcerned too small to review. Figure 7 also presents how the response by the participant on the last condition they purchased a mobile phone, laptop and games console affected their purchasing indications for robots in a given condition. Participants who had bought games consoles second-hand without a guarantee were more likely to positively respond to purchasing a robot in any condition type, while the opposite was true for those buying laptops new who had a higher robot purchase indication rate than for those who bought laptops refurbished with guarantees. Supporting data for all figures included in section 3 is included in the Supplementary Data. DISCUSSION 4.1 Consumer attitudes towards purchasing of second-hand robots Consumer attitudes towards the purchase of second-hand robots with a guarantee matched interest levels for new systems at 27 percent, while only 10 percent of participants indicated a purchase possibility when there was no guarantee offered. Equal favourability for new and second-hand with guarantee robots does suggest that there is an opportunity for the sale of systems in both conditions. To enable the sale of second-hand systems though, vendors require the return of old systems at the end of their life requiring the industry to consider this in their business models. Elzinga et al. (2020) presents research into three business models for the electronics industry consumer circular economy; take-back management, product Figure 7. Effect of environmental lifestyle factors on participants responding if they would purchase a robot based on the purchase conditions: New, Second-hand with guarantee, Second-hand without guarantee. lease and pay-per-use, with take-back management the most popular option with consumers. The take-back management business model requires businesses to re-obtain ownership of products through collection points, with consumers incentivised to take part through payment schemes or fees Elzinga et al. (2020). This suggests that use of a take-back management scheme within the robotics industry will result in additional sales for robot manufacturers through the reconditioning and resale of second-hand systems, enabling a more circular economy. The success of a take-back management scheme for the robotics industry would require easily accessible return points and well-communicated returns processes. These are particularly important to the electronics industry, where long-term storage of small household electronics regularly occurs and is a key barrier to electronics recovery Wilson et al. (2017). This process, also referred to as the hibernation phase of electronics ownership Murakami et al. (2010), is a well-documented consumer behaviour in developed countries. 70 percent of consumer e-waste was placed in hibernation for three to five years by consumers in the US Babu et al. (2007), while consumers in the UK stored mobile phones for an average of 3 years Wilson et al. (2017), and in a study of residents in a city in Finland - 70 percent of participants retained their mobile phone for a period of time after they had no primary use for it in a study Yl¨a-Mella et al. (2015). When considering the different types of robots presented to participants, interest was highest for robots which were able to complete household chores, followed by robots performing security roles. Overall interest levels amongst participants for new and second-hand with guarantee robots for chores were 62 percent and 58 percent respectively, while security robots had interest levels of 37 and 32 percent respectively. These results are comparable with the Nitto et al. (2017) study found that 50 percent of consumers in the US were interested in robots that would help with either household chores or security. This study did find though that levels of interest varied by country of residents, with 34 percent of residents of Germany and only 19 percent of residents from Japan indicating they would be interested in purchasing a robot within the next 5 years. Robots used as pets were the least popular across all sale condition types, with a second-hand pet robot with no guarantee interesting only 3 percent of respondents. This was followed by robots for entertainment which had similar rates for new and second-hand with guarantee systems as pet robots, but a slightly higher interest in second-hand systems at 7 percent. Again, the Nitto et al. (2017) study noted that "when it comes to leisure, time spent with friends or caring for pets and children, American consumers are noticeably less interested in being involved with robots", confirming the findings of this study. Only robots used for entertainment, or for health & fitness, saw the rate of interest increase for a secondhand robot with a guarantee over a new robot, with the remaining categories seeing a decrease between the buying conditions. It is possible that due to the second-hand market for non-robotic technologies for both entertainment and fitness already being well established, there is a greater openness amongst participants to see second-hand robots in these sectors. Demographics which most influenced a survey participants' interest in purchasing new robots were age and prior ownership of robotic systems such as vacuums or mowers. 60 percent of those aged 18-25, and 37 percent of those previously owning a robotic system would purchase a robot new. Only those aged 66 and over were more likely to show an interest in purchasing a second-hand system (with or without a guarantee) rather than a new system. These results differed from those in the P´erez-Belis et al. (2017) study on consumer attitudes in Spain towards second-hand EEE purchases for the home which found that older consumers and women were more likely to repair small household EEE, while men and those from medium-income families were more likely to purchase second-hand small household EEE. To better understand participants' responses to second-hand robots, this survey also reviewed their prior purchasing habits of internet-enabled devices such as mobile phones, games consoles, personal assistant speakers and internet-enabled security doorbells or CCTV. For participants in this survey, 22 percent had owned a second-hand mobile phone and, of those who owned laptops, games consoles, and internet-enabled security systems, the percentage who had those products second-hand was 18, 22 and 10 percent respectively. These results are consistent with data and research into the second-hand market for mobile phones. In 2016 second-hand smartphones accounted for 7 percent of the global sales market and was expected to see increases in sales 4 to 5 times quicker than new phones Del (2016). In addition, it has been well-documented that mobile phones are passed on to friends and family members outside of global sales, adding to the total number of second-hand devices in use. Wieser and Tr¨oger (2016) summarises that 13 to 28 percent of all smartphones are passed onto family members or charity at their replacement point. In comparison, overall purchase rates of other second-hand small household electronics has been shown to be much lower. Overall the P´erez-Belis et al. (2017) study found only 0.75 percent of participants had bought second-hand small electronics for the home at any time where the electronics in the study included items such as vacuums, blenders, toasters and kettles. Therefore, recognising that consumer attitudes in this study showed equal interest in purchasing new robotic systems to second-hand robots with guarantees, it may be possible for the robotics industry to aim for the higher levels of second-hand device sales seen for internet-enabled devices such as mobile phones and game consoles than for the lower rates seen for standard electrical household goods. The results of this survey were not able to show a direct relation between participants who had previously bought other second-hand electronics, and those more willing to buy second-hand robots. This may be due to ownership levels of robots for the home being so low still that the responses of participants were not influenced by their attitudes towards other types of second-hand electronics. 4.2 Concern factors for consumers when purchasing second-hand robots In the Yl¨a-Mella et al. (2015) study of consumer perceptions towards second-hand mobile phones, concerns raised by participants as reasons for not purchasing second-hand mobile phones included reliability of the product (47 percent of respondents), short life-cycle (32 percent), availability of existing budget models (32 percent) and lack of warranty (16 percent). In comparison, this study yielded much higher concern rates, with concerns rates as high as 90 percent relating to the cost of purchasing new robots. Of the factors assessed by the Likert Scale responses in the survey, the lowest concern rate was still for robots carrying out physical damage to the home but this was still at 56 percent for new systems. Comparing ownership rates for consumer electronics within this survey only 14 percent of respondents owned a robot for the home, while 100 percent of respondents had a mobile phone. This disparity in ownership, and the relative newness of the robotics market will likely have affected concern levels for the robotic systems compared to other electronic devices. It should be noted though that even amongst robot owners in this survey, concern levels remained high, with their concern rate being 6, 8 and 10 percent higher than for those without prior robot ownership for factors of security of personal data (new), the environmental impact of manufacture (new) and cost of maintenance (2nd-hand without guarantee), highlighting the current realities of robot ownership. Participants of the survey indicated the same levels of concern toward cost for both new and second-hand systems. This suggests that consumers may need to recognise significant cost advantages in secondhand robots in order to purchase them over new. This is reflected in the findings of Hazen et al. (2017) which highlights the need for push factors to influence the uptake by consumers in purchasing of other manufactured technology goods. In addition to push factors affecting consumer choice in the purchase condition of electronics, pull factors such as the individual perception of environmental concerns can influence the uptake of second-hand goods Hazen et al. (2017). In this survey, 97 percent of the respondents agreed there was a climate emergency. This resulted in a too-small sample size for those that do not believe there is a climate emergency in order to compare the two demographics. However, across the survey participants, levels of concern decreased when participants considered the environmental impact involved in the manufacture of new to second-hand and second-hand without guarantee condition robots. Where consumers show a greater understanding of climate change and its impact, consumers are more likely to partake in a pro-climate consumer society Łukasz Kurowski et al. (2022). The results of this survey suggest highlighting the reduction in manufacturing impact through the reuse of robotic systems should result in positive consumer behaviour towards these second-hand products. It should be noted though that in comparison, concerns about the environmental impact of disposal increased across the purchase conditions. The researchers were not able to conclude from the data why this environmental concern had an opposite result to the manufacturing concern factor. Further investigation would be needed to understand this result. Further to the responses from the Likert Scale concern factors, the qualitative results raised additional concerns by participants around the performance of new and second-hand systems, maintainability of secondhand systems, and methods of insurance and liability of systems without a guarantee. The topics raised as additional areas of concern in the qualitative analysis revealed that some topics were universal to robots in the home, regardless of the purchasing condition. This included the performance of the robots, and more fundamentally, trust in any robotic system coming into the home. Much as Miglani and Hensman (2016) highlights the ethical and technical considerations for software used in robots in the home, participants of this survey raised concerns regarding data security. The number of such concerns increased for second-hand systems and included issues around software obsolescence, the introduction of viruses and access to prior owners' data. The theme of obsolescence was also raised in relation to the physical system, and the effect that buying a second-hand system might have on access to upgrades and the associated costs of upkeep. These concerns were in line with findings from research into other types of second-hand electronics. The P´erez-Belis et al. (2017) study found reasons for not purchasing second-hand electronics included cleanliness and hygiene concerns, minimal cost savings for second-hand systems over new, lack of knowledge of where to purchase second-hand devices, lack of repair guarantees and perceptions of low durability for second-hand systems. With many of these themes also appearing in this research, findings from other consumer electronic studies can be used to influence the robotics industry too. While this study has placed emphasis on the role of the robotics industry in creating and maintaining a circular economy for products, inaction by consumers must still be considered. P´erez-Belis et al. (2017) notes that while product ecodesign is central to a circular economy and requires manufacturers to design more 'durable, easier to repair, reuse or recycle products', attitudes of consumers towards electronics at the end of their primary life must also be tackled. General consumers will either dispose of the e-waste in the bin instead of through dedicated WEEE recycling bins or schemes due to the relatively small size of many EEE products, or they will store the e-waste at homeP´erez-Belis et al. (2017). This tendency for incorrect management of electronic waste at the end of its life was highlighted in the introduction to this paper (Section 1. The qualitative analysis highlighted a number of participants who registered no interest in purchasing any robotic system for the home, regardless of buying condition. It is inefficient to work towards creating solutions for those unlikely to ever purchase a robot, let alone a second-hand robot. Fiorini et al. (2022) describes how participant curiosity in the technology supports greater uptake of participants; addressing this in future studies, for this topic may provide a greater and more instructive yield in results. 4.3 Evaluation of the surveying process Reviewing the outcome of the participant demographics it was noted that participants with children in the home, those aged 66 and over, and those who do not believe there is a climate emergency were underrepresented in this survey in comparison to the UK population. This is a reflection that this survey partially relied on convenience sampling methods Bryman (2016) - where participants were those most available to the research team, in this case, through the publication of the request for participants via social media channels. This will likely have resulted in a more homogeneous demographic than a quota sampling system that would have produced Bryman (2016). Some effort was taken to widen the scope of participants through the use of the online Surveycircle platform, however, this platform is generally used by students and researchers, again resulting in some homogeneous traits and self-selection for participation based on interest in the topic. Results presented in Section 3 cannot, therefore, be generalised to be representative of the UK population, but do form indicating factors which was the requirement of the research process. There were higher response levels for comments for the new robot purchase condition than second-hand conditions, despite concern levels being higher in the Likert scales for second-hand. This suggests that either the Likert Scales better-encapsulated concern factors for participants or participants spent time considering responses for this category and may not have wanted to repeat themselves for the other conditions. Only in one example did the respondent choose to copy and paste their response from one robot condition to another. The survey design for the free-text component section of the data collection could have therefore been improved by providing participants with the option to indicate the responses additionally applied to other conditions of purchase. Additionally, with limited numbers of free-text responses, motivations for purchasing habits were not explored in great detail in this paper. Future surveys could utilise follow-up interviews or additional questioning to improve on the use of free-text comments in this survey design. While Likert Scales were used in the survey due to their ease of use and expected increased response rates, issues with using these types of scales include response acquiescence and social desirability. Acquiescence results in participants selecting results which they think are the correct answer, while social desirability causes users to select responses that make them look better for greater social acceptance Jupp (2006). Social desirability bias is often higher in surveys with an interviewer present which this research limited by utilising an online platform for data collection, however, topics around sustainability and the environment have known ethical and moral sensitivities Roxas and Lindsay (2012) which will likely have influenced participants responses. Lastly, due to the small number of participants who submitted survey data outside of the UK, only responses from those in the UK were carried forward. Bernotat and Eyssel (2018) highlighted the effect of different cultures (Japanese and German) on the perceptions of robots in the home and attitudes while Nitto et al. (2017) studies demonstrated the differences in projected purchasing habits for consumers in the US, Japan and Germany. Future studies should therefore compare attitudes to second-hand robots for participants outside of the UK. CONCLUSION Taking survey data from 72 UK participants, around a quarter indicated a positive interest in purchasing a new robot for the home. When presented with second-hand robots with guarantees, this figure did not change. However, when the option of second-hand robots without a guarantee was introduced this was reduced to 10 percent. This highlights the need for recognised certification methods or manufacturer warranties in order for robots to be successfully sold in the second-hand market. Young people aged 18-25 indicated a significantly higher interest in robotic systems than any other age group. Whether this is a factor of the participant's age at the time of the survey or the generation of which they are part is unclear from this single snapshot survey. However, paired with higher interest levels in the robots presented to those who have prior experience in ownership of robotic systems, this suggests an affinity for, and greater experience with, smarter devices in the home will form key drivers for individuals being willing to purchase a consumer robot. Current trends comparing second-hand purchases of household electronics to second-hand purchases of mobile phones suggest that the second-hand robotics market will be more similar to that of internet-enabled devices such as smartphones, than for household electronic devices - even where the robot will be used as a device for the home. By studying the growth of the second-hand mobile phone market and the challenges it has faced, the consumer robotics industry will be able to preempt the requirements that will likely be faced in trying to support the circular economy and tackle those at a time when it is cheaper in the technology maturity process to do so. However, it should be noted that the experience of prior ownership of other types of second-hand electronic devices (such as phones, laptops and game consoles) did not increase the participant's level of interest in second-hand robots. It is therefore possible that robotic technology for the home is too new or unknown for individuals to be able to make comparable decisions between purchasing the experience for other second-hand electronics to the projected experience of owning a robot. Instead, participants felt the initial purchase cost of any system was the greatest concern for new and second-hand robots, while the cost to maintain was the greatest concern for second-hand robots without guarantees. Additionally, attitudes to second-hand robots generally highlighted concerns for maintainability, verification and certification, technology obsolescence and liability in the event of damage to a person or home. In order to make the second-hand robot market attractive for consumers, these issues would need to be addressed and resolved, alongside a system to provide guarantees for second-hand systems. Even with these concerns though, individuals still indicated they were willing to purchase second-hand systems. Overall this survey is encouraging for the wider implementation of the circular economy and demonstrates that there is a market for second-hand robotic systems for the home. To enable this, processes must be in place to retain consumer robots at the end of their primary use, in order to bring them into the second-hand market. As demonstrated with other electronic devices, this may require incentivisation (such as buy-back schemes), and accessible methods for consumers to return used robotic systems. Manufacturers, retailers and public systems not supporting this process will likely result in the discarding of old robots as e-waste, adding considerable levels of waste already produced annually.},

  abstract     = {Editorial on Research Topic Space manipulators play a pivotal role in modern space missions, enabling satellite servicing, debris removal, and planetary exploration. However, their lightweight, long-reach designs and dynamic operational environments introduce significant vibration challenges that can compromise mission success. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach, integrating advancements in actuators, control algorithms, and material science. While conventional actuators (Liu et al., 2021; Tayebi et al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2018) and attitude control strategies (Ti et al., 2019; Tayebi et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2025) remain prevalent in spacecraft design, emerging solutions leveraging soft materials and AI-driven control architectures represent a rapidly evolving frontier in vibration mitigation research. This Research Topic provides the most recent developments in vibration mitigation techniques for space manipulators, including four important studies as result of the call. These studies cover several aspects of vibration through flexible dynamics estimation via quasi-static approximation, AI-enhanced guidance and control systems, bio-inspired soft actuation, and hybrid soft-rigid grasping architectures. Accurate measurement of elastic coordinates via sensors has historically posed significant challenges in controlling flexible space manipulators. Patel and Damaren addressed this by developing a model-based estimation framework, eliminating the need for direct vibration sensing. They proposed a quasi-static estimator that approximates elastic coordinates with joint torque data, enabling precise end-effector trajectory tracking. Their simulations on single and two-link manipulators demonstrate robust performance, even with large payloads and model uncertainties. Conventional spacecraft Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) systems, designed for ground-commanded operations with limited autonomy, face significant challenges in adapting to the dynamic demands of on-orbit servicing missions. Addressing this gap, Hao et al. proposed an AI-enhanced visual GNC system as an intermediate solution between conventional architectures and future fully autonomous systems. Their approach combines a deep learning-based algorithm that estimates target pose from 2D images without requiring prior knowledge of the target's dynamics, and a learning-based motion planner that generates manipulator trajectories while minimizing spacecraft attitude disturbances. The visual GNC system is exemplified through simulation of a conceptual mission, involving a micro-satellite tasked with on-orbit manipulation of a non-cooperative CubeSat. Figure 1 illustrates the design of the intelligent orbital service spacecraft and delineates the conceptual mission framework for capturing and servicing a non-cooperative target. Their work demonstrates the potential of AI to enhance autonomy in space robotics, particularly for non-cooperative target capture. FIGURE 1 Left: The design of the intelligent orbital service spacecraft. Right: The conceptual mission framework (Hao et al.). Actuators play an important role in controlling of space manipulators. Ashby et al. introduced bio-inspired soft actuators using dielectric elastomer transducers (DETs) as lightweight artificial muscles for space applications. Inspired by the starfish podia as shown in Figure 2, their inflatable DET-based actuator combines deployable structures with proprioceptive capabilities, enabling compact stowage during launch and adaptive operation in zero-gravity environments. The study highlights the advantages of soft robotics in space, where mass and volume constraints are critical. These actuators show particular promise for applications requiring adaptable, mass-efficient systems in unstructured orbital environment. FIGURE 2 Left: The basic structure of a typical starfish's podium (tube foot). Right: Close-up of a starfish on the sea floor, with podia in active motion (Ashby et al.). Dontu et al. discussed the development of a hybrid soft gripper for delicate object manipulation, validated through real-world robotics competitions. Their vacuum-actuated design integrates soft fingers with rigid components, and task-specific modules, balancing compliance and precision. By refining the gripper through successive iterations, the work demonstrates the importance of adaptable, hybrid designs for handling diverse objects in unstructured environments. These studies collectively illustrated three essential developments in space manipulator design through model-based estimation overcoming sensing limitations in orbit, AI-driven autonomy enabling real-time adaptation, and material and actuation Innovations. Looking ahead, the field must address key challenges in technology readiness levels and orbital validation, particularly for soft robotic components in space environments.},

  abstract     = {KEY CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE SPECIAL ISSUE In the evolving landscape of robotics, the challenge of deploying intelligent systems in real-world environments under limited computational and energy budgets has become increasingly important. The special issue of Frontiers in Robotics and AI—"Computer Vision Mechanisms for Resource-Constrained Robotics Applications", gathers a series of innovative contributions that directly address this challenge. The collection not only reflects the state of the art in efficient robotic perception, but also channels bio-inspired models, minimal computing principles, and hardware-constrained innovation to define a compelling path forward. The premise of the issue is grounded in a vital observation: although computer vision has reached extraordinary levels of accuracy and generalization through deep learning and high-performance sensors, these solutions are often tethered to expensive and power-hungry hardware and computationally complex algorithms. Autonomous robots intended for field deployment—whether aerial drones, underwater vehicles, or mobile ground units—frequently face bandwidth, energy, and compute bottlenecks. Thus, vision mechanisms designed with constraint-awareness are not merely desirable, but necessary. One prominent contribution to the issue is Singh et al.'s framework on minimal perception, which seeks to enable robotic autonomy by reducing perceptual complexity to its essential components Singh et al. (2024). Drawing inspiration from ecological psychology and AI, the authors design systems where perception is not treated as a comprehensive reconstruction of the world, but rather as a dynamic filter tuned to task relevance. The approach is validated through simulation and robot experiments, demonstrating that sparse and compressed sensory signals can support goal-directed behaviors such as obstacle avoidance and navigation with minimal computational overhead. Another standout is Van Opstal et al.'s biomimetic robotic eye, which introduces a six-degree-of-freedom platform capable of replicating human-like saccadic movements. The design merges active vision control Rui Pimentel de Figueiredo et al. with neurophysiological plausibility, offering both an experimental platform for neuroscientific hypotheses and a roadmap for embodied perception in robotics Van Opstal et al. (2024). The project brings to life ideas proposed in earlier models of oculomotor control, notably by Robinson and Sparks, but with real-time hardware precision and active visual fixation. Kalou et al. contribute with their work on head-centric representation of 3D shapes, reformulating shape perception as a process guided by an embodied fixation system Kalou et al. (2022). Their compact encoding scheme capitalizes on spatial priors gained from head-centered visual exploration, echoing Gibson's ecological theory of vision Gibson (1979) and early active vision paradigms. On the sensor innovation front, Ribeiro-Gomes et al. advocate for event-based cameras as foundational tools in embedded robotics. Their integration of asynchronous feature tracking into a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) framework demonstrates improved latency and energy efficiency compared to conventional methods Ribeiro-Gomes et al. (2023). These contributions collectively reflect a growing interest in both algorithmic minimalism and bio-inspired adaptation. FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND EDITORIAL PERSPECTIVE The research compiled in this issue reflects a broader shift in the field: away from monolithic perception pipelines and toward adaptive, embodied, and task-sensitive vision systems. A key theme is the resurgence of the perception-action loop, long emphasized by ecological psychology and active vision pioneers such as Aloimonos et al. Aloimonos et al. (1988) and Gibson Gibson (1979), but now reinvigorated through hardware-aware and task-constrained implementations. First, there is a growing recognition of the need for perception systems that dynamically adapt their computational load. Runtime-adaptive pipelines—capable of modulating neural network size, activation depth, or sensor resolution in response to context—could become essential for sustained autonomy in resource-constrained environments. Second, spiking neural models and neuromorphic circuits represent a biologically plausible and energy-efficient alternative to dense convolutional networks. This trend aligns with broader developments in transprecision computing and event-driven processing Delbruck and Lichtsteiner (2007); Sze et al. (2017), offering pathways for ultra-low-power robotics. A third frontier lies in the development of learning-based attention strategies. While classical attention mechanisms in vision prioritize computational saliency, emerging work explores end-to-end learning of attention policies that guide both perception and action. Reinforcement learning, meta-learning, and unsupervised learning strategies may enable robots to allocate their limited perceptual resources more effectively—particularly when paired with real-time hardware feedback on power and latency. Finally, the field would benefit greatly from standardized benchmarks designed specifically for resource-constrained robotics. While robust datasets exist for general tasks like SLAM or autonomous driving, few evaluate performance under explicit constraints such as degraded sensing, memory limits, or energy caps. Establishing such benchmarks could spur more targeted innovation and help consolidate this rapidly growing subfield. In terms of real-world impact, the relevance of resource-constrained perception extends well beyond research labs. In industrial robotics, especially in domains such as manufacturing, logistics, and infrastructure inspection, there is a growing demand for agile and power-efficient robots that can operate reliably in bandwidth-limited and dynamic environments. Many of these applications involve mobile Rui Pimentel de Figueiredo et al. platforms or wearable systems where energy and compute budgets are tightly constrained. Vision systems that adaptively throttle processing, or that rely on asynchronous and event-based sensing, are particularly well-suited for tasks such as real-time anomaly detection, autonomous warehouse navigation, and human-robot collaboration on production lines. Moreover, the advances discussed in this issue intersect meaningfully with the development of bio-inspired and humanoid robots. Platforms modeled after human morphology benefit immensely from perception systems that mimic the selective, task-dependent nature of biological vision. For example, the implementation of saccadic control, head-centric representation, and embodied attention strategies aligns naturally with the perceptual architectures found in humanoid robots. Such robots—whether designed for eldercare, physical rehabilitation, or disaster response—require lightweight and efficient perception pipelines that can operate within strict power, latency, and mobility constraints dictated by their human-centric form and mission requirements. CONCLUSION From biologically inspired eye movements to minimal perception frameworks and event-based feature tracking, the contributions point toward a future where efficiency and embodiment are not peripheral concerns, but rather central pillars of robotic intelligence, particularly as robotics moves further into industrial, assistive, and human-interactive domains. This special issue offers a compelling survey of the innovations shaping vision for resource-constrained robotics. From biologically inspired eye movements to minimal perception frameworks and event-based feature tracking, the contributions point toward a future where efficiency and embodiment are not peripheral concerns, but rather central pillars of robotic intelligence.},

  abstract     = {As service robots are increasingly integrated into the hotel industry to enhance operational efficiency and customer experience, understanding consumers’ responses to robotic services has become a critical research agenda. However, empirical evidence on how customers evaluate the service quality of hotel robots and how these evaluations influence their continuance intention remains limited. Drawing on the SERVQUAL framework, this study redefines service quality in the context of AI-powered hotel robots through five dimensions: reliability, assurance, entertainment, anthropomorphism, and tangibles. Furthermore, the study explores the moderating role of personal innovativeness in the relationship between perceived service quality and continuance intention. Data were collected via an online survey from 400 Generation Z consumers in China who had prior experience with item-delivery robots in hotel settings. The results indicate that assurance, entertainment, anthropomorphism, and tangibles have significant positive effects on continuance intention, while reliability does not show a statistically significant impact. Moreover, personal innovativeness significantly moderates the effects of certain service quality dimensions, suggesting that individual differences in technology readiness shape consumer reactions to robotic services. This study contributes to the literature by extending traditional service quality theory into the domain of human–robot interaction and by highlighting the nuanced mechanisms through which robot-specific service attributes influence user loyalty. Practical implications are offered for hotel managers seeking to optimize robot deployment strategies and improve guest engagement in technology-enhanced service environments.},

  abstract     = {\section*{Artificial Intelligence and Social Robotics for Mental Healthcare}In recent decades, mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression have risen dramatically across the globe \citep{baker2023mental,ten2023prevalence}. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Social Robotics present groundbreaking prospects that could revolutionize mental healthcare \citep{hung2025ethical}. Social robots, specifically designed for human interaction by displaying emotions and engaging in conversations, along with data-driven AI, exemplify modern advancements in sectors such as education \citep{letendre2024social} and elderly care \citep{yen2024effect}. Despite these advancements, the convergence of AI and social robotics in mental health has untapped potential and presents a plethora of unresolved challenges. For instance, there is a lack of ethical norms \citep{torras2024ethics} that regulate and guide the correct use of social robots in a wide variety of contexts, ranging from assistive care for the elderly to healthcare. Therefore, in this research topic, we have collected current contributions to the design and development of social robots as well as empirical studies on human-robot interactions focused on mental health and elderly care.\section*{Articles of the research topic}The articles contributing to the design and evaluation of social robots (supported by artificial intelligence) for mental healthcare included in this research topic are as follows:\href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2025.1305685/full}{Aoki et al.} focused on how different forms of humanoid robot vitality (namely gentle and rude) impact human performance with an emphasis on mental workload. Particularly, their study explored human performance and emotional states while engaging in demanding cognitive multitasking in the presence of social robots. Experiments involving 29 participants were conducted with an iCub humanoid robot continuously displaying vitality forms through coordinated movements of its arms, torso, and head. The participants interacted with the iCub robot while performing a task battery simulating cognitive challenges encountered by aircraft pilots. Whereas some participants interacted with iCub exhibiting a rude vitality form, the others interacted with iCube exhibiting a gentle vitality form. While interacting with the robot, \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2025.1305685/full}{Aoki et al.} recorded participants' facial expressions and electrodermal activity to assess their mental workload. Their results revealed that a robot exhibiting a gentle vitality form fostered a more positive and lower mental workload than one exhibiting a rude vitality form. \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2025.1305685/full}{Aoki et al.}'s results offer useful insights into stress-free human-robot interaction supporting mental well-being. \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2025.1560214/full}{Hung et al.} present an empirical study involving 46 elderly participants (from 60 to over 100 years old) on the use of social robots in the mental health area. Their study aimed to identify ethical challenges and propose mitigation strategies for implementing social robots in long-term care settings. To achieve these objectives, their research involved human-robot interaction between elderly individuals and social robots (namely Paro and Lovo robots) in separate studies. As a result of this empirical study, four key ethical challenges associated with the implementation of social robots in long-term care facilities were identified: inequitable access, participant consent, human care substitution, and concerns about infantilization. In addition, their work discussed mitigation strategies to address ethical support for older adults in long-term care settings.\href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2025.1529421/full}{Dong et al.} explored children's understanding of social robots endowed with artificial intelligence capabilities and how social robots promote learning engagement within the context of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education. Motivated by a lack of research on the effectiveness of social robots into primary and secondary education in informal settings, their objective was to design and evaluate a theater afterschool program (supported by social robots) to promote STEAM education and foster embodied learning. Their study took place in an elementary school involving 38 children. The children interacted with different robots, ranging from humanoid robots with human-like facial expressions to stereotypical robots. Among the participants, there were children with autism spectrum disorder, which (according to \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2025.1529421/full}{Dong et al.}'s results) improved their social and emotional skills by interacting with social robots. \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1426717/full} {Liu et al.} present an empirical study on the influence of behaviorally anthropomorphic service robots on customer variety-seeking behavior. Their study aimed to identify the mechanisms through which robot anthropomorphism affects consumer choices, specifically examining social presence as a mediator and decision-making context as a moderator. In pursuit of these goals, their research involved a series of six experiments with ordinary consumers interacting with service robot scenarios. They found that higher behavioral anthropomorphism significantly increases variety-seeking, a relationship partially mediated by social presence. Additionally, the influence of social presence on variety-seeking was significantly stronger in public decision-making contexts. Their work provides recommendations for strategically deploying service robots to enhance customer engagement. \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1426717/full}{Liu et al.}'s results have implications related to mental healthcare because social, anthropomorphic robots should deliver services (e.g., psychological therapies and counseling), expressing emotions (as expected by users) in order to establish both a social and an emotional connection. \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1426717/full}{Kamide et al.} carried out a psychological evaluation of an avatar robot in two distinct regions (Dubai and Japan) to explore how cultural background influences psychological aspects attributed to robot avatars. Furthermore, \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1426717/full}{Kamide et al.} aimed at understanding whether (avatar) robots' fundamental psychological impressions such as warmth, competence, and discomfort are essential for developing more culturally adapted human-robot interactions. Specifically, they conducted two studies: the first involved a virtual robot used as an avatar, and the second involved a physical robot. The results suggest that participants from Dubai were more comfortable interacting with a virtual robot, whereas participants from Japan were more comfortable interacting with a physical robot. \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1426717/full}{Kamide et al.} also discussed the implications of these findings and the relationship between robot evaluations and cultural background, which is a relevant aspect for social robots designed for mental healthcare in multicultural domains.We believe this collection of articles offers valuable insights supported by empirical evidence to further advance in social robots for mental healthcare. We hope this research topic motivates the readers to embark on and contribute to this fascinating research area.},

  abstract     = {The development of advanced control strategies for prosthetic hands is essential for improving performance and user experience. Soft prosthetic wrists pose substantial control challenges due to their compliant structures and nonlinear dynamics. This work presents a learning-based impedance control strategy for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist, integrated with the PRISMA HAND II prosthesis, aimed at achieving stable and adaptive joint-space control. The proposed method combines physics-based modeling using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and the Euler-Lagrange approach with a neural network trained to estimate unmodeled nonlinearities. Simulations achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 3.04×10−4 rad and a settling time of 3.1 s under nominal conditions. Experimental trials recorded an average RMSE of 2.7×10−2 rad and confirmed the controller’s ability to recover target trajectories under unknown external forces. The method supports compliant interaction, robust motion tracking, and trajectory recovery, positioning it as a viable solution for personalized prosthetic rehabilitation. Compared to traditional controllers like Sliding Mode Controller (SMC), Model Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC), and Model Predictive Controller (MPC), the proposed method achieved superior accuracy and stability. This hybrid approach successfully balances analytical precision with data-driven adaptability, offering a promising pathway towards intelligent control in next-generation soft prosthetic systems.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, AVs move beyond their initial purpose of only providing a self-driving and/or assistive driving experience, and progressively transform into interactive agents with some level of autonomy, as well as some context-dependent social features. This introduces new challenges and questions, already relevant in other areas of human-robot interaction (HRI), such as: if an AV is perceived as a social agent by the human with whom it is interacting or collaborating, how are the various facets of its interface and behaviour impacting its human partner? And how do we foster a successful collaboration between the human driver and the AV, maximizing the driver’s comfort, agency, and trust in the AV? Our specific research goal in this area is to explore how the human’s perception of the AV can vary across different levels of information sharing and autonomy of the AV. More precisely, in this work we sought to understand the various factors that could influence naïve participants’ acceptance and trustworthiness of AV. In a between-subjects online study, informed by participatory design, we investigated the effects of different AV interfaces with different information levels on participants’ perceptions of the AV, specifically their trust and comfort ratings. We also sought to understand how much the environment and the AV’s behaviour play a role in determining the level of autonomy users will grant to the AV. We found that the transparency of the AV (described by the amount of information shared with the users) had a significant impact on people’s trust and comfort in the car. Participants’ relationship with the AV’s autonomy however was more complex, and was influenced both by the AV’s transparency, but also by the driving environment and the specific events happening in the scenes.},

  abstract     = {Intensive finfish aquaculture is increasingly relying on enabling technologies and solutions such as sensor systems, robotics, and other machinery. Together with conventional farming equipment, these systems may emanate acoustic noise and artificial light, impacting the pen environment. Farmed fish have been observed to respond behaviourally and/or physiologically to anthropogenic sounds and lights, indicating a stress reaction that could impair welfare and health. This study aimed to investigate how farmed Atlantic salmon respond to such stimuli, with direct implications for the design and operation of robotic and mechanised systems in sea pens. We conducted experiments where we systematically exposed adult farmed Atlantic salmon in commercial net pens to sounds of frequencies within the range common to farm equipment (100–1,000 Hz), and submerged lights at 8 and 12 m with four different intensities (600 lx–14,500 lx). Data was analysed using sonar data and a deep learning (DL) based method for processing that automatically identified fish distribution patterns and estimated the average avoidance distance to the sound/light source. The fish fled from the sound source while playing sounds of 400 Hz, while sounds at other frequencies did not elicit a response. The response to light intensity depended on deployment depth, with the fish moving closer to the source when intensity was increased at 8 m depth, but conversely moving further away with increasing density when it was placed at 12 m. These outcomes are important inputs for the design of equipment, autonomous vehicles, robotic interventions and operations at commercial farms to ensure that their sound and light emissions have minimal impact on the fish, thereby reducing the potential of induced stress.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, it is often assumed that, at least in principle, robots in general, and social robots in particular, have the potential to increase human well-being across a wide range of sectors and application areas. At the same time, efforts to introduce such systems into our everyday environments have had only limited success and it is yet to be seen whether the impact of social robots on our daily lives, professional and private, will actually be beneficial. Therefore, there is a need to systematically address and study the long-term use and presence of social robots in everyday environments, where humans not only interact with robots, but also have them integrated into the totality of their lived experiences in everyday life.One of the main ways to investigate human engagement with social robots in everyday environments is through HRI studies conducted “in-the-wild”. While such an approach has certainly been instrumental and increasingly used in HRI research, in this Research Topic we have proposed to further expand the underlying theoretical and methodological frameworks to address the notion of 'everyday life'. Such a notion is viewed here as an important sociological concept and an umbrella term that allows us to address, not only specific application domains for robots, but also the continuity and totality of human lived experiences that emerge through long-term engagement with social robots in everyday life contexts. This is in a situation where placing social robots in everyday settings has often been an explicit goal for robot development but the very notion of 'everyday life' has not been systematically analysed. Therefore, this Research Topic has brought together a wide range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary contributions to further develop the HRI domain. While the main audience of this Research Topic is the HRI community, we have welcomed contributions from any disciplinary, interdisciplinary, theoretical, or methodological perspective that would address the subject of 'everyday life' in HRI research. As a result, we have published eight articles centered on the themes of integration, acceptance and people’s attitudes towards robots in everyday life.\href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2023.1241519/full}{Kühne et al.} investigates the use of dialects in social robots and its impact on the perceived trustworthiness and competence of robots. This is part of a broader inquiry into design and contextual factors that affect people’s acceptance of robots as social interaction partners. In particular, the study involved playing a short online video featuring NAO the robot speaking either in the Berlin dialect or standard German and asking one hundred twenty native German speakers to evaluate robots through a survey. While the study resulted in observing a slight trend of higher trust and competence evaluation for the standard German-speaking robot compared to the robot that spoke the Berlin dialect, the difference was not statistically significant and the two robots received largely comparable ratings in terms of both competence and trustworthiness. Also, on the one hand, the study found a positive correlation between certain variables, e.g. between participants’ self-reported Berlin dialect proficiency and trustworthiness, and on the other hand, it also depicted a complex picture of people’s perceptions of robots being affected by a number of factors that go far beyond robot features such as demographic characteristics, or a type of device used to watch the video. \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1438912/full}{Zafrani et al.} focuses on the acceptance and assimilation of socially assistive robots (SARs) in everyday life of the elderly persons. It presents the study that examined the uses, constraints and outcomes of engaging with ‘Gymmy’ the robot in real-life conditions and over a long period of time, and their effect on the older adults Quality Evaluations of SARs. The study involved nineteen community-dwelling adults aged 75-97 who interacted with a personal training robot installed at their homes for a period of 6 weeks. The main findings of the study involved identifying two assimilation patterns among the participants who could be categorized either as ‘Fans’ or ‘Skeptics’ based on the type of experience they reported regarding the robot. These two groups differed in terms of the positive vs. negative experience as well as participants’ personal background, attitudes towards robots before and after using the robot in question, and actual user experience. Thus, the study has shown that assimilation and acceptance of SARs is far from being a homogenous process and requires and requires careful consideration of the older adults’ needs and concerns.\href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2023.1212034/full}{ Zawieska et al.} poses the basis for this Research Topic as it discusses the existing and possible conceptual frameworks for the study of ‘everyday life’ in the HRI research. The paper first provides an overview of the ways everyday life is typically addressed in the HRI studies, namely in terms of settings, activity, population and/or methodology. Subsequently, the paper proposes further conceptual developments towards a systematic study of everyday life in HRI as a topic in its own right. In the process, it follows Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) and sociological perspectives that have a long tradition of studying the everyday. In search of possible synergies between the HRI and SSH approaches, the paper builds upon the notion of ‘lived experiences’, and depicts the everyday as an open-ended process. It also engages with a critique of the contemporary everyday life as it calls for challenging the underlying understanding of the everyday and the real-world as ‘natural’ and by doing do, widening the scope of HRI research to include ethico-political stances oriented towards the pursuit of a ‘good life’.\href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1363243/full}{Komatsu et al.} conducted participatory design workshops with middle‑to‑older adults in Japan—once during the COVID‑19 pandemic and again post‑pandemic—to explore how their needs and attitudes toward robot technologies evolved due to changing social circumstances. Drawing on Nowland et al.’s ``stimulation vs. disengagement'' framework, the study found a marked shift over time: during the pandemic, participants prioritized robot tools that enabled distanced communication and social sharing with family, aligning with the stimulation hypothesis. After pandemic restrictions lifted, their focus shifted inward—toward personal well-being, ease of use, and technologies that alleviate digital exclusion, reflecting the disengagement hypothesis. Throughout, the participants consistently emphasized the importance of user-friendly, multifunctional robotic solutions—citing familiarity, simplicity, and seamless integration into their daily routines (e.g., combining guidance with communication tools). The authors highlight that Japan’s super-aged context and rapid digitization during COVID‑19 exacerbated older adults’ digital exclusion, particularly disadvantaging those less tech‑savvy. They conclude with a strong call for inclusive co‑design approaches that address evolving social needs, from enabling connection during isolation to supporting personal well‑being in the post-pandemic era—ensuring robot technologies remain relevant and accessible across life stages and contexts.\href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1332110/full}{Hägglund et al.} explore young adults’ trust considerations when interacting with a socially assistive robot in a high-stakes pharmacy scenario—specifically, medication counseling on emergency contraceptive pills. Utilizing a co-creation methodology, they worked with participants to design a prototype application using the Furhat social robot platform. Through in-lab testing and subsequent interviews (six participants), they conducted an inductive, reflexive thematic analysis. The study produced five distinct ``tales of trust'', each represented as a persona embodying varying expectations and willingness to trust a robot in this sensitive domain. The research identifies six key factors that drive initial trust formation: physical position (spatial relation to the robot), perceived autonomy, interaction boundaries, feelings of shame, eye gaze, and conversational alignment. These factors shaped whether participants were open to consulting a robot about intimate health matters. By mapping a continuum from low to high trust expectations, the authors illuminate the nuanced interplay of affective, contextual, and design elements influencing user trust in socially assistive robots. The insights significantly inform the understanding of trust formation in HRI, especially in sensitive healthcare contexts, offering important design considerations for socially assistive robotics in the healthcare sector.\href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1289414/full}{Ostrowski et al.} present a year-long co‑design study involving 28 older adults, aimed at developing HRI guidelines that reflect seniors’ real-world needs. Participants engaged in a series of interviews, design sessions, and reflections to articulate the types of interactions they would want in daily life. These older co-designers expressed growing confidence over time, increasingly favoring transactional robot capabilities—like reminders and scheduling—while maintaining reservations about surveillance-related functions such as personal data tracking and monitoring. Beyond practical assistance, the study found measured enthusiasm for robots facilitating social connection, monitoring bodily signals, and supporting emotional well-being—all tempered by concerns over autonomy, privacy, and the ``naturalness'' of robotic interactions. Employing ethnographic decision-tree modeling, the authors demonstrated that simpler, non-intrusive features gained acceptance, whereas more invasive ones triggered sustained skepticism. They conclude by offering clear, user-driven guidelines for HRI design with older adults, and highlight several areas—such as ethical data practices, enhancing agency, and improving emotional realism—that warrant deeper investigation before broader deployment.\href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1347367/full}{Vetter et al.} conducted a study that explores integrating robotic technologies in the care sector, where such innovations are seen as solutions to labor shortages and aging populations. Their research applied an integrated approach combining value sensitive design and speculative design to explore the complexities of care environments, focusing on the diverse needs, goals, and socio-material arrangements that shape this space. Drawing on six interviews and six card workshops with Austrian care workers and residents, five key themes emerged: trust-building routines, stakeholder negotiations, reciprocal and affective care, caregiver self-care, and material mediation. To provoke reflection and discussion, six speculative vignettes were created, highlighting tensions that arise when technologies disrupt established care practices. The study offers valuable insights for robotic designers to understand care values and dynamics prior to developing interventions.\href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1363713/full}{Irfan et al.} conducted a participatory design study with 28 older adults to explore their expectations of conversational companion robots powered by models, such as large language models (LLMs). The study introduced a functioning robot prototype using LLMs in everyday life scenarios to prompt discussion. Through a thematic analysis process of the data, the findings revealed that older adults prefer robots that actively engage in conversations during isolation and passively accompany them in social settings. Key expectations included memory and personalization, privacy and control over data, useful reminders and information, support for social connections, and the expression of empathy and emotion. Based on the findings outlined, the study offers design recommendations for incorporating models (such as LLMs) into companion robots. The outcomes of the articles provide insights that extend beyond robotic agents and contribute broadly to the development of socially responsive conversational agents for older adults.We hope that with these contributions we have shed light on the importance of the notion of everyday life with robots, and the need for multifaceted HRI approaches that would consider a whole range of factors that together contribute to human lived experiences with robots. The next step is to further develop more nuanced and HRI-specific methods and approaches that would allow us to study a unique phenomenon of life with robots at is unfolds.},

  abstract     = {Robust autonomous navigation in complex, dynamic indoor environments remains a central challenge in robotics, requiring agents to make adaptive decisions in real time under partial observability and uncertain obstacle motion. This paper presents DreamerNav, a robot-agnostic navigation framework that extends DreamerV3, a state-of-the-art world model–based reinforcement learning algorithm, with multimodal spatial perception, hybrid global–local planning, and curriculum-based training. By formulating navigation as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), the system enables agents to integrate egocentric depth images with a structured local occupancy map encoding dynamic obstacle positions, historical trajectories, points of interest, and a global A* path. A Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) learns stochastic and deterministic latent dynamics, supporting long-horizon prediction and collision-free path planning in cluttered, dynamic scenes. Training is carried out in high-fidelity, photorealistic simulation using NVIDIA Isaac Sim, gradually increasing task complexity to improve learning stability, sample efficiency, and generalization. We benchmark against NoMaD, ViNT, and A*, showing superior success rates and adaptability in dynamic environments.

  abstract     = {Weeds pose a significant challenge in agriculture by competing with crops for essential resources, leading to reduced yields. To address this issue, researchers have increasingly adopted advanced machine learning techniques. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated remarkable success in various computer vision tasks, making their application to weed classification, detection, and segmentation more advantageous compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to their self-attention mechanism. However, the deployment of these models in agricultural robotics is hindered by resource limitations. Key challenges include high training costs, the absence of inductive biases, the extensive volume of data required for training, model size, and runtime memory constraints. This study proposes a knowledge distillation-based method for optimizing the ViT model. The approach aims to enhance the ViT model architecture while maintaining its performance for weed detection. To facilitate the training of the compacted ViT student model and enable parameter sharing and local receptive fields, knowledge was distilled from ResNet-50, which serves as the teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate significant enhancements and improvements in the student model, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 83.47%. Additionally, the model exhibits minimal computational expense, with only 5.7 million parameters. The proposed knowledge distillation framework successfully addresses the computational constraints associated with ViT deployment in agricultural robotics while preserving detection accuracy for weed detection applications.},

Even though robust localization methods do exist for many applications, it is difficult for them to succeed in complex environments and challenging situations. In particular, corridor-like environments present important issues for traditional range-based methods. The main contribution of this paper is the integration of new observation models into the popular AMCL ROS node, considering visual features obtained from the detection of rectangular landmarks. Visual rectangles are distinctive elements which are very common in man-made environments and should be detected and recognized in a robust manner. This hybrid approach is developed and evaluated both for the combination of an omnidirectional camera and a laser sensor (using artificial markers) and for RGB-D sensors (using natural rectangular features). For the latter, this work also introduces RIDGE, a novel algorithm for detecting projected quadrilaterals representing rectangles in images. Simulations and real world experiments are presented for both cases. As shown and discussed in the article, the proposed approach provides significant advantages for specific conditions and common scenarios such as long straight corridors.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates a novel nonlinear update rule for value and policy functions based on temporal difference (TD) errors in reinforcement learning (RL). The update rule in standard RL states that the TD error is linearly proportional to the degree of updates, treating all rewards equally without any bias. On the other hand, recent biological studies have revealed that there are nonlinearities in the TD error and the degree of updates, biasing policies towards being either optimistic or pessimistic. Such biases in learning due to nonlinearities are expected to be useful and intentionally leftover features in biological learning. Therefore, this research explores a theoretical framework that can leverage the nonlinearity between the degree of the update and TD errors. To this end, we focus on a control as inference framework utilized in the previous work, in which the uncomputable nonlinear term needed to be approximately excluded from the derivation of the standard RL. By analyzing it, the Weber–Fechner law (WFL) is found, in which perception (i.e., the degree of updates) in response to a change in stimulus (i.e., TD error) is attenuated as the stimulus intensity (i.e., the value function) increases. To numerically demonstrate the utilities of WFL on RL, we propose a practical implementation using a reward–punishment framework and modify the definition of optimality. Further analysis of this implementation reveals that two utilities can be expected: i) to accelerate escaping from the situations with small rewards and ii) to pursue the minimum punishment as much as possible. We finally investigate and discuss the expected utilities through simulations and robot experiments. As a result, the proposed RL algorithm with WFL shows the expected utilities that accelerate the reward-maximizing startup and continue to suppress punishments during learning.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has emerged as one of the foundational technologies enabling mobile robots to achieve autonomous navigation, garnering significant attention in recent years. To address the limitations inherent in traditional SLAM systems when operating within dynamic environments, this paper proposes a new SLAM system named GNV2-SLAM based on ORB-SLAM2, offering an innovative solution for the scenario of cowshed inspection. This innovative system incorporates a lightweight object detection network called GNV2 based on YOLOv8. Additionally, it employs GhostNetv2 as backbone network. The CBAM attention mechanism and SCDown downsampling module were introduced to reduce the model complexity while ensuring detection accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the GNV2 network achieves excellent model compression effects while maintaining high performance: mAP@0.5 increased by 1.04%, reaching a total of 95.19%; model parameters were decreased by 41.95%, computational cost reduced by 36.71%, and the model size shrunk by 40.44%. Moreover, the GNV2-SLAM system incorporates point and line feature extraction techniques, effectively mitigate issues reduced feature point extraction caused by excessive dynamic targets or blurred images. Testing on the TUM dataset demonstrate that GNV2-SLAM significantly outperforms the traditional ORB-SLAM2 system in terms of positioning accuracy and robustness within dynamic environments. Specifically, there was a remarkable reduction of 96.13% in root mean square error (RMSE) for absolute trajectory error (ATE), alongside decreases of 88.36% and 86.19% for translation and rotation drift in relative pose error (RPE), respectively. In terms of tracking evaluation, GNV2-SLAM successfully completes the tracking processing of a single frame image within 30 ms, demonstrating expressive real-time performance and competitiveness. Following the deployment of this system on inspection robots and subsequent experimental trials conducted in the cowshed environment, the results indicate that when the robot operates at speeds of 0.4 m/s and 0.6 m/s, the pose trajectory output by GNV2-SLAM is more consistent with the robot's actual movement trajectory. This study systematically validated the system's significant advantages in target recognition and positioning accuracy through experimental verification, thereby providing a new technical solution for the comprehensive automation of cattle barn inspection tasks.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionVisual odometry (VO) has been widely deployed on mobile robots for spatial perception. State-of-the-art VO offers robust localization, the maps it generates are often too sparse for downstream tasks due to insufffcient depth data. While depth completion methods can estimate dense depth from sparse data, the extreme sparsity and highly uneven distribution of depth signals in VO (∼ 0.15% of the pixels in the depth image available) poses signiffcant challenges.MethodsTo address this issue, we propose a lightweight Image-Guided Uncertainty-Aware Depth Completion Network (IU-DC) for completing sparse depth from VO. This network integrates color and spatial information into a normalized convolutional neural network to tackle the sparsity issue and simultaneously outputs dense depth and associated uncertainty. The estimated depth is uncertainty-aware, allowing for the filtering of outliers and ensuring precise spatial perception.ResultsThe superior performance of IU-DC compared to SOTA is validated across multiple open-source datasets in terms of depth and uncertainty estimation accuracy. In real-world mapping tasks, by integrating IU-DC with the mapping module, we achieve 50 × more reconstructed volumes and 78% coverage of the ground truth with twice the accuracy compared to SOTA, despite having only 0.6 M parameters (just 3% of the size of the SOTA).DiscussionOur code will be released at https://github.com/YangDL-BEIHANG/Dense-mapping-from-sparse-visual-odometry/tree/d5a11b4403b5ac2e9e0c3644b14b9711c2748bf9.},

A motion mapping model for the human arm and a seven-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) robotic arm are first established based on global configuration parameters and a hybrid mapping method. This model is used to describe the impact of IMU cumulative error on the robot teleoperation performance. Subsequently, the IMU pose state estimation model is constructed using PSO and ML-LSTM neural networks. The initial data of multiple IMUs and handling handles are used for training the estimation model. Finally, comparative experiments are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed state estimation model. The results demonstrate that the PSO–ML-LSTM algorithm can effectively eliminate the impact of IMU cumulative errors on robot teleoperation.},

While prior research in the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has examined the integration of the traits, such as emotional intelligence, memory-driven personalization, and non-verbal communication, by themselves, they have thus-far neglected to consider their synchronized integration into a cohesive, operational education framework. To address this gap, we customize a Multi-Modal Large Language Model (Llama 3.2 from Meta) deployed with modules for human-like traits (emotion, memory and gestures) into an AI-Agent framework. This constitutes the robot’s intelligent core that mimics the human emotional system, memory architecture and gesture controller to allow the robot to behave more empathetically while recognizing and responding appropriately to the student’s emotional state. It can also recall the student’s past learning record and adapt its style of interaction accordingly. This allows the robot tutor to react to the student in a more sympathetic manner by delivering personalized verbal feedback synchronized with relevant gestures. Our study suggests the extent of this effect through the introduction of Engagement Vector Model which can be a benchmark for judging the quality of HRI experience. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that such an empathetic responsive approach significantly improves student engagement and learning outcomes compared with a baseline humanoid robot without these human-like traits. This indicates that robot tutors with empathetic capabilities can create a more supportive, interactive learning experience that ultimately leads to better outcomes for the student.},

  abstract     = {The security of code-based digital records is a major concern of the 21st century. AI and artificial general intelligence (AGI) can be hacked to pieces by digital adversaries, and some AI objectives can lead to existential threats. The former arises from sitting duck problems that all software systems are vulnerable to, and the latter include control and misalignment problems. Blockchain technology, circa 2009, can address these problems: hashing algorithms rely on a consensus mechanism in manmade software systems to keep early blocks of software immutable and tamper-proof from digital malware, while new blocks can be added only if consistently aligned with original blocks. There is evidence that the ancient precedent of the genomic blockchain, underpinning the unbroken chain of life, uses a self-referential rather than a consensus-based hashing algorithm. Knowledge of self-codes permits biotic elements to achieve a hack-free agenda by self-reporting that they have been “negated,” or hacked, exactly implementing the Gödel sentence from foundational mathematics of Gödel, Turing, and Post (G–T–P). This results in an arms race in open-ended novelty to secure the primacy of original self-codes. Selfhood and autonomy are staples of neuroscience on complex self–other social cognition and increasingly of autonomous AGI agents capable of end-to-end programmed self-assembly. My perspective is that self-referential G–T–P information processing, first found in the adaptive immune system of jawed fish 500 mya and more recently in mirror neuron systems of humans, has enabled code-based self-organized intelligent systems like life to survive over 3.7 billion years. Some lessons for AGI can be gleaned from this discussion.},

  abstract     = {The study highlights the effectiveness of FMEA in robotic spot-welding operations, providing a systematic approach to enhancing performance in an automotive assembly line. Robotic welding industries depend on mechanized, programmable tools to automate welding processes, ensuring efficiency, reliability, and effective material handling. In the automotive sector, Tier 1 suppliers utilize robotic welding machines to produce high volumes of welded assemblies, with daily output exceeding 450 units. However, frequent equipment downtime due to maintenance challenges disrupts productivity and impacts customer satisfaction. This study aims to develop a Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) approach for robotic welding industries, optimizing machine uptime, enhancing product quality, and reducing financial losses caused by unexpected failures. A 3-year dataset was analysed to identify the primary causes of downtime and their associated costs. Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) was applied to assess failure modes, determine root causes, and calculate Risk Priority Numbers (RPNs), thereby formulating corrective actions to mitigate recurring failures and enhance operational efficiency. Findings revealed that maintenance-related issues accounted for 79% of total downtime, resulting in financial losses of R2,281,508.82 over 3 years. The application of FMEA provided a structured framework for prioritizing critical failure modes and implementing targeted corrective measures to reduce downtime and enhance overall reliability. To sustain high productivity and quality, it is recommended that robotic welding industries adopt proactive maintenance strategies based on FMEA findings. Regular monitoring, predictive maintenance, and workforce training will help minimize machine failures and optimize operational efficiency.},

This paper presents a novel, vision-based framework for autonomous trailer loading that operates without GPS, making it adaptable to dynamic and unstructured environments. The proposed method integrates real-time computer vision with a finite state machine (FSM) control strategy to detect, approach, and align the ASV with the trailer using visual cues such as LED panels and bunk boards. A realistic simulation environment, modeled after real-world conditions and incorporating wave disturbances, was developed to validate the approach and is available1. Experimental results using the WAM-V 16 ASV in Gazebo demonstrated a 100% success rate under calm to medium wave disturbances and a 90% success rate under high wave conditions. These findings highlight the robustness and adaptability of the vision-driven system, offering a promising solution for fully autonomous trailer loading in GPS-denied scenarios.},

This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art diffusion models in robotic manipulation, including grasp learning, trajectory planning, and data augmentation. Diffusion models for scene and image augmentation lie at the intersection of robotics and computer vision for vision-based tasks to enhance generalizability and data scarcity.

  abstract     = {Research organizations and academics often seek to map the development of scientific fields, identify research gaps, and guide the direction of future research. In cobot-related research, the scientific literature consulted does not propose any comprehensive research agenda. Moreover, cobots, industrial robots inherently designed to collaborate with humans, bring with them emerging issues. To solve them, interdisciplinary research is often essential (e.g., combination of engineering, ergonomics and biomechanics expertise to handle safety challenges). This paper proposes an exhaustive study that employs a scoping review and bibliometric analysis to provide a structured macro perspective on the developments, key topics, and trends in cobot research for industry. A total of 2,195 scientific publications were gained from the Web of Science database, and a thorough selection process narrowed them down to 532 papers for comprehensive analysis. Descriptive statistics were employed to analyze bibliometric measures, highlighting publication trends, leading journals, the most productive institutions, engaged countries, influential authors, and prominent research topics. Co-authorship and bibliographic couplings were also examined. Through a co-occurrence analysis of terms, the content and research objectives of the papers were systematically reviewed and lead to a univocal categorization framework. That categorization can support organizations or researchers in different cobotics (collaborative robotics) fields by understanding research developments and trends, identifying collaboration opportunities, selecting suitable publication venues, advancing the theoretical and experimental understanding of automatic collaborative systems, and identifying research directions and predicting the evolution of publication quantity in cobotics.},

  abstract     = {As a contribution to research on transparency and failures in human–robot interaction (HRI), our study investigates whether the informational ecology configured by publicly displaying a robot’s automatic speech recognition (ASR) results is consequential in how miscommunications emerge and are dealt with. After a preliminary quantitative analysis of our participants’ gaze behavior during an experiment where they interacted with a conversational robot, we rely on a micro-analytic approach to detail how the interpretation of this robot’s conduct as inadequate was configured by what it displayed as having “heard” on its tablet. We investigate cases where an utterance or gesture by the robot was treated by participants as sequentially relevant only as long as they had not read the automatic speech recognition transcript but re-evaluated it as troublesome once they had read it. In doing so, we contribute to HRI by showing that systematically displaying an ASR transcript can play a crucial role in participants’ interpretation of a co-constructed action (such as shaking hands with a robot) as having “failed”. We demonstrate that “mistakes” and “errors” can be approached as practical accomplishments that emerge as such over the course of interaction rather than as social or technical phenomena pre-categorized by the researcher in reference to criteria exogenous to the activity being analyzed. In the end, while narrowing down on two video fragments, we find that this peculiar informational ecology did not merely impact how the robot was responded to. Instead, it modified the very definition of “mutual understanding” that was enacted and oriented to as relevant by the human participants in these fragments. Besides social robots, we caution that systematically providing such transcripts is a design decision not to be taken lightly; depending on the setting, it may have unintended consequences on interactions between humans and any form of conversational interface.},

  abstract     = {Socially assistive robots are increasingly being researched and deployed in various domains such as education, healthcare, service, and even as collaborators in a variety of other workplaces. Similarly, SARs are also expected to interact in a socially acceptable manner with a wide audience, ranging from preschool children to the elderly. This diversity of application domains and target populations raises technical and social challenges that are yet to be overcome. While earlier works relied on the Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) paradigm to give an illusion of interactivity and intelligence, a transition toward more autonomous robots can be observed. In this article, we present a systematic review, following the PRISMA method, of the last 5 years of Socially Assistive Robotics research, centered around SARs’ level of autonomy with a stronger focus on fully and semi-autonomous robots than non-autonomous ones. Specifically, to analyse SARs’ level of autonomy, the review identifies which sensing and actuation capabilities of SARs are typically automated and which ones are not, and how these capabilities are automated, with the aim of identifying potential gaps to be explored in future research. The review further explores whether SARs’ level of autonomy and capabilities are transparently communicated to the diverse target audiences above described and discusses the potential benefits and drawbacks of such transparency. Finally, with the aim of providing a more holistic view of SARs’ characteristics and application domains, the review also reports the embodiment and commonly envisioned role of SARs, as well as their interventions’ size, length and environment.},

  abstract     = {Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding (AARR) is a cornerstone of human language and reasoning, referring to the learned ability to relate symbols in flexible, context-dependent ways. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical approach for modeling AARR within an artificial intelligence framework using the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS). NARS is an adaptive reasoning system designed for learning under uncertainty. We introduce a theoretical mechanism called acquired relations, enabling NARS to derive symbolic relational knowledge directly from sensorimotor experiences. By integrating principles from Relational Frame Theory—the behavioral psychology account of AARR—with the reasoning mechanisms of NARS, we conceptually demonstrate how key properties of AARR (mutual entailment, combinatorial entailment, and transformation of stimulus functions) can emerge from NARS’s inference rules and memory structures. Two theoretical demonstrations illustrate this approach: one modeling stimulus equivalence and transfer of function, and another modeling complex relational networks involving opposition frames. In both cases, the system logically demonstrates the derivation of untrained relations and context-sensitive transformations of stimulus functions, mirroring established human cognitive phenomena. These results suggest that AARR—long considered uniquely human—can be conceptually captured by suitably designed AI systems, emphasizing the value of integrating behavioral science insights into artificial general intelligence (AGI) research. Empirical validation of this theoretical approach remains an essential future direction.},

Over nine days, a 5th-grade class was observed to assess the robot’s impact on student engagement, motivation, and peer interactions, and compared to classes where any avatar robots were not introduced. Key findings include improved student confidence in presentations, enhanced social interactions during recess, and positive feedback on the robot’s role in supporting classroom activities.

  abstract     = {The widespread and growing use of flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is attributed to their high spatial mobility, autonomous control, and lower cost compared to usual manned flying vehicles. Applications, such as surveying, searching, or scanning the environment with application-specific sensors, have made extensive use of UAVs in fields like agriculture, geography, forestry, and biology. However, due to the large number of applications and types of UAVs, limited power has to be taken into account when designing task-specific software for a target UAV. In particular, the power constraints of smaller UAVs will generally necessitate reducing power consumption by limiting functionality, decreasing their movement radius, or increasing their level of autonomy. Reducing the overhead of control and decision-making software onboard is one approach to increasing the autonomy of UAVs. Specifically, we can make the onboard control software more efficient and focused on specific tasks, which means it will need less computing power than a general-purpose algorithm. In this work, we focus on reducing the size of the computer vision object classification algorithm. We define different tasks by specifying which objects the UAV must recognize, and we construct a convolutional neural network (CNN) for each specific classification. However, rather than creating a custom CNN that requires its dataset, we begin with a pre-trained general-purpose classifier. We then choose specific groups of objects to recognize, and by using response-based pruning (RBP), we simplify the general-purpose CNN to fit our specific needs. We evaluate the pruned models in various scenarios. The results indicate that the evaluated task-specific pruning can reduce the size of the neural model and increase the accuracy of the classification tasks. For small UAVs intended for tasks with reduced visual content, the proposed method solves both the size reduction and individual model training problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses a critical challenge in Industry 4.0 robotics by enhancing Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) systems to operate effectively in dynamic and low-light industrial environments, which are common in sectors like warehousing, logistics, and manufacturing. Inspired by biological sensing mechanisms, we integrate bio-inspired event cameras to improve state estimation systems performance in both dynamic and low-light conditions, enabling reliable localization and mapping. The proposed state estimation framework integrates events, conventional video frames, and inertial data to achieve reliable and precise localization with specific emphasis on real-world challenges posed by high-speed and cluttered settings typical in Industry 4.0. Despite advancements in event-based sensing, there is a noteworthy gap in optimizing Event Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) parameters for practical applications. To address this, we introduce a novel VIO-Gradient-based Optimization (VIO-GO) method that employs Batch Gradient Descent (BGD) for efficient parameter tuning. This automated approach determines optimal parameters for Event SLAM algorithms by using motion-compensated images to represent event data. Experimental validation on the Event Camera Dataset shows a remarkable 60% improvement in Mean Position Error (MPE) over fixed-parameter methods. Our results demonstrate that VIO-GO consistently identifies optimal parameters, enabling precise VIO performance in complex, dynamic scenarios essential for Industry 4.0 applications. Additionally, as parameter complexity scales, VIO-GO achieves a 24% reduction in MPE when using the most comprehensive parameter set (VIO-GO8) compared to a minimal set (VIO-GO2), highlighting the method’s scalability and robustness for adaptive robotic systems in challenging industrial environments.},

It can be further extended using native browser libraries or WebSocket interfaces, allowing researchers to add support for their own devices. We also provide tracking for several HRI metrics, such as task completion and command selection time, enabling quantitative comparisons between different user interfaces and devices. We demonstrate the utility of our benchmark with a user study (n = 50) conducted to compare five different input devices, and also compare single-vs. multi-user control. In the pick-and-place task, we found that users performed worse when using the eye tracker + EMG device pair, as compared to mouse + keyboard or gamepad + gamepad, over four quantitative metrics (corrected p < 0.001).
