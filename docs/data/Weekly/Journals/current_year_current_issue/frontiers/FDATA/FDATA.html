  abstract     = {BackgroundThe use of machine learning (ML) in surgery till date has largely focused on predication of surgical variables, which has not been found to significantly improve operating room efficiencies and surgical success rates (SSR). Due to the long surgery wait times, limited health care resources and an increased population need, innovative ML models are needed. Thus, the Framework for AI-based Surgical Transformation (FAST) was created to make real time recommendations to improve OR efficiency.MethodsThe FAST model was developed and evaluated using a dataset of n=4796 orthopedic cases that utilizes surgery and team specific variables (e.g. specific team composition, OR turnover time, procedure duration), along with regular positive deviance seminars with the stakeholders for adherence and uptake. FAST was created using six ML algorithms, including decision trees and neural networks. The FAST was implemented in orthopedic surgeries at a hospital in Canada's capital (Ottawa).ResultsFAST was found to be feasible and implementable in the hospital orthopedic OR, with good team engagement due to the PD seminars. FAST led to a SSR of 93% over 23 weeks (57 arthroplasty surgery days) compared to 39% at baseline. Key variables impacting SSR included starting the first surgery on time, turnover time, and team composition.ConclusionsFAST is a novel ML framework that can provide real time feedback for improving OR efficiency and SSR. Stakeholder integration is key in its success in uptake and adherence. This unique framework can be implemented in different hospitals and for diverse surgeries, offering a novel and innovative application of ML for improving OR efficiency without additional resources.},

  abstract     = {Secure aggregation of distributed inputs is a well-studied problem. In this study, anonymity of inputs is achieved by assuring a minimal quota before publishing the outcome. We design and implement an efficient cryptographic protocol that mitigates the most important security risks and show its application in the cyber threat intelligence (CTI) domain. Our approach allows for generic aggregation and quota functions. With 20 inputs from different parties, we can do three secure and anonymous aggregations per second, and in a CTI community of 100 partners, 10, 000 aggregations could be performed during one night.},

  abstract     = {Algorithmic decision-support systems, i.e., recommender systems, are popular digital tools that help tourists decide which places and attractions to explore. However, algorithms often unintentionally direct tourist streams in a way that negatively affects the environment, local communities, or other stakeholders. This issue can be partly attributed to the computer science community's limited understanding of the complex relationships and trade-offs among stakeholders in the real world. In this work, we draw on the practical findings and methods from tourism management to inform research on multistakeholder fairness in algorithmic decision-support. Leveraging a semi-systematic literature review, we synthesize literature from tourism management as well as literature from computer science. Our findings suggest that tourism management actively tries to identify the specific needs of stakeholders and utilizes qualitative, inclusive and participatory methods to study fairness from a normative and holistic research perspective. In contrast, computer science lacks sufficient understanding of the stakeholder needs and primarily considers fairness through descriptive factors, such as measureable discrimination, while heavily relying on few mathematically formalized fairness criteria that fail to capture the multidimensional nature of fairness in tourism. With the results of this work, we aim to illustrate the shortcomings of purely algorithmic research and stress the potential and particular need for future interdisciplinary collaboration. We believe such a collaboration is a fundamental and necessary step to enhance algorithmic decision-support systems toward understanding and supporting true multistakeholder fairness in tourism.},
