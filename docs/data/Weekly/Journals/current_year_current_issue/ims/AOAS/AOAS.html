  abstract     = {Product cannibalisation in the marketplace refers to the decrease in the sales of one product due to competition from another product. We examine this phenomenon in a wholesale data set provided by a major international company. We use a multivariate Hawkes process where each product is represented by a dimension, with cross-inhibition effects that model product cannibalisation. To implement the Hawkes process with inhibition, we resolve challenges regarding the integration of the intensity function and introduce a new, less restrictive condition for stability, as existing conditions are unnecessarily strict under inhibition. We conduct our analysis in a Bayesian framework for which we design a dimension-independent prior on the cross-inhibition based on a reparametrisation.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) outperform ordinary GPs as surrogate models of complex computer experiments when response surface dynamics are nonstationary, which is especially prevalent in aerospace simulations. Yet DGP surrogates have not been deployed for the canonical downstream task in that setting: reliability analysis through contour location (CL). In that context we are motivated by a simulation of an RAE-2822 transonic airfoil which demarcates efficient and inefficient flight conditions. Level sets separating passable vs. failable operating conditions are best learned through strategic sequential designs. There are two limitations to modern CL methodology which hinder DGP integration in this setting. First, derivative-based optimization underlying acquisition functions is thwarted by sampling-based Bayesian (i.e., MCMC) inference, which is essential for DGP posterior integration. Second, canonical acquisition criteria, such as entropy, are famously myopic to the extent that optimization may even be undesirable. Here we tackle both of these limitations at once, proposing a hybrid criterion that explores along the Pareto front of entropy and (predictive) uncertainty, requiring evaluation only at strategically located “triangulation” candidates. We showcase DGP CL performance in several synthetic benchmark exercises and on the RAE-2822 airfoil.},

  abstract     = {There is abundant interest in assessing the joint effects of multiple exposures on human health. This is often referred to as the mixtures problem in environmental epidemiology and toxicology. Classically, studies have examined the adverse health effects of different chemicals one at a time, but there is concern that certain chemicals may act together to amplify each other’s effects. Such amplification is referred to as synergistic interaction, while chemicals that inhibit each other’s effects have antagonistic interactions. Current approaches for assessing the health effects of chemical mixtures do not explicitly consider synergy or antagonism in the modeling, instead focusing on either parametric or unconstrained nonparametric dose response surface modeling. The parametric case can be too inflexible, while nonparametric methods face a curse of dimensionality that leads to overly wiggly and uninterpretable surface estimates. We propose a Bayesian approach that decomposes the response surface into additive main effects and pairwise interaction effects and then detects synergistic and antagonistic interactions. Variable selection decisions for each interaction component are also provided. This Synergistic Antagonistic Interaction Detection (SAID) framework is evaluated relative to existing approaches using simulation experiments and an application to data from NHANES.},

The proposed PoD-BIN design evaluates the posterior predictive probabilities of up-and-down decisions. In PoD-BIN, multiple grades of toxicity, categorized as mild toxicity (MT) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), are simultaneously modeled, with the primary outcome being time-to-toxicity for both MT and DLT. This approach allows the enrollment of new patients while previously enrolled patients are still being monitored for toxicity, potentially reducing the trial duration. The Bayesian decision rules in PoD-BIN employ the probability of decisions to balance the trade-off between accelerating the trial and the risk of exposing patients to excessively toxic doses. Through numerical examples, we illustrate the trade-off between speed and safety of PoD-BIN and compare it with existing designs. PoD-BIN demonstrates the ability to control the frequency of risky decisions while simultaneously shortening trial duration in simulations.},

  abstract     = {Migration flows represent an important component of global sustainable development and demographic trends. However, the dynamic nature of the migration phenomenon, known issues of undercoverage of administrative records and long intercensal periods make estimation of internal migration a very challenging task. In this work we focus on the estimation of internal migration in Colombia, which is the subject of an ongoing armed conflict that has triggered forced and voluntary population movements from rural areas. Motivated by the high variability of migration flows across small areas in Colombia, we propose the use of super heavy-tailed (SHT) priors for sparse and ultra-sparse small area effects under a Fay–Herriot model. We establish theoretical properties of a family of log-Cauchy priors and a new SHT prior obtained by considering a four parameter beta (FPB) density. We provide especially suited Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that can also be applied to other global-local families of priors in small area contexts. In addition, we consider a simulation study to illustrate how our proposal improves the precision of posterior estimates in sparse and ultra-sparse settings compared to other existing priors in the literature. Finally, we apply our proposed methodology to the estimation of internal migration in Colombia and obtain results with improved precision that are consistent with the population dynamics in the country. Moreover, we provide practical suggestions for official statisticians and other practitioners who desire to use our proposed framework in their own SAE problems.},

The study is motivated by the U.S. Census Bureau’s well-known ROAM application, which uses a linear regression model trained on the U.S. Census Planning Database data to identify hard-to-survey areas. A crowdsourcing competition (Public Opin. Q. 81 (2016) 144–156) organized more than 10 years ago revealed that machine learning methods, based on ensembles of regression trees, led to the best performance in predicting survey response rates; however, the corresponding models could not be adopted for the intended application due to their black-box nature. We consider nonparametric additive models with a small number of main and pairwise interaction effects using ℓ0-based penalization. From a methodological viewpoint, we study our estimator’s computational and statistical aspects and discuss variants incorporating strong hierarchical interactions. Our algorithms (open-sourced on GitHub) extend the computational frontiers of existing algorithms for sparse additive models to be able to handle datasets relevant to the application we consider. We discuss and interpret findings from our model on the U.S. Census Planning Database. In addition to being useful from an interpretability standpoint, our models lead to predictions comparable to popular black-box machine learning methods based on gradient boosting and feedforward neural networks—suggesting that it is possible to have models that have the best of both worlds, good model accuracy and interpretability.},

  abstract     = {Gun violence is a major source of injury and death in the United States. However, relatively little is known about the effects of firearm injuries on survivors and their family members and how these effects vary. To study these questions and, more generally, to address a gap in the methodological causal inference literature, we present a framework for the study of effect modification or heterogeneous treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs. We implement a new matching technique, combining profile matching and risk set matching to: (i) preserve the time alignment of covariates, exposure, and outcomes, avoiding pitfalls of other common approaches for difference-in-differences, and (ii) explicitly control biases due to imbalances in observed covariates in subgroups discovered from the data. Our case study shows significant and persistent effects of nonfatal firearm injuries on several health outcomes for those injured and on the mental health of their family members. Sensitivity analyses reveal that these results are moderately robust to unmeasured confounding bias. Finally, while the effects for those injured vary largely by the severity of the injury and its documented intent, for families, effects are strongest for those whose relative’s injury is documented as resulting from an assault, self-harm, or law enforcement intervention.},

The proposed network causal tree (NCT) algorithm has several advantages. First, it allows the investigation of the heterogeneity of the treatment effect, avoiding potential bias due to the presence of interference. Second, understanding the heterogeneity of both treatment and spillover effects can guide policymakers in scaling up interventions, designing targeting strategies, and increasing cost-effectiveness. We investigate the performance of our NCT method using a Monte Carlo simulation study and illustrate its application to assess the heterogeneous effects of information sessions on the uptake of a new weather insurance policy in rural China.},

  abstract     = {Tropical cyclones (TC) are significant indicators of evolving climate dynamics. Two primary responses of interest are the cyclone frequency and intensity. In this paper we propose a novel integrated modelling framework for simultaneous modelling of TC frequency across several meteorological regions within Australasia. The key methodological insight is to model the second-order properties of multiple integer-valued time series in frequency domain, instead of parametric time domain models. We take a two-stage semiparametric approach, where large scale environmental variation is modelled using generalized linear models while the stochastic variation, including spatial heterogeneity, is estimated using spectral analysis of time series under a hierarchical generating model. Using longitudinal data analysis, we are able to jointly model periodicities in TC frequencies and their correlation with El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles as well as the spatial variation between regions. We project the fitted model to obtain one-step-ahead forecasts under the principle of best linear unbiased estimation. This semiparametric approach allows us to obliterate the uniqueness matter of parametric integer-valued time series modelling. Additional methodological advantages include tests for spatial heterogeneity and temporal second-order stationarity. The data analysis corroborates previous findings on declining trend of tropical cyclone frequencies, in the short-term.},
