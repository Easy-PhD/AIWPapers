However, this introduces the complex but crucial transition flight phase, which is not yet well understood regarding aerodynamics and flight dynamics. To better understand the aircraftâ€™s dynamic behavior within this flight regime, this paper analyzes the longitudinal tilt-wing transition, considering various operational strategies for the maneuver. The analysis is based on an optimal control approach where the dynamic control problem is transcribed into a nonlinear programming problem. The developed framework allows for successfully exploring different transition strategies by adapting constraints and objective functions. Compared to the results of static trim analyses, the phenomena of transition folds are attenuated in the dynamic investigation due to inertial effects. Furthermore, the backward transition maneuver from cruise to hover flight proves to be more challenging from a flight physics perspective because of high effective angles of attack and requires upward motion if flow separation is to be avoided.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on developing a bearings-only measurement-based three-dimensional window traversal guidance method for quadrotor uninhabitated aerial vehicles (UAVs). The desired flight path and heading angles of the quadrotor are proposed as functions of the bearing angle information of the four vertices of the window. These angular guidance inputs employ a bearing angle bisector term and an elliptic shaping angle term, which directs the quadrotor toward the centroid of the window. Detailed stability analysis of the resulting kinematics demonstrates that all quadrotor trajectories lead to the centroid of the window along a direction that is normal to the window plane. A qualitative comparison with existing traversal methodologies showcases the superiority of the proposed guidance approach with regard to the nature of information, computations for generating the guidance commands, and flexibility of replanning the traversal path. Realistic simulations considering a six-degree-of-freedom quadrotor model and Monte Carlo studies validate the effectiveness, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed guidance solution. Representative flight validation trials are carried out using an indoor motion capture system.},

  abstract     = {In deep space exploration missions involving lunar flybys, to ensure the successful execution of the lunar gravity assist (LGA), one or more trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs) are typically required before the perilune. The concept of singularity suggests that targeting future states either requires a significant amount of maneuvering or cannot be calculated within a finite iteration time. To mitigate the high computational costs associated with TCMs determined via the differential correction method, it is essential to analyze the singularity of the Lambert problem in the lunar flyby. This study demonstrates that the singularity of the Lambert problem in Keplerian orbits exhibits transferability in lunar flybys under the three-body model by using the Lagrange coefficients and pseudostate theory. This transferability is validated through the determinant theory of the state transition matrix (STM), which is further extendable to other three-body systems. Furthermore, this study elucidates the applicability of singularity in lunar flybys under the three-body model through numerical simulations in both prograde and retrograde motions, considering different arguments of perilune. These derivations and simulations establish criteria for assessing singularity, facilitating the rapid identification of positions associated with high maneuver costs. The conclusions drawn from this study have been validated using the ephemeris model. It is shown that it is possible to preemptively circumvent singularities and enhance the robustness of the guidance algorithm in practical lunar flyby missions.},

However, the nonlinear optimization solvers required remain too slow for use on relatively resource-constrained flight-grade computers. In this work, we turn toward amortized optimization, a learning-based technique for accelerating optimization run times, and develop Trajectory Optimization with Merit Function Warm Starts. Offline, using data collected from a simulation, we train a neural network to learn a mapping to the full primal and dual solutions given the problem parameters. Crucially, we build upon recent results from decision-focused learning and develop a set of decision-focused loss functions using the notion of merit functions for optimization problems. We show that training networks with such constraint-informed losses can better encode the structure of the trajectory optimization problem and jointly learn to reconstruct the primal-dual solution while yielding improved constraint satisfaction. Through numerical experiments on a lunar rover problem and a 3-degree-of-freedom Mars powered descent guidance problem, we demonstrate that Trajectory Optimization with Merit Function Warm Starts outperforms benchmark approaches in terms of both computation times and network prediction constraint satisfaction.},

This is achieved by considering both flyby and rendezvous missions. Drawing inspiration from previous research using low-thrust propulsion, this work focuses on time-optimal missions, applying optimal control theory to achieve reasonable transfer times. The formulation relies on continuous guidance control, employing an indirect method derived from Eulerâ€“Lagrange variational equations and Pontryaginâ€™s minimum principle.

We consider the case of a pursuer implementing given standard guidance laws for the midcourse and terminal phases. These engagement stages are separated by a predefined decision time, at which the pursuer allocation is determined. The pursuerâ€™s position and heading at the decision time, referred to as a handover point, is optimized with respect to a tradeoff between the expected miss distance and control effort. Since the pursuer uses known given guidance laws, the handover point is the only optimization parameter of the problem. We propose a computationally efficient approach to evaluate the performance index online for a set of candidate decision points sampled from the pursuerâ€™s reachable set at the end of the midcourse stage. Specifically, for the terminal phase, we develop the performance index representation using a limited number of sensitivity functions, which relate to variations in initial conditions and evader maneuver and can be computed offline. This terminal phase cost evaluation procedure is applicable for a class of linear time-varying systems with a quadratic cost. The proposed methodology is exemplified for minimum-time midcourse trajectories and proportional navigation terminal guidance law.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a numerical optimization algorithm for generating approach and landing trajectories for a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) aircraft. We improve on the existing research on aircraft landing trajectory generation by formulating the trajectory optimization problem with additional real-world operational constraints, including 6-DoF aircraft dynamics, runway alignment, constant wind field, and obstacle avoidance, to obtain a continuous-time nonconvex optimal control problem. Particularly, the runway alignment constraint enforces the trajectory of the aircraft to be aligned with the runway only during the final approach phase. This is a novel feature that is essential for preventing an approach that is either too steep or too shallow. The proposed method models the runway alignment constraint through a multiphase trajectory planning scheme, imposing alignment conditions exclusively during the final approach phase. We compare this formulation with the existing state-triggered constraint formulation for runway alignment. To solve the formulated problem, we design a novel sequential convex programming algorithm called extrapolated penalized trust region that extends the penalized trust-region algorithm by incorporating an extrapolation step to expedite convergence. We validate the proposed method through extensive numerical simulations, including a Monte Carlo study, to evaluate the robustness of the algorithm to varying initial conditions.},

Here, we consider control strategies with a level of decentralization such that they do not require hardware and software modifications when assembling multiple modules together irrespective of how they are connected. To this end, we present two strategies: the first does not require the knowledge of the configuration of the assemblage, while the second, which offers better performance, includes identifying the configuration automatically during the takeoff phase of the flight. We discuss the control allocation associated with both strategies, as well as the configuration identification algorithm employed in the second strategy. Experimental analysis, including conducting flight tests, validates the efficacy and performance of the presented control strategies.},

  abstract     = {The Koopman operator theory provides a global linearization framework for general nonlinear dynamics, offering significant advantages for system analysis and control. However, practical applications typically involve approximating the infinite-dimensional Koopman operator in a lifted space spanned by a finite set of observable functions. The accuracy of this approximation is the key to effective Koopman operator-based analysis and control methods, generally improving as the dimension of the observables increases. Nonetheless, this increase in dimensionality significantly escalates both storage requirements and computational complexity, particularly for high-dimensional systems, thereby limiting the applicability of these methods in real-world problems. In this paper, we address this problem by reformulating the Koopman operator in tensor format to break the curse of dimensionality associated with its approximation through tensor decomposition techniques. This effective reduction in complexity enables the selection of high-dimensional observable functions and the handling of large-scale datasets, which leads to a precise linear prediction model utilizing the tensor-based Koopman operator. Furthermore, we propose an optimal control framework with the tensor-based Koopman operator, which adeptly addresses the nonlinear dynamics and constraints by linear reformulation in the lifted space and significantly reduces the computational complexity through separated representation of the tensor structure.},

In this work, we present a number of tensor operator norms as a means to approximately bound the error associated with linear methods and determine the situations in which that maximum error is encountered. An emphasis is placed on induced norms that can be computed in terms of matrix or tensor eigenvalues associated with coefficient tensors from higher-order Taylor series. These operator norms can be used to understand the performance and range of applicability of an algorithm exploiting linear approximations in different sets of coordinates. We examine uses of tensor operator norms in the context of linear and higher-order rendezvous guidance and to present a unified treatment of nonlinearity indices for dynamic systems. Tensor norm computations can offer insights into these problems in one to two orders of magnitude less time than similarly accurate sampling methods while providing more general understanding of the error performance of linear or higher-order approximations.},

  abstract     = {Space manipulators are a key enabling technology for future on-orbit servicing and active debris removal missions, yet conventional rigid designs can limit overall system dexterity. This work introduces a novel hybrid softâ€“rigid space manipulator system (HSMS), which integrates a tendon-driven continuum manipulator with a traditional rigid robot. A strain parameterization technique known as geometric variable strain (GVS) is employed to derive a closed-form, minimum-order dynamic model of the HSMS by leveraging the principle of virtual work. Thrusters and variable-speed control moment gyros are incorporated to activate the spacecraft base and enhance the realism of the description. Two inverse-dynamics control designs are then proposed: one to bring the system to rest from a nonzero momentum condition and another one to track a three-dimensional trajectory in the end-effector task space. Extensive numerical simulations validate both the dynamic model and the proposed controllers, demonstrating the potential of the proposed HSMS concept for advanced space-manipulation tasks.},
