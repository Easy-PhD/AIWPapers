  abstract     = {The broadcloth material used in parachute manufacturing is generally a thin, woven, permeable textile. The small length scales of fibers, pores, and gaps in fabric are challenging to spatially resolve in a full-scale parachute simulation. In this work, simulations are performed using a 3D reconstruction of the broadcloth material used in the Mars 2020 mission, and simulation results using the detailed reconstructed geometry are compared to a simplified model proposed in a previous work. Furthermore, results from simulations under Earth ambient lab conditions are compared to experimental permeability test data to validate the choice of parameters for this reduced-order model. Simulations under ASPIRE SR03 flight-relevant conditions are also performed to study permeability in a rarefied flow regime. It is observed that flow through the material is similar to a developing pipe flow, and under low-density conditions, significant slip velocity is present inside pores. For all conditions investigated, the pressure drag is the primary contributor to the total drag force. Drag and mass flow rate discrepancies are observed between models, motivating future work to investigate the sensitivity of system-level parachute FSI simulations to the assumed permeability model and associated parameters.},

  abstract     = {Coordinated experimental and computational studies were conducted on the ROTEX-T, a cone–flare geometry used in a successful flight-test experiment, with the objectives of explaining the origins of the largest differences between computational and experimental results, assessing code-to-code, facility-to-facility, and ground-to-flight differences, and further illuminating the flight-test results. Background-oriented schlieren, infrared thermography, high-speed self-aligned focusing schlieren, and focused laser differential interferometry measurements were made in two wind tunnels. The surface heat flux and Stanton number distributions were calculated. Separation and reattachment locations, as well as flow state at each, were determined. Computational results were obtained using the VULCAN-CFD and SU2 codes in steady-state mode, and direct numerical simulation (DNS). The nominally steady axisymmetric flow was found to be globally unstable to stationary three-dimensional disturbances concentrated in the reattachment region. Without adding external noise, the disturbance amplitudes computed by DNS were found to be high in the separation bubble, and thus the flow was transitional. The separation location predicted computationally is consistently upstream of the experimental observation. This difference is caused by tunnel noise, whose effect is not incorporated into the computations. Despite this, the computed density field and shape of the separation bubble closely matched that observed experimentally. The maximum vertical density gradient was confirmed as an accurate, very useful definition of the boundary-layer edge. Computed laminar heating rates before separation agreed well with experiment; transitional heating rates after reattachment from experiments were between laminar and turbulent computations. Reattachment location and the flow state upon reattachment were assessed for the flight data. At flight-matched Reynolds numbers, flight trends align with the ground-test results, indicating a transitional shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction.‡‡‡},

  abstract     = {The premise of over-the-wing mounted rotors is that a favorable aerodynamic effect is achieved by interaction with the lifting wing, which also acts as noise shield. A physics-based low-order model is proposed that accounts for aerodynamic interactions in the prediction of the aeroacoustic footprint of the installed rotor. The nonuniform inflow of the rotor disk is modeled by an analytical description of the inviscid potential effects of the wing’s circulation, given as a function of the blade sectional coordinates. Furthermore, the ingestion of the separated boundary layer is considered at large angles of attack. The related steady inflow distortion serves as input to an aeroacoustic noise prediction chain that computes the unsteady loading on the blades and the resulting tonal noise emission by helicoidal surface theory. The model is validated by measurements from a single over-the-wing mounted rotor for a wide range of angle of attack, advance ratios, and rotor positions over the wing’s chord. The predictions and experimental data show an equivalent increase in the tonal components relative to the isolated rotor, and a minimization of the tonal noise for a midchord rotor position, for emission directions around the rotor disk plane over the wing’s suction side.},

  abstract     = {A semi-analytical model is proposed that incorporates aerodynamic interactions between the rotor- and wing-induced flowfields. Predictions are validated through experiments performed with an array of five rotors above an airfoil, where the angle of attack, advance ratio, and chordwise rotor position are varied. At moderate angles of attack, the propulsive thrust is reduced due to the acceleration induced by the wing’s circulation. Around the stall angle of the isolated wing, the rotors re-energize the boundary layer when operated in low-thrust conditions. By increasing the thrust, a pronounced region of reverse flow between the rotors and wing adversely affects the leading-edge separation delay over the wing that occurs for lower thrust settings. However, in this condition, the wing–rotor-array system exhibits increased thrust compared to the attached flow condition due to the rotors ingesting low-momentum flow. In addition, the rotor-induced flow over the wing augments suction, while the pressure side is subjected to a pressure increase, ascribed to flow entrainment from the rotors. After comparison with the experimental observations, it is confirmed that the model predictions accurately describe the lift and thrust performance trends, aside from a discrepancy in the lift force when the rotors are operated in low-thrust conditions.},

The analysis is focused on the physics of the second-mode instability at high enthalpy and the role of high-temperature effects. Although the stability solvers considering thermochemical nonequilibrium were best at estimating the measured second-mode frequency ( for shot 2990, for shot 3019), they overpredicted the most amplified frequency by approximately 16–23%. A moderate spread in the predicted most amplified frequency was also observed between the different solvers. The solvers estimated a most amplified frequency range of approximately 1450–1550 kHz for shot 2990 and approximately 1525–1650 kHz for shot 3019. There was also significant inconsistency observed in predicting the peak -factor magnitude, ranging from for shot 2990 and from for shot 3019.},

  abstract     = {This research introduces a novel structure for a doubly curved shallow shell, termed the “single-variable-edge and variable-thickness doubly curved shallow shell” (SVEVT-DCSS). The shell is constructed from a functionally graded carbon nanotube/fiber/polymer multiscale laminated composite with three distinct carbon nanotube distribution patterns: uniform distribution (UD), FG-O, and FG-X. These distributions are modeled using the Halpin–Tsai micromechanical approach and an orthotropic micromechanical model. Employing the theory of elasticity and the Von Karman–Donnell geometrical nonlinearity assumption, the governing equations for the mechanical behavior of the shell, which rests on a Winkler–Pasternak elastic foundation and is subjected to a thermomechanical environment, are formulated. By applying Galerkin’s method to these equations, the dynamic characteristics of the shell are determined. The nonlinear dynamic responses of the SVEVT-DCSS are analyzed with a focus on both periodic and chaotic behavior. Furthermore, the accuracy and reliability of the results are validated through comparisons with existing literature and finite element method simulations. The findings, presented through numerical tables and graphical figures, demonstrate the significant potential of this novel shell structure for practical engineering applications, contributing to advancements in aerospace, civil, and mechanical engineering.},

The Newmark- method is utilized to calculate the dynamic characteristics of the rotor system. The influence of the positions and normal forces of the dampers on the critical speed, vibration, strain energy distribution, and sensitivity of the rotor is analyzed. The results show that the vibration suppression is related to both the equivalent damping coefficient and the equivalent dynamic stiffness of the DFD. The influence of the DFD on the strain energy distribution of the rotor is notable. The parameter selection of DFDs should balance vibration suppression and strain energy distribution in a rotor system. The installation position of DFDs significantly modulates rotor dynamic behavior. The parameter design of DFDs must be guided by rotor strain energy distribution while incorporating speed-dependent adaptation to ensure vibration suppression across operational states. This study is of great significance for exploring the optimal control strategy of the DFD-rotor system.},

This paper proposes a novel nonlinear unsteady aerodynamic ROM formulated as a highly compact multi-input Volterra series. Orthogonal matching pursuit is used to obtain a set of optimally sparse nonlinear multi-input ROM coefficients from unsteady aerodynamic training data. The framework is exemplified in an aeroelastic setting using the benchmark supercritical wing, considering forced response, flutter, and limit cycle oscillation. The simple and efficient optimal sparsity multi-input ROM framework performs with high accuracy compared to the full-order aeroelastic model, requiring only a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of possible multi-input terms to be identified and allowing a 98% reduction in the number of training samples.},

Schlieren imaging, nitric oxide planar laser-induced fluorescence (NO-PLIF) imaging, and pressure transducer techniques are employed to visualize flow structures and conduct parametric measurements. Numerical simulations are conducted to shed light on the flow structures and elucidate the underlying mechanisms as well. The results indicate that NO-PLIF imaging can effectively capture the spatially resolved structures surrounding the jet exit. Both the Mach disk height and barrel shock width are positively correlated with the jet momentum ratio and angle of attack . Furthermore, the pressure plateau and peak distribution upstream and downstream of the sonic orifice are also significantly influenced by and . Specifically, peak pressure increases with an increase in , while it drops for a larger .

Nonetheless, these models have some limitations in simulating flows with adverse pressure gradients due to the inclusion of various assumptions, such as the eddy viscosity hypothesis. As a result, many researchers have focused their efforts on improving turbulence models, including parameter calibration. In this paper, a progressive neural network framework is utilized to modify the dissipation coefficients of the shear-stress transport (SST) model into a function of physical quantities. Firstly, the zero pressure gradient flat plate case is employed to obtain the calibrated model SST-FP. Subsequently, the flow with a turbulent separation bubble is adopted to progressively acquire the calibrated model SST-TSB. The enhanced model performs well in predicting the mean velocity profile, friction coefficient, and other variables of training cases, owing to joint corrections on the and equations. Furthermore, verification research demonstrates that the SST-TSB model mitigates the potential damage to the wall-law prediction. It can also adapt the forecast properly in circumstances where the original model predicts larger or smaller separation zones, avoiding the drawbacks that Bayesian inference and other methods have when applied to parameter calibration.},

In this paper, the phenomenon of wave dispersion that causes this effect is exploited through time reversibility to focus waves both spatially and temporally and hence amplify the peak response at a chosen position. Harmonic finite element analysis is first undertaken to determine the wave bearing characteristics of a simplified representation of a wing leading edge. Transient analysis is then performed on the structure with an attached ice layer to focus disturbances of bandwidths up to 50 kHz at different chosen points. The amplitude of the peak shear stress between the ice and substrate is bandwidth dependent and predicted to be up to 30 times higher than due to a comparable pulse input. Predicted peak accelerations are successfully validated experimentally for a limited bandwidth of 10 kHz.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical structure design can improve the structural efficiency of lightweight sandwich structures, and the potential for multifunctional design is also considerable. By constructing fishbone-shaped Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) arrays onto the grid walls and introducing Absorbent Honeycomb Sandwich Structure (AHS) as its small-scale configuration, Hierarchical Grid Hybrid Absorber (HGHA) is proposed. By deriving the equivalent models of absorbent honeycomb, its Electromagnetic (EM) and mechanical properties are decoupled. The high relative permittivity and dielectric loss of AHS, combined with the local strong E-filed excited by the CFRP arrays, broaden the absorption band towards lower frequency and significantly reduce the reflection loss (RL), respectively. After optimization, HGHA achieves broadband (2–18 GHz), wide-angle (0–60°), and efficient (average ) EM wave absorption. Furthermore, honeycomb provide efficient lateral support for the grid walls, changing its failure mode from elastic buckling to plastic microbuckling. Thus, the specific compressive strength and specific energy absorption of HGHA is improved by 99.3% and 173%, respectively, compared to grid sandwich structure. It demonstrates that HGHA is competitive among radar absorbing structures and composite sandwich structures, providing a novel solution for the lightweight, high-efficiency, and multifunctional design of aircraft structures.},

The jet speed and temperature ratio are significantly higher than most laboratory facilities. At these high-speed and high-temperature conditions, compressibility effects become important. It is, therefore, possible that high-performance aircraft could emit a new noise component that has not been observed before. In the case of laboratory jets, turbulent mixing noise is generated by the shearing motion of the jet flow. The details of the process are discussed in this paper and others. In addition, this paper reports the identification of a new noise component from high-performance aircraft. This new noise component contains a significant fraction of infrasound. Infrasound at high intensity could lead to body cavity resonance. It becomes a health hazard. How this noise component is related to the early experimental observations of Mach wave radiation from shock-tube-generated jets, first reported by Oertel, and subsequent analysis based on the Euler equation by Tam and Hu are examined. The existence of the new noise component, which is the dominant component at an inlet angle larger than 140 deg, is confirmed by spectral data, directivity data, and as-measured sound pulse data.},

  abstract     = {Bistable deployable composite booms (Bi-DCBs) have broad application prospects in space deployable structures due to unique bistable characteristics, efficient stowage, lightweight, and excellent mechanical properties. However, the contrasting structural requirements (i.e., stiffness, stability) and operational requirements (i.e., lightweight, compact, and stowage) pose challenges to engineering design. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a many-objective optimization formulation for the Bi-DCB, leveraging the respective advantages of the analytical and surrogate models, aiming to achieve a balance between multiple objectives, thereby obtaining the optimal comprehensive performance. In this formulation, the cross-sectional radius, cross-sectional angle, and length are selected as design variables while ensuring that the Bi-DCB does not fail during operation. Based on these, an optimization model is established with the objectives to minimize the linear density and the longitude-sectional polar radius at the endpoint and to maximize the average strain energy and the natural frequency. To verify optimal results, benchmark testing and performance evaluation are conducted using different algorithms, and the Pareto front containing 112 solutions is ultimately found, all superior to the initial sample in four objectives. These solutions achieve a good balance and coordination among multiple objectives, providing optimal performance schemes for the design of the Bi-DCB.},

  abstract     = {This study uses direct numerical simulations (DNSs) with PyFR (www.pyfr.org) to investigate the impact of freestream disturbances on the performance of nonconventional triangular airfoils for Martian rotorcraft. First, triangular airfoils optimized for steady uniform freestream conditions at a 12 deg angle of attack are subjected to unsteady upstream conditions containing freestream eddies with various target turbulence intensities and characteristic length scales. Results show that the freestream eddies lead to a breakdown of coherent suction-side vortices and a reduction of aerodynamic forces, with the magnitude of this effect increasing with higher turbulence intensities and larger length scales. Building on this, DNSs are then used to optimize triangular airfoils at a 12 deg angle of attack for unsteady upstream conditions containing freestream eddies. The new designs still leverage an unsteady vortex roll-up mechanism to generate lift. However, their shapes are different from those obtained when optimizing for steady uniform inflow conditions, with their apexes closer to the trailing edge. This downstream apex position allows for the smaller and weaker vortices that result from the interaction of the freestream eddies with the separated shear layer to cover a larger suction surface area. Taken together, the results demonstrate the importance of considering freestream disturbances when designing nonconventional airfoils for use on a Martian rotorcraft.},

  abstract     = {Numerical simulations show great potential to reduce the need for costly physical flight testing during takeoff and landing, thereby decreasing the time-to-market for future aircraft. In order to validate computational fluid dynamics results, we often perform wind-tunnel experiments. However, most simulations in the literature are performed at free-air conditions, neglecting confinement effects, and therefore the wind-tunnel data must be corrected based on empirical methods. In the present work, we compare free-air and in-tunnel simulations of NASA’s high-lift configuration of the Common Research Model (CRM-HL) and quantify sensitivities for steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS)-based methods and unsteady scale-resolving hybrid RANS/large-eddy simulations (HRLESs). Uncertainties associated with the choice of turbulence model, initialization strategies, and boundary conditions are covered. The present study provides valuable lessons learned and contributes toward best practices for in-tunnel simulations. For maximum lift prediction, RANS-based methods lead to nonphysical flow-separation patterns considering both free-air and in-tunnel configurations. We show consistency between in-tunnel and free-air HRLESs in terms of statistical and unsteady characteristics and reasonable agreement with wind-tunnel data. However, in-tunnel simulations increase the levels of complexity considerably and require long initial transients (independent of the initialization strategy). In order to explain persisting differences between simulation and experiment, we require better characterization of wind-tunnel flow conditions.},

In the LES, the new mechanisms for ethanol, n-heptane, and Jet A match available experimental data well, whereas the C1 mechanism slightly underpredicts the flame size.

Both the plate and stiffeners are modeled using the first-order shear deformation theory. Functionally graded material (FGM) properties vary continuously in the thickness direction using the power law. Compared to Finite Element Method (FEM), the Ritz method is beneficial while applying the skin-stiffener compatibility conditions, as the stiffeners can be placed arbitrarily and do not have to share nodes with the base structure finite element model. Such an approach would be efficient during shape optimization studies, as remeshing of the structure would not be required for changes in geometry. Orthogonal Jacobi polynomials as trial functions make the Ritz analysis robust, as they do not suffer matrix ill-conditioning-induced numerical issues when higher-order polynomials are required to accurately obtain the complex buckling mode shapes for curvilinearly stiffened panels. Stiffener displacements are approximated independently using one-dimensional trial functions, and compatibility is explicitly satisfied at the integration points along the stiffener path, which saves the computational cost by reducing the integration order. Accuracy of the proposed method is verified using several literature examples and commercial FEM software. Parametric studies on buckling response of the studied model with variation in the FGM power law index are conducted.},

The configuration examined is a panel located downstream of a compression ramp. First, the ramp is exposed to Mach 4 flow, and the frequency content of pressure fluctuations in the turbulent boundary layer upstream and downstream of the compression corner is compared. It is found that intermediate frequencies that may influence fluid-structure interaction propagate into the downstream boundary layer. Next, the coupling mechanism between turbulence and structural responses is studied. Changes in turbulence caused by structural deformations are examined, followed by an investigation into the aeroelastic effects of modified turbulence on a flexible panel. One-way coupling exists between turbulence and structural responses because structural deformations significantly affect turbulence properties, but variations in turbulence have minor effects on structural responses. Finally, the role of turbulence in fluid-structure interaction is determined. Pressure fluctuation histories of varying intensity are applied to panels of varying thickness. A threshold is established indicating when boundary layer turbulence causes moderate structural deformations. The findings of the paper provide guidelines for designing control surfaces of hypersonic vehicles subjected to turbulent shock wave-boundary layer interaction effects.},

A macroscopic numerical method for laser ablation under high-speed flow conditions was developed based on carbon/carbon (C/C) materials. The model includes both oxidation and sublimation processes of C/C materials. For the first time, mass injection effects on ablation characteristics were introduced. Numerical simulations of laser ablation on a flat plate model were conducted under Mach 6 and static conditions. The temperature evolution in the ablation zone was analyzed. Changes in flow characteristics due to ablation injection and high-speed airflow were examined in detail. Additionally, the impact of these flow changes on ablation characteristics was investigated. Results indicate that the airflow significantly affects temperature responses at different wall positions. The isotherms in the ablation zone bend downstream. The total ablation rate at Mach 6 is 5.3% higher than in static conditions. Local flow characteristics are altered by both ablation injection and high-speed flow, creating a high-pressure zone. This zone evolves continuously, leading to pressure variations at different wall locations. These local pressure changes significantly affect the sublimation rate of the wall, thereby influencing the ablation rate.},

  abstract     = {Aerobots are expected to play a key role in future missions to explore the atmospheres of Venus and other planetary bodies. Proposed missions to Venus involve lowering instruments on tethers toward the inhospitable surface from balloons at altitudes on the order of 50 km. Accurately capturing the viscoelastic behavior of the tethers in system design models is essential for managing response and loads during dynamic events (deployment, gusts, flight control) and following long-term aging in extreme environments. The behavior of materials likely to be used in tethers, such as Kevlar, is well-described by a fractional derivative viscoelastic model. One of the shortcomings of such models is the challenge of numerical time integration of the system equations of motion. In this work, fractional derivative behavior is approximated using a multi-anelastic displacement fields (multi-ADF) model. The multi-ADF model augments the instantaneous displacement field with multiple discrete internal displacement fields that individually evolve following first-order relaxation processes. Notably, while the fractional derivative model is nonlocal in time, requiring the entire history for evaluation, the first-order version is local, essentially capturing the history in the present values of internal state variables. A multi-ADF finite element model of a tether with an instrument gondola is developed, and a Newmark time integration scheme is used to obtain the dynamic response of the system during a drop test. The multi-ADF model is shown to be very accurate for creep, dynamics, and gondola-drop simulations, and it runs in a small fraction of the time required by a direct fractional-derivative model.},

  abstract     = {The accurate modeling of hypersonic environments, including coupled ablation, is a challenging problem due to the complex flow physics, numerical accuracy, and robustness required for these simulations. The simulation mesh needs to be designed carefully, and structured high-aspect ratio stretched grids are typically used to properly capture the high wall-normal gradients. The mesh generation process proves to be a cumbersome and time-consuming process for realistic and complex vehicles, creating a severe bottleneck to the current CFD workflow. This work highlights the development of the Cartesian Higher-Order Adaptive Multi-Physics Solver (CHAMPS) near-body Cartesian grid solver, capable of automatic volume mesh generation, and its accurate and robust use in simulating coupled ablation for steady-state graphite ablation by interfacing with the Kentucky Aerothermodynamics and Thermal Response System Material Response (KATS-MR) solver. Validation on a Mach 8.7 cylinder and a Mach 22.88 axisymmetric Mars 2020 capsule showcases the challenges associated with shock-capturing on non-shock-aligned Cartesian grids. A verification study of the CHAMPS–KATS coupled ablation framework is performed for steady-state graphite ablation on a Mach 25.2, 9 deg blunt cone, followed by the validation of the solver for a blunt cone in the NASA Ames Interaction Heating Facility arcjet.},

  abstract     = {We present a nonintrusive surrogate model to emulate time-dependent flow problems. Our approach enhances spatial mode decomposition using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to spectral model decomposition via spectral POD (SPOD), along with mapping of the spectrum in each case onto a common spectral domain. This alignment enables the collapse of fundamental frequencies in different cases into a single frequency. To emulate a new flowfield, we apply the kriging method to predict the SPOD coefficients for the target case, followed by flowfield reconstruction using the inverse Fourier transform. In our examples of flow past circular and square cylinders, we demonstrate the limitations of emulation based on POD or SPOD without a common spectral domain, as they fail to predict the fundamental frequency accurately. However, our proposed approach employing SPOD in the rescaled spectral domain successfully predicts the velocity spectrum and achieves a good predictability for time-dependent lift and mean drag. Moreover, we underscore the necessity of unbiased training data for the method’s efficacy. This study proposes a robust, nonintrusive surrogate modeling strategy to capture time-dependent features of flow problems, which is crucial for design purposes where time dependency between parameters is significant.},

The results demonstrated that the lift–drag ratio can be increased by about 21.8% without drag penalty after plasma actuation. Meanwhile, the time-averaged flowfield indicated that the separation region area around the flap is reduced by the plasma actuator. Moreover, the leading-edge stagnation point deflects toward the lower surface of the airfoil, which is similar to the effect of increasing the angle of attack and leads to the increment of the lift. In addition, the controlling mechanisms of the plasma actuator are uncovered based on the instantaneous flowfield results. It is of great importance that two flow structures produced by the interaction between the plasma actuator and the separated shear layer at different times play an important role in suppressing the separation flow by promoting the mixing between the main flow and the flow near the wall surface, and transferring the momentum from the leading edge of the flap to the trailing edge of the flap. The different characteristics of the separated shear layer at different times is the main reason for the generation of different flow structures of the plasma actuator.},

  abstract     = {The haystack phenomenon is a hallmark of turbulence–propeller interaction and a major source of unsteady thrust and aerodynamic noise in aircraft and underwater applications. This phenomenon is characterized by distinct broadband spectral humps in the unsteady thrust and noise at blade passing frequency harmonics. These humps tend to shift to higher frequencies under certain conditions, known as blue-shifting. Understanding the mechanics behind the haystack is crucial for developing effective flow and noise control strategies. This work introduces a theoretical model to predict unsteady thrust caused by these interactions. This model is validated through comparisons with numerical simulations under various inflow conditions, including single-frequency gusts and broadband turbulence. In addition, we examine the mechanisms of the haystack, with a focus on the influence of key parameters. Beyond its predictive capabilities, the model reveals certain flow structures ingested by the rotor that are related to the unsteady thrust and finally addresses the mechanisms of the blue-shifting phenomenon. This research not only deepens our understanding of the fluid mechanics underlying the haystacks but also provides valuable insights for designing the next generation of low-noise propellers, thereby contributing directly to quieter and more sustainable green aviation.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes a new computational strategy for complex aerodynamic flows that involve multiple powered devices, such as flow control actuators or power systems. A complete computational domain contains all the relevant physical regions, including the inner regions of all the powered devices. The proposed strategy aims to reduce the exorbitant computational resources required to resolve fine flow features within most of the devices. The approach involves modifying an existing computational fluid model by introducing a grid generation step and a boundary condition module. The grid generation step employs a predetermined strategy that is performed prior to the simulation step, resulting in a grid system that includes only a few of the devices. The flow computation is then performed by incorporating special boundary conditions replicated over all the powered devices and continually updated in the course of the time-stepping process. This approach demonstrates high computational efficiency, as exemplified by its application to a wing of a rotorcraft equipped with numerous flow control actuators in hover mode. The results obtained using this replication approach closely match those obtained using a complete computational domain, but with approximately 50% fewer computational resources. Excluding many actuators from the computational domain is particularly advantageous for flows with disparate length scales and time scales, enabling practical computations over sufficiently long times.},

Numerical simulations, performed using a lattice Boltzmann solver ProLB, are validated against these experimental data. While the geometry is relatively simple, this is still a challenging case to accurately predict numerically, particularly the boundary-layer separation bubble that occurs upstream of the spoiler. The flow is characterized by an arch-type broadband wake without any coherent vortex shedding. There is a horseshoe vortex that originates upstream of the spoiler and wraps around both sides of the spoiler. Inboard of the horseshoe vortex there are a pair of ground vortices with the opposite sign vorticity to the horseshoe vortex. A combination of band-filtered on-surface pressures and three-dimensional numerical beamforming was used to determine the noise sources. As well as the broadband bluff body wake and the horseshoe vortex, the beamforming showed that the ground edge vortices and the spoiler side edges were the dominant acoustic sources.},

The coupled-adjoint approach computes gradients efficiently, enabling the optimization of over 100 structural and geometric parameters simultaneously. Our optimization study modifies a DTU 10 MW benchmark with a simplified structure and isotropic material properties. The tightly coupled optimizations increase torque by 14% while reducing rotor mass by 9% or reduce blade mass by 27% while maintaining torque. Blade-resolved models provide greater design freedom, enabling 5% higher mass reductions than conventional parameterizations at equal torque.

  abstract     = {A new surveillance-evasion differential game is posed and solved in which an agile pursuer (the prying pedestrian) seeks to remain within a given surveillance range of a less agile evader that aims to escape. In contrast to previous surveillance-evasion games, the pursuer is agile in the sense of being able to instantaneously change the direction of its velocity vector, while the evader is constrained to have a finite maximum turn rate. Both the game of kind, concerned with conditions under which the evader can escape, and the game of degree, concerned with the evader seeking to minimize the escape time while the pursuer seeks to maximize it, are considered. The game-of-degree solution is surprisingly complex compared to solutions to analogous pursuit-evasion games with an agile pursuer because it exhibits dependence on the ratio of the pursuer’s speed to the evader’s speed. It is, however, surprisingly simple compared to solutions to classic surveillance-evasion games with a turn-limited pursuer.},

  abstract     = {Communication between satellites is an important component of collision-free navigation operations. The work in this paper is motivated by the premise that each satellite has more reliable knowledge of its own state compared to its direct observations of others. The authors aim to leverage this shared, enhanced information among satellites to enable autonomous coordination and collision avoidance. They rely on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to model multiple autonomous satellites interacting in a shared environment with limited observation and communication ranges. First they demonstrate the effectiveness of their method against comparable MARL algorithms. To address the computational expense of MARL, they investigate the effectiveness of transferring a model trained on a ground environment to one trained in space. Despite the fact the two environments have very different dynamics, they show that the transfer learning model outperforms a model that is trained directly on the space environment. Furthermore, even in the presence of additional perturbations, the authors’ transfer learning model is able to accelerate training and achieve comparable rewards. With the effectiveness of their method explored, they then evaluate the benefits of information sharing by studying collision rates and path planning. Their results indicate that sharing maneuver information leads to lower collision rates and more efficient path planning.},

  abstract     = {Center manifold theory describes the phase flow near collinear libration points as a combination of two harmonic oscillations and one hyperbolic motion, the latter driving exponential spacecraft divergence. The Floquet modes approach (FMA), based on Floquet theory, is widely studied but suffers from inefficiency due to its inability to suppress nondivergent components (NDCs) beyond the unstable motion. To overcome this limitation, we propose an improved FMA strategy that leverages the collateral effect of NDCs—a key factor in traditional FMA failures yet exploitable for enhanced control. First, a predictor–corrector algorithm computes a correction factor to refine unstable mode estimation, accounting for unmodeled nonlinearities. Next, the most critical NDC is identified and suppressed, the timing of the next maneuver is predicted, and a maneuver overshoot factor is introduced to regulate excessive NDCs. By strategically selecting maneuver types, our approach ensures effective suppression. Finally, three numerical simulations validate the method’s effectiveness, versatility, and robustness.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops the mathematical framework to use higher-order state transition tensor (STT) approximations of nonlinear dynamics to design impulsive spacecraft maneuvers incorporating the effects of state uncertainty. Several semi-analytic formulations are derived strictly as a function of a reference STT expansion, including minimum-energy, minimum-covariance, and maximum-covariance cost functions; mean state constraints; state chance constraints; and control-linear maneuver execution errors. Analytical gradients are derived for most of the formulations, which can be used to speed up optimization procedures developed with these equations. A tractable approximation of the nonlinear covariance propagation equations is also derived to further speed up these calculations. Example applications for each of the formulations are provided for a multi-impulse, highly nonlinear transfer in the Earth–moon system. The proposed methodology can be used to efficiently compute a variety of maneuvers accounting for the effects of spacecraft state uncertainty using a single STT expansion. This can enable more flexible and rapid maneuver planning in reaction to changing mission priorities, navigation errors, and maneuver execution errors.},

  abstract     = {Aerocapture leverages atmospheric drag to convert a spacecraft’s hyperbolic trajectory into a bound orbit. For some aerocapture missions, heating due to the radiation of high-temperature gases in the shock layer can be much larger than the heat due to convection. This paper provides analytical proof and numerical validation that radiative heat load is minimized by the same trajectory that minimizes the final : a single switch bang-bang trajectory, starting with lift-up. The proof is general and is valid for several formulations of radiative heat flux; further, the same proof can be used to conclude that convective heat load, computed according to many of the available formulations, is instead maximized by that trajectory. Further, a novel guidance that plans a bang-bang trajectory with constraints in the attitude kinematics is introduced. While achieving performance similar to that of the current state-of-the-art, the inclusion of constraints in attitude kinematics allows for much less tuning. Finally, a lateral guidance that makes use of information on the final inclination of the predicted trajectory is introduced. Such guidance allows for very high accuracy in the inclination requirements with only two reversals by requiring a single parameter to be tuned.},

In Auto-SCvx, the authors solve a sequence of convex subproblems until convergence to a solution of the original nonconvex problem. This method iteratively optimizes dual variables in closed form in order to update the penalty hyperparameters used in the primal variable updates. A benefit of this method is that it is autotuning and requires no hand tuning by the user with respect to the constraint penalty weights. Several example hypersonic reentry problems are posed and solved using this method, and comparative studies are conducted against current methods. In these numerical studies, our algorithm demonstrates equal and often improved performance while not requiring hand tuning of penalty hyperparameters.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous on-orbit assembly operations are usually translated into complex optimal control problems requiring advanced methods to solve. Solved through either direct methods or indirect methods, these optimal control problems are known to be highly sensitive to the initial guess provided to the solver. This paper proposes an algorithm to reduce the problem’s sensitivity to the initial guess by integrating the continuation method and the notion of reinforcement learning. To this end, a continuation space is formed from a trivial problem with a known solution to the desired optimal control problem. A set of continuation parameters, selected from the state, control, or constraint variables, forms the basis for this continuation space. Finding a suitable continuation path is problematic since it requires a comprehensive search algorithm that considers several factors, such as the choice of continuation parameters and continuation steps for each parameter, to find an appropriate path. To search for this path, a reinforcement learning search agent was proposed based on the Sarsa method to traverse the continuation space in real-time for a continuation trajectory satisfying some desired criteria. Numerical experiments were conducted for a series of autonomous on-orbit assembly operations using robotic spacecraft to demonstrate the capability of the proposed technique. Various simulations with different reward functions showed that the shape and size of the objects in the assembly environment affect the solver’s performance.},
