To this end, we follow a directed linear preferential attachment model for a random, heavy-tailed number of steps in time and treat the incoming edge count of all existing nodes as a random vector of random length. By combining martingale properties, moment bounds and a Breiman type theorem we show that the resulting quantity is multivariate regularly varying, both as a vector of fixed length formed by the edge counts of a finite number of oldest nodes, and also as a vector of random length viewed in sequence space. A Pólya urn representation allows us to explicitly describe the extremal dependence between the degrees with the help of Dirichlet distributions. As a by-product of our analysis we establish new results for almost sure convergence of the edge counts in sequence space as the number of nodes goes to infinity.},

  abstract     = {We study continuous-time Markov chains on the nonnegative integers under mild regularity conditions (in particular, the set of jump vectors is finite and both forward and backward jumps are possible). Based on the so-called flux balance equation, we derive an iterative formula for calculating stationary measures. Specifically, a stationary measure $\pi(x)$ evaluated at $x\in\mathbb{N}_0$ is represented as a linear combination of a few generating terms, similarly to the characterization of a stationary measure of a birth–death process, where there is only one generating term, $\pi(0)$ . The coefficients of the linear combination are recursively determined in terms of the transition rates of the Markov chain. For the class of Markov chains we consider, there is always at least one stationary measure (up to a scaling constant). We give various results pertaining to uniqueness and nonuniqueness of stationary measures, and show that the dimension of the linear space of signed invariant measures is at most the number of generating terms. A minimization problem is constructed in order to compute stationary measures numerically. Moreover, a heuristic linear approximation scheme is suggested for the same purpose by first approximating the generating terms. The correctness of the linear approximation scheme is justified in some special cases. Furthermore, a decomposition of the state space into different types of states (open and closed irreducible classes, and trapping, escaping and neutral states) is presented. Applications to stochastic reaction networks are well illustrated.},

We use two Euler–Maruyama schemes with decreasing step sizes $\Gamma = (\gamma_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ to approximate the invariant measure of $(X_t)_{t \geqslant 0}$ : one uses independent and identically distributed $\alpha$ -stable random variables as innovations, and the other employs independent and identically distributed Pareto random variables. We study the convergence rates of these two approximation schemes in the Wasserstein-1 distance. For the first scheme, under the assumption that the function b is Lipschitz and satisfies a certain dissipation condition, we demonstrate a convergence rate of $\gamma^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}_n$ . This convergence rate can be improved to $\gamma^{1+\frac {1}{\alpha}-\frac{1}{\kappa}}_n$ for any $\kappa \in [1,\alpha)$ , provided b has the additional regularity of bounded second-order directional derivatives. For the second scheme, where the function b is assumed to be twice continuously differentiable, we establish a convergence rate of $\gamma^{\frac{2-\alpha}{\alpha}}_n$ ; moreover, we show that this rate is optimal for the one-dimensional stable Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. Our theorems indicate that the recent significant result of [ 34 ] concerning the unadjusted Langevin algorithm with additive innovations can be extended to stochastic differential equations driven by an $\alpha$ -stable Lévy process and that the corresponding convergence rate exhibits similar behaviour. Compared with the result in [ 6 ], our assumptions have relaxed the second-order differentiability condition, requiring only a Lipschitz condition for the first scheme, which broadens the applicability of our approach.},

We prove that the expected Betti numbers grow sublinearly fast, with the trivial exceptions of those at dimensions 0 and 1. Our result also shows that preferential attachment graphs undergo infinitely many phase transitions within the parameter regime where the limiting degree distribution has an infinite variance. Regarding higher-order connectivity, our result shows that preferential attachment favors higher-order connectivity. We illustrate our theoretical results with simulations.},

Motivated by the above example and the long-established approximation of epidemic processes by branching processes, we explore the number of individuals alive in a time-inhomogeneous branching process with a general phase-type lifetime distribution given only (partial) information on the times of deaths of individuals. Deaths are detected independently with a detection probability that can vary with time and type. We show that the number of individuals alive immediately after the k th detected death can be expressed as the mixture of random variables each of which consists of the sum of k independent zero-modified geometric distributions. Furthermore, in the case of an Erlang lifetime distribution, we derive an easy-to-compute mixture of negative binomial distributions as an approximation of the number of individuals alive immediately after the k th detected death.},

  abstract     = {A pervasive approach in scientific computing is to express the solution to a given problem as the limit of a sequence of vectors or other mathematical objects. In many situations these sequences are generated by slowly converging iterative procedures, and this led practitioners to seek faster alternatives to reach the limit. ‘Acceleration techniques’ comprise a broad array of methods specifically designed with this goal in mind. They started as a means of improving the convergence of general scalar sequences by various forms of ‘extrapolation to the limit’, i.e. by extrapolating the most recent iterates to the limit via linear combinations. Extrapolation methods of this type, the best-known of which is Aitken’s delta-squared process, require only the sequence of vectors as input. However, limiting methods to use only the iterates is too restrictive. Accelerating sequences generated by fixed-point iterations by utilizing both the iterates and the fixed-point mapping itself has proved highly successful across various areas of physics. A notable example of these fixed-point accelerators (FP-accelerators) is a method developed by Donald Anderson in 1965 and now widely known as Anderson acceleration (AA). Furthermore, quasi-Newton and inexact Newton methods can also be placed in this category since they can be invoked to find limits of fixed-point iteration sequences by employing exactly the same ingredients as those of the FP-accelerators. This paper presents an overview of these methods – with an emphasis on those, such as AA, that are geared toward accelerating fixed-point iterations. We will navigate through existing variants of accelerators, their implementations and their applications, to unravel the close connections between them. These connections were often not recognized by the originators of certain methods, who sometimes stumbled on slight variations of already established ideas. Furthermore, even though new accelerators were invented in different corners of science, the underlying principles behind them are strikingly similar or identical. The plan of this article will approximately follow the historical trajectory of extrapolation and acceleration methods, beginning with a brief description of extrapolation ideas, followed by the special case of linear systems, the application to self-consistent field (SCF) iterations, and a detailed view of Anderson acceleration. The last part of the paper is concerned with more recent developments, including theoretical aspects, and a few thoughts on accelerating machine learning algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) studies decision problems under uncertainty where the probability distribution governing the uncertain problem parameters is itself uncertain. A key component of any DRO model is its ambiguity set, that is, a family of probability distributions consistent with any available structural or statistical information. DRO seeks decisions that perform best under the worst distribution in the ambiguity set. This worst case criterion is supported by findings in psychology and neuroscience, which indicate that many decision-makers have a low tolerance for distributional ambiguity. DRO is rooted in statistics, operations research and control theory, and recent research has uncovered its deep connections to regularization techniques and adversarial training in machine learning. This survey presents the key findings of the field in a unified and self-contained manner.},

  abstract     = {This paper reviews current theoretical and numerical approaches to optimization problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) that depend on random variables or random fields. Such problems arise in many engineering, science, economics and societal decision-making tasks. This paper focuses on problems in which the governing PDEs are parametrized by the random variables/fields, and the decisions are made at the beginning and are not revised once uncertainty is revealed. Examples of such problems are presented to motivate the topic of this paper, and to illustrate the impact of different ways to model uncertainty in the formulations of the optimization problem and their impact on the solution. A linear–quadratic elliptic optimal control problem is used to provide a detailed discussion of the set-up for the risk-neutral optimization problem formulation, study the existence and characterization of its solution, and survey numerical methods for computing it. Different ways to model uncertainty in the PDE-constrained optimization problem are surveyed in an abstract setting, including risk measures, distributionally robust optimization formulations, probabilistic functions and chance constraints, and stochastic orders. Furthermore, approximation-based optimization approaches and stochastic methods for the solution of the large-scale PDE-constrained optimization problems under uncertainty are described. Some possible future research directions are outlined.},

  abstract     = {Time parallelization, also known as PinT (parallel-in-time), is a new research direction for the development of algorithms used for solving very large-scale evolution problems on highly parallel computing architectures. Despite the fact that interesting theoretical work on PinT appeared as early as 1964, it was not until 2004, when processor clock speeds reached their physical limit, that research in PinT took off. A distinctive characteristic of parallelization in time is that information flow only goes forward in time, meaning that time evolution processes seem necessarily to be sequential. Nevertheless, many algorithms have been developed for PinT computations over the past two decades, and they are often grouped into four basic classes according to how the techniques work and are used: shooting-type methods; waveform relaxation methods based on domain decomposition; multigrid methods in space–time; and direct time parallel methods. However, over the past few years, it has been recognized that highly successful PinT algorithms for parabolic problems struggle when applied to hyperbolic problems. We will therefore focus on this important aspect, first by providing a summary of the fundamental differences between parabolic and hyperbolic problems for time parallelization. We then group PinT algorithms into two basic groups. The first group contains four effective PinT techniques for hyperbolic problems: Schwarz waveform relaxation (SWR) with its relation to tent pitching; parallel integral deferred correction; ParaExp; and ParaDiag. While the methods in the first group also work well for parabolic problems, we then present PinT methods specifically designed for parabolic problems in the second group: Parareal; the parallel full approximation scheme in space–time (PFASST); multigrid reduction in time (MGRiT); and space–time multigrid (STMG). We complement our analysis with numerical illustrations using four time-dependent PDEs: the heat equation; the advection–diffusion equation; Burgers’ equation; and the second-order wave equation.},

  abstract     = {The discontinuous Petrov–Galerkin (DPG) method is a Petrov–Galerkin finite element method with test functions designed for obtaining stability. These test functions are computable locally, element by element, and are motivated by optimal test functions which attain the supremum in an inf-sup condition. A profound consequence of the use of nearly optimal test functions is that the DPG method can inherit the stability of the (undiscretized) variational formulation, be it coercive or not. This paper combines a presentation of the fundamentals of the DPG ideas with a review of the ongoing research on theory and applications of the DPG methodology. The scope of the presented theory is restricted to linear problems on Hilbert spaces, but pointers to extensions are provided. Multiple viewpoints to the basic theory are provided. They show that the DPG method is equivalent to a method which minimizes a residual in a dual norm, as well as to a mixed method where one solution component is an approximate error representation function. Being a residual minimization method, the DPG method yields Hermitian positive definite stiffness matrix systems even for non-self-adjoint boundary value problems. Having a built-in error representation, the method has the out-of-the-box feature that it can immediately be used in automatic adaptive algorithms. Contrary to standard Galerkin methods, which are uninformed about test and trial norms, the DPG method must be equipped with a concrete test norm which enters the computations. Of particular interest are variational formulations in which one can tailor the norm to obtain robust stability. Key techniques to rigorously prove convergence of DPG schemes, including construction of Fortin operators, which in the DPG case can be done element by element, are discussed in detail. Pointers to open frontiers are presented.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble Kalman methods, introduced in 1994 in the context of ocean state estimation, are now widely used for state estimation and parameter estimation (inverse problems) in many arenae. Their success stems from the fact that they take an underlying computational model as a black box to provide a systematic, derivative-free methodology for incorporating observations; furthermore the ensemble approach allows for sensitivities and uncertainties to be calculated. Analysis of the accuracy of ensemble Kalman methods, especially in terms of uncertainty quantification, is lagging behind empirical success; this paper provides a unifying mean-field-based framework for their analysis. Both state estimation and parameter estimation problems are considered, and formulations in both discrete and continuous time are employed. For state estimation problems, both the control and filtering approaches are considered; analogously for parameter estimation problems, the optimization and Bayesian perspectives are both studied. As well as providing an elegant framework, the mean-field perspective also allows for the derivation of a variety of methods used in practice. In addition it unifies a wide-ranging literature in the field and suggests open problems.},

In recent years, CutFEM has gained significant attention for its ability to discretize partial differential equations in domains with intricate geometries. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the core concepts and key developments in CutFEM, beginning with its formulation for common model problems and the presentation of fundamental analytical results, including error estimates and condition number estimates for the resulting algebraic systems. Stabilization techniques for cut elements, which ensure numerical robustness, are also explored.

As an application of our result, we study upper tail large deviations for homomorphism densities of regular graphs. We identify the existence of a ‘symmetric’ phase, where the graph, conditioned on the rare event, looks like a block model with the same block sizes as the generating graphon. In specific examples, we also identify the existence of a ‘symmetry breaking’ regime, where the conditional structure is not a block model with compatible dimensions. This identifies a ‘reentrant phase transition’ phenomenon for this problem – analogous to one established for Erdős–Rényi random graphs [13, 14]. Finally, extending the analysis of [34], we identify the precise boundary between the symmetry and symmetry breaking regimes for homomorphism densities of regular graphs and the operator norm on Erdős–Rényi bipartite graphs.},

It is the subject of the celebrated container method which found numerous spectacular applications over the years. We consider the question of how many independent sets we can have in a graph under structural restrictions. We show that any $n$ -vertex graph with independence number $\alpha$ without $bK_a$ as an induced subgraph has at most $n^{O(1)} \cdot \alpha ^{O(\alpha )}$ independent sets. This substantially improves the trivial upper bound of $n^{\alpha },$ whenever $\alpha \le n^{o(1)}$ and gives a characterisation of graphs forbidding which allows for such an improvement. It is also in general tight up to a constant in the exponent since there exist triangle-free graphs with $\alpha ^{\Omega (\alpha )}$ independent sets. We also prove that if one in addition assumes the ground graph is chi-bounded one can improve the bound to $n^{O(1)} \cdot 2^{O(\alpha )}$ which is tight up to a constant factor in the exponent.},

They fluctuate with demographic variables, and they seem to be increasing over time. We therefore find ourselves measuring with the equivalent of what Wittgenstein termed an “elastic ruler.” I then propose a “skeptical solution” to the problem. Elastic rulers are suitable tools for measuring dynamic, floating networks of values, like foreign currency exchanges. We can assuage the skeptical concerns by understanding clinical trials in this way; I suggest several practical guidelines for doing so.},

Thermodynamic temperature is unambiguously defined as rate of change of energy with entropy at constant momentum; that said, its operational significance is limited and other measures of energy/entropy covariance, which incorporate momentum transfer, are often more useful.},

This involves reshaping causal understanding of phenomena with distracting information. Using case studies and causal models, we illustrate how this impacts belief and decision making even for rational learners, informing science policy and debates about misleading content.},
