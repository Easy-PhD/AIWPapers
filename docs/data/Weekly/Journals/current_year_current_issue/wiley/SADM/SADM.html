  abstract = {Data streams, characterized by high velocity and volume, pose significant challenges for real-time data analysis. Online learning methods have become increasingly prominent for handling these challenges efficiently. In this paper, we consider an online renewable algorithm for composite quantile regression, which only needs to retain the key information in the historical data and update the summary statistics with the currently accessible data to obtain a renewable estimator. The proposed method is theoretically proven to be asymptotically equivalent to the oracle estimator derived from the entire dataset, offering advantages in computational and memory efficiency. Unlike previous approaches that impose constraints on batch numbers or data variance, our method is unconstrained by these factors. Meanwhile, numerical simulations and experiments on real data sets demonstrate that our estimator not only surpasses existing methods in handling both homogeneous and heterogeneous data but also performs better than traditional Quantile Regression in various scenarios. These findings highlight the suitability of our approach for real-world streaming data applications.},

  abstract = {In the era of big data, accurately predicting trends and uncertainties in time series data is crucial for various fields, such as finance and engineering. This paper proposes an adaptive weighted regularized quantile regression gated recurrent unit (AWR-QRGRU) algorithm. The gated recurrent unit (GRU) is employed to capture long-term dependencies in the sequence and generate predictions for multiple quantiles through a fully connected layer, thereby enabling both point forecasts and interval forecasts with varying confidence levels. In the proposed prediction algorithm, the loss function incorporates coverage loss, median loss, interval width loss, and regularization loss. An adaptive weight adjustment mechanism was implemented to dynamically optimize the weights of these different loss terms, enhancing the accuracy and stability of the predictions when dealing with multidimensional explanatory variables. Subsequently, we conducted Monte Carlo experiments to validate the algorithm's effectiveness in both point and interval predictions. Ultimately, the algorithm was applied to predict Amazon's and NVIDIA's stock prices, showcasing its potential applications in complex financial market environments.},

  abstract = {We propose an automatic method for clustering multivariate time-series data based on mixtures of Dynamic Linear Models. Unlike traditional time-series clustering methods that yield static membership parameters, our approach allows each time series to dynamically change cluster memberships over time. Thus, each time series has a dynamic posterior probability of belonging to each cluster. The proposed mixture model is flexible, assuming a Dirichlet evolution for the mixture weights that enables smooth membership transitions over time. This approach accounts for correlations between weights, thereby avoiding abrupt membership changes caused by outlying observations in the series. Posterior estimates of model parameters and membership probabilities are obtained via Gibbs sampling. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient alternative method based on stochastic expectation maximization and gradient descent to obtain point estimates. We illustrate the proposed method using a tri-variate panel dataset combining Gapminder and World Bank indicators—life expectancy, GDP per capita, and crude birth rate—for 78 European and African countries from 1960 to 2007. The selected regions provide strong socioeconomic and demographic contrasts, allowing the model to effectively capture temporal and structural changes in cluster membership.},

  abstract = {Random binnings generated via recursive binary splits are introduced as a way to detect, measure the strength of, and to display the pattern of association between any two variates, whether one or both are continuous or categorical. This provides a single approach to ordering large numbers of variate pairs by their measure of dependence and then to examine any pattern of dependence via a common display, the departure display (coloring bins by a standardized Pearson residual). Continuous variates are first ranked and their rank pairs binned. The Pearson's goodness of fit statistic is applicable but the classic approximation to its null distribution is not. Theoretical and empirical investigations motivate several approximations, including a simple approximation with real-valued, yet intuitive, degrees of freedom. Alternatively, applying an inverse probability transform from the ranks before binning returns a simple Pearson statistic with the classic degrees of freedom. Recursive random binning with different approximations is compared to recent grid-based methods on a variety of non-null dependence patterns; the method with any of these approximations is found to be well-calibrated and relatively powerful against common test alternatives. Method and displays are illustrated by applying the screening methodology to a publicly available data set having several continuous and categorical measurements of each of 6497 Portuguese wines. The software is publicly available as the R package AssocBin .},

  abstract = {In the era of big data and increasing survey costs, non-probability samples become increasingly popular in sampling surveys but may be subject to selection biases with unknown inclusion probabilities. In addition to selection bias, non-probability samples may also suffer from missingness in practice, even nonignorable nonresponse with unknown response probabilities. Superpopulation model methods have been discussed for reducing selection biases from non-probability samples, but not for dealing with nonignorable missingness for non-probability samples yet. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear superpopulation model inference approach for non-probability samples with nonignorable missingness. We develop rigorous procedures for estimating the response probabilities for units in the non-probability sample and the nonlinear superpopulation model parameters, and construct the finite population mean estimator based on the nonlinear superpopulation model, response probabilities, and inclusion probabilities. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and variance estimation are also discussed under the proposed framework. In a simulation study, we compare the proposed method with some existing methods. The real data analysis results using the National Health Interview Survey data illustrate the good performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Modeling and estimating radon concentration are of crucial interest to support health protection campaigns. In the literature, many studies concentrated on indoor radon, while few of them investigated the outdoor radon spatial distribution and the factors that influence its formation. In this context, the vast possibilities of the artificial intelligence systems, based on machine learning techniques, can show remarkable capabilities. This paper focuses on the optimization of the architecture and the parameters of an artificial neural network (ANN) for inferring outdoor radon concentrations. More specifically, in the development of alternative ANN models, the Feed-Forward Back propagation with the Levenberg–Marquardt is performed with different hidden layers to train the models and a bootstrap resampling method is applied to improve the model generalization. Some evaluation metrics and a sensitivity analysis are also included in order to assess the prediction accuracy among the ANN models.},
