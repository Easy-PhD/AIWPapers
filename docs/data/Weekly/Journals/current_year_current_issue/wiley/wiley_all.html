  abstract     = {Cyber-attacks pose a security threat to military command and control networks, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, and civilian critical national infrastructure. The use of artificial intelligence and autonomous agents in these attacks increases the scale, range, and complexity of this threat and the subsequent disruption they cause. Autonomous Cyber Defence (ACD) agents aimto mitigate this threat by responding at machine speed and at the scale required to address the problem. Additionally, they reduce the burden on the limited number of human cyber experts available to respond to an attack. Sequential decision-making algorithms such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) provide a promising route to create ACD agents. These algorithms focus on a single objectivesuch as minimising the intrusion of red agents on the network, by using a handcrafted weighted sum of rewards. This approach removes the ability to adapt the model during inference, and fails to address the many competing objectivespresent when operating and protecting these networks. Conflicting objectives, such as restoring a machine from a back-up image, must be carefully balanced with the cost of associated down-time or the disruption to network traffic or services that might result. Instead of pursuing a Single-Objective RL (SORL) approach, here we present a simple example of a multi-objective network defense game that requires consideration of both defending the network against red-agents and maintaining the critical functionality of green-agents. Two Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms, namely Multi-Objective Proximal Policy Optimization (MOPPO) and Pareto-Conditioned Networks (PCN), are used to create two trained ACD agents whose performance is compared on our Multi-Objective Cyber Defense game. The benefits and limitations of MORL ACD agents in comparison to SORL ACD agents are discussed based on the investigations of this game.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a hybrid methodology for evaluating leading retail companies based on customer perspectives, combining Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven sentiment analysis with fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM). The framework integrates large-scale customer review analysis with expert decision-making to provide a comprehensive assessment of retail performance. The process begins with AI-based text mining to collect and analyze customer reviews, extracting emotional tones and identifying frequently mentioned criteria. Expert judgment is then applied to refine, organize, and assign importance to these criteria. The q-rung orthopair fuzzy set MCDM methodology is employed to address uncertainty, conflicting objectives, and qualitative expert opinions by translating them into a structured quantitative evaluation. This hybrid approach offers a balanced assessment that combines subjective and objective dimensions. As a case study, 2000 customer reviews from each of four major U.S. retailers—Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and Target—were analyzed to derive key evaluation criteria based on user feedback. The proposed method distinguishes itself through its unique integration of sentiment analysis and decision-makers' expert evaluations, enabling a holistic and robust evaluation of alternatives. By bridging customer perceptions with expert analysis, this methodology provides a deeper, more nuanced understanding of retailer performance, contributing to improved supplier selection and business decision-making processes. A second analysis, enabled by this methodology, also highlighted key performance differences among the retailers in areas such as customer service, delivery experience, and return/refund processes. Among the findings, Target and Amazon showed the strongest overall sentiment performance, while Costco excelled in return policies and Walmart exhibited weaker results in customer service and delivery. As a result, this hybrid methodology offers valuable insights for both decision-makers aiming to optimize supplier selection and customers seeking better shopping experiences.},

  abstract     = {This review evaluates classical machine learning-based hypertension prediction models, emphasizing their role in addressing global health burdens , particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Hypertension affects over 1.28 billion people globally and contributes to cardiovascular disease and mortality. The review compares machine-learning techniques with traditional methods, focusing on key datasets, evaluation metrics, and model development to advance early detection and effective hypertension management. The review used the PRISMA framework, using databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE explorer to identify studies published between 2020 and 2024 on machine learning techniques, predictive models, and early detection of hypertension based on relevance, methodological rigor, and inclusion criteria. The study analyzed hypertension prediction models across various countries, including the US, England, Korea, Japan, China, Indonesia, Thailand, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and several African countries. The models' performance varied with AUC statistic values ranging from 0.6 to 0.9, indicating a wide range of predictive accuracy. Machine learning techniques generally reported higher performance metrics than traditional statistical methods. Risk factor heterogeneity was evident, with models like random forest, logistic regression, and gradient-boosted trees showing high predictive accuracy. Emerging techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and ensemble methods improved unbalanced data set performance. The review explores the potential of machine learning-based hypertension prediction models in healthcare, highlighting their ability to accurately predict hypertension risk, tailor interventions to specific populations, and optimize healthcare resources in low- and middle-income countries. However, challenges include data quality, model explainability, and ethical considerations. Despite these, ML integration offers scalable and cost-effective solutions, especially in resource-limited settings. Future research should focus on diverse datasets, advanced feature integration, and longitudinal validations.},

  abstract     = {The sterile insect technique (SIT) represents a highly effective and promising method for combating tsetse fly-related infections, which involves the release of sterilized male tsetse flies in the assigned zones. However, tsetse fly rearing poses specific challenges, particularly in the tsetse sex separation, as this process is labor-intensive and incurs significant costs. Here, we report a simple model that classifies tsetse flies by sex using an object detection model based on the YOLO algorithm. This paper also conducted a comparative analysis of YOLOv8 and YOLO11 deep learning models, focusing on their efficacy in tsetse fly detection and classification using a range of performance metrics and statistical analysis. The findings reveal that the classification accuracy of YOLO11 stands at 97.6%, whereas YOLOv8 achieves 95.6%. The classification precision of YOLO11 in identifying tsetse flies is 88.6%, while that of YOLOv8 is 85.9%. Additionally, YOLO11 demonstrates an inference speed of 13.0 ms, slightly faster than YOLOv8's 13.4 ms in tsetse sex detection. Moreover, YOLO11 outperformed YOLOv8 in both F1 score and mAP@0.5–0.9, a success attributed to its enhanced architectural design. However, statistical tests indicate there is no significant difference between the two models, achieving p values ≥ 0.05 for all metrics. This study adds value to tsetse rearing and fly-based disease control by offering automated tsetse sex detection insights into its practical uses in real-world contexts. Furthermore, this research enriches the understanding of the two models with tsetse flies as the focal point and recommends a more effective and accurate detection approach. Finally, integrating the model with the mobile object detection Android app will reduce tsetse sex sorting dependency on experienced technical experts and enhance tsetse rearing productivity.},

Repetitiveness is a common characteristic of human behavior. Repetitiveness indicates which node is updated frequently and its importance. A chatbot needs to solve a situation regarding how quickly it will access its neural memory to retrieve information. Thus, the ranking of nodes in a neural network is necessary to allocate them to the chatbot's memory. The proposed ranking methodology takes affinity, number of edges, adjacency, average weight, and update time interval parameters into account to calculate the ranked value of each node. After that, a ranking tree is generated. This tree is finally considered the memory navigation path in that neural graph. If a node updates regularly with each clock pulse, which resembles a repetitive task, then its ranked value increases. This node should get preference over other low-ranked nodes. This study provides an approach to convert a neural graph into a ranking tree and a path to navigate through it. Thus, the chatbot can identify which node is more promising and has a shorter path than other nodes for information retrieval.},

It divides these numbers into nine groups based on their first digit, with the largest category comprising numbers beginning with 1, followed by those starting with 2, and so on. Each neuron within a neural network (NN) is associated with a numerical value called a weight, which is updated according to specific functions. This research examines the Degree of Benford's Law Existence (DBLE) across two language model methodologies: (1) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and (2) long short-term memory (LSTM). Additionally, this study investigates whether models with higher performance exhibit a stronger presence of DBLE. Two neural network language models, namely: (1) simple RNN and (2) LSTM, were selected as the subject models for the experiment. Each model is tested with five different optimizers and four different datasets (textual corpora selected from Wikipedia). This results in a total of 20 different configurations for each model. The neuron weights for each configuration were extracted at each epoch, and the following metrics were measured at each epoch: (1) DBLE, (2) training set accuracy, (3) training set error, (4) test set accuracy, and (5) test set error. The results show that the weights in both models, across all optimizers, follow Benford's Law. Additionally, the findings indicate a strong correlation between DBLE and the performance on the training set in both language models. This means that models with higher performance on the training set exhibit a stronger correlation of DBLE.},

In this paper, thematic analysis has been performed on unstructured opinions obtained from 11 experts about the integration of LLMs in the field of software development to understand their benefits and limitations using two natural language processing (NLP) techniques: sentiment analysis and keyword extraction and analysis. Sentiment analysis suggests that most experts were optimistic and pragmatic about the use of generative artificial intelligence in software development, although some experts engaged in critical reflection.

  abstract     = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to become an essential tool for defending against machine-speed attacks on increasingly connected cyber networks and systems. It will allow self-defending and self-recovering cyber-defence agents to be developed, which can respond to attacks in a timely manner. But how can these agents be trusted to perform as expected, and how can they be evaluated responsibly and thoroughly? To answer these questions, a Test and Evaluation (T&E) process has been developed to assess cyber-defence agents. The process evaluates the performance, effectiveness, resilience, and generalizability of agents in both low- and high-fidelity cyber environments. This paper demonstrates the low-fidelity part of the process by performing an example evaluation in the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment on Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents trained as part of Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 2. The process makes use of novel Measures of Effectiveness (MoE) metrics, which can be used in combination with performance metrics such as the RL reward. MoE are tailored for cyber defence, allowing a greater understanding of agents' defensive abilities within a cyber environment. Agents are evaluated against multiple conditions that perturb the environment to investigate their robustness to scenarios not seen during training. The results from this evaluation process will help inform decisions around the benefits and risks of integrating autonomous agents into existing or future cyber systems.},

  abstract     = {The brain tumor grows abnormally in the human brain, which causes brain cancer. Death rates have been rising annually for the past few decades due to negligence of early treatment of brain tumors. To reduce the death rate, early identification of tumors is crucial. Early brain tumor detection may potentially lower the risk of life. Manual tumor diagnosis is complex, challenging, and time-consuming for medical professionals. Therefore, automatic detection and segmentation methods simplify the diagnosing procedure. Thus, automatic segmentation and classification methods are taken up to make the diagnosis process easy. This research proposes a two-dimensional cumulative sum average filter (2D-CSAF) for preprocessing images and an improved deviation sparse fuzzy C-means (IDSFCM) with neighbor information for segmenting brain tumors from magnetic resonance images. The novel IDSFCM segmentation increases the noise reduction capability and enhances segmentation accuracies. The hybrid modified sine cosine algorithm-crow search algorithm (MSCA-CSA)–based WELM model is proposed to classify the brain tumor. The MSCA-CSA algorithm optimizes the weights of the WELM model to increase the classification capability. The gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) feature extraction technique is employed to extract the features from the segmented images, and extracted features are given as input to the MSCA-CSA-WELM model for classification. The brain tumor dataset from Harvard Medical School is considered for this research. The proposed IDSFCM segmentation achieved 99.53% segmentation accuracy. The accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity performance measures are considered for the classification. The classification performance was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics. The proposed MSCA-CSA–based WELM model outperformed feature extraction–based classifiers, achieving 99.37% accuracy, 99.87% sensitivity, and 99.44% specificity during training.},

  abstract     = {A neurodevelopmental illness called autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is frequently associated with sensory problems including an excessive or insufficient sensitivity to noises, scents, or touch. Children with autism typically do not talk much and keep to themselves, but they can imitate certain actions from cartoons and movies. They may exhibit unsafe or unexpected behavior as a result. Early detection and therapy can assist in improving the diseases. In this study, we suggested a data-driven machine learning (ML) model for examining the autism dataset of diverse age groups (toddlers, children, and adults) to classify autism in the initial stage. The proposed ML model can efficiently analyze autism patients’ datasets and correctly classify and detect ASD features. We utilized a data preprocessing technique followed by feature selection methods using information gain and Pearson correlation. Then, we employed five different ML classifiers (KNN, RF, SVM, NB, and MLP) together with a hyperparameter optimization strategy. We assess their work using performance metrics such as prediction accuracy and the F1-measure. After comparing the accuracy between different classifiers, SVM produced the highest accuracies of 98%, 99%, and 100% for the toddler, child, and adult datasets while MLP produced an accuracy of 0.94 for the Pakistani child dataset, respectively. These thorough experimental assessments suggest that correct fine-tuning of the ML techniques can be crucial in the classification of autism in individuals of various ages. We believe that the thorough feature significance analysis presented in this study can guide medical professionals’ judgment when screening ASD individuals. In comparison with other methods currently used for the timely identification of ASD, the suggested framework has shown encouraging results.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of the digital age, data have become insecure, which requires techniques to secure data. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has become an increasingly secure technology for storing next-generation digital data. DNA provides superior capabilities due to its high and efficient storage capacity and long lifespan. Protecting these data is of utmost importance, especially data with sensitive content. In this study, the proposed encryption algorithm is a new and novel contribution; a new cryptographic methodology is presented that leverages the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank to create cryptographic keys. This key dictionary is created by nucleotide sequences created from the GenBank database. The proposed methodology uses databases such as the National Center GenBank, which contains huge repositories of genetic information, to improve the effectiveness of data security. By converting traditional digital data into DNA sequences, this methodology provides new features of cryptographic protection. The security and reliability of the proposed methodology were thoroughly tested through simulation and data analysis. The results indicate that the proposed encryption methodology has a superior ability to withstand many types of cryptographic attacks, which confirms its effectiveness and strength in data protection. The paper also presented several findings, including a low encryption time of 250 ms and decryption time of 230 ms, as well as a memory usage of 50 MB for large datasets. Furthermore, the proposed method demonstrated exceptionally high stability. Across all these metrics, the proposed approach outperformed other existing methods. The proposed methodology is applicable to ensure the security and integrity of DNA-based digital storage systems. This methodology was developed independently and has not been previously studied. This modern methodology represents an advance in digital data security and protection, providing an advanced solution in the digital age of cybersecurity.},

Models explored for regression in this paper include linear regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN).

This study developed a neural network classifier to determine the nutritional requirements for four types of Type 2 diabetic patients: those with chronic hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity, or all three conditions. The classifier was trained using Kenya Food Composition Tables data on food nutrients and processing techniques. The neural network had five layers, including three hidden layers with 10 neurons each, using tanh and sigmoid activation functions, gradient descent optimization, cross-entropy loss function, and 0.1 learning rate. Training used 40 hidden neurons per layer, 60,000 epochs and 0.2 learning rate. The neural network was evaluated against random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). The neural network achieved high performance with 91.4% accuracy, 88% recall, 86.8% precision, and 87.3% F1-score.

  abstract     = {The prevailing method for grading oil palm fruit bunches in mills relies on human graders conducting visual inspections, resulting in frequent errors and inconsistent assessments. This is a significant open problem when developing a detector for oil palm fruit ripeness and oil content, which are related factors. Current trends focus on computer vision techniques based on image processing and machine learning to improve grading of oil palm fruit bunches at an individual factory, resulting in limited diversity of the data used for evaluation. Collecting data from all factories offers informational advantages but raises privacy concerns. Addressing these challenges, this study proposes federated learning (FL) to develop local and global prediction models for grading oil palm fruit ripeness while preserving data privacy. FL facilitates collaborative model training across factories, mitigating privacy risks and enhancing model development efficiency. The proposed model uses the color of palm husks to determine the ripeness stage, which is used as a factor in predicting the yield of oil from the crop. A predictive model was created using FL principles with a training dataset of 5209 images, which was divided into two subsets: single-palm (2571 images) and multipalm (2638 images). The classification accuracy of a global model was 90.0%, while the local models were expanded to include private data for each of 4 testing clients. The predictive global and local models from FL were used to implement the system in a web application form and to validate its performance in calling the oil palm ripeness stage.},

Proper garbage waste processing, management, and recycling are crucial for both ecological and economic reasons. Computer vision techniques have shown advanced capabilities in various applications, including object detection and classification. In this study, we conducted an extensive review of the use of artificial intelligence for garbage processing and management. However, a major limitation in this field is the lack of datasets containing top-view images of garbage. We introduce a new dataset named “KACHARA,” containing 4727 images categorized into seven classes: clothes, decomposable (organic waste), glass, metal, paper, plastic, and wood. Importantly, the dataset exhibits a moderate imbalance, mirroring the distribution of real-world garbage, which is crucial for training accurate classification models. For classification, we utilize transfer learning with the well-known deep learning model MobileNetV3-Large, where the top layers are fine-tuned to enhance performance. We achieved a classification accuracy of 94.37% and also evaluated performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. These results demonstrate the model’s strong generalization in aerial/top-view garbage classification.},

This study proposes an AutoGluon–Shapley additive explanations (AutoGluon-SHAP) approach, which automatically predicts concrete mechanical strength while providing insightful interpretations of the results. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to enhance global accessibility to the model. AutoGluon leverages powerful algorithms such as LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, random forest, ensembles, and neural networks within its TabularPredictor to automate model selection. The models were trained and tested using a comprehensive dataset of 1760 concrete samples sourced from the published literature, encompassing diverse concrete types, cement brands, additives, target compressive strengths, and curing periods. Results show that the WeightedEnsemble_L2 predictive model demonstrated robust performance in estimating flexural, tensile, and compressive strengths. All the predictive models achieved high performance with R 2 of more than 0.98 for all the strengths’ properties. SHAP offered both global insights into the influence of the predictors on mechanical strength and local explanations for individual predictions, ensuring transparency and reliability.

This study presents a comprehensive hybrid modeling approach to predict oil prices in the context of Russia and Ukraine across three distinct periods: before the war, during the war, and the immediate aftermath of the conflict. Using advanced machine learning techniques, we developed a hybrid system combining Random Forest, ElasticNet, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regressor models. These models were integrated through a Voting Regressor to enhance prediction accuracy. Our analysis revealed varying levels of predictive performance across the different periods. Prior to the war, the models showed strong predictive capabilities, evidenced by low mean-squared error (MSE) values and high coefficients of determination ( R 2 ). However, during the war, the models struggled to capture extreme volatility, resulting in significantly increased MSE and negative R 2 values. Predictions for the immediate aftermath of the conflict demonstrated improvements, with a reduction in MSE and positive R 2 values, indicating a return to relatively more stable market conditions. Notably, combining data from both before the war and war periods could further improve predictive accuracy, as it would reduce the impact of the conflict’s volatility on model performance. These results emphasize the challenges of forecasting oil prices in periods of geopolitical instability and underscore the importance of hybrid modeling approaches to adapt to rapidly changing market dynamics.},

In this study, we propose an efficient approach combining dynamic contrast stretching (DCS) method, advanced morphological operation–based segmentation, triangle thresholding, and a final postprocessing step. Our preprocessing step enhances the contrast of retinal images acquired under various lighting conditions, enabling reliable and accurate segmentation. This enhancement is achieved using the DCS method, which is compared to two widely used contrast enhancement techniques: adaptive histogram equalization (AHE) and contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). The second step combines morphological operations and triangle thresholding to enhance vessel structures, eliminate noise, and separate blood vessels effectively. Postprocessing addresses artifacts and ambiguous areas at image boundaries. Our approach is evaluated using widely recognized reference datasets, including Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE), Structured Analysis of the Retina (STARE), and High-Resolution Fundus (HRF). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior segmentation accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. Specifically, we achieve average accuracy rates of 98.08%, 97.14%, and 98.94% for the DRIVE, STARE, and HRF datasets, respectively. In addition, our method is distinguished by exceptionally fast execution times, reaching 0.013 s for the DRIVE and STARE datasets.

  abstract     = {Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the virus has posed a grave threat to human health. Automated segmentation of COVID-19 lung computed tomography (CT) scans is a crucial diagnostic tool that aids physicians in providing accurate and timely diagnoses, as it contains significant radiomics information. Given that the specificity for discriminating between the causes of conventional pulmonary features is lower than its sensitivity, the primary goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a CT-based radiomics model capable of distinguishing between COVID-19 and other lung diseases. To address this, we propose an efficient, modified radiomics feature processing method that integrates an optimal aerial perspective (OAP) parameter-based intensity dark channel prior (IDCP) with a 50-layer residual deep neural network (ResNet50 DNN) for autolesion segmentation (ALS-IOAP-DNN). To further enhance COVID-19 lesion estimation, novel optimization strategies, including a hybrid simulated annealing-cuckoo search (SA-CS) algorithm, are introduced alongside the original SA method. The SA-CS algorithm extends SA by preventing entrapment in local minimum and enhancing global exploration. Five benchmark functions are used to accelerate convergence and address the issue of local optima. As a result, the hybrid approach outperforms 10 recent studies on two publicly available datasets (COVID-CT-Dataset and HUST-19), achieving an average accuracy score of 100% across different epochs, along with perfect accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 100% specificity. The proposed models significantly outperform the baseline model, with accuracy improvements of 13.6% on Data1 and 2.5% on Data2. While the baseline model achieves 88% accuracy on Data1 and 97.6% on Data2, the proposed ALS-IOAP-DNN4 model attains perfect accuracy (100%) on both datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of ALS and advanced optimization techniques. Furthermore, the use of OAP with IDCP enhances the precision of COVID-19 lesion estimation, underscoring its significance in COVID-19 diagnosis and medical imaging management.},

Highly accurate and reliable T w forecasts are essential for the ecological management of rivers. This study evaluates the performance of machine learning-based predictive models in forecasting T w in the Catu River. The models were trained using climatic and hydrological data collected from 2009 to 2016 and validated with real data from 2023. The evaluated models include backpropagation neural network (BPNN), Random Forest, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Air2Stream, and NARX, employing nine input variables such as atmospheric pressure, air temperature, and water vapor concentration. The results show that the BiLSTM model achieved the best performance, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12°C and R 2 = 0.98, followed by BPNN with an RMSE of 0.18°C and R 2 = 0.91, and the Random Forest model, which obtained an NSE of 0.95. These models demonstrated a strong ability to predict T w under both normal and extreme conditions, capturing the thermal dynamics of the Catu River with high precision during events involving minor thermal variations. Conversely, the NARX and Air2Stream models exhibited lower performance, proving more prone to errors under conditions of extreme variability. The findings of this study provide valuable scientific insights for river T w prediction and the protection of aquatic ecosystems, with practical applications in water resource management in tropical regions.},

  abstract     = {Biometric security systems must be able to detect phony fingerprints to provide reliable authentication. The findings of this study suggest a hybrid approach to the detection of fake fingerprints that uses information on the texture and shape of the fingerprint. The novelty of this approach lies in integrating both traditional fingerprint information and geometric features obtained through wavelet transformation, which has not been extensively explored in previous studies. The proposed procedure uses the traditional fingerprint information and the geometric features that may be collected by wavelet modification. This allows it to take advantage of the complementary capabilities that these two types of capabilities offer. In addition, the hybrid feature set improves the system’s robustness and accuracy by leveraging each feature type’s unique strengths. To achieve this goal, the standard fingerprint information and the geometric aspects of the fingerprint are combined. It is possible to efficiently identify authentic and forged fingerprints by using these hybrid features and training a gradient boosting classifier. The findings of the studies demonstrate that the suggested technique achieves an accuracy of 96% on medium spoofing photos from the SOCOFing dataset, 97% on hard spoofing images, and 98% on mixed spoofing images. This high level of accuracy, especially on mixed spoofing images, showcases the effectiveness of the novel hybrid approach in diverse and challenging scenarios. This places it in the position of being the most accurate way currently accessible among the existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed method’s scalability and adaptability make it suitable for real-world applications, potentially setting a new standard in biometric security. There is a great deal of optimism that the technique that has been described can increase the reliability and safety of biometric systems when used in situations representative of the actual world.},

This study proposes an efficient spectrum-sharing technique for dual-hop CRNs using NOMA, optimized by an improved artificial bee colony (IABC) algorithm and guided by a single-input single-output fuzzy rule-based system (SISO-FRBS). In this setup, a distant primary transmitter communicates with the primary receiver via a secondary NOMA relay. The objective is to maximize the sum data rate of secondary users (SUs) while minimizing total transmission power. SISO-FRBS enhances the IABC search process by dynamically guiding the search agents, improving both optimization quality and convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves the primary data rate benchmark of 5 bit/s/Hz at a transmit power of 19 mW, compared with 23 mW with traditional ABC, achieving a 19.04% improvement in power efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Computer vision plays a crucial role in current day tasks due to its wide range of merits and applications in many fields like disease diagnosis, medical decisions, military, security, scientific applications, and business. Identifying plant species upon their leaf images is a very challenging and complex task. In this study, we introduced a model for classifying a variety set of plant leaves using different techniques such as factorization machine (FM), dimensionality reduction (DR), and ensemble learning (EL). In our study, FM is used as a classification algorithm, whereas DR is included in two stages, namely, feature extraction (FE) and feature selection (FS). FE has been used to extract the features from images in tabular form; on the other hand, FS is used to reduce the size of the data by getting rid of noisy (redundant and irrelevant) features. In addition, we utilized two methods for FS, filter-based and wrapper-based approaches. The used filter was the minimum redundancy maximum relevance, and the used wrapper was the improved binary cuckoo search algorithm that is based on Lévy flight and abandon nest functions. Regarding EL, it was used to declare different versions of FM by passing different subsets of features that are deduced from the original ones to improve its performance. We used the Swedish and Flavia leaf datasets for training and testing phases. The proposed model achieved a high performance in terms of accuracy that produced 95.67% on Swedish dataset and 99.6% on Flavia dataset. According to the results and in comparison to other methods, we proved that our proposed model ensures a favorable plant leaf classification approach. Finally, the proposed wrapper FS approach showed very good results without setting up the number of features to be selected by the user.

Recently, there has been an increase in the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in hydrogeology to estimate GWL in monitoring wells. This study presents a novel technique for predicting GWL changes that uses three independent datasets: historical GWL and climatic variables (CVs) data such as rainfall and temperature influencing groundwater dynamics. In our experimental research, the models’ prediction output on real-world datasets ensures that the model’s significant patterns are recorded while taking into account the noise in the data, resulting in a perfect balance of bias and variance. The DL models’ results show a significant score of root mean square error (RMSE) between 2.20 and 12.40 and coefficient of determination ( R -squared between 0.84–0.99), showing a significant improvement in RMSE and mean absolute error (MAE) in the testing and validation categories, when compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. This study improves our understanding of GWL modeling and provides decision-makers with a reliable tool for controlling change. The study advances environmental modeling by exhibiting methodological complexity and emphasizes the importance of comprehensive data analysis in water resource management.},

  abstract     = {Stroke disease has been the leading cause of death globally for the last several decades. Thus, the death rate can be decreased by early recognition of disease and ongoing surveillance. However, the largest obstacle to perform advanced analytics using the conventional approach is the growth of massive amount of data from various sources, including patient histories, wearable sensor devices, and medical data. The current technology that could have a large impact on the healthcare sector is the integration of machine learning with big data analytics (scalable machine learning), particularly in the early diagnosis of this disease. To address this issue, a scalable stroke disease prediction model for a multinode distributed environment, which was developed by combining big data analytics concepts with machine learning to handle extensive healthcare datasets, an aspect not seen in the prior literature on stroke disease detection, is presented in this work. We have implemented four scalable algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient-boosting tree, and decision tree, using a dataset that was collected from a Medical Quality Improvement Consortium database. As a result, two worker nodes and one master node were used to analyze the dataset. The model’s performance was assessed using performance metrics including the area under the curve (AUC) and confusion matrix. With an accuracy of 94.3% and an AUC score of 99%, the random forest was determined to be better based on the experimental results. It was also shown that the main risk factor for stroke disease is diabetes, which is followed by hypertension. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of using Spark’s scalable machine learning techniques to forecast stroke disease and identify risk factors earlier. The findings of this study can be utilized by physicians as clinical decision aids to aid in the more accurate identification of stroke disease.},

  abstract     = {The accurate prediction of subscriber traffic is a critical challenge in telecommunication networks, as it is essential for making informed decisions to maintain consistent service quality. Various artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been explored for this purpose, with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) being particularly popular. However, RNNs often suffer from the gradient vanishing problem, which reduces their effectiveness in processing long sequences of data. Long short–term memory (LSTM) networks partially address this issue by controlling the propagation of learning errors, but they still face challenges related to convergence speed and residual learning errors. To address these limitations, this study proposes a new hybrid RNN architecture that combines features of Jordan and Frasconi networks for improved subscriber traffic prediction. The proposed architecture integrates two sublayers, a sigmoid and a Gaussian function, within a hidden layer that forms a loop. This configuration enables the network to leverage incremental learning through restricted Coulomb energy (RCE) at the local level, while also benefiting from global learning through backpropagation. The architecture was tested on a dataset consisting of cellular traffic data collected from a telecommunication operator in Cameroon. The results demonstrated that the hybrid RNN model outperforms traditional Jordan and Frasconi networks, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 14.18 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.61 using the Adam optimizer with a batch size of 64. In addition, the hybrid model showed superior performance in terms of RMSE, MAE, and convergence speed compared to the existing models. These findings suggest that the proposed model could support telecom operators in proactive congestion management and resource optimization.},

Unfortunately, traditional approaches to predicting readmissions frequently lack accuracy. This presents a critical challenge, as identifying patients at high risk for readmission is essential for implementing preventive measures. The study introduces a novel method that employs machine learning to automatically extract features from patient data, eliminating labor-intensive manual feature engineering. The primary goal is to develop predictive models for unplanned readmissions for UTI patients at Jordan University Hospital within 3 months postdischarge. This is executed through a retrospective analysis of electronic health records from January 2020 to June 2023. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the study identifies high-risk patients by evaluating demographic, clinical, and outcome characteristics, ensuring model reliability through thorough optimization, validation, and performance assessment. Three predictive models were developed as follows: a gradient-boosting classifier (GBC), logistic regression (LR), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The GBC, SGD, and LR achieved impressive accuracy rates of 99%, 95%, and 89%, providing strong confidence in the methodology. The study’s findings reveal key risk factors associated with readmissions, enhancing our understanding of this process and offering a valuable framework for improving patient care, optimizing resource allocation, and supporting evidence-based decision-making in healthcare management.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is characterized by abnormal cell growth, which leads to tumor formation. Autonomous breast cancer detection has seen good progress. However, there are still several challenges to robust detection. This survey article explores the complexities inherent in multiclass classification for breast cancer diagnosis, aiming to improve patient care, efficiency, and timeliness. In our study, we focus on using histopathology slide images and assess the current state of breast cancer classification, particularly with artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning and convolutional neural networks. The histopathology images are key tools in the diagnosis process, allowing pathologists to visually assess tissue samples for signs of cancer. Our analysis reveals several challenges that hinder the effectiveness of current diagnostic methods. One significant issue is the need for more diversity in the existing datasets, which often fail to represent a wide range of patient populations. This limitation reduces the accuracy of diagnostic results, mainly when applied to different clinical environments. Furthermore, class imbalances within these datasets, where certain cancer types or stages are underrepresented, lead to biased diagnoses, with more common cases being easily identified while rarer cases are frequently missed. Another challenge is the limited generalizability of current diagnostic techniques, which perform well in controlled environments but often need to improve when applied to new, unseen data from different institutions or imaging systems. Additionally, the complexity of histopathological analysis means that it can be difficult for clinicians to interpret certain findings, leading to uncertainty in the diagnostic process. Our study reveals that addressing these issues requires collaborative efforts to improve the quality of datasets, reduce class imbalances, and develop optimal standardized diagnostic methods. By overcoming these challenges, we can enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility of breast cancer diagnosis, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and global healthcare. We believe that by examining several factors and variables and conducting an in-depth analysis of the state of the art, this study will contribute to the state of the art and benefit researchers in both computing and medical domains.},

  abstract     = {In today’s mobile communication society, the integration of mobile technology in education has revolutionised learning through m-Learning. This approach leverages wireless mobile technology and computing, enabling learners to access educational resources anytime and anywhere, thereby enhancing flexibility and freedom. Mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets and PDAs, facilitate m-Learning by providing mobility and interactive learning environments. M-Learning is characterised by its personalised, collaborative, and ubiquitous nature, offering learners context-aware experiences tailored to their immediate surroundings and needs. Context awareness plays a pivotal role in m-Learning, distinguishing it from traditional education by dynamically adapting content delivery based on factors beyond just location, including time, network conditions and user preferences. This adaptability poses significant challenges in designing effective teaching strategies that meet diverse learner requirements. To address these challenges, this study explores the application of machine learning techniques—specifically “Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS)”—in developing a Context-Aware m-Learning platform. Performance comparisons based on RMSE, MAE and accuracy metrics reveal ANFIS as the optimal method for enhancing the proposed m-Learning system, aligning with the contextual demands and parameters defined for effective mobile education. ANFIS’s ability to minimise absolute prediction errors more effectively than the other methods. In terms of accuracy, ANFIS again leads the performance metrics, achieving an accuracy of 82.46% with 10 neurons. In comparison, ANN and KNN achieved accuracies of 81.17% and 80.74%, respectively. These accuracy values indicate that ANFIS not only reduces prediction errors but also consistently delivers higher predictive accuracy.

This study introduces a cutting-edge transformer-based model specifically tailored for long-term time-series forecasting, aimed at improving the performance of PV generation systems. Leveraging the robust attention mechanisms and parallel processing capabilities inherent in encoder–decoder transformer architecture, the model effectively captures intricate relationships within weather data. A unique positional encoding layer is incorporated to bolster the model’s comprehension of the chronological sequence of data points. Furthermore, the multihead attention mechanism adeptly identifies interactions between key meteorological factors, especially temperature and radiation, which are crucial for precise PV generation predictions. Evaluation using real-world weather datasets reveals that the proposed model significantly surpasses conventional forecasting methods in mean squared error and mean absolute error metrics. This work underscores the applicability of transformer models in predicting temperature and radiation for PV generation, offering a scalable and efficient forecasting solution vital for sustainable energy management.

This research investigates the application of deep feature extraction for classifying eight different ocular diseases. The VGG16, a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model, was employed for feature extraction, while the fine k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier was utilized for classification. Experimental results showed an initial classification accuracy of 89.2% using features from Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) heatmaps and 83.1% using Multiscale Retinex (MSR) enhanced images. However, combining both feature sets led to an improved classification accuracy of 96.5%. Despite these promising results, several challenges remain, including the need for models that generalize across diverse patient imaging and demographics modalities, the accessibility of extensive annotated datasets, and the interpretability of models. Ethical issues and legal frameworks are also crucial for the safe and fair implementation of AI in medical services.

The models were trained using historical price, weather, and rainfall data using time-series forecasting methods, specifically LSTM and CNN. The findings indicate that stepwise feature selection minimizes prediction errors and improves MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and MAE. Preliminary experiments revealed that the LSTM model with feature selection outperformed the other models, particularly in feature selection. Employing standard hyperparameters of 100 epochs, 32 batches, and five windows, the model demonstrated superior performance with a lower MSE (0.0010), RMSE (0.0274), MAPE (3.7803), and MAE (0.0158) than the CNN model. Statistical hypothesis testing revealed significant variations between the LSTM and CNN models, with feature selection p -values below 0.05. These results indicate that LSTM with feature selection models optimized through refined hyperparameters leads to more accurate Thai morning glory price forecasting, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in their decision-making processes. Additionally, this study can forecast prices for 5, 7, 14, and 21 days in advance based on different Window_len values, addressing various planning needs. The 5- and 7-day forecasts support short-term decision-making, such as scheduling harvest cycles and weekly market planning, whereas the 14-day forecast assists farmers in optimizing planting schedules and logistics. Furthermore, the 21-day forecast is beneficial for medium-term market planning, including negotiating forward contracts and adjusting distribution strategies to maximize profitability.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer is a significant global health issue, ranking as the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early diagnosis of this disease is of utmost importance to increase the survival rate and enhance the healthcare system. Many machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods have been proposed to facilitate automated early diagnosis of this cancer. However, label noise in medical images and the dependence on a single model can lead to suboptimal model performance, which could potentially hinder the development of a sophisticated automated solution. In this paper, we address label noise in training data and propose a stacking-ensemble model for classifying colorectal cancer along with a trustworthy computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. Initially, a variety of filtering methods are extensively analyzed to determine the most suitable image representation, with subsequent data augmentation techniques. Second, a modified VGG-16 model was proposed with fine-tuning that was utilized as a feature extractor to extract meaningful features from the training samples. Third, a prediction uncertainty and probabilistic local outlier factor (pLOF) were applied to the extracted features to address the label noise issue in the training data. Fourth, we adopted a random forest–based recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE) feature selection method with various combinations of features to recursively select the most influential ones for accurate predictions. Fifth, four base ML classifiers and a metamodel were selected to build our final stacking-ensemble model, which integrates the prediction probabilities of multiple models into a meta-feature set to ensure trustworthy predictions. Finally, we integrated these strategies and deployed them into a web application to demonstrate a CAD system. This system not only predicts the disease but also generates the prediction probabilities of each class, which enhances both clarity and diagnostic insight. Our proposed model was compared with different state-of-the-art ML classifiers on a publicly available dataset and demonstrated the highest accuracy of 92.43%.},

  abstract     = {Neural machine translation (NMT) model processes sentences in isolation and ignores additional contextual or side information beyond sentences. The input text alone often provides limited knowledge to generate contextually correct and meaningful translation. Relying solely on the input text could yield translations that lack accuracy. Side information related to either source or target side is helpful in the context of NMT. In this study, we empirically show that training an NMT model with target-side additional information used as knowledge can significantly improve the translation quality. The acquired knowledge is leveraged in the encoder-/decoder-based model utilizing multiencoder framework. The additional encoder converts knowledge into dense semantic representation called attention. These attentions from the input sentence and additional knowledge are then combined into a unified attention. The decoder generates the translation by conditioning on both the input text and acquired knowledge. Evaluation of translation from Urdu to English with a low-resource setting yields promising results in terms of both perplexity reduction and improved BLEU scores. The proposed models in the respective group outperform in LSTM and GRU with attention mechanism by +3.1 and +2.9 BLEU score, respectively. Extensive analysis confirms our claim that the translations influenced by additional information may occasionally contain rare low-frequency words and faithful translation.

  abstract     = {A traffic network exhibits inherent characteristics of networks while also possessing unique features that hold significant research value. In this study, the limitations of static graph structures and the challenges of accurately modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in traffic flow have been addressed through a hybrid GCN-gated recurrent unit (GRU)-transformer model. The proposed model integrates a dynamic topology module (DTM) with graph attention networks (GATs), GRUs, and transformer-based temporal modules to adaptively capture the evolving dynamics of traffic networks. The DTM dynamically updates graph structures based on real-time traffic conditions, while GATs focus on identifying critical spatial relationships. GRUs efficiently capture temporal dependencies, and the transformer model captures long-term sequential patterns, providing a comprehensive framework for real-time traffic forecasting. The proposed model was trained and evaluated using the METR-LA dataset, which comprises traffic data from 207 sensors at 5-minute intervals. The model demonstrated superior performance across various metrics, achieving RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values of 4.125%, 2.985%, and 5.432%, respectively, for 15-minute predictions, with an R 2 value of 0.928. For longer prediction horizons (30, 45, and 60 min), the model consistently outperformed baseline methods, maintaining competitive RMSE and MAPE values. The experimental setup included normalization, graph construction using adjacency matrices, and preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and robustness. The integration of spatial and temporal features through the GCN-GRU-transformer framework enhanced the model’s ability to generalize across varying traffic scenarios, including peak hours and disruptions. Compared to traditional methods, which often rely on static graphs and fail to adapt to real-time changes, the hybrid model effectively addresses both spatial heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. The results indicate its robustness in handling complex traffic dynamics, adaptability to real-world variations, and potential applications in intelligent transportation systems. Future work will focus on incorporating multimodal data sources and enhancing computational efficiency to achieve broader scalability and deployment in smart city infrastructures.},

Consequently, hate speech and offensive content have turned out to be a widespread issue that negatively affects both individuals and society and needs to be controlled through detection and removal. This paper aims to provide a further understanding of the meaning of hate speech and offensive language and to provide a comprehensive discussion of the various techniques to detect hate speech and offensive language. A systematic literature review (SLR) of 90 research papers published between 2018 and 2024 was conducted to discover gaps within the literature. This review revealed challenges and possibilities for further development and improvement of previous findings. The results show that most of these works classified hate speech and offensive language using techniques from machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), and the most common performance metrics were Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-measure. The benchmark datasets are also described. Twitter was the most commonly utilized social network for obtaining datasets, while Facebook is sometimes used. Moreover, the findings of this review offer insight into research trends in Arabic hate speech and offensive language, as well as new research directions. The most interesting finding is that until now most Social Media Network Developers have not included autodetection of hate speech or offensive language plugins. Finally, this study presents a guideline for choosing the best strategies and techniques to detect and predict Arabic offensive language and hate speech.},

These models are built on top of Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT). These base predictor models leverage historical energy consumption patterns to capture temporal intricacies, including seasonal variations and rolling averages. In addition, we employed feature engineering methodologies to further enhance their predictive abilities. The accuracy of each ensemble model was evaluated by assessing various performance indicators, including the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination R 2 .

  abstract     = {A vast variety of neural network (NN)–based controllers use indirect adaptive control structures for their implementation, which primarily aims at estimating the nonlinear dynamics of the system and thereby generating a suitable control action. However, the most commonly used gradient descent weight update rule of the NN-based indirect adaptive controllers often fails to identify the system dynamics appropriately, and the control action becomes ineffective on the system under control. Further, a significant number of existing works in this domain employ randomized or suboptimal initial NN weights, which can potentially hamper the transient performance of the control loop. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative control scheme that utilizes the strength of indirect adaptive control of NN, along with the robustness of the PID controller. Since the PID control structure is often independent of plant dynamics and generates a control action to mitigate any error between the reference and the current plant output, it can be easily augmented with the control action generated by inverse neural network (INN) to mitigate any effects of unlearnt dynamics by INN. Further, we have used a bio-inspired optimization algorithm, that is, particle swarm optimization (PSO), to optimize the initial weights of the INN along with the PID controller’s parameters to get an optimal control performance. The proposed INN + PID controller scheme has been tested on a cart-mounted inverted pendulum system due to its challenging control requirement owing to its intricate nonlinear dynamics. Detailed simulation studies for the proposed INN + PID and PID controllers have been carried out for various control requirements, viz. set point tracking, disturbance rejection, and robustness testing. Further, an extensive comparative study has been devised based on the integral of absolute error (IAE) to test the efficacy of the proposed INN + PID controller against the conventional PID controller. Through extensive comparative studies, it was deduced that the proposed INN + PID controller is capable of handling the intricate nonlinear dynamics of the cart-mounted inverted pendulum system and provides a sturdy stabilization of the angular position of the pendulum with respect to the desired trajectory and superior transient control in comparison with the conventional PID controller. In terms of quantitative comparison, the improvement in IAE achieved by the proposed INN + PID controller was found to be 94.84%, 94.62%, and 69.86% better in comparison to the conventional PID controller for set point tracking, disturbance rejection for introduced impulsive force, and time-varying force variation, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Skin cancer spreads quickly as the skin is the most vulnerable organ, and melanoma (MEL) is a fatal type of skin cancer. Detecting MEL in the early stage can hugely increase the chance of a cure. There are several methods based on machine learning to detect MEL from dermoscopic images. However, increasing the accuracy of detection is still challenging. This paper presents a new method for MEL detection that considers the combination of deep and handcrafted time–frequency local features. After short preprocessing, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) extract the deep features. To this end, feature maps at the output of the flatten layer are considered as deep features. The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptors are handcrafted local features computed from the four subbands of one-level two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D DWT). After the fusion of the mentioned features, semisupervised discriminant analysis (SDA) reduces the highly correlated and redundant features. The Bayesian optimizer finds the optimum parameters of the SDA and Gaussian kernel of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to maximize the classification accuracy. The HAM10000 dataset with data augmentation is considered to assess the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results show that the proposed method reaches the accuracy and sensitivity of 94.19% and 96.22%, respectively. The most challenging parts of the proposed method are extraction of deep features and tuning the parameters of SDA and Gaussian-SVM.},

  abstract     = {This research focuses on developing an intelligent administrative chatbot for Roman Urdu to overcome the language barrier that hinders individuals who are not fluent in English from utilizing existing chatbot frameworks. While chatbot architectures can be rule based or artificial intelligence (AI) based, the core objective of a chatbot is to effectively address user queries across diverse domains. AI-based chatbots have demonstrated higher interactivity, scalability, adaptability to human interests, and evolving knowledge compared with rule-based architectures. However, the majority of existing chatbot frameworks is in English, which poses a challenge in regions like Pakistan where only a small percentage of the population is proficient in English. In response to this challenge, this research introduces an intelligent administrative chatbot specifically developed for Roman Urdu. Roman Urdu is the practice of writing Urdu, the native language of Pakistan, using the English alphabet. The proposed chatbot allows students to post their questions in either English or Roman Urdu, enabling them to obtain conclusive answers. The chatbot system utilizes a sentence analysis approach to generate relevant and productive responses to user queries. The core building block of the proposed chatbot is the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model with long short-term memory (LSTM) units. To train the model, a dataset was meticulously collected from various administrative offices at the University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore, initially in English and subsequently translated into Roman Urdu using different writing styles. The effectiveness of the proposed system was evaluated through a human judgment approach, assessing the contextual relevance and productivity of the chatbot’s responses to relevant questions. In conclusion, this research aims to bridge the language gap in chatbot frameworks, enhancing accessibility and usability.},

  abstract     = {Face recognition is a reliable biometric technology that utilizes artificial intelligence and computer vision to identify and verify an individual’s identity based on facial features. Its rapid development has enabled integration into diverse applications, including security systems, access control, forensics, and mobile devices. However, challenges such as recognizing faces across different ages persist, presenting opportunities for further research. Developing robust face recognition models requires substantial training datasets, but manually labeling large collections of facial images is both time-intensive and costly. Our previous study demonstrated that a ResNet-50 model trained on a dataset of 44,000 facial images, combining the original FaceScrub dataset with HyperStyle age and smile augmentations, achieved an F1-score of 79%, significantly outperforming the model trained solely on the authentic FaceScrub dataset (F1-score: 63%). Building upon these findings, this study explores a broader range of augmentation styles, including pose and domain adaptation, e.g., Pixar, Toonify, Sketch, and Disney, using the HyperStyle scheme. Models trained with domain adaptation showed reduced performance (F1-score: 64%) due to the domain gap introduced by cartoon-like styles. In contrast, models trained with pose augmentation achieved an F1-score of 75%, demonstrating the importance of augmentations resembling real-world variations. When training incorporated all augmentation styles, e.g., age, smile, pose, and domain adaptation, the F1-score reached 78%, slightly lower than the model trained with age and smile augmentations only (F1-score: 79%). To further evaluate the impact of age and smile augmentations, additional experiments were conducted using various CNN models, including VGGNet-16, MobileNetV3Small, SEResNet-18, and ResNet-50, under different hyperparameter configurations. Among these, ResNet-50 achieved the highest F1-score (82%), surpassing VGGNet-16 (60%), MobileNetV3Small (65%), and SEResNet-18 (81%). The study also introduced modifications to the HyperStyle scheme in both the preprocessing and postprocessing stages, which further enhanced model performance. The ResNet-50 model trained with the modified HyperStyle scheme, and the original FaceScrub dataset achieved the highest F1-score of 83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of these modifications in improving face recognition performance.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of fake online and AI–generated news content poses a significant threat to information integrity. This work leverages advanced natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms to effectively detect fake and AI–generated content. The utilized dataset, combined with multiple open-source datasets, comprises 43,000 real, 31,000 fake, and 80,000 AI–generated news articles and is augmented with an ensemble large language model. We combined three open-source LLMs (GPT-2, GPT-NEO, and Distil-GPT-2) into an ensemble LLM to generate new news titles, selecting the best outputs through majority voting for further dataset expansion. Preprocessing involved data cleaning, lowercasing, stop word removal, tokenization, and lemmatization. We applied six machine learning and five natural language processing models to this dataset. The two top-performing natural language–based models (RoBERTa and DeBERTa) have been combined to develop an ensemble transformer model. Among the machine learning models, random forest achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 92.49% and an F1 score of 92.60%. Among the natural language processing models, the ensemble transformer model attained the highest results, with 96.65% accuracy and an F1 score of 96.66%. The proposed ensemble model is optimized by applying model pruning (reducing parameters from 265M to 210M, improving training time by 25%) and dynamic quantization (reducing model size by 50%, maintaining 95.68% accuracy), enhancing scalability and efficiency while minimizing computational overhead. The DistilBERT-Student model, trained using a balanced combination of feature- and logit-based distillation from the RoBERTa-base Teacher network, achieved strong classification performance with 96.17% accuracy. Visualize-based attention maps are constructed for different news categories to enhance the interpretability of the applied transformer–based ensemble news detection models. Finally, a website was developed to enable users to identify fake, real, or AI–generated news content.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of cold-deck, mean, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) imputation techniques for predicting thyroid disease using a dataset of 9172 observations with 31 clinical features (5.2% missing values). Feature importance analysis identified thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (TT4), and free thyroxine index (FTI) as consistently significant biomarkers across all imputation methods. Five classifiers—Naïve Bayes, linear regression, support vector machines (SVM), LightGBM, and recurrent neural networks (RNN)—were assessed on imputed datasets, with performance evaluated through accuracy, F1 score, and recall. The KNN imputation method enhanced LightGBM’s accuracy by 0.47% over mean imputation (99.06% vs. 98.99%) and by 1.47% over cold deck (99.06% vs. 98.59%), demonstrating its superiority in preserving feature relationships and enhancing predictive power. LightGBM achieved the highest performance with KNN imputation (accuracy: 99.06%, F1: 97.57%, and recall: 97.83%), outperforming other classifiers by 2.5%–4.0% in accuracy. These results underscore the necessity of robust imputation techniques for reliable thyroid disease prediction.

Traditional clustering methods, such as K-means, are limited by fixed cluster numbers and sensitivity to outliers, often missing small or irregular fraud patterns. This research introduces an adaptive clustering algorithm (AD-KMeans) that dynamically adjusts the number of clusters based on variance and density thresholds, enabling better identification of hidden fraudulent activity. Using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, the proposed method is evaluated against standard K-means using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F 1-score, silhouette score, Davies–Bouldin index (DBI), and the Calinski–Harabasz index (CHI). Experimental results show that compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed AD-KMeans achieves the highest fraud recall (91.2%) and F 1-score (87.6%), improving recall by 22.3 percentage points over the best hybrid model (hybrid DNN + clustering, 68.9%) and F 1-score by 11.5 points (from 76.1% to 87.6%). Moreover, it identifies distinct fraud-prone clusters and adapts effectively to data structure variations.

Therefore, early prediction and detection are critical, leading to timely and appropriate interventions at early stages. Four ensemble tree-based algorithms were used in this study: adaptive boosting, extreme gradient boosting, random forest, and extremely randomized trees, investigating their ability to predict heart disease. Data related to heart disease clinical features was obtained from the open Kaggle Machine Learning Dataset repository. Adaptive Boosting stands out as the highest performer, achieving an average testing accuracy of 93.70%, precision of 93.71%, recall of 93.70%, and F1 score of 93.69%, along with the highest AUC score of 0.9708, across all competing models considered in the study. These metrics indicate a superior ability to distinguish between patients with and without heart disease, effectively making it particularly valuable for clinical applications where early detection can save lives. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework adopted to investigate the relative importance of the features in predicting heart disease revealed the most influential predictors (ST slope, chest pain type, old peak, and cholesterol), further aiding the understanding of heart disease mechanisms. Future work should explore the integration of ensemble learning algorithms with real-time patient monitoring systems.

  abstract     = {Collaborative filtering (CF)-based personalized recommendation systems are among the most widely adopted strategies for addressing information overload in modern markets. However, a significant challenge that hinders the effectiveness of these systems is data sparsity. To address this limitation, advanced methodologies such as matrix factorization and deep learning models have been developed to improve CF system performance in sparse data scenarios. Despite their advancements, most existing models rely solely on either implicit or explicit user–item interactions to generate recommendations. Traditional CF approaches often struggle with sparsity, necessitating the development of hybrid methods that integrate both explicit and implicit feedback to enhance performance. To address this gap, this study introduces DeepBlendRec, an innovative deep learning-based framework that leverages both explicit user ratings and implicit user behaviour. By utilizing this dual-input methodology, the model captures richer information regarding user–item interactions, thereby significantly improving recommendation accuracy. DeepBlendRec employs an enhanced autoencoder with a constrained decoder to process implicit ratings, thereby improving reconstruction quality and facilitating the creation of robust latent space representations. Simultaneously, explicit ratings are processed through a multilayer perceptron. The reconstructed outputs are then fused to generate a Top-N recommendation list. Experimental evaluations conducted on the MovieLens datasets demonstrate that DeepBlendRec consistently outperforms existing models across several key performance metrics, including mean-squared error (MSE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), precision, recall, and F1-score. These results highlight the potential of DeepBlendRec to advance the capabilities of recommendation systems in handling data sparsity and improving predictive accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel approach to engineering design optimization through the development of an improved mountain gazelle optimizer (iMGO) that incorporates variable neighborhood search (VNS) techniques. The enhanced algorithm effectively addresses engineering optimization challenges by identifying optimal design solutions within specified constraints. In particular, iMGO significantly improves solution diversity and mitigates the risk of premature convergence to local optima, thereby overcoming the limitations of the original MGO. A comprehensive analysis was conducted using 12 functions from the CEC 2022 benchmark suite, and the algorithm was applied to five engineering problems, including the design of an I-beam, pressure vessel, three-bar truss, cantilever beam, and tension spring. Comparative results indicate that iMGO outperforms established metaheuristic techniques, such as MFO, WOA, GOA, MPA, TSO, and SCSO, as well as the original MGO. The results validate iMGO’s effectiveness in navigating the complexities of constrained engineering optimization. For instance, in practical applications, the manufacturing cost of the pressure vessel design was reduced from 6014.4537 to 5915.3358, and the weight of the tension spring was decreased from 0.0149154 to 0.0130101 relative to the original MGO. These enhancements underscore the significant potential of iMGO in real-world applications across aerospace engineering, structural design optimization, energy system planning, and other fields, thereby contributing to more efficient and sustainable engineering solutions.},

First, in order to enhance the efficiency of cooperative hunting, a novel task allocation method is proposed based on a leader–follower structure, where follower and leader MSVs perform the target encircling task and the target tracking task, respectively. Second, on the basis of task allocation, adaptive control design is employed for the follower MSVs to enhance the control performance of target encircling; optimal feedback control design combined with adaptive feedforward control design is considered using the RL algorithm for the leader MSVs to ensure the optimality of target tracking. Finally, the stability of the multi-MSV hunting control system is guaranteed and all signals are uniformly ultimately bounded based on the Lyapunov theory in the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through simulation results.},

  abstract     = {While analyzing health data is important for improving health outcomes, class imbalance in datasets poses major challenges to machine learning classification models. This work, therefore, considers the class imbalance problem in stroke prediction using models such as K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, logistic regression, random forest, and decision tree. This work balances the stroke dataset, thereby enhancing model performance, through various oversampling strategies: random oversampling (RO), ADASYN, SMOTE, and SMOTE–Tomek. Compared to the results of the imbalanced dataset, all applied oversampling techniques enhanced the correct classification of stroke events by the ML model. Among these, RO–SVM with RBF kernel was the best in terms of sensitivity, specificity, G-mean, F1-score, and accuracy values, offering the highest results with respective values of 89.87%, 94.91%, 92.36%, 89.64%, and 89.87%. After applying oversampling techniques, all the machine learning classifications were good enough to classify stroke status, especially for the minority class. This study has highlighted the importance of class imbalance issues in health datasets. Precise detection of instances of minority classes can be enhanced considerably by employing classification models with the implementation of hybrid strategies to effectively solve class imbalance issues, which, in turn, will help improve healthcare outcomes. Further research in integrating more advanced deep learning techniques into other health datasets with imbalances is encouraged to further validate or refine class imbalance approaches, as effective handling of imbalanced classes can substantially promote predictive model performance in the analysis of healthcare.},

  abstract     = {The elongation period of cotton fiber development is crucial for ensuring cotton quality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying fiber elongation remain unclear. This study reveals that SER02 _ A11 , which is preferentially expressed during the fiber elongation period, encodes serine protease inhibitors (serpins). A previously uncharacterized SNP 517th is localized in the gene's coding region between Gossypium barbadense and G. hirsutum , leading to the premature translation termination and low expression of GhSER02 in G. hirsutum . However, in G. barbadense , normal protein translation and high expression of GbSER02 are observed. Ectopic GbSER02 expression or site-directed GhSER02' mutagenesis (but not GhSER02 ) promotes trichome and root cell elongation in Arabidopsis , indicating that SNP 517th causes the dysfunction of GhSER02 . Overexpressing GbSER02 in G. hirsutum increases fiber length. GbSER02 interacts with the transcription factor GhVOZ1 (vascular one-zinc-finger protein) in the cytoplasm, alleviating the inhibitory effect of GhVOZ1 on GhGA3ox1 expression, thereby promoting gibberellin synthesis. Subsequently, the cell wall loosening-related genes GhXTH2 and GhEXPA1 are significantly upregulated whereas the flavonoid metabolism-related gene GhCHS1 is significantly downregulated, ultimately improving fiber length. Collectively, this study reveals the essential role of the GbSER02-GhVOZ1-GhGA3ox1 module in regulating fiber quality and provides novel insights into the mechanism of fiber development in cotton.},

  abstract     = {Cancer patients have a higher risk of all types of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Cardiologists are encountering a growing number of cancer patients with CVDs, and an increasing number of cancer patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The mechanistic link between cancer and CVDs remains elusive. Here, the meta-analysis shows the increased incidence ratio of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in patients undergoing PCI with cancer compared with non-cancer. We experimentally demonstrated that cancer aggravated mitochondrial dysfunction and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in two models of lung cancer in mice. Plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from cancer mice exacerbated cardiac I/R injury in vivo and in vitro, while inhibition of tumor EVs secretion by lipid-coated polyacrylic acid/calcium phosphate nanoparticles delivered a neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor (GW4869) showed the opposite results. Lung-specific miR-485-3p sponges mediated by Adeno-associated virus 6 suppress cardiac damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in CC10-KRAS G12D mice post-I/R. Mechanistically, PPARGC1A/PGC-1α is post-transcriptionally repressed by miR-485-3p in cardiomyocytes, leading to the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I subunits and ATP synthesis. Taken together, our findings reveal for the first time that cancer can aggravate cardiac injury and mitochondrial dysfunction by releasing miR-485-3p-enriched extracellular vesicles derived from cancer cells.},

  abstract     = {Creation of well-curated databases tailored to specific structural motifs can underpin and drive materials discovery, as the properties of materials are governed by composition and structure. The role of such motifs in directing the intricate interplay between structure and properties is exemplified by intermetallic compounds with structures that contain kagome layers that exhibit a variety of exotic physical states. Two prevailing approaches have previously been applied to identify such materials: evaluation of structural topology or geometry assessment, however, both present limitations if deployed individually. We augment topological screening with geometrical filtering to allow versatile control over the identification of kagome layers. Applying this approach with minimal further constraints labels over 9000 kagome-containing intermetallics which are assigned to four structural classes, revealing connections between symmetry, composition, direct space structure, and flatband electronic structures in reciprocal space. A machine learning model is used to predict new element combinations that favour the formation of kagome layers. Several highly-ranked phase fields correspond to known kagome-containing materials that were absent from the training dataset, demonstrating that the workflow can identify chemistries affording kagome layers. This motivates the extension of the approach beyond kagome to other property-conferring motifs, such as honeycomb, square planar or triangular plane nets.},

To maximize their efficacy, adjuvants and their combinations are investigated to prepare vaccines with whole tumor antigens. By comparing different nano/micro-vaccines, ≤ 400 nm and 2.5 µm, respectively, are identified as their optimal sizes. When used alone, the optimal cancer vaccine cures all or most tumor-bearing mice with melanoma, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma lung metastasis. The landscape of immune cells in the blood, splenocytes, and draining lymph nodes of vaccine-treated mice is systematically investigated using single-cell sequencing. The diversity of CD8 + T cell receptors (TCR), CD4 + TCR, and B cell receptors (BCR) in cured mice is higher than that in uncured mice. By comparing 21 samples, several biomarkers, including KLRG1, S100A4, S1PR5, IL2Ra, and IKZF2, were identified to distinguish responders and non-responders to immunotherapy. Moreover, S100A4, S1PR5 and KLRG1, are biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy in mouse cancer models and patients with cancer. Hence, this study presents an optimized cancer vaccine that cures most tumor-bearing mouse models and the landscape of immune cells in non-responders and responders to immunotherapy.

However,  the structural component alterations and immune cell infiltration characteristics of choroid plexus (ChP) following traumatic brain injury (TBI) remain incompletely understood. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing and histological analysis, the accumulation of group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) in the ChP stroma post-TBI is identified. Intracerebroventricular adoptive transfer of ILC2 is further indicated to exhibit a tendency to colonize the ChP and significantly alleviate pathogenic immune infiltration during the acute phase of TBI, as well as maintain hippocampal integrity during the chronic phase. Sensory-motor function and memory impairments in TBI mice are also improved under ILC2 treatment. Mechanistically, ILC2 is induced by ChP fibroblasts derived IL33 and anchored to stroma fibroblasts via the VCAM-1/Integrin α4β7 pathway. Furthermore, single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the hippocampus reveals that ILC2-derived AREG promotes the initiation of neurogenesis by interacting with EGFR on early-stage neurogenic cells. Overall, these findings highlight that ChP-resident ILC2, through optimizing the immune microenvironment and promoting neurogenesis after TBI, may represent a potential therapeutic strategy.},

This research has uncovered that polysulfide anions (K 2 S x ), which serve as reducing catalysts, can also effectively act as sulfur reagents, providing the formation of C( sp 3 )–S bonds through a photoredox catalysis with an oxidative photocatalyst tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) and dual hydrogen atom transfer (DHAT) process.

  abstract     = {Rotator cuff tears often require surgical reconstruction; however, outcomes remain suboptimal, primarily because of the challenges in fully restoring the tendon–bone interface (TBI). The normal fibrocartilaginous transition zone is often replaced by fibrous scar tissue, thereby increasing the risk of retears. A porous hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel is developed to encapsulate adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). Gelatin microspheres served as porogens to create micropores within the hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel (HMs), and hollow gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel microspheres are used to encapsulate BMP-2 (GMBs). In vitro experiments confirm substantial proliferation and homing of ADSCs within the porous hydrogel system. When the ADSCs-loaded composite hydrogel (HMs/MBs/ADSCs) is applied to a rat rotator cuff injury model, it effectively reconstructs the fibrocartilage transition zone and promotes TBI healing. Transcriptome sequencing is performed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying BMP-2-induced fibrocartilage reconstruction. Furthermore, integrated in vitro sequencing reveals that HMs/MBs/ADSCs modulated the tissue microenvironment to enhance tissue regeneration, primarily through BMP-2′s regulation of the paracrine effects of ADSCs. This study explores the comprehensive pathway through which HMs/MBs/ADSCs enhance tissue regeneration, emphasizing the synergistic effects of BMP-2 and ADSCs, and offers novel insights into the mechanisms underlying TBI healing.},

  abstract     = {Leaf senescence significantly impacts both the yield and quality of non-heading Chinese cabbage (NHCC). Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of leaf senescence in NHCC remain poorly understood. Here, transcriptome changes are first profiled, and found that ethylene (ET) and salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathways are activated during leaf senescence. Further mining of ET, SA, and DNA methylation pathway genes identified that EIN3A and CMT2 are induced and repressed, respectively, during leaf senescence. A whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) analysis revealed a global reduction of DNA methylation during leaf senescence, with the most dramatic decline occurring in the 1 kb regions upstream of transcription start sites (TSS) and downstream of transcription end sites (TES). Knocking down of EIN3A and CMT2 via virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) demonstrated that EIN3A is crucial for ET- and age-triggered leaf senescence, while CMT2 plays an inhibitory role. It further showed that EIN3A directly represses the expression of CMT2 to release its “braking” role on senescence-associated genes ( SAGs ) expression. Thus, the study uncovers a pivotal antagonistic interaction between ET signaling and DNA methylation, which may be involved in setting the pace for the progression of leaf senescence in NHCC.},

  abstract     = {Effective bone regeneration remains a significant challenge in surgical practice, particularly due to the limitations associated with autologous bone grafting, such as donor site morbidity and limited bone availability. This study investigated the potential of human bone-derived endothelial cells (b-ECs) in mediating bone regeneration, especially in conjunction with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (bm-MSCs). It is demonstrated that b-ECs retain unique osteoinductive properties post-isolation, crucial for promoting bone formation in vivo. Utilizing ectopic and orthotopic xenograft models in immunodeficient mice, these findings revealed that the synergistic interaction of b-ECs and bm-MSCs induced rapid and substantial bone formation, highlighting the therapeutic potential of b-ECs in bone repair strategies. The distinct expression of KIT ligand (KITLG) in b-ECs emerged as a key factor in these processes. KITLG expression by b-ECs facilitated the recruitment of c-Kit+/CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells to the osteovascular niche, leading to robust osteogenic differentiation of bm-MSCs, a process regulated by Notch signaling. Moreover, inducing KITLG expression in non-bone-derived endothelial cells conferred similar osteoinductive capabilities. These findings not only enhance the understanding of the intricate interplay between vascular and bone tissues but also open avenues for developing innovative cell-based approaches for bone regeneration therapy.},

  abstract     = {Livestock farming and conventional meat production pose significant environmental, health, and animal welfare challenges. In seeking sustainable alternative solutions, cultivated meat technology typically utilizes differentiation of myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) into muscle cells for in vitro meat production. However, understanding the molecular determinants governing MPC differentiation into muscle cells, and the potential enhancement of this process through modulation of signaling pathways, remains limited. Herein, we characterized the molecular landscape associated with bovine MPC differentiation in vitro by employing multiomics, and explored its augmentation by small molecules, together leading to identification of media that enhanced myogenic differentiation compared with conventional methods in both 2D cultures and tissue-engineered 3D skeletal muscle constructs. Through bulk and single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics, we compared conventional and enhanced differentiation media, demonstrating that the enhanced media gave rise to unique progenitor-like cell populations, while simultaneously promoting differentiation into myocytes and contractile myotubes expressing a wide array of myogenic markers that more closely resemble bovine muscle cells in vivo. The improved method for promoting myogenic differentiation in 2D and 3D formats, together with the corresponding molecular roadmap, may prove valuable for cultivated meat applications.},

  abstract     = {Exposed to mechanical confinement, mammalian cells can establish remarkable unspecific adhesion, which is independent of integrins. How cells facilitate such adhesion remains unclear. Here, it is investigated how mammalian cells exposed to compression initiate unspecific and integrin-mediated adhesion. It is observed that with increasing compression, cells increase adhesion to collagen I or fibronectin and strengthen adhesion faster. Under low and medium compression, cells minimally increase unspecific adhesion to substrates that lack specific binding sites for cell surface receptors, such as integrins. However, under high compression, mammalian cells switch to a strong unspecific adhesion state, which significantly contributes to cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion. Thereby cells use the glycocalyx to directly facilitate strong unspecific adhesion and to enhance early integrin-mediated adhesion. The mechanistic insight of how cells unspecifically adhere to substrates under confinement opens avenues to better understand cell adhesion in development, homeostasis, disease, and in a wide range of biotechnological and medical applications in which cells are exposed to mechanical confinement.},

Thus, more effective combination therapies are needed. This study finds that cystine and cysteine levels in tumor tissues of lung cancer patients are significantly higher than adjacent non-tumor tissues. Cystine deficiency polarizes macrophages toward an M1 phenotype, secreting more TNF-α, CXCL9, and CXCL10. However, using a cystine-free diet marginally reduces the development of lung cancer in vivo. A cystine-free diet slightly reduces lung cancer progression in vivo. Further studies show that cystine deprivation or erastin-mediated transport inhibition increased PD-L1 expression in macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. Combining a cystine-free diet or IKE injection with PD-L1 antibody treatment significantly inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth in mice. Mechanistic studies indicat that cystine deficiency-induced GSH depletion activates NF-κB in macrophages by reducing its glutathionylation. This effect can be reversed by replenishing GSH or using an NF-κB inhibitor. At the same time, lung cancer patients with better responses to immunotherapy are found to have lower serum GSH levels. These findings suggest that targeting cystine metabolism combined with PD-L1 inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy.},

Furthermore, integrating nanocatalysts into nanodiodes has narrowed the gap between model systems and practical catalysts, demonstrating hot electron excitation in nanoparticle-based systems.

  abstract     = {Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury associated with recanalization therapy in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) exacerbates the initial brain damage. However, it remains a clinical challenge due to limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms of I/R injury. This study aims to investigate the mechanism of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-mediated succinate oxidation in microglia extracellular traps (MiETs) formation and neuronal injury after cerebra I/R injury. The results show that microglia are the main cell type producing extracellular traps (ETs) at 24 h at cerebral parenchyma after cerebral I/R. Additionally, oxygen glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) could induce MiETs formation and increased level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Microglia switches toward glycolysis with enhanced SDH activity and upregulated expression of SDH subunit A (SDHA) during MiETosis. Dimethyl malonate (DMM), a competitive SDH inhibitor, could reduce MiETosis by inhibiting succinate oxidation and mtROS production during reperfusion. Furthermore, DMM is found to alleviate neuronal injury after OGD/R exposure and neurological behavior disorders after cerebral I/R, and the effect is similar to MiETosis inhibitor BB-Cl amidine. These findings reveal a novel functional state of microglia and the role of succinate oxidation in MiETosis after cerebral I/R and provide a novel potential target for the treatment of AIS.},

METTL14-mediated m 6 A modification stabilized LINC01094 by recruiting the reader protein IGF2BP2, which contributed to the upregulation of LINC01094 expression in BC. Gain- and loss-of-function assays validated that LINC01094 triggered a switch in glucose metabolism from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis, promoting BC progression both in vitro and in vivo. LINC01094 promoted the dimeric assembly and nuclear translocation of PKM2 by acting as a “molecular scaffold” for the PKM2/JMJD5 complex. This, in turn, facilitated energy metabolic reprogramming and cell proliferation induced by HIF1-α/β-catenin. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of LINC01094 is evaluated through the administration of the PKM2 activator TEPP-46 in mouse xenografts.

  abstract     = {Potassium-ion batteries, which possess unique advantages such as lower K + /K redox potential compared to sodium and superior interfacial charge transfer dynamics, demonstrate considerable viability for grid-level energy storage deployment. However, the development of potassium electrodes remains constrained by sluggish solid-state diffusion of K + within electrodes and progressive structural failure by the large volume variation during (de)intercalation, which requires a thorough understanding ionic transport, size effects, and electro–chemo–mechanical properties of electrodes, to achieve rational design and controlled synthesis. This review initiated with a comprehensive evaluation of potassium-based batteries from five aspects: energy density, power density, cycle life, safety, and cost. Afterward, a systematical examination for key aspects of potassium electrodes from a unique perspective is provided, starting with the fundamental scientific issues of transport properties (key features, anomalous cases, regulation, measurement and prediction) and size effects (kinetics, thermodynamics, potassium storage and transport mechanisms), while further discussing the specific electro–chemo–mechanical properties (composition–structure regulation, nanostructure and interface engineering). Additionally, this review highlights the construction of high-entropy electrodes and the pivotal role of machine learning in developing potassium electrodes. This review aims to provide critical guidance for future basic research and industrial applications of potassium electrode materials.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is pivotal to sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies. Yet, its sluggish kinetics in acidic media and reliance on expensive noble metal catalysts limit its efficiency in these applications. Spinel cobalt(II, III) oxide (Co 3 O 4 )-based catalysts are cost-effective alternatives with high theoretical catalytic activity. However, their practical deployment is hindered by their poor stability in acidic electrolytes. This review critically examines recent advances in enhancing the stability of spinel Co 3 O 4 -based catalysts for acidic OER. The fundamental reaction mechanisms of acidic OER are first analyzed to illustrate how different catalyst design strategies can be used to improve their stability. Next, five key catalyst design strategies reported in recent studies are summarized: 1) constructing protective surface layers, 2) modulating reaction pathways, 3) controlling cobalt redox dynamics, 4) tuning cobalt-oxygen covalency, and 5) stabilizing lattice oxygen. Further, recent research progress in understanding the structure-activity-stability relationship of spinel Co 3 O 4 -based catalysts is summarized, with a focus on identifying their catalytically active sites, tracking surface reconstruction, and elucidating degradation mechanisms. This review ends with a discussion of future research directions for addressing key challenges in realizing durable, high-performance Co 3 O 4 -based catalysts for acidic OER applications.},

  abstract     = {Coordinating transcription and replication via transcription factors (TFs) is a conserved mechanism in higher eukaryotes. The role of TFs in regulating these processes in cancers remains unclear. Here, it is shown that oncogenetic ETS transcription factor ETV4 controls DNA replication through both transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ETV4 localizes to specific DNA replication origins and interacts with the origin recognition complex subunits ORC1 and ORC6 during the G1/S phase, facilitating origin formation. Using quantitative in situ analysis of protein interactions at DNA replication forks (SIRF) assays, it is shown that ETV4 transiently localizes to replication forks in the S phase. It interacts with replicative helicase MCM2 N-terminal, histone H3, and histone-chaperone FACT and is involved in histone processing during replication. Additionally, ETV4 transcriptionally regulates key replisome genes MCM2, MCM4, MCM5, MCM10, and ORC1, influencing their expression and recruitment to chromatin. Due to its binding at the origin-promoter locus like the MCM4 gene, ETV4 overexpression increases R-loop formation, DNA damage, and cell death under external replication stress induced by topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor. These findings highlight the dual role of ETV4 in replication and transcription and suggest that targeting TOP1 could be a synthetic-lethal approach in ETV4-overexpressed lung cancer.},

These mechanisms involve protein–protein interactions between receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and MLKL, MLKL phosphorylation, protein–protein interactions between MLKL and MLKL, and MLKL-lipid interactions. In this review, the specificity of MLKL activation mechanisms is discussed across different species and describe the processes by which MLKL transitions from an auto-inhibited to a membrane-embedded state.

Herein, this study focuses on the development of an innovative fluorescent probe that exhibits heightened spectral sensitivity to microenvironmental changes and its advanced HSFI application. First, the comprehensive investigation of various donor-π-acceptor molecules uncovers the critical role of π-spacer on the wavelength sensitivity to microenvironment polarity. Based on this insight, a new fluorescent probe Lipi-PS of whose wavelength sensitivity represents the highest level so far is rationally developed. Further combining with the features of lipid droplets (LDs) targeting and high photostability of Lipi-PS , as well as the newly established wavelength and polarity encoding method, HSFI is successfully realized in cells, tissues, and zebrafishes. Accordingly, the structural morphologies, fluorescence wavelengths, and polarities are intuitively visualized in the HSFI images. Notably, a special HSFI of single LD is achieved using Lipi-PS in a custom-built 3D-SpecDIM system, allowing 5D tracking ( xyzλt ) of individual LDs for the first time. This enables unprecedented correlation of polarity-dynamic behavior at the single-LD level.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial dysfunction is related to etiopathogenesis and progression of heart failure (HF). The underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Transcription factor FOXM1 plays an essential role in cardiovascular development. The present study explores its role in mitochondrial bioenergetics in postmitotic cardiomyocytes (CMs). FOXM1 is significantly upregulated in ischemic heart tissues from humans, mice, and pigs. CM-specific Foxm1 -knockout mice exhibit dilated cardiomyopathy features associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of Foxm1 -knockout mice reveal robust, specific downregulation of gene programs important for mitochondrial energetics and homeostasis. Analysis of proteome and ubiquitinome data reveal that FOXM1 deficiency in CMs promotes LKB1 ubiquitination and impairs the AMPK signaling and energy metabolism pathways. Bioinformatics analysis identifies that E3 ligase MKRN1 promotes the K48-linked ubiquitination of LKB1 on Lys146, which in turn, inhibits the AMPK signaling pathway and impairs energy homeostasis in mice with HF. CM-specific Mkrn1 knockout ameliorates cardiac dysfunction by rejuvenating the impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics induced by FOXM1 deficiency. FOXM1 overexpression preserves mitochondrial bioenergetics and protects against myocardial I/R injury in both rodent and porcine models. In conclusion, FOXM1 is actively involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics during HF. FOXM1 may be a potential promising therapeutic target for myocardial I/R injury and HF.},

Herein, two corundum-type medium-entropy oxide ceramics (MEO-1 and MEO-2) are synthesized through solid-state reaction sintering under controlled oxygen partial pressures. MEO-1 is a single-phase corundum-type oxide (Al 0.41 Cr 0.26 Fe 0.31 Ti 0.02 ) 2 O 3 , while MEO-2 incorporates (Fe 4 Al 3 Cr) 0.25 TiO 5 whiskers to reinforce (Al 0.40 Cr 0.25 Fe 0.30 Ti 0.05 ) 2 O 3 . By regulating variable valence ions at different oxygen partial pressures, the whiskers achieved a maximum average length of 28.3 µm and a length-to-diameter ratio of 17.7 at 50.6 kPa, significantly enhancing the fracture toughness of the MEO-2, which possesses the optimal flexural strength, Vickers hardness, and fracture toughness of 321 ± 8 MPa, 22.4 ± 1.5 GPa, and 3.87 ± 0.12 MPa m 1/2 , respectively. Bravais–Friedel–Donnay–Harker law (BFDH) simulation elucidates that oxygen partial pressures can effectively regulate ionic diffusion behavior and whisker growth. First-principles calculations demonstrate that the whisker growth direction [0 4 0] aligns with the high shear modulus direction, contributing to the strengthening mechanism. This work provides new insights for designing high-performance medium/high-entropy ceramics, highlighting the critical role of oxygen partial pressure in regulating whisker growth and improving mechanical properties.},

This study presents two types of STOMs with an area of 11.4 cm 2 , exhibiting homogeneous appearance while retaining up to 92% of their respective small-area cell power conversion efficiency (PCE). Precise laser structuring minimized the area loss originating from the sub-cell series interconnection, allowing narrow cell stripes down to 1.25 mm. This enables a metal-less top electrode composed solely of PEDOT:PSS without compromising fill factor. For a module, an additional challenge is to ensure a low resistance series interconnection between sub-cells.

  abstract     = {Copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) have emerged as a remarkable class of CO 2 reduction reaction catalysts that are distinguished by their unparalleled reactivity, but effectively modulating the transport pathway of charge carriers between Cu NCs by feasible chemical means is still challenging. Herein, a thermally induced covalent crosslinking strategy is proposed to modulate the fast electron transport pathway formed between clusters. A copper-sulfur–nitrogen cluster [Cu 4 (SN) 4 ] (denoted Cu 4 SN ) is first synthesized; subsequently, the SN ligands in Cu 4 SN are coupled covalently via a thermally induced covalent crosslinking strategy to yield CC –Cu 4 SN , which exhibits enhanced conductivity and photocarrier transport. As expected, CC –Cu 4 SN shows a high photocatalytic CO production rate of 29.98 µmol g −1 h −1 with ≈99.5% selectivity in CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as sacrificial agents, which is more than 10 times superior to that observed with Cu 4 SN . Systematic experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the covalent crosslinks between clusters accelerate the dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers, increase the light utilization ability, favor CO 2 adsorption and * COOH generation, thereby accounting for the increased CO 2 photoreduction activity. This work presents a novel thermally induced internal covalent crosslinking strategy for synthesizing novel cluster-based covalent polymers with enhanced stability and catalytic activity.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of high-performance electrocatalysts is crucial for advancing sustainable energy technologies. Compositionally complex solid solutions comprising multiple metals offer promising catalytic properties, yet their exploration is challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible compositions. In this work, human-decision driven combinatorial sputtering of thin-film materials libraries and high-throughput characterization is combined with Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the quaternary composition space Ni-Pd-Pt-Ru for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Using this method, the global activity optimum of pure Ru is identified after covering less than 20% of the complete composition space with six materials libraries. Six additional libraries are fabricated to validate the activity trend. The resulting dataset is used to formulate general guidelines for the efficient composition of space exploration with combinatorial synthesis paired with Bayesian optimization.},

ALKBH5 induces ferroptosis in the HH/R model by mutating the 3′-UTR of G3BP1 mRNA and m 6 A sites at positions 142 and 173. Mutations of sites 142 and 173 only partially affect the levels of p53 N/T , SLC7A11 and ferroptosis. G3BP1, YBX1 and p53 protein can bind to each other, and p53 can inhibit the expression of SLC7A11 via nuclear binding to the promoter region of SLC7A11 mRNA. The p53 and YBX1 proteins can synergistically enter the nucleus to aggravate cell damage, while G3BP1 is expressed in the cytoplasm and inhibits p53 binding to SLC7A11 by blocking the entry of the p53 and YBX1 proteins into the nucleus. ALKBH5 promotes G3BP1 expression through m 6 A methylation at m 6 A sites 142 and 173. Subsequently, G3BP1, YBX1, and p53 interact with each other, the amount of synergistic nuclear translocation of YBX1 and p53 is reduced, and the level of p53 nuclear translocation that inhibiting SLC7A11 transcription is decreased, thereby inhibits cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and reducing myocardial tissue damage during myocardial IRI in diabetes.},

However, the limited stability of natural enzymes, along with interference from electro-oxidizable species, continues to pose significant challenges for their long-term application. Herein, an integrated wearable system is presented for nonenzymatic glucose monitoring in sweat at the point of care. This system integrates a flexible microfluidic glucose sensor patch for sweat sampling and measurement, using Pt nanoparticles (Pt-NPs) confined within phthalocyanine-based conductive metal–organic frameworks (Pc-MOFs) as electrode materials, and a flexible printed circuit board for signal/analysis and wireless communication. The microfluidic sensor patch based on Pc-MOFs confined Pt-NPs exhibits significantly improved nonenzymatic glucose sensing performances. This is attributed to the ultrasmall size of Pt-NPs and the confinement effect within the Pc-MOF channels, which regulates the glucose adsorption intensity and increases the electrocatalytic activity to glucose oxidation. During the continuous monitoring process, the glucose concentration is calibrated in sweat by accounting for fluctuations in pH and temperature, and evaluated the performance of the wearable device in monitoring sweat glucose levels in human subjects over a 12-h period, achieving data as accurate as that obtained using high-performance liquid chromatography.},

  abstract     = {Regulating the orientation and dynamics of interfacial water is essential for optimizing electrocatalytic reactions, yet it remains challenging due to its intrinsic disorder. Here, it is demonstrated that localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on an Ir single-atom Au catalyst actively restructures the hydrogen-bond (HB) network, accelerating ammonia oxidation reaction kinetics. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that plasmonic excitation shifts the HB network toward a more flexible configuration, favoring the formation of three-coordinated hydrogen-bonded water (3HB·H 2 O) while suppressing cation-associated species (K + ·H 2 O). This transformation enhances the dehydrogenation process and stabilizes reaction intermediates, leading to a 28% increase in NH 3 oxidation kinetics. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy further confirms that LSPR-driven polarization at the Ir active site compresses the Ir─O bond from 1.73 to ≈1.58 Å by generating electron vacancies, thereby accelerating deprotonation with * OH during oxidative electrolysis. Extending this principle to an LED-driven plasmon-assisted symmetric wastewater electrolyzer, achieving a 40-fold current enhancement and 94% ammonia removal efficiency over 120 h at 1 V under landfill leachate-like conditions.},

Polyglycolic acid (PGA) is widely used in biomedical and packaging fields. Here, this study introduces an electrochemical degradation strategy for PGA waste that couples its conversion with seawater-driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using rosette-like high-entropy NiCoFeMnAlO x nanosheets (r-NCFMAO). The PGA-derived glycolic acid oxidation reaction (GAOR) achieves 100 mA cm −2 at 1.36 V versus RHE, benefiting from abundant hydroxyl species (OH*) that lower the required potential by over 190 mV compared to the oxygen evolution reaction. This method produces ≈90% CO 3 2− , and subsequent Ca 2+ precipitation recovers 77% of CaCO 3 , a valuable material in construction and papermaking. Electrochemical analysis, quasi in situ electron paramagnetic resonance, and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal continuous OH − oxidation enhancing GAOR activity, while density functional theory confirms that OH* lowers the energy barrier for the rate-determining C─C bond cleavage and C─H bond activation. The integrated GAOR ‖ HER system sustains performance for over 300 h at industrial current densities and is applicable to upcycling various plastics.

  abstract     = {Low-temperature annealing is traditionally employed to relieve residual stresses in metallic materials, typically resulting in softening. However, a novel finding in the face-centered-cubic (fcc) CoNiV medium entropy alloy (MEA) is reported, where low-temperature annealing induces significant hardening without sacrificing ductility. Specifically, after annealing at 530 °C, the yield strength increases from 503 to 653 MPa, while maintaining plasticity of ≈60%. The comprehensive analysis reveals that this unexpected strengthening is attributed to the development of multi-scale chemical short-range orderings (SROs) during the annealing process. These SROs, particularly a newly formed L12-type ordered structure (SRO-2), enhance material strength by promoting dislocation slip planarity and reducing dislocation entanglement. This study demonstrates that low-temperature annealing can effectively optimize atomic-scale structures in complex alloys distinct from that in conventional alloys, thereby improving their mechanical properties. These findings extend the conventional understanding of annealing effects and highlight the potential for leveraging SROs to design high-performance materials.},

The ionogel, synthesized from the molecular network construction of Gly-lignin, 1-butyl-3-vinylimidazole tetrafluoroborate (BVIMBF 4 ), and benzyl methacrylate (BZMA), forms a stable and elastic 3D conductive network through both chemical and physical crosslinking. This structure imparts remarkable mechanical properties, including considerable adhesion (30.4 kPa on flame-retardant gloves), tensile strength (5.8 MPa), and high ionic conductivity. Notably, through the formation of a protective carbonized/B₂O₃ layer and chemical barrier gases during combustion, the ionogel exhibits excellent flame retardancy, with a weight loss of 41.8% at 800 °C. Additionally, GLI achieves real-time thermal sensing via its negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior (TCR = −0.58% °C −1 ). Even after exposure to fire, GLI retains its temperature and motion-sensing capabilities.

  abstract     = {This work elucidates an important open question in the field of mechanically soft magnetorheological elastomers (MREs): how microstructural rearrangements during magnetic actuation modulate their viscoelastic behavior. Experimental assays are provided on mechanically confined and very soft MREs that, under magnetic actuation, show an order of magnitude increase in relaxation times compared to purely mechanical cases. It is demonstrated that such a modulation in the viscous response can be tuned by the amplitude and actuation rate of the magnetic stimuli, and is intrinsically linked to microstructural rearrangements of the magnetic particles. Motivated by these experimental observations, magnetic actuation protocols are conceived to enable mechanical responses in soft materials with force-memory. Specifically, due to the magnetically induced long-term viscous relaxation, one can induce magnetic-driven yielding by introducing material hardening during cycling loading. This mechanical memory of the MRE can be subsequently removed by releasing the magnetic stimuli for h, resetting the material performance and its microstructural state. These mechanisms are deeply understood by a combination of different experimental approaches and a new theoretical magneto-mechanical continuum model. The results reported herein respond to unraveled fundamental questions in soft MREs, and provide a game-changing concept for designing a new branch of soft sensor-actuator and reservoir computing systems.},

However, most of existing topologically protected couplers exhibit a constant transmission coefficient within the bandgap, and achieving continuously tunable transmission coefficients remains challenging. Here it is experimentally showed that a four-port coupler consisting of quantum valley Hall effect-based waveguides can exhibit continuously tunable transmission coefficients from one input port to each of the two output ports over the bandgap, while the rest port is consistently isolated by the topological protection. Further topologically protected digital signal transfer is demonstrated with frequency shift keying modulation in the coupler, revealing the data-transfer capability close to the theoretical limit established in the digital communication scheme.

However, most kirigami structures can only deform freely within a 2D plane, with limited out-of-plane deformability, making them inadequate for constructing periodic objects with arbitrary 3D shapes. Here, a novel class of 3D mechanical metamaterials with hyperbolic kirigami tessellations has been developed. By projecting hyperbolic kirigami templates onto three types of triply periodic minimal surfaces, candidate structures are developed with remarkable properties. An extreme negative Poisson's ratio of -1 and tunable mechanical multistability are uncovered through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments thanks to the flexible kirigami geometry. Notably, the structure achieves a maximum volume expansion of up to 488% during auxetic morphing. Furthermore, programmable morphing behaviors are demonstrated through voxelated assemblies of kirigami unit cells with varying geometrical parameters. The novel design strategy presented in this work based on hyperbolic kirigami tessellations opens up new avenues toward auxetic and multistable mechanical metamaterials with broad applications spanning shape-morphing architectures, deployable space structures, and soft machines.},

Here, a base-mediated multicomponent polymerization strategy using readily available elemental sulfur, aromatic diamines, and aromatic dialdehydes is developed to synthesize unprecedented polybenzothiazoles with scalability. By efficient alkaline activation of substrates through nucleophilic sulfurization-cyclization cascades, this method enables economically viable kilogram-scale production in a one-pot process with high yields (73–98%) and monomer universality, including previously incompatible electron-deficient aromatic amines. The resulting polybenzothiazoles unlock their long-overlooked potential in precious metal recovery, demonstrating selective, rapid, and efficient extraction (>99%) of gold (Au), palladium (Pd), and platinum (Pt) from ultra-trace concentrations (1 ppb) to complex matrices including surface water, e-waste, and spent catalyst leachates. Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic nitrogen (N)/sulfur (S) participation and π-conjugation in their fused heterocycles govern metal coordination selectivity and redox stability. This work establishes a practical yet versatile platform to advance polybenzothiazoles from synthesis to resource utilization, highlighting their transformative role in addressing critical challenges through adaptive material design and precious metal recovery.},

  abstract     = {Coating technology is widely used in diverse fields such as energy, healthcare, and aerospace because of the advantages of simple fabrication, low cost, stability, and customized functions. However, conventional coatings fall short in meeting the emerging demands due to their single functionality and non-responsiveness. Inspired by natural prototypes, microcapsule-based intelligent coatings (MICs) that exhibit remarkable responsiveness to external stimuli have been developed and used in various fields such as corrosion protection and anti-fouling. Comprehensively understanding the responsive mechanisms and optimization strategies of MICs can maximize their adaptability and flexibility, which are highly desired for their precise preparation and actual applications. Therefore, this review focuses on recent progress of MICs, varying from bioinspired designs, material selections, stimulus responses, and diverse applications, providing more inspiration to design advanced MICs. First, biological prototypes used in the fabrication of MICs are briefly introduced. Then, the material selections and stimulus responses of MICs, as well as their advantages and disadvantages are emphasized. Later, applications are focused according to their functions, including anti-corrosion, anti-fouling, self-lubricating, and temperature regulation. Finally, the scientific challenges and prospects in designing MICs, focusing on the requirements of developing new structures using machine learning and achieving new applications, are highlighted.},

In contrast, BioBridge designs an Inductive-Associative pipeline inspired by the workflow of scientists who base their accumulated expertise on drawing insights into novel drug-target pairs from weakly related references. BioBridge predicts novel drug–target interactions using limited sequence data, incorporating multi-level encoders with adversarial training to accumulate transferable binding principles. On these principles basis, BioBridge employs a dynamic prototype meta-learning framework to associate insights from weakly related annotations, enabling robust predictions for previously unseen drug-target pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BioBridge surpasses existing models, especially for unseen proteins. Notably, when only homologous protein binding data is available, BioBridge demonstrates robust efficacy for virtual screening of the epidermal growth factor receptor and adenosine receptor, underscoring its potential in drug discovery.},

However, techniques for flexible dual-modal sensors mainly rely on integrating multiple sensing units on a platform, thus inducing extra costs and complexities associated with the fabrication and data processing. In this paper, a flexible dual-modal sensor is presented, which contains only one sensing unit, i.e., single-crystalline silicon-based diode, for the real-time, independent, and continuous monitoring of light and temperature. Operation modes for photodetection and temperature sensing of the flexible dual-modal sensor are switchable by controlling the biased condition. In addition, both experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that the crosstalk between light and temperature can be conveniently decoupled by short-circuit current and forward current of silicon-based diodes. Finally, the flexible dual-modal sensor is implemented as a platform to realize the continuous monitoring of photoplethysmography (PPG) and skin temperature of fingertips. These presented results offer paths to the construction of multifunctional, flexible bioelectronic devices or integrated platforms for biomedical uses.},

To explain the difference in attitudes toward AI agents, existing research has primarily focused on environmental factors. However, evolutionary psychology research suggests that the mechanism of outgroup rejection has a genetic basis, highlighting the need to explore the potential genetic underpinnings of negative attitudes toward AI agents as an outgroup in human society. This study examines the genetic basis of negative attitudes toward AI agents and their relationship with related personality traits, using a twin study design to assess negative attitudes toward AI agents, victim sensitivity, and moral preferences. Univariate genetic analyses revealed significant heritability of these negative attitudes. Bivariate analyses further identify shared genetic influences between victim sensitivity and personal-level fear and wariness toward robots. Similarly, a shared genetic basis is observed between the moral preferences concerning authority and sociotechnical blindness anxiety toward AI agents. These findings extend the understanding of social cognition in AI agents by emphasizing the role of genetic factors in shaping attitudes toward them. Moreover, they provide new insights for enhancing public acceptance of AI agents and optimizing human-machine interactions.},

  abstract     = {Modeling complex semiconductor fabrication processes such as Ohmic contact formation remains challenging due to high-dimensional parameter spaces and limited experimental data. While classical machine learning (CML) approaches have been successful in many domains, their performance degrades in small-sample, nonlinear scenarios. In this work, quantum machine learning (QML) is investigated as an alternative, exploiting quantum kernels to capture intricate correlations from compact datasets. Using only 159 experimental GaN HEMT samples, a quantum kernel-aligned regressor (QKAR) is developed combining a shallow Pauli-Z feature map with a trainable quantum kernel alignment (QKA) layer. All models, including seven baseline CML regressors, are evaluated under a unified PCA-based preprocessing pipeline to ensure a fair comparison. QKAR consistently outperforms classical baselines across multiple metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE), achieving a mean absolute error of 0.338 Ω·mm when validated on experimental data. Noise robustness and generalization are further assessed through cross-validation and new device fabrication. These findings suggest that carefully constructed QML models can provide predictive advantages in data-constrained semiconductor modeling, offering a foundation for practical deployment on near-term quantum hardware. While challenges remain for both QML and CML, this study demonstrates QML's potential as a complementary approach in complex process modeling tasks.},

  abstract     = {Interfacial instability in aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) leads to uncontrolled dendrite growth and water-induced parasitic reactions, limiting their practical applications. In this work, a novel superhydrophobic HfO 2 -coated functionalized glass fiber separator is proposed. Characterized by its high dielectric constant, HfO 2 can autonomously generate an oriented electric field under external electric field stimulation, ensuring uniform distribution of the electric field and Zn 2+ flux at the interface. This strategy not only enhances Zn 2+ transport kinetics but also effectively suppresses the migration of SO 4 2− via electrostatic repulsion. Furthermore, the HfO 2 @GF separator promotes the deposition of Zn 2+ along the Zn (100) and Zn (002) crystal planes, facilitating the preferential exposure of the unique Zn (101) crystal plane. Additionally, its superhydrophobic property effectively inhibits interfacial side reactions. Therefore, the symmetrical cell exhibits an ultra-long cycling life of 4660 h at 5 mA cm −2 and 1 mAh cm −2 , and maintains stable operation up to 5050 h at 10 mA cm −2 . The Zn||I 2 full battery maintains 87.75% of its initial capacity after 8000 cycles at 10C. Furthermore, the stacked Zn||I 2 pouch battery provides an Ah-level capacity (1.64 Ah). This work provides a new insight into the construction of highly stable interfacial chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Gold is an effective catalyst for low-temperature CO oxidation, yet its mechanism remains debated. Among the various proposed mechanisms, increasing attention has been given to a possible electrochemical pathway in recent studies. Here, experimental evidence is reported that CO oxidation at room temperature in electrolytes proceeds via coupled electrochemical CO oxidation and oxygen reduction half-reactions, i.e., the mixed-potential-driven mechanism. A model system is designed with deposited Au nanoparticles (NPs) and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO) on carbon paper acting as spatially separated electrodes in a single electrolysis cell. After shorting the two electrodes, the reaction current and mixed potential of the overall CO oxidation are measured without any externally applied bias. Independent current–potential curves for each half-reaction are also obtained under identical experimental conditions. The intersection points of these curves, representing the predicted mixed potential and net current, showed good agreement with the values measured in the short-circuited system. These results provide clear evidence that CO oxidation in aqueous media proceeds via a mixed-potential-driven mechanism, analogous to corrosion. This finding provides strong support for the hypothesis that low-temperature CO oxidation over-supported Au catalysts in the presence of water vapor proceeds via a similar electrochemical pathway in gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis.},

Moreover, LiTFSI ionic liquids are introduced into the healable poly(dimethylsiloxane) to prepare a transparent healable compliant electrode (PHT-IL) that does not obscure the light emission of PHT-ZnS:Cu dielectric elastomer. Then, an integral healable DEA (ISDEA) with an excellent interfacial interaction is constructed by coating two sides of PHT-ZnS:Cu with PHT-IL. The optimized ISDEA displays an actuated strain of 17.0% at 15 kV mm −1 with a healing efficiency of 91.9%. The integrated ISDEAs are used as soft anti-counterfeiting labels and soft intelligent keyboards for information transmission, encryption, and human-machine interaction, showing prospective applications in the realm of data leakage prevention and personal privacy protection.},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this maturation are not yet fully understood. In this study, YTHDC1 is identified as a key positive regulator of hepatocyte maturation and an essential factor in maintaining liver homeostasis. YTHDC1 expression increases in the liver after birth, and hepatocyte-specific deletion of Ythdc1 impairs hepatocyte maturation, leading to reduced liver weight, liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. These defects contribute to the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. YTHDC1 supports postnatal hepatocyte maturation and liver function by enhancing the expression of key transcription factors, FOXA1 and FOXA2, at the posttranscriptional level through m 6 A recognition. Restoring FOXA1 or FOXA2 expression mitigates the phenotypic defects observed in Ythdc1 -HKO mice. Mechanistically, YTHDC1 binds to the m 6 A regions of Foxa1 and Foxa2 mRNAs, promoting their expression. These findings reveal a mechanism by which YTHDC1 regulates hepatocyte maturation.},

Here, the label-free and non-invasive detection of multiple tau variants dynamics across developmental stages, age-related variants, and various APOE isogenic genotyes is presented to investigate the APOE –tau axis using human cerebral organoids (hCOs) combined with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Principal component analysis (PCA) of SERS signals successfully identifies four developmental stages of hCOs: embryonic body, neuronal differentiation, maturation, and maintenance phases. Temporal dynamics of age-related tau protein secretion are observed, reflecting characteristics associated with AD, which are diminished by astrocyte expression. PCA-based dimensionality reduction of SERS signals further reveals distinct clustering for different APOE isogenic genotypes, with tau protein secretion increasing from APOE2/E2 to APOE4/E4 , providing direct insight into the APOE –tau axis in AD. This study introduces a novel method for the non-invasive clinical assessments of disease conditions, dynamics, and the relationship between APOE and tau in AD.},

  abstract     = {The conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a promising strategy for obesity treatment. It is previously identified βFaar as a conserved long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) regulator of islet β-cell function in individuals with obesity, but its effect on WAT browning is not well understood. In this study, it is discovered that βFaar expression in adipose tissue markedly decreases with the progression of obesity in both mice and humans. βFaar in adipose tissue reduces lipid droplet (LD) size in WAT and promotes a browning phenotype in inguinal WAT (iWAT), leading to the amelioration of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. These effects can be attributed to crosstalk between βFaar and proteins within the master regulatory pathways of LD formation and WAT browning, including RAS oncogene family 18 (RAB18) and interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4). Specifically, βFaar inhibits LD swelling by binding to RAB18 and promoting IRF4 nuclear translocation, increases uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) transcription, and further induces iWAT browning by binding to karyopherin subunit alpha 6 (KPNA6). Together, these results demonstrate the critical roles of βFaar in regulating iWAT browning and preserving metabolic health; thus, βFaar may be a potential therapeutic target for management of obesity and related disorders.},

  abstract     = {Engineering functional 3D tissue constructs is essential for developing advanced organ-like systems, with applications ranging from fundamental biological research to drug testing. The generation of complex multicellular structures requires the integration of external geometric and mechanical cues with the ability to activate genetic programs that regulate and stimulate cellular self-organization. Here, it is demonstrated that gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels serve as effective matrices for 3D cell culture, supporting both in situ genetic manipulation and cell growth. HEK293T cells embedded in GelMA remained viable and proliferated over 16 days, forming clusters within the matrix. Efficient gene delivery is achieved in the 3D hydrogel environment using both plasmid DNA and mRNA as gene vectors. Furthermore, in situ prime editing is applied to induce permanent genetic modifications in embedded cells. To achieve spatially confined gene expression, gel-embedded channels are introduced that allowed localized stimulation via doxycycline perfusion through a Tet-On system. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating gene delivery, inducible expression, and spatial control within GelMA-based hydrogels, establishing a versatile framework for engineered 3D cell systems with programmable genetic activity.},

  abstract     = {Syngas production through CO 2 electrochemical reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) has attracted numerous attention for reducing carbon emissions and increasing chemical feedstocks. However, the precise regulation of H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas remains a challenge, especially through simple and feasible methodologies. In this work, a novel composite electrocatalyst, copper-indium/black phosphorus ( CuIn/BP ) is developed, using a simple one-step co-reduction method for efficient CO 2 RR. It is found for the first time that there is a linear relationship between BP content in CuIn/BP and the H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas. Consequently, the H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas can be precisely tailored by simply adjusting the BP content in CuIn/BP . A total faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO and H 2 reached ≈ 100% along with a current density of 135.2 mA cm −2 . Mechanistic studies suggest that the CuIn phase and Cu 3 P species are in situ generated in CuIn/BP , where the CuIn phases mainly contribute to CO generation, while the Cu 3 P species promote H 2 formation. The variation in BP content modulates the proportion of the CuIn phase and Cu 3 P species, leading to the variations in H 2 /CO molar ratios. Thus, this study provides an efficient and simple strategy to tailor the H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas for various industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Green hydrogen, produced via renewable-energy-driven water electrolysis, is among the most promising new energy carriers. Ru is a potential catalyst for this purpose; however, its strong hydrogen binding strength results in poor reaction kinetics, limiting its application potential. Creating a new Ru structure by introducing a second element is crucial for optimizing its catalytic performance. However, only a few studies have explored this approach, leaving the understanding of how chemical composition influences Ru's structure and catalytic activity elusive. Here, a systematic study is reported on Si decoration of Ru, achieving a tunable local environment around Ru and optimized reaction kinetics. By constructing a Ru-SiO x interleaved Turing-patterned structure, the ratio of Si coordinated to Ru is tuned by well-designed selective etching. With increasing Si content, the H-binding strength on the Ru center is progressively weakened, resulting in a V-shaped trend in hydrogen production activity. The optimized sample exhibits a low overpotential of 21 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in alkaline solution, along with a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec −1 , surpassing the performance of commercial Pt/C. This study establishes a valuable framework for optimizing the surface properties and catalytic activity of noble metals.},

Typically, the various rate constants are obtained by numerically fitting of the photoluminescence (PL) decay, but it is overlooked whether or not the solution of such a fit is unique. Using an analytical model, it is demonstrated that for typical TADF emitters only the sum of k S and k ISC , and the sum of k T and k rISC can be uniquely obtained from the transient PL decay and PL quantum yield (PLQY) experiments. Depending whether nonradiative losses stem from singlets or triplets, various combinations of k T and k rISC , k S and k ISC can be used to obtain the same transient PL decay, while keeping the PLQY constant. The only exception is the case of unity PLQY that allows for a direct determination of all relevant kinetic rates from just a single transient PL measurement. It is further shown that additional PL measurements in oxygen atmosphere with complete triplet quenching are redundant, since the results can be explicitly predicted from PL measurements in inert atmosphere. Using the TADF emitter CzDBA with a PLQY as high as 90% as a model system, it is demonstrated that by a combination of PL decay, PLQY, and OLED device modeling it is possible to quantify all the individual kinetic rates. For CzDBA neat film with PLQY as high as 90%, the majority of nonradiative losses stems from triplets, showing it is vital to conduct comprehensive studies on the molecular origin of nonradiative losses in the future.},

However, achieving uniform and stable coverage of the textured silicon substrate with hole-selective layer (HSL) remains a significant challenge. Herein, a HSL material, DPAICz ((indolo[2,3-a]carbazole-11,12-diylbis(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis(phosphonic acid)), is reported specifically designed for textured silicon substrate. Compared to the typical HSL material 2PACz, DPAICz features a π-expanded conjugated core and multiple anchoring groups, forming a split-standing configuration with anchoring groups positioned on opposite sides, resulting in superior anchoring stability on textured substrate under external stimuli. Moreover, DPAICz exhibited a larger molecular dipole moment and a more pronounced p-type characteristic, enhancing the interfacial hole extraction efficiency. Consequently, wide-bandgap (1.68 eV) perovskite solar cells employing DPAICz as the HSL achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.42%. Introducing the DPAICz into monolithic silicon/perovskite tandem solar cells greatly improved their performance, achieving a remarkable PCE of 32.55% in 1 cm 2 area. Importantly, the unencapsulated tandems based on DPAICz exhibited significantly enhanced long-term operational stability, retaining 96% of its initial PCE after 880 h of continuous 1-sun light soaking at 45 °C under open-circuit condition.},

Solid-state memristive devices, such as crossbar arrays and percolated nanoparticle (NP) networks, already demonstrate these properties. However, closer similarity to neural networks is expected from liquid-state systems, including polymer melts, which remain largely unexplored. Here, the resistive switching in silver/poly(ethylene glycol) (Ag/PEG) nanofluids, prepared by depositing gas-aggregated Ag NPs into PEGs of varying molecular mass, is investigated. These systems form long-range conductive NP bridges with reconfigurable resistance states in response to an electric field. The zeta-potential of Ag NPs and molecular mobility of PEG determine the prevalence of low resistance (ohmic) state, high resistance states (poor conductance) or intermediate transition states governed by space-charge-limited conduction or electron tunneling. The occurrence of these states is given by the interparticle gaps, which are determined by the conformation of PEG molecules adsorbed on the NPs. It is presented, for the first time, an equivalent circuit model for the Ag/PEG system. These findings pave the way to adopt polymer melts as matrices for neuromorphic engineering and bio-inspired electronics.},

Understanding the structure-property relationship is essential for the realization of their use in spintronic, valleytronic, and optoelectronic applications. Herein, after the high pressure-temperature synthesis of 3R-MoS 2 in a large volume cubic press, a concomitant experimental and theoretical high-pressure study of 3R-MoS 2 is reported, leading to the discovery of pressure-induced reversible isostructural phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Concurrent with the isostructural transitions, a semiconductor-to-metal transition is observed, owing to strong interlayer interaction and charge redistribution across the van der Waals gap under pressure. The pressure-induced enhancement of interlayer interactions together with the robust intrinsic layer stacking in 3R-MoS 2 prevent the layers from sliding under pressure and hinder a corresponding volume collapse. This study on continuous pressure-tuning of crystal and electronic structure in 3R-MoS 2 will play a vital role in developing the next-generation devices involving coupling of structural, optical, and electrical properties of 3R-polytypes of TMDs and other layered materials.},

However, achieving this heterogeneity within a single material remains a significant challenge. Here, a strategy to engineer spontaneously generated heterogeneous surface and bulk structures within a material is introduced. The resulting material is termed phase-separation and underwater reconfiguration-enhanced (PURE) elastomers. PURE elastomers integrate the high elasticity of the bulk with superior immunocompatibility at the surface. By de novo designing the immunomodulatory and alkyl acrylate monomer structures, this is regulated that the copolymer's spatial configurations, ultimately influencing its condensed structure. Tuning the alkyl side chain length facilitates the formation of a distinctive phase-separation pattern in elastomers that accommodates large deformations, resulting in excellent toughness and low hysteresis. Moreover, this phase structure supports a water-induced surface phase reconfiguration, aligning with in vivo applications. This reconfiguration enriches immunomodulatory groups at the material surface, significantly enhancing immunocompatibility. Consequently, these elastomers exhibit extremely low fibrotic capsule formation for up to one year in mice and two months in non-human primates. This findings introduce a class of durable, fibrosis-resistant materials and establish a new strategy for designing heterogeneous polymeric elastomers with broad biomedical applicability.},

FemXpress performs robustly on both simulated and real datasets, without requiring parental genomic information, and can also identify genes that escape XCI. Applying FemXpress to single-cell RNA-Seq data from multiple tissues of a cynomolgus monkey, we reveal heterogeneity in XCI origin across organs and cell types. In each organ, we identify candidate XCI-escaping genes, and within each cell type, we observe gene expression differences associated with XCI origin, potentially contributing to phenotypic variability. Furthermore, FemXpress demonstrated strong performance in phasing XCI in scRNA-Seq datasets from embryos and colon tumors. In summary, FemXpress provides a powerful approach for XCI status analysis, offering new insights into XCI dynamics at single-cell resolution.},

However, the practical application of traditional ceramic aerogels is constrained by their inherent mechanical brittleness. Herein, a strategy is proposed to customize mechanically tunable aerogels by armoring ceramic nanounits with pyrolytic carbon (PyC). The PyC encapsulating layers with various thicknesses are transformed into ductile tights or rigid armors, facilitating the mechanical customization of BN@PyC aerogel from superelasticity to rigidity across scales. Interestingly, the PyC armor imparts unique versatility to the aerogel, including flame retardancy, elastic response conductivity, and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, owing to the thermal stability of the PyC armor, the BN@PyC aerogel maintains its mechanical integrity even after high-temperature thermal treatment, and exhibits an unexpected resistance to butane torch ablation. Integrating mechanical stability, high-temperature resistance, and multifunctionality, BN@PyC aerogels offer new possibilities for scalable applications in extreme environments. This facile strategy of armoring brittle ceramic aerogels with PyC provides a novel reference for customizing the mechanical properties of multifunctional aerogels.},

The key advancement lies in the stable polarized interface created by the ionogel, which enables rapid charging and high charge retention, leading to a significant instantaneous power within the first few raindrops and achieving an 8-fold increase in saturation performance over conventional design. The harvester only requires 25 droplets to reach saturation and maximum electrical output, achieving an impressive power density of 235.11 W m −2 and a conversion efficiency of 6.77%, being the highest recorded for ionogel and hydrogel-based droplet energy harvesters. Additionally, the adhesive nature of the ionogel enhances the device's stability and versatility in varying energy generation and steam leakage applications. This work advances the pursuit of sustainable energy harvesting by bridging materials science with practical application.},

This review explores the unique optical properties and tunable characteristics of these complexes, which enable effective reactive oxygen species generation and near-infrared light absorption for targeted cancer cell destruction. Metal-ligand complexes are classified based on their ligands and metal ions. The ligands include tetrapyrrolic structures, polypyridine, and polyphenols, while the metal ions comprise transition and noble metals. Their individual contributions to enhancing therapeutic efficacy are also explored. Fundamental interactions, including ligand-to-metal charge transfer and metal-ligand coordination, are examined. These interactions significantly influence the photoreactivity and biocompatibility of the complexes. Recent advances integrating metal-ligand complexes with other modalities, such as chemo-phototherapy and immunotherapy, are highlighted. These combinations offer promising approaches for synergistic tumor eradication. The challenges of ligand diversity, delivery optimization, and the underexplored mechanisms in PAT are also discussed. By integrating recent progress and prospective applications, this review emphasizes the critical importance of metal-ligand complexes in innovating cancer theranostic technologies.},

Here, it is reported that downregulation of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15B) significantly correlated with poor outcomes in patients with KRAS mut -PDAC. Mechanistically, KRAS mut /ERK1-elicited phosphorylation of ABHD17C promotes depalmitoylation and membrane-to–cytoplasm translocation of ALOX15B, facilitating proteasome-dependent degradation of ALOX15B via interaction with the E3 ligase complex CUL4/DDB1/DCAF10. Notably, treatment with methyl protodioscin (MPD), a steroid saponin primarily purified from polygonatum sibiricum rhizome, restored the S-palmitoylation and membrane location of ALOX15B via disruption of the ABHD17C/ALOX15B interaction, consequently resulting in significant inhibition of growth rate of patient-derived KRAS mut -PDAC organoids in vitro and KRAS mut -PDAC-formed tumor in vivo via induction of ferroptosis. Therefore, these findings unveil a prominent role of ferroptosis evasion in KRAS mut -PDAC progression and highlight the potential of targeting KRAS/ERK1/ABHD17C/ALOX15B axis in KRAS mut -PDAC treatment.},

Conventional hydrovoltaic nanogenerators are constrained by their limited power density and suboptimal long-term stability. Therefore, a transpiration-driven electrokinetic power generator (TEPG) based on silk yarn coated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/divinyl sulfone (DVS) and designed as a wearable hydrovoltaic nanogenerator offering outstanding power generation efficiency and water stability is presented in this study. Given its hydrophilic surface, mechanical durability, and high aspect ratio, silk yarn is used to design a yarn-based TEPG system to achieve high spatial-efficiency and maximize volumetric power density. Furthermore, the covalent crosslinking agent, DVS, is introduced to sustain the long-term, high-power production efficiency of PEDOT:PSS. The devised yarn-type TEPG system generates a maximum power of 112 µW cm −3 with artificial sweat. A system comprising 25 yarn-type TEPGs arranged in a series–parallel configuration is implemented utilizing the high spatial-efficiency of the sewable yarn-type TEPG.

  abstract     = {Incorporating conductive nanomaterials into polymers yields a new class of piezoresistive strain-sensing materials. While possessing monotonic resistance-strain behavior is a fundamental requirement for any material used for strain sensing, polymer nanocomposites frequently exhibit nonmonotonic resistance responses under strain, which limits their application prospects. In this study, physical experiments and molecular dynamics simulations are performed to determine a feasible solution to overcome this limitation. The corresponding results demonstrate that regulating the initial inter-nanofiller junction geometry imparts complete control over the monotonic piezoresistive behavior of polymer nanocomposites. Mechanistically, monotonically increasing resistance responses under tension can be achieved by promoting active diffusion that causes van der Waals force-driven barrier crossing of nanofillers (resulting in direct contact between nanofillers, e.g., at elevated curing temperatures) during curing; thus, during deformation, nanofillers primarily move away from one another. Conversely, suppressing diffusion during curing causes barrier crossing of nanofillers, which results in resistance reduction, under deformation owing to stress-driven local rearrangement of polymer molecules in heterogeneous shear transformation zones. The mechanistic insights provided by this study can guide the design of next-generation, advanced strain-sensing materials in the future.},

However, while Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) 2 mediated H3K27me3 clearly contributes to the formation of repressive chromatin loops in Arabidopsis , the role of PRC1 mediated H2Aub remains unclear. Notably, in the Arabidopsis genome, H2Aub and H3K27me3 marks do not always co-localize, and some regions are marked exclusively by H2Aub, but the contribution of these only-H2Aub regions to chromatin looping remains largely unexplored. By using Capture-High-throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture (C-Hi-C) to specifically enrich interactions associated with H2Aub regions, it is find that H2Aub loops are preferentially established between two H2Aub enriched regions. Although pure only-H2Aub-loops can be detected, H2Aub regions tend to interact with regions marked by both H2Aub and H3K27me3, contributing to the formation of PcG hubs. Furthermore, it is find that maintaining appropriate level of H2Aub and H3K27me3 is essential for the stability of H2Aub loops and that the formation of these loops reinforce gene repression.

Without confirming the identifiability of these parameters, model predictions may be unreliable, limiting their usefulness for understanding biological mechanisms or informing experimental and clinical decisions. In this paper, a novel mathematical framework is proposed for practical identifiability analysis in dynamic models. Starting from a rigorous mathematical definition, it is proved that practical identifiability is equivalent to the invertibility of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). The relationship between practical identifiability and coordinate identifiability is further established, introducing an efficient metric that simplifies and accelerates identifiability assessment compared to traditional profile likelihood methods. To address non-identifiable parameters, new regularization terms are incorporated, enabling uncertainty quantification and improving model reliability. Additionally, an optimal experimental design algorithm is developed to ensure all parameters are practically identifiable from collected data. Applications to Hill functions, neural networks, and biological models demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed framework in uncovering critical biological processes and identifying key observable variables.},

This study introduces AntiBMPNN, an advanced deep-learning framework that leverages an antibody-specific 3D dataset, a fine-tuned message-passing neural network (MPNN), a frequency-based scoring function, and AlphaFold 3 to achieve highly accurate antibody sequence design. AntiBMPNN surpasses ProteinMPNN with a perplexity of 1.5 and over 80% sequence recovery. Its scoring function, combined with AlphaFold 3, effectively prioritizes sequences based on structural recovery, positional stability, and biochemical or complex properties. Experimental validation highlights a 75% success rate in single-point antibody design. AntiBMPNN consistently outperforms AbMPNN, AntiFold, and ProteinMPNN in designing complementarity determining regions (CDR) 1-3, yielding stronger binding affinities. For CDR1 of huJ3 (anti-HIV nanobody), it achieves a half maximal effective concentration (EC₅₀) of 9.2 nM (nanomolar), better than ProteinMPNN (135.2 nM) and AntiFold (59.3 nM), and comparable to AbMPNN (6.6 nM). For CDR2 of the D6 nanobody (targeting CD16), AntiBMPNN reaches 0.3 nM, outperforming AbMPNN (2.3 nM), AntiFold (0.7 nM), and ProteinMPNN (0.7 nM). In CDR3 of huJ3, it achieves 1.7 nM, surpassing AbMPNN (51.2 nM), with no detectable activity from AntiFold or ProteinMPNN.

Spinodal decomposition, a mechanism of phase separation, can result in a highly interconnected pore morphology, though controlling this process is difficult in practice, limiting its application for in vitro models. Here, a straightforward method is introduced for dynamically halting the phase separation of a gelatin methacryloyl and poly(vinyl alcohol) (GelMA-PVA) polymer blend in the context of a biofabrication process based on dynamic interface printing (DIP). This is enabled by a novel approach based on the concerted application of acoustic mixing and photocuring to structure the pore size, orientation, and interconnectivity in hydrogels. This approach accordingly enables spatially addressable fabrication of 3D hydrogel architectures, with the potential to enhance the functionality of engineered tissues via tailored microenvironments.},

  abstract     = {Food-grade lipid nanoparticles (FLNs) have been widely used as functional carriers of various nutrients and clinical drugs; however, the potential for FLNs to induce substantial biological effects is often overlooked. Here, it is found that FLNs are first delivered to the early endosomes and then preferentially fused with lipid droplets (LDs) after entering the cells through endocytosis. This process leads to a notable LDs accumulation, which in turn triggers autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway. The cascade ultimately promotes tumor cell growth and invasion. However, autophagy inhibition while FLNs treatment counteracts these effects and further causes mitochondria damage, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and excessive LDs accumulation, eventually leading to cell apoptosis. This indicates a potential anti-tumor strategy. The animal tests further demonstrate that intratumoral injection of FLNs together with an autophagy inhibitor (3-MA) effectively suppresses tumor angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis without harming normal cells in mice, confirming a promising and safe anti-tumor strategy of applying FLNs under autophagy inhibition conditions. The findings represent a substantial step forward in comprehending the biological effects of biomedical carriers.},

Consequently, the development of suitable intratumoral microbiota analysis methods is crucial. Although matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) involves straightforward operations and provides precise results, the “direct smear method” limits the identification of bacterial subspecies. Furthermore, the issue of inadequate quantification with MALDI MS renders it unsuitable for direct analysis of intratumoral bacteria. To address these challenges, a novel ionic liquid in this study is employed, called norharmane conjugated to 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Nor@DHB) for the direct detection of intratumoral bacteria using MALDI MS. Because gram-negative bacteria are dominant within cancer cells, lipid A is selected as the chemical fingerprint for bacterial identification. The results demonstrated that using Nor@DHB can enhance the lipid A signal by an order of magnitude and achieved a good linear relationship within a concentration range of 0.01–80 ng mL −1 . Here, this method is successfully applied to the direct analysis of lipid A in actual clinical samples. Subsequent machine learning and nomogram models further confirmed the correlation between characteristic lipid A ions and LC patient clinicopathological features, which are further validated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments.},

Positive correlations between Gal3 expression and renal fibrosis are observed in both DKD patients and mice.

Genetic ablation of Gal3 globally or specifically in macrophages, as well as pharmacological inhibition of Gal3, significantly attenuated kidney fibrosis in diabetic mice. Mechanistically, macrophage-derived Gal3 interacted with TGFβ receptor2 (TGFBR2) and Pro-TGFβ1, preventing TGFBR2 proteasomal degradation in fibroblasts and increasing TGFβ1 levels in the diabetic kidney.

While these motifs are known to modulate phosphorylation efficiency, their quantitative impact on target site phosphorylation within long intrinsically disordered substrates remains largely unexplored. Using NMR spectroscopy, JNK1-dependent phosphorylation of JIP1, a 450-amino acid disordered substrate, is investigated, identifying eleven phosphosites with distinct phosphorylation efficiencies. By selectively disrupting JNK1 binding to the D- and F-motifs of JIP1, the determinants of phosphorylation efficiency are uncovered. Specifically, it is found that the D-motif selectively enhances phosphorylation in the C-terminal direction in a length-dependent manner, impressively increasing the phosphorylation efficiencies of sites located at sequence distances exceeding 120 amino acids, while the F-motif primarily promotes phosphorylation of a site located immediately N-terminal to the F-motif. Additionally, docking-site-independent phosphorylation is observed, whose efficiency is dictated by the intrinsic sequence preference of JNK1, as inferred from motif scores derived from positional scanning peptide arrays. The work highlights how docking site motifs and sequence context synergistically regulate phosphorylation efficiency, emphasizing the critical role of substrate architecture in determining MAPK-mediated signaling outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant advances in the synthesis of biomimetic materials, the scalable fabrication of high-performance bulk materials under ambient conditions remains a formidable challenge— particularly when it comes to achieving rapid processing while preserving superior mechanical properties. Herein, inspired by nacre's “brick-and-mortar” structure, this work develops an energy-efficient approach that utilizes ice-templating technology as the structure framework and carbon mineralization for rapid CaCO 3 production, resulting in a strong yet tough carbon mineralized material (CMM) while also fixing CO 2 . This material replicates both the hierarchical microstructure and chemical composition of nacre. By precisely controlling the freezing dynamics with dual temperature gradients, this work creates an ordered lamellar skeleton composed of γ-dicalcium silicate (γ-C 2 S). The rapid, in situ carbon mineralization under mild conditions generates interspersed CaCO 3 grains within this structure, which are then infiltrated with gelatin to form a nacre-like CMM with exceptional mechanical properties. The resulting material exhibits a flexural strength of 45 MPa (eight times that of a cement-hydrogel composite) and a fracture toughness of 2.03 MJ m −3 (a 20-fold improvement over unmodified CMM), while maintaining a density of only 1.2 g cm −3 . The enhanced performance stems from multiscale toughening mechanisms, including crack deflection, secondary crack formation, and strong interfacial bonding, all of which facilitate efficient energy dissipation. This work establishes a new paradigm for designing high-performance synthetic materials through the synergistic integration of biomimetic principles with carbon mineralization, offering promising applications in the development of sustainable infrastructure and carbon neutrality.},

  abstract     = {Effective management of postoperative pain and wound healing presents significant challenges in clinical settings, driving the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. The analgesic and wound healing effects of hydrogen (H 2 ) have gradually been recognized; however, the lack of efficient hydrogen delivery systems remains a major limitation. This study introduces a novel transdermal drug delivery system, which utilizes sustained-release photothermal microneedles (MNs) to ameliorate incisional pain and accelerate wound healing. Polydopamine (PDA)-modified ZIF-8@ammonia borane (AB) nanoparticles with photothermal conversion properties are designed, along with temperature-responsive QX-314-loaded polycaprolactone (PCL) microspheres for controlled release, which are delivered in vivo by dissolvable MNs. In vitro results showed that PDA@ZIF-8@AB nanoparticles can release H 2 continuously for up to 5 days in an acidic microenvironment, while the photothermal properties of PDA facilitated controlled release of QX-314 through 6 cycles of near-infrared (NIR) exposure. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the MN system provided sustained analgesia for up to 5 days and promoted wound healing in the acidic microenvironment of postoperative incisions. Upon NIR exposure, the photothermal conversion of PDA activated membrane ion channels and induced thermally triggered deformation of PCL@QX-314 microspheres, allowing for on-demand release of QX-314 and targeted neuronal uptake, thus offering personalized analgesia. In vitro cell experiments and in vivo studies confirmed the biocompatibility of the system. This innovative approach not only highlights the dual role of H 2 in pain relief and wound healing but also provides a new personalized treatment strategy for postoperative pain management with promising clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {Radiotherapy-radiodynamic therapy (RT-RDT) has emerged as a promising approach due to its remarkable anticancer efficacy. However, hypoxic tumor microenvironment and insufficient energy deposition severely reduce the radiotherapy outcomes. Herein, lonidamine (LND)-loaded Fe(III) metal-Pt(II) porphyrin framework (FPTM-LP) is designed for radiosensitization through hypoxia alleviation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) amplification. Specifically, the high-Z element Pt effectively absorbs X-ray photons to generate •OH for RT while transferring X-ray energy to porphyrin (TCPP), which stimulates the generation of 1 O 2 for RDT. Moreover, by the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, the weak acidity and glutathione (GSH)-responsive release of LND achieves O 2 economization, which promotes the generation of ROS and stabilizes DNA damage. Intriguingly, Pt(II)TCPP exhibits the capability of O 2 concentration-dependent near infrared luminescence imaging-guided RT-RDT. Moreover, the decomposition of FPTM-LP under high concentration of GSH generates large amounts of Fe 2+ , leading to the augmented production of •OH via Fenton reactions. In brief, this work presents a radiosensitizer with a unique and efficient mechanism of self-monitoring hypoxia alleviation and increasing ROS levels for enhanced cancer RT-RDT. The radiosensitization potency of FPTM-LP is confirmed in tumor-bearing mice in vivo, proclaiming a new strategy for enhancing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing side effects.},

  abstract     = {Carbon dots (CDs) have elicited attention in photodynamic antimicrobial applications, but their susceptibility to aggregation limits their effectiveness. Herein, CDs@ZIF-8 nanocomposites are synthesized. The results reveal that they have superior dual photodynamic enhanced antimicrobial properties, specifically 7.63 log 10 CFU mL −1 (lg) elimination for Escherichia coli (only 3.12 lg with CDs and 4.18 lg with ZIF-8) and 7.27 lg elimination for Staphylococcus aureus (only 4.17 lg with CDs and 2.94 lg with ZIF-8). Optoelectronic property analysis and density functional theory calculations show that the enhanced photodynamic antimicrobial properties of CDs@ZIF-8 can be attributed to their narrow bandgap and higher binding affinity for O 2 , which facilitates the photo-generated e − –h + pairs separation and promotes the generation of 1 O 2 and •O 2 − . Furthermore, the CDs@ZIF-8/polycaprolactone/ethyl cellulose nanofibrous films are prepared by microfluidic-blow-spinning, which have prominent antimicrobial properties and extend the shelf life of strawberries from 6 to 12 d.

Consequently, the D-A polymer PTZ-Pz shows a high specific capacity of 208 mAh g −1 . The electrode exhibits an ultra-long cyclability of more than 80 000 cycles, with an excellent rate performance of 116 mAh g −1 at 20 A g −1 . Benefiting from the fast kinetics, the PTZ-Pz cathode can operate well at a high mass loading of 44.2 mg cm −2 .

  abstract     = {Red mark syndrome (RMS) is a disease affecting rainbow trout. Although the precise etiology of this disease is still under debate, a Midichloria-like organism (MLO) is suspected as the triggering agent. RMS provokes characteristic skin lesions. Previous investigations pointed to a local immune response characterized by a B cell influx. To elaborate on these findings, here, this study extensively characterizes systemic and local B cell responses in RMS-affected fish. The local influx of IgM+ B cells to the skin lesions is confirmed, and a differentiation of these B cells to plasma-like cells is demonstrated. IgM repertoires suggested a polyclonal activation of local B cells and some trafficking between skin and head kidney. Finally, the fact that transcripts of the gene coding for MLO 16S rRNA are found in sorted skin IgM + B cells and non-IgM + skin leukocytes reveals the capacity of this intracellular bacterium to be internalized by B cells, where it may possibly directly interfere with intracellular pathways. The data significantly advances the knowledge on RMS and provides another example of a fish pathology in which fish B cells seem pivotal, possibly because of the specific ways in which teleost B cells intrinsically sense and respond to pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Obesity is increasingly recognized as a negative prognostic factor for cancers, including osteosarcoma. However, the mechanisms linking obesity to chemoresistance in osteosarcoma remain unclear. This study found obesity is significantly associated with poor responses to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in osteosarcoma patients. In vitro, adipocyte-conditioned medium (Adi-CM) induced cisplatin resistance, while peritumoral adipocytes and diet-induced obesity (DIO) reduce the cisplatin efficacy in vivo. Mechanistically, Adi-CM enhanced DNA repair by the PARP1/ATM pathway activation. Proteomic analysis identified A1BG, a secreted protein upregulated in adipocytes from chemoresistant patients, as a key mediator of this effect. A1BG depletion in adipocytes restored cisplatin sensitivity, whereas recombinant A1BG enhanced resistance and promoted DNA repair. Further investigation revealed a direct interaction between A1BG and NAMPT, leading to the stabilization of NAMPT and an increased NAD + production. This enhanced PARP1 activity and subsequent DNA repair. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of NAMPT and PARP1 using FK886 and Olaparib, respectively, reversed Adi-CM-induced cisplatin resistance and restored cisplatin sensitivity in osteosarcoma cells, DIO mouse models, and patient-derived organoids. A novel link between obesity and cisplatin resistance in osteosarcoma is established, highlighting the A1BG/NAMPT/PARP1 axis as a critical driver. Targeting this axis may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for overcoming obesity-associated chemoresistance in osteosarcoma.},

The role of migrasomes in endothelial-immune interactions remains unclear. This study explores migrasome evolution in the atherosclerotic (AS) microenvironment, highlighting their function as amplifiers in the inflammatory cascade. Through analysis of ApoE −/- mouse models and single-cell multi-omics data, migrasome activity is mapped using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) algorithms. Co-culture systems and anti-Cluster of differentiation 74 (CD74) blocking experiments are employed to investigate immune-metabolic reprogramming triggered by migrasome cargo signaling. Advanced imaging and functional studies demonstrated that the interaction between amyloid protein precursor (APP) ligands on endothelial cells and CD74 receptors on macrophages triggers endothelial cells to produce more migrasomes. The clinical relevance of these findings is confirmed through CD74 blocking experiments, which effectively disrupted migrasome-mediated signaling and attenuated atherosclerotic progression. Importantly, migrasome content is positively correlated with the severity of atherosclerosis. These results fundamentally challenge existing paradigms of intercellular communication by establishing migrasomes as dual-functional entities – serving both as biomarkers of endothelial stress and molecular drivers of immune microenvironment deterioration. The discovery of the “migrasome-APP-CD74” signaling network opens new avenues for developing organelle-targeted therapies to interrupt the vicious cycle of vascular inflammation.},

However, the mechanisms regulating ID1 ubiquitination in ESCC are not well understood. This study identifies TRIM21 as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets ID1 for K11-linked ubiquitination at lysine 91. Unlike typical ubiquitination that marks proteins for degradation, TRIM21-mediated K11 ubiquitination does not affect ID1 stability. Instead, it disrupts the ID1-TCF12 interaction, releasing TCF12 to activate SLC31A1, a copper transporter. Elevated SLC31A1 expression increases intracellular copper, inducing cuproptosis and inhibiting ESCC cell proliferation and tumor growth. Functional assays show that overexpressing TRIM21 suppresses ESCC progression, while TRIM21 knockdown promotes growth. Clinically, low TRIM21 expression correlates with advanced disease stage and poorer patient survival rate, underscoring its prognostic value. Additionally, Sorafenib treatment upregulates TRIM21, enhancing ID1 ubiquitination, increasing SLC31A1 expression, and inducing cuproptosis. These findings uncover the TRIM21-ID1-TCF12-SLC31A1 axis as a critical pathway in ESCC progression, suggesting that targeting this axis with Sorafenib can offer a promising therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor growth and improving patient outcomes.},

This study conducted a comprehensive prognostic meta-analysis involving 2,968 patients with diffuse glioma and established a comprehensive machine learning framework with nested resampling of 18 machine learning algorithms, and developed the Immune Glioma Survival Signature (IGLoS). This signature, comprising CCL19, ICOSLG, IL11, PTGES, TNFAIP3, and TRAF3IP3, has been demonstrated to predict survival outcomes across a range of cancers and to correlate with tumor progression at the level of multi-omics.

Furthermore, siRNA screening has underscored the critical role of TRAF3IP3 in modulating PDL1 expression and immune pathways, with implications on the ERK pathway and NFATC2 involvement. Through single-cell analysis of published and in-house datasets, TRAF3IP3 exhibited selective enrichment in NPC-like and MES-like tumor cells, and showed a dual functionality in mediating T-Cell Exhaustion.

  abstract     = {Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is one of the significant characteristics of poor prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), strongly associated with high mortality rates. Immunotherapy has emerged as a crucial treatment modality for OSCC LNM, yet its limited response rate severely restricts its clinical application. Cuproptosis, a newly discovered immunogenic cell death (ICD), is often hindered by lipid metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, which also contributes significantly to the lack of response to immunotherapy. Herein, a metal-organic framework (MOF) nanodrug loaded with orlistat (ORL) is developed, designated as ORL@Cu-MOF. This nanodrug is designed to respond and release under the high glutathione (GSH) stimulus of the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby inducing cuproptosis and suppressing fatty acid metabolism in OSCC cells. In vivo, ORL@Cu-MOF effectively triggers cuproptosis and inhibits fatty acid metabolism, exerting antitumor effects in mouse models and remodeling the TME. Furthermore, the combination of ORL@Cu-MOF with programmed death receptor-1 (αPD-1) significantly enhances immunotherapy outcomes, transforming “cold tumors” into “hot tumors”. This study is the first to report the synergistic use of cuproptosis induction and fatty acid metabolism suppression in the treatment of metastatic cancer, offering novel insights for the care and management of LNM of OSCC.},

The screening focuses on a wide range of ferrite systems (M 1-x Fe x O y , M═Mn, Al, Mg, Co, Ni, 0.05< x< 0.95) and particularly underscores the (MgMnCo) 1-x Fe x O y system for its high oxygen capacity during redox cycles. Remarkably, (MgMnCo) 0.65 Fe 0.35 O y achieves state-of-the-art turnover number and a higher theoretical solar-to-fuel efficiency of 43.6% compared to benchmark ceria at 17.4%. CALPHAD-based thermodynamic analysis and spectroscopic electronic structure analysis reveal that the excellent redox performance of this material is attributed to the simultaneous contributions of Fe and Mn cations. This dual active feature is discovered for the first time in any ferrite cycles to the best of available knowledge, offering significant opportunities to explore new multi-cation ferrite systems in the related research field. In addition, the screening methodology employed here can potentially be extended to other thermochemical processes.},

  abstract     = {Optimizing the morphology of the active layer is crucial for achieving high photovoltaic conversion efficiency in all-polymer solar cells (APSCs). Solvent vapor annealing (SVA) is an essential post-treatment strategy for controlling active layer morphology. However, most current SVA are conducted ex situ, limiting their ability to accurately reveal the morphological evolution of active layers of APSCs. In this study, in situ synchrotron radiation GIWAXS and in situ UV–vis spectroscopy combined with GISAXS is used to monitor the morphological evolution of PM6/PY-IT blends during the SVA process in real-time. Results showed that the PY-IT absorption peak exhibited a red shift under a nonpolar carbon disulfide vapor, while a blue shift is observed during the SVA process with a polar chloroform vapor. The SVA process can be divided into three stages: solvent swelling, recrystallization, and molecular rearrangement. For thermally pre-annealed samples subjected to chloroform SVA, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased by 15.1%. The improved PCE stems from reduced crystal plane spacing (d-spacing), enhanced crystal coherence length, and optimal phase separation via SVA. Pre-annealing suppresses excessive swelling, emphasizing the reordering dynamical role in the morphology of APSCs. This study offers insights into balancing SVA conditions to maximize performance and minimize adverse effects.},

  abstract     = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from a breakdown in the symbiotic relationship between the intestinal commensal microflora and the mucosal immune system. Non-toxigenic Bacteroides fragilis , a common human colon symbiote, has been shown to alleviate colitis. However, the underlying mechanisms of this alleviation remain incompletely understood. Herein, it is demonstrated that promoting the secretion of B. fragilis outer membrane vesicles (Bf OMVs+ ) enhances its ability to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, while inhibiting B. fragilis OMV secretion (Bf OMVs− ) reduces this effect. Bf OMVs+ alleviates colitis by inhibiting neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. Further, B. fragilis OMVs (Bf-OMVs) are isolated and extracted, then administered them intraperitoneally to DSS-induced colitis mice, observing that Bf-OMVs can target intestinal tissues, the spleen, and bone marrow, and they are internalized by neutrophils to inhibit NET formation, thereby alleviating colitis. The expression profile of miRNAs in Bf-OMVs is assessed, revealing that Bf-OMVs are enriched with mmu-miR-like sRNA, miR-5119, which targets and inhibits PD-L1, leading to the suppression of GSDMD-mediated NET release and promoting the proliferation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), culminating in the alleviation of colitis. These findings provide new insights into the role of B. fragilis OMVs in the pathogenesis and treatment of IBD.},

Despite its potential relevance, the role of this interaction in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unexplored due to the lack of effective molecular tools. To address this, we employed SRiApt, an aptamer generated through the recently established Blocker-SELEX pipeline. Its biological stability is improved by phosphorothioate modifications to form PT f -SRiApt. Using this aptamer, the critical role of the SCAF4-POLR2A interaction in driving TNBC tumor growth and immune regulation is uncovered. PT f -SRiApt effectively inhibits tumor growth and induces cell cycle arrest in TNBC cells with elevated SCAF4 and POLR2A expression. Additionally, PT f -SRiApt promotes premature mRNA termination, boosting antigen presentation and promoting T-cell infiltration. Analysis of patient samples further confirmed the negative correlation between SCAF4-POLR2A interaction and the effectiveness of immunotherapy, highlighting the potential of PT f -SRiApt in improving immune efficacy. Together, the work provides a powerful tool not only for dissecting previously “undruggable” protein-protein interactions but also for enhancing tumor immunogenicity and reshaping the tumor microenvironment.},

Activation of nociceptors in acute inflammatory pain (AIP) significantly reduced sleep by 45–50% in the first 6 h, with reduced sleep spindle density for 1–3 h post-AIP. Additionally, an “optogenetic pain (Opto-Pain)” model is implemented to produce acute peripheral pain-induced awakenings that reduced sleep comparable to AIP. Both pain models are used to test the role of wake-promoting neurons in the parabrachial nucleus that express Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (PBel CGRP ) in relaying nociceptive stimulus from the dorsal horn as part of the spine-ponto-amygdaloid tract. Blocking PBel CGRP neurons with genetic ablation or optogenetic inhibition attenuated sleep loss. To dissect the PBel CGRP pathways, the terminals are then optogenetically silenced post-AIP and found the reversal of sleep disturbances in the following descending order of effectiveness: substantia innominata of the basal forebrain (SI-BF) > central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) > bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) > the lateral hypothalamus (LH). In SI-BF and CeA, a similar reversal of AIP-induced sleep loss occurred with pharmacological blocking of either CGRP or NMDA receptors.

While tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) mediate intercellular communication, their role in shaping TAMs phenotypes and function remains unclear. This study explores how TNTs facilitate the transfer of tumor-derived materials, particularly fatty acids, to TAMs, affecting macrophage polarization and function. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified heterogeneous macrophage subpopulations in the TME. Enrichment analysis pinpointed key substances transferred via TNTs. Lipidomics and metabolomics analyzed the fatty acids involved. In vitro and in vivo experiments validated TNTs-mediated material transfer, and transcriptomic analysis revealed the associated signaling pathways. TNTs are the primary route for transferring tumor-derived fatty acids, notably arachidonic acid (AA), to macrophages. This transfer reprogrammed TAMs from anti-tumor CD5L + to pro-tumor TREM2 + phenotypes, increasing CCL18 secretion, reducing phagocytic activity, and impairing CD8 + T cell proliferation. Mechanistically, AA activated the PI3K-AKT pathway, driving TAMs polarization. These findings are confirmed in xenograft models, where TNTs-induced TAMs exhibited enhanced pro-tumor properties. TNTs-mediated transfer of tumor-derived AA reprograms TAMs via PI3K-AKT activation, promoting immune suppression and tumor progression, highlighting TNTs and PI3K-AKT as potential therapeutic targets in iCCA.},

  abstract     = {Pulmonary vascular remodeling, which current therapeutic targets fail to alleviate disease severity, plays a key role in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Irisin is identified as a protective factor involved in regulating inflammation and oxidative stress, but its role in PAH remains unknown. To investigate, plasma irisin levels and its local pulmonary artery expression are measured in patients with PAH and mouse models. Irisin expression is significantly decreased in patients with PAH and PAH mouse models. Furthermore, overexpression and exogenous injection of irisin effectively alleviate hemodynamic and right-heart function in PAH mouse models, meanwhile, it also reverses proliferation and cell cycle progression of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). To illustrate the mechanism of irisin exerts on PAH, Enolase 1 is identified as a key irisin-interacting protein. Irisin suppresses proliferation of PDGF-induced PASMCs by promoting ubiquitination status of Enolase 1 via E3 ligase of down regulated protein 4 in neural precursor cell development. Co-immunoprecipitation and molecular docking analyses verifies the interaction and binding sites between irisin and its interactive proteins. Overall, these findings suggest that, irisin is a novel protective factor downregulated in PAH. By ubiquitination, irisin promotes Enolase 1 degradation and suppresses cell proliferation and pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH.},

In this work, we propose using large language models (LLMs) to learn vulnerability evaluation from historical assessments of medical device vulnerabilities in a single manufacturer's portfolio. We highlight the effectiveness and challenges of using LLMs for automatic vulnerability evaluation and introduce a method to enrich historical data with cybersecurity ontologies, enabling the system to understand new vulnerabilities without retraining the LLM. Our LLM system integrates with the in-house application—Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS)—to help Siemens Healthineers (SHS) product cybersecurity experts efficiently assess the vulnerabilities in our products. Also, we present a comprehensive set of experiments that helps showcase the properties of the LLM and dataset, the various guardrails we have implemented to safeguard the system in production, and the guidelines for efficient integration of LLMs into the cybersecurity tool.},

VATE is designed to autonomously analyze and correct student errors in mathematical problem-solving using advanced large language models (LLMs). By incorporating student draft images as a primary input for reasoning, the system provides fine-grained error cause analysis and supports real-time, multi-round AI—student dialogues. In this extended version, we introduce a new snap-to-solve module for handling low-reasoning tasks using edge-deployed LLMs, enabling faster and partially offline interaction. We also include expanded benchmarking experiments, including human expert evaluations and ablation studies, to assess model performance and learning outcomes. Deployed on the Squirrel AI platform, VATE demonstrates high accuracy (78.3%) in error analysis and improves student learning efficiency, with strong user satisfaction. These results suggest that VATE is a scalable, cost-effective solution with the potential to transform educational practices.},

  abstract     = {According to an industry survey, many people miss opportunities to apply for government subsidy programs because they do not know how to apply. People also need to search manually and check whether these programs are suitable for them. To address this issue, our study developed a new generative recommender system with both users' information and government subsidy documents. Within our recommender system framework, we modify the existing Residual Quantization Variational Auto-Encoder (RQ-VAE) model to capture deep and abstract information from subsidy documents. Using semantic IDs generated for approximately 185,610 user click-stream histories and 240,000 documents, we train our recommender system to predict the semantic IDs of the next subsidy policy documents in which a user might be interested. In 2024, we successfully deployed our generative recommender system in Wello, a Korean Gov-Tech startup. In collaboration with the Korean government, our generative recommender system helped enhance program effectiveness by saving $7.8 million in unused funds and achieved $27.4 million in advertising efficiency gains. Also, Wello observed a 68% improvement in Click-Through-Ratio (CTR), increasing from 41.4% in the third quarter of 2024 to 69.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024. We thus anticipate that our generative recommender system will have a significant impact on both individuals and the government.},

Our approach encompasses three key elements: (1) a hierarchical “severity” framework for incident detection that identifies and categorizes errors while attributing component-specific error rates, facilitating targeted improvements; (2) a scalable and principled methodology for benchmark construction, evaluation, and deployment, designed to accommodate multiple development teams, mitigate overfitting risks, and assess the downstream impact of system modifications; and (3) a continual improvement strategy leveraging multidimensional evaluation, enabling the identification and implementation of diverse enhancement opportunities. By adopting this holistic framework, organizations can systematically enhance the reliability and performance of their AI Assistants, ensuring their efficacy in critical enterprise environments. We conclude by discussing how this multifaceted approach opens avenues for various classes of enhancements, including human-AI collaborative evaluation, paving the way for more robust and trustworthy AI systems.},

My research seeks to directly address this challenge by enabling AI systems to interact with humans to learn aligned and robust behaviors. The way robots and other AI systems behave is often the result of optimizing a reward function. However, manually designing good reward functions is highly challenging and error-prone, even for domain experts. Although reward functions are often difficult to manually specify, human feedback in the form of demonstrations or preferences is often much easier to obtain but can be difficult to interpret due to ambiguity and noise. Thus, it is critical that AI systems take into account epistemic uncertainty over the human's true intent. As part of the AAAI New Faculty Highlight Program, I will give an overview of my research progress along the following fundamental research areas: (1) efficiently quantifying uncertainty over human intent, (2) directly optimizing behavior to be robust to uncertainty over human intent, and (3) actively querying for additional human input to reduce uncertainty over human intent.},

The selection of any one of multiple underway watercraft for patient exchange is complicated by participating aircraft utilization histories and participating watercraft positions and velocities. The selection problem is modeled as a semi-Markov decision process with an action space, including both fixed land and moving watercraft exchange points. Monte Carlo tree search with root parallelization is used to select optimal exchange points and determine aircraft dispatch times. Model parameters are varied in simulation to identify representative scenarios where watercraft exchange points reduce incident response times. We find that an optimal policy with watercraft exchange points outperforms an optimal policy without watercraft exchange points and a greedy policy by 35% and 40%, respectively. In partnership with the United States Army, we deploy for the first time the watercraft exchange point by executing a mock patient transfer with a manikin between two HH-60M medical evacuation helicopters and an underway Army Logistic Support Vessel south of the Hawaiian island of Oahu. Both helicopters were dispatched in accordance with our optimized decision strategy.},

Far from a gradual evolution, its sudden emergence has jolted educational institutions, leaving many academics grappling with a perceived encroachment upon their intellectual domain. This upheaval has sparked intense debates, with concerns ranging from the erosion of academic integrity to the devaluation of scholarly labor. This essay contends that such apprehensions, while understandable, may overlook the transformative potential of AI as a collaborative tool. Drawing parallels to historical disruptions—such as the advent of photography challenging traditional art forms—we explore how AI can augment human creativity rather than supplant it. By examining the dynamics of authorship, originality, and accountability, we argue for a redefinition of these concepts in the context of AI-assisted work. Emphasizing the importance of human oversight in guiding AI outputs, we advocate for a framework that recognizes the symbiotic relationship between human intellect and machine efficiency. Such a perspective not only preserves the essence of academic rigor but also embraces the democratization of knowledge production. Ultimately, this essay calls for a balanced approach that mitigates risks while harnessing the innovative capacities of generative AI in academia.},

Building upon this, this article transcends the traditional binary judgment model and constructs a tiered copyright determination model. Based on the level of human control and contribution in the AI generation process, it introduces dimensions such as technological controllability and density of human intent, classifying generative AI into three tiers: strong protection, weak protection, and non-protection. Regarding the copyrightability of content generated by generative AI, this article argues that the issue should be addressed within the framework of copyright law itself.

  abstract     = {Electrochemical random-access memory (ECRAM) devices are a promising candidate for neuromorphic computing, as they mimic synaptic functions by modulating conductance through ion migration. However, the use of a thick electrolyte layer (>40 nm) in conventional ECRAMs leads to an unavoidable tradeoff between synaptic weight updates and operating speed. To address this problem, a Cu-based ultrathin ECRAM (UT-ECRAM) that uses a single 5 nm HfO x active layer and a ≈1.2 nm AlO x liner is designed. The highly efficient gate-tunable fast Cu-ion transport in the AlO x /HfO x UT-ECRAM enables 1) near-ideal linearity in weight updates (0.45) even achieved with a pulse width ( t w ) of 50 μs, 2) dynamic multilevel retention of 10 4 s, and 3) reliable cycling endurance of 10 4 cycles. A numerical analysis based on device scaling quantitatively reveals that a relatively high concentration of field-driven Cu ions (≈10 20 cm −3 ) contributes to each synaptic weight update per gate voltage ( V G ) pulse in the UT-ECRAM without becoming deactivated by traversing thicker layers. This improved gate sensitivity can ultimately overcome the linearity and the ratio/speed tradeoff relationships, paving the way for robust neuromorphic synaptic units.},

Recent achievements have integrated legged mobility with manipulation capabilities, yet the accuracy of end-effector trajectory tracking remains a challenge, which is crucial for practical applications. This study proposes an innovative approach that integrates coordinated trajectory generation with decoupled tracking control to enhance the accuracy of end-effector trajectory tracking. This approach also expands the end-effector's workspace and improves the smoothness of the robot's movements. The trajectory optimization-based coordinated trajectory generator leverages the active motion of the quadruped's body to produce smooth movements. Meanwhile, the decoupled tracking control models the robotic arm and quadrupedal robot as independent floating-base systems, incorporating interaction forces to enhance the overall system's tracking accuracy. Finally, a series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully perform a variety of trajectory-tracking tasks, reducing the root mean squared error by 82.7% compared to independent control in the stance mode, and cutting additional computational overhead by 53.4% compared to the unified control.},

  abstract     = {Heart failure (HF) is a major clinical and public health problem. Cardiac assist devices are crucial treatment modalities for end-stage HF, but they still face limitations, such as direct blood contact and high power consumption. We present a lightweight (<60 g), compact, electroactive polymer (EAP)-based cardiac assist device (E-CAD) as a nonblood-contacting, low-power alternative to address these limitations. E-CAD consists of EAP units paired with negative bias springs (NBSs), mounted on a flexible sleeve that wraps around the heart to assist in cardiac compression. The device is designed to be biomimetic to match the regionally varying mechanical stiffness of the heart. Benchtop silicone phantom and ex vivo porcine tests demonstrated E-CAD's ability to increase volume displacement by 1.21-fold in benchtop tests with a silicone phantom and 1.17-fold in ex vivo settings, along with an associated increase in ejection fraction, compared to cases without the device. Furthermore, it operates on low power (<0.3 W), enabling a compact design with a thin driveline (outer diameter = 0.3 mm), which reduces infection risk. In summary, we showed that EAP-based direct cardiac compression was feasible with low power demand. The improvement in cardiac output may translate into clinical benefits for advanced HF patients.},

  abstract     = {Collecting detailed information from trees via hovering with an aerial robot is both energetically inefficient and often infeasible in dense forest canopies. Perching on trees offers a promising solution by enabling prolonged observations with reduced energy consumption. To overcome perching location limitations, in this article, a bird-inspired passive perching mechanism specifically optimized for vertical tree trunks is proposed. Similar to the tail action of treecreepers ( Certhiidae family) when perching on vertical tree trunks, the proposed aerial robotic platform perches on tree surfaces using a main clawed gripping mechanism combined with a supporting “tail” mechanism featuring arrays of embedded microspines. To cope with the complex curvature of tree trunks, adaptive elastic joints that allow the mechanism to passively contact the tree's surface are introduced. By incorporating the region of attraction for the mechanism, the aerial platform is designed to be more reliable during perching maneuvers by adjusting angular movement, thereby defining suitable initial velocities and accelerations for achieving stable equilibrium. The proposed system is validated in a motion capture environment using vertical trunks with diameters ranging from 40 to 220 mm, and further demonstrates in outdoor perching tests. Results confirm the feasibility of dynamic perching on vertical tree trunks under realistic forest conditions.},

Although the application of liquid metals (LM) and their composites has improved the stretchability of various tactile sensors, there remains a considerable gap between the performance of current flexible tactile sensors and human skin, attributed to their limited sensitivity and narrow working range. In this work, a liquid metal droplet (LMD)-based flexible tactile sensor that achieves both high-pressure sensitivity of 3 × 10 −2 kPa −1 and a wide working range from 50 Pa to 1.2 MPa is proposed. The novel sensor consists of an LMD array in which each pair of droplets is connected by an electrolyte solution within the polydimethylsiloxane microchannel grid. It is demonstrated that the 2-LMD sensor is capable of detecting human motion and physiological signals, while the electrical impedance tomography-based 3.5 × 3.5 cm sensor can detect the shape and position of single-point, multipoint, and other complex contact using only eight evenly distributed electrodes along the sensor's edge. These findings highlight the promising potential of the sensors in future robotic and wearable electronic applications.},

This mechanism allows soft robots to perform rhythmic movements. A mathematical model is developed to describe the self-excited oscillations of the jet hose. Numerical simulations are conducted to analyze the impact of various parameters on system oscillations. The system operates under pressures from 90 to 150 kPa. By adjusting the pressure, hose length, and jet hole diameter, the oscillation frequency of the pressure can be tuned between 5.9 and 11.1 Hz. The comparison between simulation results and experimental data verifies the correctness of the mathematical model. Finally, a soft robot capable of crawling based on anisotropic friction is designed and fabricated. Powered solely by the soft pneumatic pressure regulation system, the robot achieves self-rhythmic crawling.

  abstract     = {6D object pose estimation, a critical component in computer vision and robotics domains, involves determining the 3D location and orientation of an object relative to a canonical reference frame. Recently, the widespread proliferation of RGB-D sensors has precipitated a marked increase in interest towards 6D pose estimation leveraging RGB-D data. A deep bidirectional fusion network is developed, DBF-Net, achieving efficient yet accurate 6D object pose estimation. Specifically, a sparse linear Transformer (SLT) with linear computation complexity is introduced to effectively leverage cross-modal semantic resemblance during the feature extraction stage, such that it fully models semantic associations between various modalities and efficiently aggregates the globally enhanced features of each modality. Once acquiring two feature representations from two modalities, a feature balancer (FB) based on SLT is proposed to adaptively reconcile the importance of these feature representations. Leveraging the global receptive field of SLT, FB effectively eliminates the ambiguity induced by visual similarity in appearance representation or depth missing of reflective surfaces in geometry representations, thereby enhancing the generalization ability and robustness of the network. Experimental results demonstrate that DBF-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art works by nontrivial margins across multiple benchmarks.

For comprehensive control of roll, pitch, yaw, and longitudinal velocity, an augmented-twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (A-TD3) algorithm streamlines the training of the control agent. It enables adaptation to large-range attitude variations using small-scale training data, thereby reducing computational costs for diverse missions. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach: A-TD3 improves training speed by 30.8% while mitigating issues such as excessive rudder motion, poor operability, and high energy consumption across different missions. The attitude control experiments on the X-AUV prototype validate that A-TD3's control performance with PID method.},

  abstract     = {Materials science has traditionally relied on a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical modeling to discover and develop new materials with desired properties. However, these processes can be time-consuming, resource-intensive, and often limited by the complexity of material systems. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, has revolutionized materials science by offering powerful tools to accelerate the discovery, design, and characterization of novel materials. AI not only enhances the predictive modeling of material properties but also streamlines data analysis in techniques like X-Ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and electron microscopy. By leveraging large datasets, AI algorithms can identify patterns, reduce noise, and predict material behavior with unprecedented accuracy. In this review, recent advancements in AI applications across various domains of materials science, including spectroscopy, synchrotron studies, scanning probe and electron microscopies, metamaterials, atomistic modeling, molecular design, and drug discovery, are highlighted. It is discussed how AI-driven methods are reshaping the field, making material discovery more efficient, and paving the way for breakthroughs in material design and real-time experimental analysis.},

Owing to their inherent nonlinearity, nanomechanical systems constitute an interesting technology to serve as reservoir. While RC platforms are built using microelectromechanical systems, the energy efficiency, response time, and footprint of these systems can be significantly improved by using nanoscale devices. Herein, the use of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) is investigated, which can be used in RC, utilizing inherent nonlinearities and the fading memory effect from the transient response of NEMS. The smaller size and higher operating frequencies of NEMS enable faster processing rates compared to micromechanical systems, while their compact footprint, low power consumption, and ability to operate under ambient conditions simplify integration into practical applications. In modified national institute of standards and technology (MNIST) handwritten digit–recognition test, this system achieves 90% accuracy with a 3.3 μs processing time per pixel. Also the effect of driving frequency and amplitude on NEMS classification accuracy is investigated using experiments and simulations and it is shown that no significant dependency in any of the parameters is observed. Herein, an estimate for energy consumption of core NEMS RC system on MNIST data is provided.

Traditionally, studies have focused on single-domain datasets. These approaches overlook the potential insights gained from integrating data across different domains. This research addresses this gap using a cross-domain dataset that includes building characteristics, energy usage, and environmental factors. Feature selection techniques, including filter methods (correlation, mutual information), wrapper methods (RFE), embedded methods (Lasso, Random Forest, and gradient boosting), and dimensionality reduction are used to identify the most significant features contributing to the energy efficiency of residential properties. These techniques identify the most significant features influencing energy consumption. The findings show that cross-domain features like energy consumption, CO 2 emissions, and heating cost play a key role in predicting energy performance. By integrating data from multiple domains, the feature selection process reveals areas for energy optimization that are previously overlooked in single-domain studies. The results provide valuable insights for energy consultants, building managers, and policymakers aiming to enhance energy efficiency in residential buildings. This research highlights the importance of cross-domain data integration and offers a robust framework for feature selection.

By positioning a vibrating microrobot on tissue surfaces, the resonant frequencies of the resulting vibrations are analyzed to create detailed elasticity maps. These maps reveal tumor margins and provide critical information about the tumor's properties spatially. This approach leverages the high spatio-temporal resolution and noncontact nature of LSCI to offer a minimally invasive elastography method for potential use in colonoscopy, providing an alternative to complex and time-consuming biopsy analysis and advancing future cancer diagnostics.},

These accelerators require a large network of synaptic elements with high degree of plasticity, high endurance, large integration density, and ultralow programing energy. Although emerging nonvolatile memories exhibit promising potential as synaptic devices, their widespread application in training accelerators is limited due to their low endurance and immature fabrication technology. In contrast, capacitor-less 1 transistor-dynamic random-access memories (1T-DRAMs) have recently emerged as lucrative alternative to the conventional (1T/1C) DRAMs owing to their high scalability and low footprint. Considering the high endurance, large integration density, and ultralow write energy of the 1T-DRAMs, in this work, for the first time, their potential is explored as synaptic elements for online learning. The proposed 1T-DRAM-based synaptic element exhibits multi-level capability (up to 6 bits), a large dynamic range (3.91 × 10 3 ), an ultralow energy, and an appreciable linearity for potentiation/depression. The 1T-DRAM-based synaptic element also exhibits a paired pulse facilitation with an exponential decay similar to the biological synapses.

Based on the clustering results, wake analysis is conducted to plan and optimize the operational strategy for each wind turbine cluster, resulting in a distributed optimization strategy for their operation. Additionally, simulation experiments are conducted on micrositing and time-varying wind conditions using real-world data from a wind farm in the Arua region. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the computational efficiency of wake optimization, while ensuring the effect of the wake optimization algorithm in actual wind farms as much as possible, which is more in line with the wake optimization needs of actual wind farms. The algorithm proposed in this article provides valuable insights into wind turbine operation and maintenance under time-varying conditions.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based learning method is propdosed for achieving the overall dynamic model of robot manipulators. Several sections, e.g., data acquisition, learning model, hidden layers, nodes, activation function, and data bandwidth, are designed to make the RNN-based learning method establish the overall dynamic model of the robot manipulators. The proposed method has a key point that the optimal data bandwidth can be obtained by the loss function and its derivative in the robot manipulators. Since the data bandwidth is set to be effective in learning process, it helps to provide high learning hit rate while significantly reducing time-consuming tasks caused by trial and errors in any robot manipulators. From these benefits, the proposed method offers a compact form and simplicity so that it can produce the convenience of practicing engineers in industrial fields. The effectiveness of the proposed one is verified through experiments with three scenarios, which is compared with that of the original data bandwidth in a real robot manipulator.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks could compare the difference among all samples (nodes in graph) and transmit the interrelationship among them to obtain a global landscape. Compared with radiomics and clinical feature-based machine learning methods, whether a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) based on radiomics and clinical features improve the performance in distinguishing benign and malignant pulmonary nodules is not well studied. We propose an approach based on multimodal GCNNs that integrates patients’ lung computed tomography images with clinical information to differentiate between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. Leveraging large-scale and multisource data from multiple hospitals (i.e., 6033/290/524 patients for three hospitals respectively) enhances the diversity of features. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) are used to evaluate the performance. We achieved the average accuracy/sensitivity/specificity/AUROC of 0.8612/0.9425/0.6786/0.9025 for the main dataset via the novel GCNN proposed, respectively, maintaining the robustness of the deep learning procedures. Especially for the external testing dataset (hospital 2/hospital 3), the specificity is much higher than comparison methods (0.6250–0.6731 vs. 0.2569–0.2788). The graph neural network-based deep learning method holds the potential to assist clinicians, aiding in treatment planning, patient management, follow-up strategies, resource optimization, and overall healthcare decision-making.},

As workspaces shrink, the need for precise autonomous manipulation in confined and isolated environments increases, particularly in areas such as electronics and biological assemblies. Herein, an autonomous, untethered, holonomic, mobile micromanipulator driven by piezoelectric actuators with nanometer resolution is developed. The micromanipulator comprises a driving circuit, single-board computer, battery, manipulator, and small camera; it is lightweight (515 g), compact (90 × 116 × 104 mm), and untethered, capable of independently operating in confined and dangerous spaces for humans. The micromanipulator can autonomously position a single object with a positioning error of 0.18 ± 0.51 mm and an angular deviation of −0.4° ± 1.2°, utilizing image recognition, machine learning, and visual feedback. Moreover, the micromanipulator is verified to function in extreme conditions that simulate draft chambers and clean benches, where it successfully performs circuit mounting in confined space. The device can arrange droplets under microscopy for applications in chemical and biomedical fields, demonstrating its versatility and precise positioning capabilities. Additionally, its multi-scale applications are explored from centimeters to sub-micrometers and adjusted to the magnification capabilities of various microscopes.},

Model fitting is slow, data intensive, and prone to error. Herein, a supervised machine-learning regressor is developed for transforming AFM force–distance curves into nanorheological behavior. The method reduces the computational time required to process a force volume of a cell made of 2.62 × 10 5 curves from several hours to minutes. In fact, the regressor increases the throughput by 50-fold. The training and the validation of the regressor are performed by using theoretical curves derived from a contact mechanics model that combined power–law rheology with bottom effect corrections and functional data analysis. The regressor predicts the modulus and the fluidity coefficient of mammalian cells with a relative error below 4%.},

However, its capability to reveal the underlying tissue properties remains underexplored. A physics-constrained learning framework is studied to reversely approximate tissue property representations from multiple B-mode images acquired with varying dynamic ranges. First, an extractor network is used to generate property maps, that is, attenuation coefficient α , reflection coefficient β , border probability ρ b , scattering density ρ s , scattering amplitude ϕ , and one perturbation p map characterizing the variations caused by varying dynamic range. The α − ϕ maps are loosely regularized by rendering them forward to realistic US images using ray-tracing simulator. To further enforce the physics constraints, a ranking loss is introduced to align the disparity between two estimated p maps with the discrepancy between two distinct inputs. Due to the missing ground truth α − ϕ maps, alternatively, the method is validated by evaluating the consistency between the feature maps inferred from distinct images. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can robustly extract consistent intermediate maps from images. Furthermore, one potential downstream application is showcased to perform realistic US augmentation by introducing specific noise into the physics-inspired α − ϕ maps.},

The gripper consists of pneumatically driven hierarchical adhesive modules (bio-toe) with the capability of contact sensing, and rolling inward/outward module (rolling module). The bio-toe manufactured using soft materials can safely and flexibly cater to curved and flat surfaces. The rolling module developed using four-bar linkage mechanism allows the opposing bio-toes to roll inward to enhance adhesion (adhesion forces up to 6.3 N on a flat surface and 23 N on an 18 m −1 curved surface) and roll outward to decrease the force in releasing (less than 3 N and especially less than 0.8 N on the flat surface). Embedded resistive strain gauges provide real time signals for the controller to determine the status of the bio-toe, such as bending, adhesion/release, and even adhesive contact rates, thereby allowing the gripper to autonomously approach, envelop, adhere to, and release objects of various shapes, with the potential for dynamic adhesion control in the future. The adhesive gripper equipped with adhesive contact sensing and biomimetic inward adhesion/outward release capabilities exhibits a broader grasping range and applicability in smart adhesive grabbing across industrial, agricultural, and human–robot interaction contexts.},

Augmented reality (AR) technology currently offers a solution to provide intuitive guidance. To enhance the AR user experience, an automated method for calibrating and dynamically registering deformable tissues is proposed. First, an automatic calibration method is proposed to help register the target tissue from the virtual to the real world. The calibration method is based on a 6D pose estimator, which is built on the feature-matching network, SuperGlue and the depth estimation network, Metric3D. Subsequently, a dynamic registration method is proposed to track the deformation of the target tissue in real-time. Moreover, a piece of cloth is utilized for four automatic calibration trials, resulting in a mean absolute error (MAE) of calibration accuracy at 3.79 ± 0.64 mm. The dynamic registration accuracy is also assessed by varying the deformation of the target, yielding an MAE of 6.03 ± 0.96 mm. Finally, an ex vivo experiment involving a piece of small intestine is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system, with an MAE of 3.11 ± 0.56 mm for AR calibration and 3.20 ± 1.96 mm for dynamic registration error.},

MultiMedRes addresses medical multimodal reasoning problems through three steps i) Inquire: The learner agent decomposes complex medical reasoning problems into multiple domain-specific sub-problems; ii) Interact: The agent engages in iterative “ask-answer” interactions with expert models to obtain domain-specific knowledge; and iii) Integrate: The agent integrates all the acquired domain-specific knowledge to address the medical reasoning problems (e.g., identifying the difference of disease levels and abnormality sizes between medical images). We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of difference visual question answering for X-ray images. The experiments show that our zero-shot prediction achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing fully supervised methods, which demonstrates that MultiMedRes could offer trustworthy and interpretable assistance to physicians in monitoring the treatment progression of patients, paving the way for effective human–AI interaction and collaboration.},

Vine robots, a type of continuum robot, offer a promising solution with their unique ability to evert, allowing them to navigate complex environments while reducing friction. This article presents a novel vine robot design powered by magnetic fluid. The fluid drives both vine growth through pressurization and enables precise steering and manipulation using external magnetic fields. Unlike previous designs, the robot's high magnetic volume ensures precise control even under pressure, while maintaining a fully soft structure. This allows for controlled needle movements during biopsies. Additionally, the robot achieves passive stabilization by pressing against surrounding walls. This stabilization, combined with magnetic forces, can exert up to 1.26 N of insertion force at the tip, enabling effective tissue penetration. Experiments are conducted with a 5 mm diameter, 145 mm long magnetic fluid-driven vine robot, demonstrating movement in free space, through narrow constrictions, and within phantoms modeled after human bronchial anatomy. These results pave the way for the robot's potential application in minimally invasive surgeries, particularly in difficult-to-access areas of the body.},

In this study, we used simplified heat transfer models based on the finite element method (FEM) to generate realistic simulation data. We developed a novel management system that integrates two trained artificial neural networks with deep and wide networks using hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction speed, a known limitation of FEM. The system predicts temperature variations at multiple points on the coil, enabling strategic placement that minimizes temperature deviations and enhances cooling uniformity. This real-time computational approach eliminates the necessity for additional cooling equipment and ensures high product quality. The system's efficacy was validated through case studies, revealing dynamic adjustments and optimized placements. The proposed system achieved a mean absolute error of 3.44 and a mean absolute percentage error of 0.24%, outperforming conventional regression techniques.

However, in most cases, human intervention remains essential for the healing process.

To address this gap, in this article, first, the different phases of the healing process in soft robotics are discussed and then the technologies that are or can be integrated into self-healing soft robots to allow each individual phase to be performed autonomously with minimal human involvement are reviewed. Finally, in this article, the challenges of integrating all phases into self-healing soft robots are discussed and the perspectives on achieving fully autonomous self-healing in the future are offered. These phases are classified into five: damage detection, damage cleaning, damage closure, stimulus-triggered material healing, and recovery assessment. Achieving these attributes requires employing physical intelligence at the material level through the use of stimuli-responsive materials or utilizing embodied intelligence at the system level by integrating healing-assistive subsystems or a synergistic combination of both. Consequently, self-healing soft robots can achieve self-sufficiency in their healing capabilities, rendering them a sustainable solution for broader applications.},

  abstract     = {Catalytic asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition of diynes represents an efficient and atom-economical strategy for the assembly of valuable chiral cyclic targets in a single step. However, this strategy traditionally relies on the cyclometallation process. Moreover, there are no versatile asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition methods for diynes that are compatible with C─C double/triple bonds and C─X double bonds. Here, we disclose a copper-catalyzed asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition of diynes via vinyl cations. This universal [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition is suitable for the asymmetric cycloaddition of diynes with various C─C double/triple bonds and C─X double bonds, leading to a range of valuable chiral hexahydropyrrolocarbazoles, tetrahydropyrrolocarbazoles, and tetrahydropyran[4,3-b]indoles in generally excellent yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol features the first asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition via vinyl cations, and constitutes the first construction of carbon stereocenters in triyne cyclization.},

Here, we report a hexatopic fluorescent building block with triangular antiprismatic geometry, developed via steric-hindrance-directed conformational control and the integration of triphenylamine units. Its imine condensation with linear diamines afforded two crystalline 3D COFs with unambiguously resolved 6-fold Class IIa interpenetrated pcu topology, as determined by continuous rotation electron diffraction. Interestingly, both COFs exhibit yellow-green solid-state fluorescence and high-contrast piezofluorochromism under hydrostatic conditions. This work introduces a new class of fluorescent polyhedral nodes to expand the structural diversity of fluorescent 3D COFs and highlights their potential as stimuli-responsive materials for interesting applications.},

  abstract     = {Despite quasi-2D perovskite light-emitting diodes (quasi-2D PeLEDs) having shown great potential in the fields of light emission and display, the uncontrollable crystallization processes and substantial defects of perovskite emissive layer still limit their further development. Herein, we reported the design and in-situ synthesis of A′-site cations with oxygen–phosphorus–nitrogen–carbon (O─P─N─C) frameworks in perovskite precursor solutions by incorporating diphenylphosphinic chloride (DPCl), a bifunctional molecule containing both P─Cl and P═O functional groups. The P─Cl groups undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions with the ammonium terminals of formamidinium (FA + ) and phenethylammonium (PEA + ) cations, yielding large A′-site cations that regulate crystallization kinetics during spin-coating. Concurrently, P═O groups coordinate with undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions at grain boundaries, passivating defects. This dual-functional mechanism synergistically optimized crystallization dynamic and suppressed non-radiative recombination, resulting in compact, low-defect perovskite films. Owing to their synergistic enhancement on device efficiency, the quasi-2D PeLEDs modified with DPCl exhibited a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.07%. This study provides a new strategy for tailoring perovskite materials through A′-site engineering, offering significant insights into the development of high-performance PeLEDs.},

Reaction of the reduced cluster [NEt 4 ] 4 [Fe 6 C(CO) 15 ] ( 1 ) with thiols (RSH) or disulfides (RSSR) affords novel functionalized hexa-iron carbide clusters [NEt 4 ] 3 [Fe 6 C(CO) 14 (SR)] (R = CH 3 , 2 ; C 6 H 5 , 3 ; p -C 6 H 4 CH 3 , 4 ; L -cysteine, L - 5 ; D -cysteine, D - 5 ). Compounds 2–5 have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), 1 H and 13 C{ 1 H} nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the molecular structures of 2–4 have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD). The chirality of the L -5 and D -5 enantiomers has been investigated by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), and this represents the first VCD study of chiral metal carbonyl clusters. Combined analyses of VCD and calculated density functional theory (DFT) spectra clearly point out the occurrence of chirality transfer from the chiral organosulfur ligand to the CO ligands, as indicated by the presence of VCD bands in the ν CO region of both L -5 and D -5 . This unprecedented transfer of chirality among different ligands arises from close interactions between the CH 2 and CH hydrogens of coordinated cysteine and the CO shell of the clusters.},

  abstract     = {Narrowband organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains rare due to significant high-frequency vibronic coupling in T 1 →S 0 electronic transition, where T 1 and S 0 represent the lowest triplet excited state and ground state, respectively. Here, we report coronene-derived ( CoDe ) luminophores exhibiting ultra-narrowband RTP (full width at half maximum FWHM = 11.2 nm) with a 1.5 s lifetime and 38% afterglow efficiency in a phenyl benzoate (PhB) matrix. The narrow emission arises from enhanced coupling with low-frequency vibrational modes in localized excitation (LE) states, as supported by vibronic simulations. Under high-power excitation, the CoDe -PhB further exhibits organic long-persistent luminescence (OLPL) lasting over 40 min (FWHM = 14.7 nm), governed by a two-photon ionization-induced charge-separation mechanism. The materials are processable via melt-casting and excitable by ambient or white light, offering practical utility for high-color-purity afterglow display and lighting applications. This work establishes low-frequency vibronic engineering as a new route to narrowband RTP and OLPL emitters beyond conventional multi-resonance-based designs.},

  abstract     = {To address the inherent limitations of layered cathodes in terms of stability, kinetics, and energy density, a high-entropy superlattice layered oxide (K 0.7 Mn 0.4 Li 0.1 Co 0.125 Ni 0.125 Fe 0.125 Cu 0.125 O 2 , KMNCFCL 0.1 ) is proposed as a cathode for K-ion storage. High-entropy composition and [Li─O─K] configuration coupled with Cu─O covalency and local CuO 6 distortion trigger and stabilize lattice oxygen redox through the anionic–cationic redox inversion, essentially a premature ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), thereby alleviating potential issues of severe voltage hysteresis and capacity fade by restraining oxygen release and cation migration. Superior phase stability and strain tolerance with a solid-solution mechanism benefited from high-entropy stabilization, and “cocktail” effects can be successfully achieved by eliminating serious structural evolutions induced by Jahn–Teller (J–T) lattice distortion, O─O repulsion, and intercalation of electrolyte molecules. Furthermore, the enlarged interlayer spacing and disrupted K + /vacancy ordering facilitate rapid K-ion migration with a low diffusion barrier. Therefore, KMNCFCL 0.1 delivers a high energy density of 327.8 Wh kg −1 , superior cyclic stability with a long lifespan of over 300 cycles, and excellent rate capability. This research opens up new possibilities for achieving groundbreaking cathodic functionality in potassium layered oxides.},

  abstract     = {Aminophosphines have emerged as promising phosphorus candidates for the synthesis of InP quantum dots (QDs), offering an alternative to traditional tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphine. However, the relatively low reactivity of conventional aminophosphines has led to broader size distribution, resulting in higher full-width at half-maximum (FHWM) with lower photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we introduce a new aminosphosphine, bis(bis(trimethylsilyl)amino) phosphine (P[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 H), to address this issue. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate the direct nucleophilic activation of the P[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 H with InCl 3 , leading to the rapid nucleation of InP QDs at a relatively lower synthesis temperature. This enabled to achieve InP/ZnSeS/ZnS QDs with near-unity PLQY and a FWHM of 48 nm. These findings suggest a new chemistry for the synthesis of InP QDs, and could be extended to other III-V QDs for advanced optoelectronic applications.},

The 4.0 Å-spaced copper polyphthalocyanine (CuPPc-4.0) delivers a remarkable urea yield rate of 460.0 mmol h −1 g −1 with 26.1% Faradaic efficiency at −1.3 V (versus RHE), outperforming wider-spaced analogs. The optimal 4.0 Å cavity spatially confines reactants and intermediates, matching urea's molecular dimensions (3.5 Å), thereby enhancing C–N coupling and urea synthesis activity, while the layered AA stacking structure stabilizes unbonded diatomic Cu configurations, preventing aggregation and ensuring durability. Mechanistic studies reveal that while ball-milling treatment increases single-atom exposure, it disrupts the layered architecture and eliminates interlayer diatomic sites, reducing activity by about 50%.

The aeration energy consumption can reach tens of times higher than the energy required for the electrochemical reactions themselves. To address this, we developed an aeration-free dual-cathode system featuring a natural oxygen-harvesting electrode (NOHE). The NOHE's superhydrophobic and microporous structure effectively captures and utilizes anode-generated oxygen for H 2 O 2 synthesis (957.1 mg g cat −1 ) without external aeration. By decoupling H 2 O 2 generation and activation into separate cathodes, the system optimizes both processes independently, achieving superior efficiency. This design demonstrated rapid removal of bisphenol AF (BPAF) in saline environments, achieving 98% mineralization and exhibiting excellent operational stability over 90 h continuous use. By eliminating energy-intensive aeration, our approach may open the avenue for a scalable, sustainable solution for in situ water remediation, with broad applicability in diverse aquatic environments.},

  abstract     = {Flexibility is considered one of the most critical features of framework materials, playing a vital role in applications such as adsorption and separation. Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) exhibit unique flexibility derived from their weak, reversible hydrogen-bonding interactions; however, realizing controlled and functional flexible behavior in HOFs remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we report a flexible hydrogen-bonded organic framework, HOF-FJU-119 , constructed from an anthracene-core, that exhibits multimode guest-responsive behavior. Upon activation, HOF-FJU-119a undergoes distinct gate-opening transformations in response to CO 2 at 196 K and benzene vapor at room temperature. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and vapor adsorption isotherms reveal the emergence of new adsorption sites in the benzene-loaded phase, driven by strong interactions and the flexibility of C≡N⋯H─C hydrogen bonds, enabling selective benzene/cyclohexane separation. Notably, the adsorption of benzene induces a visible color change in fluorescence emission and a red shift of approximately 60 nm. Structural and density functional theory (DFT) analyses confirm increased molecular planarity, extended conjugation, and a narrowed bandgap. This work demonstrates a rare integration of selective adsorption, molecular recognition, and signal transduction within a single crystalline framework, offering a versatile platform for the development of intelligent porous materials with real-time visual tracking capabilities.},

Several quinary multicomponent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been documented in the literature, however, the construction of quinary MOFs through the synergistic integration of two distinct organic ligands and three different metal clusters remains scarce. Herein, solvothermal reaction of Zn(OAc) 2 ·2H 2 O with adenine and 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic anhydride afforded a novel MOF of Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC. SCXRD reveals that Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC incorporates three distinct zinc-based structural units of a mononuclear [ZnN 2 (O 2 C─) 2 ], a dinuclear [Zn 2 (Ad) 3 (O 2 C─) 2 ], and a hexanuclear [Zn 6 N 3 ( μ -H 2 O) 3 (Ad) 3 (O 2 C─) 6 ], respectively. These units assemble into a novel quinary MOF structure, distinguished as the unusual material constructed from dual ligands and triple clusters. It features three interconnected cage-like cavities replete with uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms and Watson─Crick sites. Gas adsorption investigations indicate that Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC demonstrates notable selectivity toward acetylene, ethane, and propylene adsorption, enabling the single-step ethylene purification from trinary C 2 mixtures and binary MTO products. Computational simulations reveal that preferential adsorptions are facilitated by different supramolecular interaction strengths. Given its cost-effective and readily accessible synthesis precursors, along with excellent thermal and chemical stability, Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC holds great promise for advanced gas adsorption and separation applications.},

Herein, a novel design strategy is reported for realizing high-efficiency oxygen-bridged cyclized boron-based MR-TADF emitters via engineering intermolecular packing mode. Three organic donor–acceptor (D–A) molecules with different molecular configurations are designed and synthesized, which can readily form modulated packing patterns with fastidiously regulating intermolecular charge transfer (CT) in crystalline states. Experimental and theoretical investigations expose that the intermolecular D–A packing modes could be formed in relatively planar molecular architecture, which cannot only fix the intermolecular CT excited-state configuration, but the multiple conversion channels of triplet excitons can also be involved synergistically to accelerate the spin-flip, and thus achieving near-unity PLQY and excellent reverse intersystem crossing rate of 6.7 × 10 5 s −1 in solid states. The optimized OLEDs devices achieve an attractive EQE value of 31.75%, which is at a record high for MR-TADF OLEDs with deep-blue emission. Our strategy boosts the luminescence efficiency of MR-TADF emitters through enabling the participation of multiple triplet states and the confined excited-state conformations induced by intermolecular CT interaction in aggregation state.},

A 24-crown-8 ring is sufficiently small that the side chains of canonical branched amino acids act as barriers that trap the macrocycle on the particular glycine residue used to assemble the rotaxane. The resulting crown ether–tripeptide rotaxane can subsequently be extended from either or both N- and C-termini of the axle. Three distinct positional isomers of a heptapeptide [2]rotaxane containing three glycine units were selectively synthesized, and in each case the unique position of the crown ether on the peptide axle was confirmed by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tandem mass spectrometry. The three positional isomers adopt different conformations in the region adjacent to the trapped macrocycle, and have different chemical stabilities and secondary interactions in comparison to the unthreaded peptide axle. The crown ether does not inhibit enzymatic proteolysis over the entire length of the heptapeptide–axle rotaxanes, but rather provides significant protection from degradation for the three to four residues local to the encapsulated region. The strategy opens a pathway to new analogs of naturally occurring mechanically interlocked peptides.},

In this study, a copper-catalyzed insertion reaction of a disubstituted carbene into an unsaturated imine has been developed to form β,γ-unsaturated carbonyl compounds with an α-quaternary carbon center, which subsequently undergo an unprecedented forward 1,2-/backward 1,4-furyl migration cascade, ultimately affording a highly substituted benzofuran. A formal 1,3-furan migration is involved in this multistep cascade sequence, broadening the substrate scope under mild reaction conditions.},

Lithiation-borylation has emerged as powerful methodology for the stereocontrolled construction of acyclic carbon chains but has not previously been used for the stereocontrolled synthesis of carbocycles. Herein, we report that benzylic diethylcarbamates with a tethered vicinal bis-boronic ester moiety can be deprotonated with lithium amide bases, resulting in cyclization and 1,2-metallate rearrangement to give carbocycles. This intramolecular lithiation-borylation reaction is completely regioselective and, rather than being stereospecific like the acyclic variants, it is diastereoconvergent. Stereochemistry of the boronic ester is retained but the benzylic stereocenter undergoes epimerization, furnishing carbocycles with high diastereo- and enantiocontrol from easily accessible precursors. Site-selective transformations of the bis-boronic ester products are also demonstrated.},

Herein, we describe the formation of two distinct types of cyclic SPs from structurally similar rosette-shaped molecules. The first SP (Type I) is characterized by a uniform diameter and circularity, whereas the other (Type II) has properties reminiscent of flexible cyclic covalent polymers. Remarkably, the only difference in the structures of the two monomers that form these completely distinct cyclic SPs is the absence (Type I) or presence (Type II) of hydrogen-bonding moieties. An all-atom molecular-dynamics simulation suggested that the Type II SP can adopt various “conformations” due to the dynamic nature of its hydrogen bonds, thereby behaving like a flexible covalent polymer. Real-time high-speed atomic-force microscopy (AFM) confirmed the presence of flexibility in the chains of the Type II SP on the observation timescale (several tens of seconds). Our results therefore highlight an example of a similarity between a covalent polymer and a noncovalent SP that should help to bridge the gap between these polymers, leading to new advanced materials.},

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental mechanisms underlying two principal switching modes: photoconformational and photochemical. Emphasis is placed on their structural design, magnetic behavior, and the methods used for their characterization, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV–vis spectroscopy. Selected examples illustrate the ability of these systems to control spin-polarized states, alter magnetic exchange interactions, or switch between singlet and triplet spin states upon photoirradiation. The review also discusses challenges related to thermal stability, bistability, and operation under ambient conditions. Emerging strategies for integrating photoswitches with persistent radicals or redox-active units are highlighted for their potential in molecular electronics and quantum information science. Notably, light-induced diradical species in such systems are gaining recognition as molecular qubits, offering long coherence times and spectroscopic addressability essential for quantum gate operations.

To overcome these challenges, we describe a palladium-copper hybrid catalyst that employs spillover-mediated active hydrogen (H*) redistribution mechanism. Hydrogen spillover from palladium with high H* coverage to copper with low H* coverage creates H* redistribution: reduced H* coverage of Pd mitigates HER while maintaining efficient EAH, and increased H* availability of Cu promotes EAH without activating stagnant HER. Integration of these catalysts into both cathode and anode of a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer enabled efficient ethylamine electrosynthesis and formic acid electrooxidation over 100 h, achieving exceptional ethylamine productivity (6160.0 ± 119.1 mmol g cat −1 h −1 ) and Faradaic efficiency (94.2 ± 1.6%) at record-low energy consumption (3.55 kWh kg ethylamine −1 ).

Combining this approach with engineered P450 catalysts exhibiting divergent regioselectivity enabled the expeditious synthesis of a panel of ring-expanded analogs of various complex natural product substrates. Importantly, the skeletal modification was found to drastically altered the anticancer activity of some of these compounds. By the direct targeting of aliphatic C─H sites with tunable site-selectivity, this strategy provides a powerful tool to rapidly access skeletally edited derivatives of natural products and other bioactive molecules for applications in drug discovery and chemical biology.},

The In 3+ /In redox couple offers a favorable potential that mitigates acidic corrosion while matching the MnO 2 two-electron redox. Systematic investigation of anion effects reveals that concentrated Cl − anions restructure the In 3+ solvation, forming stable chloro-complexes that lower dissociation energy and promote uniform Indium (In) deposition. Conversely, SO 4 2− -rich electrolytes impede In plating but enhance MnO 2 crystallization and MnO 2 /Mn 2+ reversibility. Through tailored Cl − /SO 4 2− ratios and an anion-decoupled dual-electrolyte configuration, the battery operates at ∼1.7 V with 72.3% energy efficiency (EE) and over 1500 cycles at 5 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, we demonstrate an electrode-less IMB using a Bi substrate at the anode, where in situ alloying-driven In deposition enables over 2000 stable cycles at 4 mA cm −2 (2 mAh cm −2 ), delivering a compelling energy density of 484.5 Wh kg −1 and a high cumulative areal capacity of 4120 mAh cm −2 .

Although DUF3328 proteins have long been implicated in diverse modifications of inert C( sp 3 )─H bonds, including halogenation, hydroxylation, and macrocyclization, the biochemical properties and catalytic mechanisms of DUF3328 proteins remain elusive. Here, we report the characterization of the DUF3328 protein CctR, which catalyzes C( sp 3 )─H hydroxylation of fungal cyclic peptide cyclochlorotine. Through AlphaFold modeling, in vitro biochemical characterization, and spectroscopic analysis, we demonstrate that CctR is a membrane-associated copper-dependent enzyme that functions as a homodimer. The dimerization of CctR is mediated by its transmembrane helix, a four-helix coiled coil, and C-terminal disulfide bonds. The conserved HxxHC(x) n HxxHC motif, characteristic of the DUF3328 superfamily, is anchored on the dimerization interface and forms a binuclear copper coordination center. Moreover, we show that CctR is dioxygen-dependent and requires electron input for the hydroxylation reaction. Together, these findings define DUF3328 as a previously unrecognized family of binuclear copper-dependent metalloenzymes, capable of catalyzing diverse chemical transformations, and lay the groundwork for future discovery of novel biocatalysts within this widespread enzyme class.},

However, these relationships are difficult to decipher, as the crystal packing affects both the intermolecular interactions and the molecular conformation. Here, we report a divergent synthetic strategy to generate a family of rigid carbonyl-bridged triphenylamine (TPA)-based chromophores via metal-free transformations of the same starting material, and exploit this family to investigate the effects of crystal packing on the solid state RTP properties. The minor bridge modifications lead the TPA derivatives to adopt three distinct crystal packing motifs: parallel columnar stacks, antiparallel zigzags, and nonparallel dimerized arrangements. Despite the nearly identical RTP spectra across the series, the proportion of phosphorescence in their emission and the RTP lifetimes are shown to differ as a result of the different crystal motifs. Computational investigations of dimer models of the solid state reveal that the interplay between fluorescence and triplet formation can be modelled by identifying the aggregate character of dimers in the crystal, but only if pairs in multiple dimensions of the crystal are considered.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have enabled potential applications in intelligent optoelectronics owing to their reversibly dynamic luminescence features. However, in most reported dynamic RTP materials, chromophores serve dual roles as phosphorescent emitters and oxygen sensitizers. This leads to uncontrollable dynamic processes and a reduction in phosphorescence performance. Herein, we present a strategy for achieving controllable dynamic RTP and maintaining the phosphorescent performance by integrating triplet photosensitizers into the RTP polymer. Specifically, by adjusting the concentration of the photosensitizer, the photoactivation time of the copolymers can be accurately controlled within the range of 3–30 s. Notably, after photoactivation, the phosphorescence lifetime of the polymer was prolonged from 558 to 1017 ms, which is longer than that of the polymer lacking a photosensitizer. The versatility of the design strategy was further validated by synthesizing a diverse range of RTP polymers through copolymerization and physical doping, as well as by employing alternative photosensitizers. Given the dynamic RTP feature, we demonstrated potential applications in dynamic intelligent afterglow displays and multilevel information encryption. This work advances the development of controllable dynamic RTP polymers and expands the application scope of stimuli-responsive materials in intelligent optoelectronics.},

Reducing Ir loading while maintaining high performance and durability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) anode is critical for the Gigawatt-scale deployment of PEMWEs. Herein, we report an ultra-low Ir anode, consisting of Re-doped Ir nanoparticles anchored on Pt nanowire networks, enabling rational catalyst design at the atomic scale and electrode structure engineering at the nanoscale. The unique doping of Re into Ir was explored as an effective strategy to promote the desirable conversion from metallic Ir to amorphous IrO x during the acidic OER, thus benefiting intrinsic activity and stability enhancements. Notably, the Pt nanowire bundles serve as a support to enhance electrical conductivity and provide a high-surface-area, robust, and interconnected electrode structure, significantly increasing Ir utilization and electron/mass transport at the device level. Three-electrode electrochemical tests revealed that the developed Ir catalyst exhibits a 100% increase in electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and a 160% enhancement in intrinsic OER activity compared to commercial Ir black catalysts. The optimized Ir anode achieved a current density of 3.0 A cm −2 at 1.69 V (0.2 mg Ir cm −2 ) and 1.73 V (0.1 mg Ir cm −2 ) in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), exceeding the US DOE 2026 targets (0.5 mg PGM cm −2 at 1.8 V for 3.0 A cm −2 ). The corresponding MEAs also demonstrated compelling long-term durability, as evidenced by a low voltage degradation rate of 26 µV h −1 over 1100 hours of operation and 0.8 µV cycle −1 during an accelerated stress test.},

  abstract     = {Unsaturated phosphorus heterocycles typically exhibit diminished π-aromaticity. A unique entry into metallaphosphirenes featuring σ-aromaticity within an unsaturated framework is reported. Reaction of sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP) with cyclic metal carbyne 1 affords phosphorus atom transfer through a formal [1 + 2] cycloaddition pathway. The formation of metallaphosphirene ring was computationally modelled using density functional theory, revealing that [1 + 2] cycloaddition involves direct nucleophilic attack step and, thus, depends on the amphiphilicity of carbyne atom. Comprehensive DFT calculations, including NICS, ACID, GIMIC, EDDB, and NOBD analysis, confirm the predominantly σ-aromatic nature of the metal-based phosphirene system. The reactivity of the metallaphosphirene in cycloaddition reactions is in accord with its σ-aromaticity, which tends to retain the three-membered heterocycle with λ 3 -P atom.},

Herein, we present a design strategy that perpendicularly integrates BN-MR frameworks into a weakly emissive tetradentate Pt(II) complex to achieve efficient narrowband phosphors. Accordingly, we synthesized two novel emitters, BCzBN-PyPt and DPABN-PyPt. The optimized emitter BCzBN-PyPt exhibits exceptional performance characteristics: 1) narrowband red emission at 605 nm with a small full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 35 nm/0.118 eV in toluene, 2) a dramatically shortened exciton lifetime of 1.2 µs (compared to 7.6 µs for the parent complex PhPyPt), and 3) a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield ( Φ PL ) of 75% in doped films–representing a 4.4-fold enhancement over PhPyPt ( Φ PL = 17%). Theoretical investigations reveal that the BN-MR skeleton induces significant electronic perturbation of the singlet state, leading to enhanced transition dipole moments and accelerated radiative decay ( k r = 3.3 × 10 5 s −1 versus 0.1 × 10 5 s −1 for PhPyPt). In optimized OLED devices, BCzBN-PyPt achieves superior red narrowband electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.7%.},

The assembled Si-supported GaN NWs/Ru-RuO 2 delivers a considerable CO rate of 57.89 mmol·cm −2 ·h −1 with nearly 100% selectivity under illumination at 5.5 W·cm −2 without external heating, along with a remarkable turnover frequency of 2.28 × 10 5 h −1 .

Currently, only three organic small molecular inhibitors of SMO have been approved for clinically targeted therapy. Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy to anchor SMO by designing metallodrugs ( RuSe , OsSe , RuIP , OsIP ) containing triadic electrophilic centers (─N(δ − )─X(δ + )─N(δ − )─). In vitro and in vivo experiments validated that the designed triadic electrophilic center drugs could selectively inhibit the activity of SMO, blocking the Hedgehog signaling pathway and effectively killing tumors. Through theoretical calculations combined with experimental data, we verified that the interaction between the protein and drugs increases the polarization of the triadic electrophilic centers. The drugs utilize dual electrophilic centers to fix the binding and use the third electrophilic center insert to the swinging hinge region between TM5 and TM6 of the 7-transmembrane domain of SMO. This strengthens the π-cation lock binding between the transmembrane peptide chains, ultimately inhibiting the mobility of the transmembrane peptide chains and thereby inhibiting SMO activity. This work provides a new strategy for designing SMO specific targeted drugs, offering new hope for clinically targeted therapies.},

However, the structure–performance relationship of additive molecules remains elusive, particularly regarding multisite coordination-mediated synergistic regulation of solvation and interface. Herein, a dynamic configuration reconstruction mechanism that orchestrates the multisite regulation of solvation and interface is unveiled by utilizing a series of polyhydroxy additive prototypes, demonstrating that the increase of functional groups and chain flexibility in multifunctional-group molecules (MGMs) contributes to boosting battery performance. MGM with folded configuration engages in multisite Zn 2+ coordination in the solvation shell, effectively minimizing active H 2 O molecule to suppress parasitic reactions, while its configuration transition to straight-chain architecture enables multisite parallel adsorption on Zn anode interface, thus accelerating desolvation kinetics and steering (002)-facet-dominated Zn deposition. Remarkably, Zn//Zn cells achieve long cycle life of 7000 h and subzero-temperature operation, and Zn//PANI pouch cell maintains nearly 100% capacity retention after 500 cycles.

However, due to the lack of two-electron transfer, rare earth (RE) centers have been considered incapable of promoting reductive elimination, thus limiting the reactivity of RE complexes and their applications in synthetic chemistry. In the presented study, we demonstrated the reactions of β -diketiminate-supported dialkyl RE(III) complexes (L Nacnac - κ 2 N , N′ )RE(III)(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 2 (THF) ( 1-RE , RE = Y, Er, Yb, and Lu; L Nacnac = {[(2,4,6-Me 3 C 6 H 2 )NCMe] 2 CH} − ) with azobenzene at ambient conditions, resulting in the formations of (L Nacnac - κ 2 N,N′ )RE(III)( η 2 - cis -PhNNPh −• ) 2 (THF) ( 2-RE ) and 2-[(trimethylsilyl)methyl]azobenzene ( I ) via a reductive elimination-powered pathway.

The computational studies indicate that the subsequent η 2 -coordination of a cis -azobenzene to the RE(III) centers in this intermediate triggers the reductive elimination between the (trimethylsilyl)methyl group and the neighboring PhNNC 6 H 5 - κ 2 N,C group, consequently enabling the C─C cross-coupling that affords product I . In this elementary process, the two N═N π *-orbitals mainly act as the energetically accessible acceptors for the two electrons being transferred, thereby facilitating the reductive elimination by avoiding the thermodynamically unfavorable 2e-reductions of RE centers.},

In this study, we prepare a composite electrode (BPQDs/GDYNTs) featuring a charge-separated interface structure to improve the SEI directly without auxiliary additives. The BPQDs/GDYNTs are comprised of graphdiyne tubes (GDYNTs) with black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) distributed on the surface. The charge transfer between BPQDs and GDYNTs creates a charge-separated interface, thereby enabling the efficient adsorption of lithium (Li) ions by the electron-rich state of GDYNTs while promoting the adsorption of hexafluorophosphate anion (PF 6 − ) on the electron-deficient state of BPQDs. That facilitates the in situ formation of a thin and inorganic-rich SEI containing fluorine- and phosphorus-based species, which significantly enhances both the desolvation of Li-ions and their kinetics. When utilized as the anode of Li-ion batteries, the BPQDs/GDYNTs electrode exhibits fast-charging capability and remarkable longevity, demonstrating ultra-stable cycling performance over 50 000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g −1 with negligible capacity decay.},

However, this goal has never been performed simultaneously in one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) COFs, due to the difficulty of dimensional control. Herein, for the first time, we synthesized three novel COFs with different dimensions, from similar composition by manipulating the conformation of the molecular building blocks through repulsion-torsion effect. Impressively, the strong repulsion-torsion effect transformed the planar building block into a non-planar building block, resulting in the construction of 2D and 3D COFs, respectively. Moreover, when we consciously reduced the repulsion-torsion effect, the resulting intramolecular conformation struggled to meet the requirements for the formation of 2D and 3D structures, ultimately generating a rare 1D COF. Further research indicated the charge transfer efficiency and photocatalytic performance of the resulting COFs followed a dimensional order of 1D > 3D > 2D. This phenomenon was attributed to the unique in-plane and out-of-plane double rotational restriction (IODRR) effect in the 1D structure, which stabilized the aromatic framework and thus greatly reduced the carrier recombination probability and energy loss.},

Here, we report a continuous ethylene photosynthesis approach as a new platform technology that enables highly efficient and selective conversion of acetylene to ethylene in liquid under mild conditions. This platform technology is compatible with a wide range of solvents, catalysts, and hydrogen sources. Using Pd/mpg-C 3 N 4 as the model photocatalyst, a complete conversion of acetylene was achieved with high ethylene selectivity (>93%) under the continuous flow of either a pure acetylene stream or a crude ethylene stream containing acetylene impurity. The process performance remained stable for at least 72 h. Physical, theoretical, and in situ spectroscopy investigations showed that the photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation follows the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and atomic hydrogen-mediated indirect electron transfer pathways with proton as the hydrogen source. The technoeconomic analysis (TEA) demonstrated that this photocatalytic approach has large profitable margins for both ethylene purification and ethylene production processes.

We herein describe an iterative approach based on mathematical modeling and parameter estimation guided by live experimental data to accurately model the oscillating chemical network. Fitting a kinetic model to the whole chemical network proves considerably more effective and time-efficient than determining reaction rates individually and enables quick screening of various parameters. We apply this method to achieve sustained oscillations in flow when changing various aspects of our recently developed oscillating system, demonstrating its potential to facilitate the development and optimization of organic oscillators as well as offering a general framework for analyzing and optimizing complex synthetic CRNs.},

The CHEG thermocell using the synergy of thermogalvanic and thermodiffusion effects showed a total ionic thermopower of 41 mV K −1 with 2.3 mV K −1 for the former, and delivered a maximum output power density of 14.3 mW m −2 K −2 and an energy density of 4.5 J m −2 K −2 . In addition, an ultrahigh maximum output power density of 4.13 mW m −2 K −2 was obtained in the CHEG device that was assembled by connecting four thermocells in series, which could realize electrocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B. This work demonstrates a feasible way to design high-performance ionic thermoelectric gels and provides a new application in water pollution treatments.},

  abstract     = {The intramolecular microenvironment regulation in metal nanoclusters has typically occurred with the same attribute factors—like metal-to-metal or ligand-to-ligand control—while the regulation with different-attribute factors, e.g., from metal to nonmetal, remains challenging, not to mention the different-attribute microenvironment regulation at the single-site level. Herein, we report the single-site metal-nonmetal microenvironment regulation of copper nanoclusters based on structurally comparable Cu 10 and Cu 11 nanoclusters with the same skeleton but different vacancy-filling elements. The quantum-size effects endow Cu 10 and Cu 11 with distinctly different photophysical properties in terms of their photoluminescence and radioluminescence. Such differences have been rationalized by exploiting the femtosecond transient absorption analysis, demonstrating that the slower non-radiative decay rate and weaker electron-phonon coupling contribute to the superior emission characteristics of the Cu 11 cluster. Accordingly, the Cu 11 -based film demonstrated effective X-ray imaging capabilities, marking the first application of cluster-based nanomaterials for X-ray imaging in the infrared region. This research highlights the potential for regulating different-attribute microenvironments in metal nanoclusters and provides an atomic-level understanding of how to modulate the photophysical properties of cluster-based nanomaterials.},

  abstract     = {P-type organic cathode materials feature multielectron redox activity, structural tunability, and elevated redox potentials, making them promising candidates for battery applications. Nevertheless, their practical deployment remains hindered by inherent challenges, particularly the persistent dissolution issue in conventional electrolytes, leading to rapid capacity fading. To overcome these intrinsic limitations, we propose a biomimetic supramolecular engineering strategy inspired by the hierarchical reinforcement observed in gourd-vine systems, which integrates two synergistic design principles. First, the alkyl-based polymeric backbone and π−π stacking impose steric confinement to suppress solvation-driven degradation. Second, the conjugated aryl groups strategically are positioned on the phenazine scaffold to enhance charge delocalization and activate redox-active nitrogen sites. This approach not only endows the battery system with exceptional long-term cycling stability but also enables high-capacity energy storage with sustained operational durability. The resultant 5,10-diaryl-5,10-dihydrophenazine polymer cathode exemplifies this paradigm, demonstrating outstanding electrochemical performance including an impressive reversible capacity of approximately 120 mAh g −1 at 100 mA g −1 and an excellent capacity retention of 88% over 2000 cycles, representing one of the most robust performances reported for organic cathodes. Comprehensive characterizations combined with theoretical simulations systematically elaborate a dual-mode charge compensation mechanism involving the reversible anion (de)coordination coupled with conjugated π-electron redox activation.},

  abstract     = {The development of effective electrocatalysts for glucose (Glu) electro-conversion is highly desirable for sensing applications; however, is greatly plagued by unstable catalytic active centers during the catalytic process, leading to severe inactivation of active sites and incomplete Glu electrooxidation. Herein, we report a class of single-atom Pt-doped Cu-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with stable high-valence Cu sites (CuO-MOF-Pt 1 ), achieving a complete oxidation of Glu and a milliampere current response toward Glu. We demonstrate that the –CN of MOF and Pt serve as electron-withdrawal sites to induce electron transfer of the Cu site, promoting the electrochemical generation of the stabilized Cu 3+ active center. Using operando spectroscopy and computation, we uncover that a complete glucose electrooxidation reaction (GOR) can be achieved by successive C─C bond scission over CuO-MOF-Pt 1 , and a stable Cu 3+ active center is responsible for its impressive GOR activity. Notably, CuO-MOF-Pt 1 delivers comparable Glu sensing performance with a high sensitivity of 2.587 mA mM −1 cm −2 , a low detection limit of 0.93 µM, and extraordinary durability. We further constructed a miniaturized CuO-MOF-Pt 1 -based sensor, enabling accurate detection of Glu in saliva. This work opens an inspiring avenue to the precise design of stable metal activity centers through electronic structure regulation for boosting Glu electrooxidation.},

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) data show a large torsional angle for meta -phenylenes relative to para -phenylene rings. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reproduce the experimental torsional angles and also establish a correlation indicating a gradual increase in strain energy from m 4 (∼31 kcal mol −1 ) to p 4 (∼90 kcal mol −1 ). Structural transitions from m 4 to p 4 lead to additional correlations such as a shift in the lowest absorption wavelength from 330 to 394 nm, a sizeable red shift in the maximum emission wavelength from 444 to 546 nm, and a decrease in fluorescence quantum yield from 0.76 to 0.20, respectively. Time-dependent (TD)-DFT analysis of the relaxed excited state (S 1’ ) geometry shows a progression of exciton delocalization as para -phenylenes are introduced into m 4 en route to p 4 , while the overall molecular size remains constant. This effect is directly related to increased π-conjugation within the nanotube's top-segment and demonstrates how exciton trapping can take place without changing the nanotube's physical size, e.g., diameter and length.},

Acting as a chemical fuel, cyanide transiently drives the formation of this adduct, which can spontaneously regenerate the parent macrocycle under mild conditions, representing a rare demonstration of metastability in a Meisenheimer complex. The dynamic behavior of this system, reminiscent of out-of-equilibrium assemblies, is finely tunable through macrocycle concentration, counterion nature, solvent, and temperature. Detailed crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses reveal that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a key role in stabilizing the adduct.

In this study, we successfully realized the selective modulation of RTP and DF emissions in a donor-acceptor doping system by inducing conformational changes in the donor through solid-liquid transition. In the solid state, the donor adopts a highly twisted quasi-axial conformation, which effectively suppresses non-radiative decay, resulting in efficient green RTP. In contrast, in the liquid state, the donor transitions to a relatively planar conformation, forming the intermolecular charge transfer state with the acceptor, significantly reducing the energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states, thereby facilitating reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and generating yellow DF. Furthermore, the coexistence of multiple emissive triplet states demonstrates promising applications in information encryption, ink-free rewritable paper, and thermal sensing.},

This top-down reconstruction strategy involves the disintegration of 1,4-ndc linker and transformation of 1D Ni–( μ 3 -OH)/( μ 2 -H 2 O)–Ni chains (which act as precursors), into ultra-low-dimensional (thickness ∼ 1.5–2.6 nm), defect-rich β -Ni(OH) 2 structure. The activated catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA.cm −2 , surpassing commercial IrO 2 . In situ Raman and powder diffraction studies demonstrate pH- and potential-dependent phase transitions, leading to the formation of catalytically active β -Ni(OH) 2 . In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms progressive structural evolution, with a Ni─O bond contraction from 2.06 to 1.89 Å under catalytic conditions, indicative of dynamic NiOOH phase formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the exposed Ni 2+ centers stabilize OER intermediates and facilitate the adsorbate oxygen evolution mechanism (AEM). The catalyst also demonstrates robust activity at elevated temperatures.

Mechanistic investigations reveal that this oxidative process proceeds via a multisite PCET pathway involving ground-state, pre-association followed by a static quenching mechanism. This contrasts with the dynamic quenching mechanism governing the reductive PCET previously reported for the same system.

ECE functions as a novel proton source, with hydroxyl (-OH) groups that are readily oxidized by photogenerated holes, resulting in efficient proton supply compared to H 2 O. Moreover, ECE facilitates membrane assembly via interfacial H-bonding between the -OH moieties of ECE and the modified nitrogen sites of MPB/CN-g-CN, generating proton-rich interfaces and local H-bond microenvironments that synergistically enhance proton supply and CO adsorption, thus steering the reaction toward CH 4 production. As a result, the MPB/CN-g-CN membrane achieves a remarkable increase in CH 4 yield from 0.01 to 35.85 µmol g −1 h −1 and selectivity from 0.4% to 82% compared to the pristine heterojunction. Furthermore, the MPB/CN-g-CN/ECE membrane demonstrates exceptional recyclability through a re-crosslinking membrane formation process, effectively reactivating proton-supply sites while maintaining superior CH 4 selectivity across multiple operational cycles.},

In this context, space-confined synthesis has emerged as a powerful strategy for engineering high-performance electrocatalysts. Recent studies have demonstrated that low-dimensional nanomaterials synthesized via confinement techniques exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic properties. The confined microenvironment imparts superior electrical conductivity, structural stability, and active site accessibility, while also facilitating elevated catalytic activity and offering potential for scalable production in practical energy applications. In this review, we first present mechanistic insights into nanoconfinement-enhanced water splitting electrocatalysis and characterization techniques including in-situ/ operando analysis for confined electrocatalysts, emphasizing how the confined architectures from one to three dimensions (1D-3D) regulate electronic structures, facilitate reactant adsorption, and reduce energy barriers. We then outline nanoscale confinement strategies, including in-situ and postsynthetic approaches using diverse host materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and MXenes, along with advanced methods for controlling particle dispersion and size. Next, we summarize recent progress in confined electrocatalysts for water splitting, highlighting density functional theory (DFT)-guided design and structure–property relationships. Finally, we address current challenges and future opportunities in synthesis control, in-situ characterization, and scalable deployment for practical hydrogen production.},

  abstract     = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used due to their high energy density, long cycle life, and environmental friendliness. However, at sub-zero temperatures, the operation of LIBs is constrained by degraded electrolyte ion transport performance and severe charge transfer polarization. In this work, we proposed a strategy for the construction of solvation structures dominated by compact ion-pair aggregates (CIPAs) through weak lithium-solvent interactions design, which significantly improved the lithium-ion transference number and reduced the de-solvation energy barrier. Excitingly, this strategy can induce the formation of a robust anion-derived solid electrolyte interface, thereby enabling the rapid transport of lithium ions across the interface even at extremely low temperatures. This electrolyte provides excellent electrochemical performance of practical natural graphite and LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 (NCM811) electrodes. The NCM811||graphite full cell exhibits capacity retention of 84.7% of its room temperature capacity at a high rate of 0.5C at −20 °C, and can be cycled stably for over 200 cycles at −40 °C without obvious capacity degradation. This work presents an innovative avenue for high performance LIBs at low temperature.},

  abstract     = {Practical aqueous zinc-ion batteries face severe challenges from cathodic dissolution and anodic dendrite growth. Herein, we report a novel electrostatic potential-dominated weakly solvated electrolyte that correlates molecular charge anisotropy with both solvation thermodynamics and interfacial passivation kinetics. By regulating the electrostatic force among Zn 2+ , H 2 O, and weak solvent, the attack ability of free water on vanadium oxide is efficiently reduced, and the vanadium dissolution is effectively prohibited. Simultaneously, the modified solvating structure induces a dense and inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interface, promoting uniform zinc deposition and suppressing side reactions. Benefiting from such synergistic optimization, the developed zinc-ion battery achieves a high capacity of 410 mAh g −1 and maintains 80% of the capacity after 650 cycles at 0.5 A g −1 . Stable Ah-level pouch cell with high energy density (138 Wh kg −1 , based on electrode mass; 36.3 Wh kg −1 , based on full cell) is also achieved, paving a promising way for practical applications.},

However, the formation of carbon–sulfur (C─S) bonds, which are essential for producing thioethers used in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials, remains significantly underdeveloped. Industrial C─S coupling methods still rely on expensive, homogeneous catalysts that suffer from poor recyclability and are susceptible to sulfur-induced deactivation. In this work, we report a copper single-atom catalyst, where Cu sites are atomically dispersed on mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride, to enable efficient, selective, and recyclable C─S cross-coupling reactions under mild conditions and on a gram scale. The catalyst exhibits excellent resistance to thiol poisoning and maintains high performance over multiple catalytic cycles. Advanced characterization techniques, including aberration-corrected electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and single-atom-sensitive electron energy loss spectroscopy, confirm the atomic dispersion and stable coordination environment of Cu sites. Combined with density functional theory simulations and radical scavenging experiments, our mechanistic investigations support a concerted oxidative addition pathway, which excludes radical intermediates. These results provide key insights into heterogeneous C─S coupling and demonstrate the power of single-atom catalysts in addressing long-standing challenges in sulfur chemistry, paving the way toward greener and more scalable processes for fine chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, large progress has been made to shift the absorption of photoresponsive molecules into the long-wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum. A breakthrough in this field was the recent development of -extended indigoid photoswitches, i.e., peri -anthracenethioindigo (PAT), exhibiting all-red and near-infrared addressability. The excited-state isomerization mechanisms of this very new addition to the realm of photoswitching are currently not understood at all, prohibiting a rational further development. In this study, we present a combined theoretical and experimental approach, including time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC(2)) calculations as well as steady-state and time-resolved femtosecond spectroscopy, to explore the isomerization pathways of this photoswitch. Our findings show that photoisomerization on singlet potential energy surfaces (PESs) is highly unfavorable and instead show that photoswitching proceeds on the PES. These insights enable a deep understanding of thioindigoid photochemistry and demonstrate that extension of the -system and peri -connectivity in the heterocycle unlock extremely favorable photoswitching properties along with the desirable red-shift in absorption. Reliable photoswitching from the triplet is achieved because of its favorable energy, which evades undesirable interference of oxygen quenching. These results pave the way for advancing thioindigoid-based photoswitches to improved performance and functionality in a rational way.},

The high crystallinity of HOFs enables us to monitor the precise structure changes and proton transfer process during acid-base neutralization reaction through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. With this information, the origin of basicity and the underlying mechanism can be identified, which further guide us to discover other porous solid bases and unveil the universal characteristic of some anionic HOFs. The practical use of the porous solid bases was demonstrated by base-catalyzed reactions, exhibiting high activity and selectivity.

  abstract     = {Emerging catalytic systems for hydrogen production via solar and mechanical energy conversion often face critical challenges, including band mismatch, interfacial charge recombination, and insufficient charge migration driving forces. To address core issues of low carrier separation efficiency and poor multi-field coupling in molecular ferroelectrics, this study proposes a molecular engineering strategy of dual molecular ferroelectric heterojunctions. We report a facile one-pot solution synthesis of a molecular ferroelectric heterojunction composed of 4,4-difluoropiperidinium lead iodide and 4,4-difluorocyclohexylamine lead iodide ((4,4-DFPD) 2 PbI 4 /(4,4-DFCHA) 2 PbI 4 ), tailored for hydrogen iodide (HI) decomposition under simultaneous light -ultrasonic activation. Under dual-field excitation, the heterojunction achieves a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 5.26 mmol g −1 h −1 , outperforming its individual constituents ((4,4-DFPD) 2 PbI 4 and (4,4-DFCHA) 2 PbI 4 ) by factors of 4.5 and 2.4, respectively. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) confirms efficient charge separation at the heterointerface, facilitated by energy-level alignment and polarization coupling. Both experimental and theoretical investigations attribute the enhanced performance to suppressed charge recombination and the synergistic action of ferroelectric and piezoelectric fields, jointly promoting directional charge migration. This work not only introduces a viable molecular ferroelectric strategy for designing high-efficiency piezo-photocatalytic systems but underscores the critical role of interfacial charge dynamics in catalytic optimization, offering theoretical insights and practical guidelines for next-generation solar-driven catalysts.},

We develop a singlet-oxygen activated up-conversion luminescence assay (SOLA) that enables ultrasensitive digital immunometric detection of protein biomarkers in homogenous format with no wash steps. This approach designs a pair of labeled antibodies, one labeled with a singlet-oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) nanogenerator of porphyrin-metal organic framework (pMOF) and the other tagged using an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) nanoreporter with luminescence caged by 1 O 2 -cleavable quenchers. Formation of sandwiched complex between target protein and antibody pairs mediates close proximity between 1 O 2 -generator and UCNP reporter, enabling efficient diffusion of 1 O 2 around the reporter to activate its luminescence through cleaving off the quenchers. This approach is demonstrated to be capable of activating detectable fluorescence from a single UCNP reporter with a single-molecule protein target. A digital homogeneous immunoassay strategy is also developed for ultrasensitive protein detection, allowing a single-step, no-wash format for digital protein detection with high signal-to-background ratio, wide dynamic range and atto-molar detection limit. The SOLA assay may provide an invaluable paradigm for developing highly accessible and ultrasensitive tools for diagnostics and biomarker discovery.},

Herein we present a helically chiral dynamic molecular switch whose enantiomers are connected via a single symmetric metastable state that can be populated via light or redox stimuli. Relaxation of the prochiral state in the presence of a bound chiral ammonium guest results in the preferential formation of a specific enantiomer through a conceptually unique supramolecular deracemization process. Importantly, the formed host enantiomer is stable even in the absence of guest, enabling reversible and stable chiral information transfer, while oxidation of the host results in an enantioenriched dication that is insensitive to light, allowing orthogonal chiral memory.},

As a model system, the Na 3.5 MnV 0.5 Ti 0.5 (PO 4 ) 3 (NMVTP) cathode significantly stabilizes the high-voltage Mn 4+/3+ and V 5+/4+ pairs, and increases the reversible capacity from 99.41 to 123.9 mAh g −1 .

Herein, we demonstrate a π-conjugated cation engineering strategy to break this limitation, reporting two phosphite-based NLO crystals: (C 2 N 4 OH 7 )H 2 PO 3 (GUPO) and C(NH 2 ) 3 H 2 PO 3 (GPO). The synergistic alignment of π-conjugated guanidinium cations and [H 2 PO 3 ]⁻ anions enables record-breaking optical anisotropy (Δ n = 0.19 @ 589.3 nm for GUPO), surpassing all known inorganic phosphates. Crucially, GUPO is the first phosphate to realize full-wavelength PM, in which the PM wavelength fully covers its optical transparency range down to 215 nm. Concurrently, GUPO exhibits exceptional second-harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.2 × KDP at 1064 nm and 1.0 × β -BBO at 532 nm), which may enable direct 266 nm laser generation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the giant birefringence originates from oriented π–π interactions between cations, while the SHG response stems from the cooperative polarization of cations. This work establishes π-conjugated cation engineering as a paradigm for designing UV NLO materials, with GUPO crystal emerging as a cheap, efficient alternative to conventional UV NLO crystals.},

Although propylene carbonate (PC) demonstrates superior oxidative stability and lower melting temperature than EC, its tendency to cointercalate with Li + within the graphite anode interlayers restricts its applicability in LIBs. We propose a PC-based weakly-solvating electrolyte engineered with difluoroethylene carbonate (DFEC) that resolves interfacial challenges at both electrodes. The PC solvent facilitates oxidative resistance through formation of an inorganic-dominated cathode–electrolyte interphase (CEI), effectively mitigating transition metal dissolution at 4.4 V operation. Simultaneously, DFEC disrupts Li + -PC coordination through reduced solvent molecule numbers in the solvation shell, enabling generation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite anodes with minimized interfacial impedance. Implemented in 5 Ah pouch cells, this electrolyte demonstrates 76.7% capacity retention after 2000 cycles (2.8–4.4 V) at room temperature (RT) and maintains 91% of its RT capacity at −20 °C, surpassing conventional EC-based electrolytes.

  abstract     = {The coproduction of high-value-added acetate and hydrogen fuel by ethanol-assisted water electrolysis is significant, but the efficiency of ethanol electrooxidation (EOR) is hindered both by sluggish kinetics, primarily dictated by the redox properties of the catalyst. Therefore, the development of efficient EOR electrocatalysts has to target optimized redox properties. Herein, a Ni 0 /Ni(OH) 2 heterostructure was synthesized by inducing a shift from hydrophilic to hydrophobic properties on the electrode surface during electrochemical deposition. The electrocatalyst enabled a current density of 573.7 mA cm −2 at 1.37 V versus RHE for EOR with a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 14.4% when coupled to a commercial solar panel. Experimental and theoretical results disclosed that the incorporation of Ni 0 facilitates the ethanol to acetate kinetics through enhanced Ni 2+ to Ni 3+ conversion. The strategy, combining hydrogen production with the synthesis of value-added products, enhances economic viability compared to conventional water electrolysis, underscoring its promise for practical implementation.},

  abstract     = {Gas–liquid–solid triphase reactions are limited by poor gas solubility and mass transfer, especially in water. The low solubility of hydrogen in water severely hinders the hydrogenation, therefore requiring high temperature and pressure to increase the activity, which have safety and cost concerns. Herein, we report a hydrophobic poly(divinylbenzene) polymer-supported Ru nanoparticle catalyst (Ru/PDVB) with both high activity and excellent stability for the hydrogenation of pyridines in water, even at ambient hydrogen pressure (0.1 MPa). The average turnover frequency (ATOF) of the Ru/PDVB (836.8 mol mol Ru −1 h −1 ) is about 6.0 and 768.0-fold higher than those of traditional Ru/C and commercial Raney Ni catalysts under equivalent reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hydrophobic polymer prevents filling of water in the nanopores of PDVB, allowing hydrogen enrichment to boost the hydrogenation. This work provides an opportunity to improve the efficiency of industrially important reactions that suffer from poor gas solubility and mass transfer.},

However, the activation of alkyl bromides typically requires strong reductants or transition-metal catalysts. Herein, we report a metal-free radical borylation strategy of various alkyl bromides utilizing a photoinduced silyl radical to mediate a halogen-atom transfer process. This method demonstrates broad utility and functional group tolerance among various primary, secondary, and tertiary unactivated alkyl bromides and can facilitate the functionalization of pharmaceutically relevant motifs.

In this work, we propose a hierarchical confinement strategy which combines spatial confinement at nanoscale and anchoring confinement at atomic scale, to overcome the size limitations imposed by high-temperature sintering. Using this strategy, a series of uniformly sized (∼1 nm) Ir-based alloy clusters, including IrMn, IrFe, IrCo and IrNi, are successfully fabricated. The synthesized sub-nanoscale IrCo alloy clusters (denoted as sub-IrCo cluster) demonstrate exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, with an ultralow overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm - 2 and a remarkable mass activity 87.5 times greater than that of commercial IrO 2 . Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the incorporation of N enhances the interaction between Ir atoms and the support. This work provides an effective strategy for preventing particle sintering via a hierarchical confinement effect and achieves precise size control at sub-nanoscale, opening a new avenue for the development of efficient noble metal catalysts with high atomic utilization.},

Among these, dicyanomethyl radical derivatives stand out as key players in dynamic covalent chemistry, demonstrating exceptional temperature-responsive reversible polymerization-dissociation dynamics and remarkable long-wavelength absorption profiles despite their low molecular weights. In this work, we developed a novel radical system designated CNPJ through the strategic incorporation of julolidine into a dicyanomethyl-functionalized phenoxazine scaffold. The stability and radical nature of CNPJ were first corroborated by nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations. Structural analyses revealed two critical phenomena enabled by efficient spin delocalization and intermolecular charge transfer: i) polarity-triggered radical center redistribution and ii) thermally regulated monomer‒π dimer equilibrium. These distinctive features confer enhanced structural rigidity and an exceptional absolute photoluminescence quantum yield of 2.57%, a remarkably high value for near-infrared emitters, accompanied by a bathochromically shifted π dimer absorption band centered at 960 nm. Capitalizing on these attributes, we engineered a theranostic platform by integrating CNPJ with the pH-responsive amphiphilic polymer PEA through pifithrin-μ (PES) inhibitor mediation. This system achieves ultrahigh-brightness fluorescence imaging-guided mild photothermal tumor therapy, yielding promising therapeutic outcomes.},

The activation mechanisms of c-di-AMP receptors like the trimeric P II -like proteins upon messenger binding have, however, remained elusive due the pivotal role of highly flexible protein regions. Here, using solution NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the interplay between the ordered and disordered structural elements of the apo and messenger-bound forms of the 44 kDa homotrimeric P II -like signal transduction protein A (PstA), we reveal a sensitive modulation of the conformational ensemble of those extended loops thought to bind the downstream interaction partners by messenger association at the receptor core.

The molecular structures of the reduced PLAs, studied by sc-XRD experiments and DFT calculations, show the formation of extended -systems. This -system extends to the Lewis acid functions and reduces their acidity. This allows a controlled release of complexed guest molecules. Oxidation regenerates the original Lewis acidity. Such reduction/oxidation cycles were also applied to an Al─P coordination polymer. sc-XRD shows the connectivity of the coordination polymer to remain unchanged, so that the polymer is stable in the neutral and reduced state. The possibility of switching such dbCOT-based PLAs and their adducts as well as the formed coordination polymers between two states with different structures and electronic compositions is of interest for the development of functional materials in the fields of electronics, optics and magnetism as well as for the development of switchable catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the dynamic assembly of fibrillar proteins in biology, research on supramolecular polymers has progressed rapidly toward the development of synthetic multicomponent systems. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the study of supramolecular polymers in solution, with an emphasis on how combined computational and experimental approaches deepen our understanding of these systems. In particular, these studies have elucidated the mechanisms of protein aggregation and provided insights into the characteristics of synthetic systems. We discuss the classification of these polymers and systems, highlighting how their different interaction modes and microstructures give rise to diverse structural and functional properties. In addition, we outline the emerging role of machine learning as a powerful tool to navigate the inherent complexity of these systems, thereby enhancing strategies for rational design and characterization. This review highlights how computational approaches, from traditional modeling to emerging machine learning techniques, enable the experimental characterization and understanding of supramolecular polymer chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Photoelectrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (PEC GOR) is considered as one of the promising strategies for obtaining high-value products and transforming solar energy to hydrogen. Herein, we report that a Ge/Zr co-doped Fe 2 O 3 photoanode present an excellent and stable PEC performance for glycerol oxidation to formate (FA) product. The Ge and Zr co-doping synergistically reduce charge carrier recombination and enhance charge transfer kinetics of the photoanode, promoting the selectivity and Faradaic efficiency toward FA chemical. Further the deposition of NiFeB co-catalyst promotes the cleavage of C─C bonds in glycerol molecules while inhibiting oxygen evolution reaction and facilitating FA accumulation. Impressively, the unbiased PEC tandem configuration for glycerol oxidation was established for coupling NiFeB/Ge/Zr-Fe 2 O 3 photoanode with Fe(Pt)-NC cathode, achieving a photocurrent density of ∼1.9 mA cm −2 with continuously operation of 100 h. The bias-free device maintains FA selectivity of above 80% with an accumulation of 1683 µmol cm −2 , representing the best PEC GOR performance toward high-value chemicals reported so far. The reaction mechanism was clarified through in situ characterization. This work provides new avenues for the sustainable solar-powered chemical synthesis of unbiased PEC systems with high selectivity and durability.},

Herein, we reveal that modifying the skeleton of D–A dyads from U-shaped to V-shaped configurations yields 3 CT-RTP with both long τ Ph (150–220 ms) and high (13%–25%). This improvement stems from preserving a substantial degree of forbiddenness in the radiative transition process of the compound while simultaneously increasing its D–A dihedral angle, which can promote more efficient spin-orbit coupling and thus more rapid intersystem crossing. Additionally, augmenting the framework rigidity of a V-shaped D–A dyad can potentially reduce the non-radiative transition rate constant of triplet excitons ( k nr,T ), thereby facilitating the attainment of long τ Ph and high .},

Here, a highly conjugated pyrene derivative has been engineered to construct both single-molecule and monolayer junctions. The charge transport within these junctions has been examined systematically through theoretical simulations and electrical measurements. These studies demonstrate a distinct transition in a single molecule from temperature-independent coherent tunneling to temperature-dependent incoherent transport, indicating vibration-mediated transport, while vibration-suppressed coherent transport is observed in a densely packed monolayer. Additionally, anisotropic gating experiments reveal that parallel fields relative to the molecular connection modulate energy levels more efficiently in comparison with perpendicular fields.

Here, we introduce unsaturated phosphine oxides as versatile triple-reactive reagents, allowing orthogonal chemoselective bioconjugation schemes. Starting from triethynyl-phosphine oxide, a variety of functionalized diethynyl-triazolyl-phosphine oxides (DTPOs) could be accessed by using Cu I -catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). We showcase DTPO-reagents in the fast and selective generation of various highly stable antibody-conjugates via antibody disulfide rebridging. A highlight from this methodology is the synthesis of a DAR 4 ADC following a modular 2-step strategy using bioorthogonal tetrazine-labeling with bicyclo-[6.1.0]non-4-yne (BCN) or trans -cyclooctene (TCO) containing payloads. Notably, the DTPO-rebridged ADC exhibited potent cytotoxicity against Her2 + cancer cells. Moreover, we utilize triethynyl-phosphine oxide to obtain ethynyl-ditriazolyl-phosphine oxides (EDPOs) which enable a unique, single-reagent peptide-cyclization-bioconjugation protocol resulting in functional cyclic peptide-protein conjugates. Overall, our work provides versatile and powerful chemoselective modalities for the controlled modification of antibodies, peptide-cyclization and peptide-protein conjugation, expanding the toolkit for chemical biology and therapeutic development.},

In this study, we developed a series of twisted intramolecular charge transfer luminogens (TICTgens) for precisely regulating and in situ monitoring of tumor cell pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo. The outperformed TICTgen HCM displayed second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence emission and exceptional viscosity sensitivity. Upon 671 nm laser irradiation, HCM induced the generation of type-I/II reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hyperthermia effect, which cumulatively triggered mitochondrial damage and pyroptosis of tumor cells. HCM was systemically delivered via intracellular acidity-sensitive nanoparticles (namely PDPA@HCM NPs) to effectively trigger pyroptosis-driven antitumor immunity. Notably, HCM performed NIR-II fluorescence and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of pyroptosis-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by measuring viscosity change, thus enabling in situ monitoring of pyroptosis-mediated antitumor immunotherapy. In combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, the PDPA@HCM NPs dramatically regressed colorectal tumor growth in a mouse model. Overall, this study demonstrated that the TICTgens could serve as a versatile platform for pyroptosis induction and monitoring of pyroptosis-based cancer immunotherapy.},

Besides near-quantitative photoconversion, the success and expediency of a psUAA for a certain application is defined by its interaction potential with the enzyme, its thermal stability and its effective wavelength of irradiation. To establish high versatility in the current repertoire, we have designed and synthesized six psUAAs based on azobenzene, arylazopyrazole, arylazothiazole, hemithioindigo and spiropyran photoswitches. The resulting psUAAs exhibit an enhanced interaction potential within an enzyme owing to their capacity for hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions and metal ion coordination. Moreover, we observed diverse photochemical behaviors among the psUAAs, with four of them reversibly switching between the isomers with purely visible light. Notably, we identified orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that facilitate the incorporation of five of the six psUAAs co-translationally and computationally analyzed the synthetase-psUAA interactions. Finally, we evaluated the photochemical behavior of the five psUAAs within an enzymatic model and tested the photocontrol of catalysis confirming their diversity. Ultimately, our findings significantly expanded the repertoire of psUAAs and demonstrated their feasibility for enzyme engineering studies.},

  abstract     = {Organic-inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) with multi-color switchable luminescence have raised pervasive attention in the field of sensing, optoelectronics, anti-counterfeiting, information encryption and storage. However, the complexity of soft lattice structures makes it difficult to establish design rules for realizing the luminescence regulation, which greatly hinders their practical applications. Herein, a series of 0D OIMHs are designed, including PA 3 SbCl 6 , PA 6 InCl 9 , PMA 4 InCl 7 , PEA 2 InCl 5 ·H 2 O and PPA 4 InCl 7 . Tunable self-trapped excitons (STEs) emission from 606 to 678 nm originated from [SbCl n ] 3-n are realized in these 0D structures by Sb 3+ doping at room temperature. The correlations among structural distortion, bandgap, emission position, and quantum yield are investigated in these 0D Sb 3+ -doped OIMHs. The greater distortion of local inorganic polyhedron induces a relative red-shift emission, while the increased separation distance between local inorganic polyhedron reduces non-radiative transitions, therefore enhancing quantum yield. Moreover, multi-emission centers are constructed in Sb 3+ /Bi 3+ -doped PMA 4 InCl 7 , achieving green/red and blue/green/red tunable multi-color switching luminescence under the regulation of excitation wavelength and temperature. Based on the multi-color luminescence response characteristics, potential application demonstrations in optical anti-counterfeiting and information encryption are designed. This suggests the application potential of constructing multi-color switchable luminescence in OIMHs using ns 2 ions, providing a new design perspective for low-dimensional OIMHs.},

Here, we demonstrate that chiral aminoacyl phosphate esters, synthetic analogs of biological acylating intermediates, drive self-assembly and reaction pathways, that are modulated purely by their configuration, without the need for changes in functional groups. Using enantiopure aminoacyl phosphate esters, we show that these left- and right-handed acylating agents generate transient epimeric (thio)-esters from homochiral peptide substrates, leading to supramolecular architectures with distinct lifetimes and self-assembly dynamics. Moreover, chirality regulates downstream reactivity in cascade reactions, where stereochemical control over an intermediate propagates into subsequent transformations. Finally, chiral acylating agents differentiate between two reaction cycles, selectively modulating one pathway while keeping another invariant – a level of control that remains difficult to achieve with conventional chemical strategies. Stereochemical programming enables control over reactivity and self-assembly, offering new opportunities to encode chirality in reaction networks and modulate their function through a single molecular parameter.},

Building on established principles, by appending a chemical gluing moiety to several small molecule inhibitors, we successfully transformed them into degraders, obviating the need for a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase recruiter. Specifically, we found that incorporating a hydrophobic aromatic ring or a double bond into a cyclin-dependent kinase 12 and 13 (CDK12/13) dual inhibitor enabled the recruitment of DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1), thereby transforming a high-molecular-weight bivalent CDK12 degrader into a potent monovalent CDK12/13 molecular glue degrader. We also showcase that attaching a cysteine-reactive warhead to a bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor converts it into a degrader by recruiting the DDB1 and CUL4-associated factor 16 (DCAF16) E3 ligase.},

  abstract     = {Elaborating electrooxidation mechanisms of biomass molecules on transition-metal-based electrodes is crucial to designing high-performance active sites. Herein, we unveiled the direct oxidation mechanism of three electrode models, Co 4 N, CoO, and Co 4 N–CoO, in which the adsorptions of OH − and glycerol on the electrodes were competitive. The adsorption of glycerol on Co 4 N was quite strong but weak on CoO, whereas the CoO preferred to adsorb OH − species. The one-sided adsorption properties of surface reactants led to the sluggish electrooxidation kinetics of organics on Co 4 N and CoO. Constructing Co 4 N–CoO heterointerfaces significantly balanced the one-sided adsorption features. Due to the moderate OH − and glycerol adsorptions on Co 4 N–CoO, the OH − was mainly used to activate glycerol rather than trigger the oxidative reconstruction of materials to form high-valence OER sites. Consequently, the Co 4 N–CoO showed excellent glycerol oxidation properties. The Co 4 N–CoO delivered a lower Tafel slope of 178 mV dec −1 while achieving a high formate yield rate of 29.40 mmol cm −2 h −1 . Furthermore, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate was maintained above 90% in a 120-h electrolysis. In situ Raman and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) experiments and DFT simulations unraveled that the improved GOR performance was mainly ascribed to the balanced co-adsorptions of OH − and organics on Co 4 N–CoO interfaces.},

  abstract     = {Engineering molecular recognition events into catalytic systems to precisely control the up- or down-regulation of catalysis in a biomimetic fashion is a challenging goal in supramolecular chemistry. In this work, we report on the construction of a new metal–organic cage, Zn II 4 L 4 tetrahedron 1 , using a protonated azacalix[3](2,6)pyridine-based ligand as the capping faces. The cage features a large cavity and wide gaps between its faces, enabling the simultaneous binding of anionic guests centrally and peripherally. Encapsulation of α-Mo 8 O 26 4− within the T -symmetric tetrahedron 1 leads to a C 3 -symmetric inclusion complex Mo 8 O 26 4− ⊂ 1 . The apertures of Mo 8 O 26 4− ⊂ 1 act as secondary binding sites for accommodating tetraarylborate guests or for providing access to the included Mo 8 O 26 4− for catalyzing reactions. Catalytic experiments demonstrated that inclusion within 1 significantly enhances the catalytic activity of Mo 8 O 26 4− for the oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides. In contrast, peripheral binding of the bulky tetraarylborate anion to the inclusion complex Mo 8 O 26 4− ⊂ 1 effectively inhibits its catalytic activity by obstructing access to the catalytic active sites of Mo 8 O 26 4− .},

  abstract     = {To achieve multi-state, visible-light-excited, long-wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with high emission efficiency within a single molecular dye system remains a significant challenge. Herein, we developed a series of V-shaped emitters comprising electron-deficient benzothiadiazole and electron-rich triphenylamine (TPA) or carbazole (Cz) units, featuring small singlet-triplet energy gaps. These molecules exhibit long-wavelength TADF emission and bright luminescence in both single-molecule and aggregate states. The V-shaped structure prompts multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds, while the intramolecular charge transfer effect significantly relaxes the molecular conformation in the excited state. These synergistic effects result in a rigid excited-state molecular conformation, facilitating strong single-molecule state emission with a high luminescence efficiency up to 75.90% (delayed: 26.57%). Meanwhile, the unique V-shaped structure and long alkyl chains enable these luminophores to maintain a twisted conformation and staggered stacking in the aggregate state, effectively preventing aggregation-caused quenching effects. Furthermore, the regular crystal environment ensures that these molecules possess a bright aggregate-state TADF luminescence with a high quantum yield up to 53.50% (delayed: 11.23%). Benefiting from their excellent photophysical properties, these molecules were successfully applied as functional dyes for concentration-independent cell imaging and antibacterial treatment.

  abstract     = {Organic molecules exhibiting aggregation-induced emission (AIE) have attracted considerable attention due to their exceptional solid-state luminescent properties. Understanding the AIE mechanism has been a focal point of both theoretical and experimental research. While conical intersection (CI) dynamics on potential energy surfaces (PESs) have emerged as a key factor in elucidating the AIE mechanism, modulating the accessibility to CI to regulate the non-radiative decay pathways remains a substantial challenge. Here we propose a new strategy leveraging strain energy introduced by cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) to tune the AIE property of tetraphenylethylene (TPE). We synthesized and characterized a series of TPE-incorporated CPPs with varying sizes and endo / exo vinyl moieties. The photophysical properties and AIE behavior of these strained TPE-CPPs were meticulously examined. Endo -TPE-CPPs exhibit AIE, while Exo -TPE-CPPs do not, opposite to strain-free TPE macrocycles. The luminescence of Endo -TPE-CPPs and Exo -TPE-CPPs can be further tuned by adjusting the number of phenylene units in the loop. Their excited-state dynamics were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculation and time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. The strain energy induces structural distortion of TPE, stabilizing or elevating the transition state (TS), thereby regulating the accessibility to CI and enabling tunable AIE properties. These findings provide new insights for designing AIE molecules.},

Here, we use flow chemistry to create redox-active hyperbranched copolymers (HBCs), which exhibited substantially improved suppression of crossover and enhanced rheology behaviors. The distinct reaction dynamics of flow chemistry facilitated the efficient and monomer-independent control over self-condensing vinyl polymerization, yielding well-defined HBCs with remarkably low dispersity. This strategy effectively enhanced the uniformity of the redox-active HBCs, leading to significantly reduced crossover and accelerated diffusion rates. The RFBs equipped with our redox-active HBCs exhibited long-term stability, mapping a pathway towards practical application of polymer-based technologies as well as highlighting the unique advantages of the flow chemistry techniques in high-precision electrolyte design.},

Herein, we report a chromium-catalyzed asymmetric reductive coupling of allyl gem -dichlorides with aldehydes, enabling precise and tunable control over regio-, enantio-, diastereo-, and Z/E -selectivity. This radical-polar crossover strategy circumvents the need for preformed organometallic reagents, offering a direct and modular approach to stereochemically complex homoallylic alcohols. A chiral imidazoline sulfonamide ligand directs the formation of Z -alkenes, while a bisoxazoline ligand reverses the selectivity to E -alkenes, achieving excellent stereocontrol across a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies support a chromium-mediated allyl radical generation and addition pathway. This work establishes a versatile platform for constructing stereochemically defined homoallylic alcohols and expands the synthetic utility of allyl gem -dichlorides in asymmetric catalysis.},

Potassium hexacyanochromate (K 3 [Cr(CN) 6 ]) has emerged as a promising negolyte material in Fe-Cr RFBs due to its favorable electrochemical properties.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations illuminate the effects of ligand exchange dynamics and structural variations on redox stability, providing mechanistic insights into electrolyte behavior.

Herein, we systematically engineered a series of methoxy ethoxy methane derivatives with tailored fluorinated alkyl groups to screen the optimal asymmetric difluorinated electrolytes for high-voltage LMBs. Spectroscopic and computational studies show that the ─CF 2 H group in difluoroethoxy methoxy methane (DFME) facilitates balanced Li─F interactions, which are essential for ensuring efficient ion transport and maintaining oxidation stability. In contrast, the elongated ─CF 2 CF 2 H group in tetrafluoropropyl methoxy methane (TFME) fails to coordinate with Li + ions, which hampers ion transport and leads to interfacial instability. The DFME electrolyte facilitates the spontaneous formation of a protective dual-layer interface featuring a LiF-rich inner phase and a Li 2 CO 3 -dominated outer phase. Consequently, Li||LiCoO 2 cells (2.5 mAh cm −2 ) using DFME exhibit remarkable cycling stability, retaining 92% capacity after 180 cycles. This is further corroborated by a 140-mAh pouch cell, which retains 91% capacity after 140 cycles.

  abstract     = {Ammonia synthesis is vital for global fertilizer production but traditionally relies on the energy-intensive Haber–Bosch process, a major contributor to CO 2 emissions. Photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (PNRR) offers a sustainable alternative by harnessing solar energy under ambient conditions. However, challenges such as low nitrogen adsorption, poor conductivity, and high electron-hole recombination of the photocatalysts limit their efficiency. This study introduces an Fe 3 O 4 @C@ZIF67 core-shell photocatalyst featuring an Fe─N─Co bridged Z-scheme heterojunction. This design incorporates carbon-coated Fe 3 O 4 in ZIF67-D (ZIF67-dodecahedron) with exposed (211) crystalline facets to enhance nitrogen adsorption. Fe─N 4 and Co─N 4 active sites improve catalytic activity, while the carbon layer enhances conductivity and facilitates oxygen vacancy formation. The Fe─N─Co bridged heterojunction further promotes charge separation and transfer. Therefore, the Fe 3 O 4 @C@ZIF67 composite achieves an outstanding ammonia yield of 33.2 mmol L −1 g −1 h −1 (outperforming other systems) with high selectivity and minimal by-products. This work provides valuable insights into the design of high-performance photocatalysts by integrating the advantages of metal–organic frameworks, core-shell architectures, and interfacial engineering, marking a significant step forward in sustainable ammonia synthesis.},

Here, we report the formation of gold hydride above 40 GPa and 2200 K in X-ray free electron laser heated diamond anvil cells using various hydrocarbons as hydrogen sources. Above 40 GPa, a hexagonal phase emerges close to the gold melting point, corresponding to a hydride with stoichiometry , with increasing from 0 to near 1 with pressure from 40 to 80 GPa. This is a high-temperature phase which reverts to face centered cubic gold on cooling to 295 K. Accompanying DFT-MD simulations are in excellent agreement with experiment and reveal the structure to consist of an hexagonal close packed gold lattice with atomic hydrogen disordered in the interstices. The hydrogen is superionic and exhibits high diffusivity through the crystalline gold lattice. Our results present the first solid-state binary compound of gold and hydrogen.},

With CO 2 levels at 427 ppm (50% above pre-industrial levels), deploying energy-efficient carbon capture technologies is crucial. Electrochemical carbon capture processes that have been touted to have the potential to meet these needs rely on the applied cell voltage, and electron utilization (CO 2 molecules separated per electron), which has generally been asserted to have a theoretical limit of one. Here, we introduce an electron-leveraging strategy to enhance electron utilization beyond this limit to 1.43 by employing Fe-EDDHA, a redox-active coordination complex having a ligand with multiple hemi-labile coordination sites. The reversibility and robustness of the system were enabled by the efficient prevention of CO 2 reduction upon the introduction of nicotinamide as a guardian of the iron(2+) center. The proof-of-concept cyclic system exhibits a minimum operational energy of 22.6 kJ e mol −1 and an average of 63.7 kJ e mol −1 over 29 cycles, using a simulated flue gas (15% CO 2 ). Our electron-leveraging strategy holds promise for advancing energy-efficient electrochemical carbon capture technologies, and offers an alternative to prevalent redox potential shifting methods proposed to mitigate undesired electron transfer reactions in redox-active materials across diverse operational conditions.},

By introducing bio-orthogonal clickable amino acids into Anticalin at various positions and applying tension to the protein complex using single-molecule AFM force spectroscopy and bead-based adhesion assays, we elucidate the relationship between anchor point position and mechanostability of the Anticalin:(CTLA-4) complex. Multi-regression analysis of the physicochemical properties of the anchor points revealed that the distance from the anchor point on Anticalin to CTLA-4′s center of mass was a major determinant of binding strength under shear flow. These results demonstrate how anchor point engineering can enhance particle adhesion and cellular delivery to CTLA-4 targets and provide a heuristic for choosing surface immobilization points of targeting proteins such that they withstand high mechanical forces.},

Embedding approaches that allow researchers to focus the computational effort on the chemically active regions of interest are promising tools in the pursuit of balancing accuracy and efficiency. However, for metallic catalysts, the required separation of the system into an active part treated with highly accurate methods and an environment is technically hard to achieve due to the delocalization of electrons in the conducting surface. Therefore, studies analyzing the potential of embedding methods for heterogeneous (electro-)catalyst screening are scarce. In this contribution, we demonstrate that simple embedding approaches are indeed achievable for studying metallic catalysts if i) the active orbital space is held consistent over a reaction coordinate and ii) the nonadditive exchange-correlation functional used to calculate the embedding potential includes a fraction of exact exchange to mitigate delocalization errors. We verify the approach for a set of open- and closed-shell CO 2 reduction reaction intermediates on different adsorption sites of a Cu(111) surface represented by cluster models to demonstrate that catalyst screening with embedding approaches is achievable.},

However, graphite is not inherently suitable for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to the limited intercalation properties of sodium ions. To address this, we propose the concept of bridging-donor-ligands, which construct ligand channels and consistently expand the graphite interlayer spacing. Using sodium dicyandiamide (NaDCA) as a model ligand, we demonstrate the formation of abundant ligand channels facilitated by the versatile dicyanamide anion (DCA − ), significantly enhancing the structural robustness of ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t-GICs). Hence, the graphite anode capacity retention is over 94% after 5000 cycles, with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) exceeding 99.8% in SIBs. This mechanism is versatile and can be extended to other metal-ion battery electrolytes.},

This process uses lithium as a mediator to cleave the nitrogen gas via a nitridation reaction at ambient pressure below 80 °C. Exposing the nitride to moisture naturally yields ammonia. The co-produced lithium hydroxide intermediate allows for spontaneous absorption of CO 2 with an exceptional capacity of 18.4 mmol CO 2 /g. The resultant lithium carbonate is electrolysed at ambient conditions to recycle the metallic lithium and release high-purity gaseous CO 2 .

  abstract     = {Accelerated failure time (AFT) models offer an attractive alternative to Cox proportional hazards models. AFT models are collapsible and, unlike hazard ratios in proportional hazards models, the acceleration factor—a key effect measure in AFT models—is collapsible, meaning its value remains unchanged when adjusting for additional covariates. In addition, AFT models provide an intuitive interpretation directly on the survival time scale. From the recent development of smooth parametric AFT models, we identify potential issues with their applications and note several desired extensions that have not yet been implemented. To enrich this tool and its application in clinical research, we improve the AFT models within a flexible parametric framework in several ways: we adopt monotone natural splines to constrain the log cumulative hazard to be a monotonic function across its support; allow for time-varying acceleration factors, possibly include cure and accommodating more than one time-varying effect; and implement both mixture and nonmixture cure models. We implement all of these extensions in the rstpm2 package, which is publicly available on CRAN. Simulations highlight a varying success in estimating cure fractions. However, in terms of covariate-effect estimation, flexible AFT models appear to be more robust than the Cox model even when there is a high proportion of cured individuals in the data, regardless of whether cure is reached within the observed data. We also apply some of our extensions of AFT models to real-world survival data.},

However, with the advent of molecular-targeted therapies and antibody drug conjugates, dose-limiting toxicities are less frequently observed, giving rise to the concept of optimal biological dose (OBD), which considers both efficacy and toxicity. The estimand framework presented in the addendum of the ICH E9(R1) guidelines strengthens the dialogue between different stakeholders by bringing in greater clarity in the clinical trial objectives and by providing alignment between the targeted estimand under consideration and the statistical analysis methods. However, there is a lack of clarity in implementing this framework in early-phase dose optimization studies. This paper aims to discuss the estimand framework for dose optimization trials in oncology, considering efficacy and toxicity through utility functions. Such trials should include pharmacokinetics data, toxicity data, and efficacy data. Based on these data, the analysis methods used to identify the optimized dose/s are also described. Focusing on optimizing the utility function to estimate the OBD, the population-level summary measure should reflect only the properties used for estimating this utility function. A detailed strategy recommendation for intercurrent events has been provided using a real-life oncology case study. Key recommendations regarding the estimand attributes include that in a seamless phase I/II dose optimization trial, the treatment attribute should start when the subject receives the first dose. We argue that such a framework brings in additional clarity to dose optimization trial objectives and strengthens the understanding of the drug under consideration, which would enable the correct dose to move to phase II of clinical development.},

We develop a general estimation method for inference in partially linear models with nonmonotone missing at random data. It proposes using partially linear working models to improve the estimation efficiency of the standard complete case method. It can be shown that the new estimator is consistent, which does not depend on the correctness of the working models. In addition, we recommend bootstrap estimates for the asymptotic variances and semiparametric models for the missing data probabilities. It is computationally simple and can be directly implemented in standard software. Simulation studies are provided to examine its performance.

Apart from the sequence tagging paradigm, the proposed method tackles the multitask lexical analysis via two-stage sequence span classification. Firstly, the model detects the word and named entity boundaries by multi-label classification over character spans in a sentence. Then, the authors assign POS labels and entity labels for words and named entities by multi-class classification, respectively. Furthermore, a Gated Task Transformation (GTT) is proposed to encourage the model to share valuable features between tasks.

  abstract     = {Nonlinear transforms have significantly advanced learned image compression (LIC), particularly using residual blocks. This transform enhances the nonlinear expression ability and obtain compact feature representation by enlarging the receptive field, which indicates how the convolution process extracts features in a high dimensional feature space. However, its functionality is restricted to the spatial dimension and network depth, limiting further improvements in network performance due to insufficient information interaction and representation. Crucially, the potential of high dimensional feature space in the channel dimension and the exploration of network width/resolution remain largely untapped. In this paper, we consider nonlinear transforms from the perspective of feature space, defining high-dimensional feature spaces in different dimensions and investigating the specific effects. Firstly, we introduce the dimension increasing and decreasing transforms in both channel and spatial dimensions to obtain high dimensional feature space and achieve better feature extraction. Secondly, we design a channel-spatial fusion residual transform (CSR), which incorporates multi-dimensional transforms for a more effective representation. Furthermore, we simplify the proposed fusion transform to obtain a slim architecture (CSR-sm), balancing network complexity and compression performance. Finally, we build the overall network with stacked CSR transforms to achieve better compression and reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion performance compared to the existing LIC methods and traditional codecs. Specifically, our proposed method achieves 9.38% BD-rate reduction over VVC on Kodak dataset.},

  abstract     = {The cloud data centres evolved with an issue of energy management due to the constant increase in size, complexity and enormous consumption of energy. Energy management is a challenging issue that is critical in cloud data centres and an important concern of research for many researchers. In this paper, we proposed a cuckoo search (CS)-based optimisation technique for the virtual machine (VM) selection and a novel placement algorithm considering the different constraints. The energy consumption model and the simulation model have been implemented for the efficient selection of VM. The proposed model CSOA-VM not only lessens the violations at the service level agreement (SLA) level but also minimises the VM migrations. The proposed model also saves energy and the performance analysis shows that energy consumption obtained is 1.35 kWh, SLA violation is 9.2 and VM migration is about 268. Thus, there is an improvement in energy consumption of about 1.8% and a 2.1% improvement (reduction) in violations of SLA in comparison to existing techniques.},

The primary limitation of previous methodologies has been the dependence on data that can be structured in a grid format. However, physiological recordings often exhibit irregular and unordered patterns, posing a significant challenge in conceptualising them as matrices. As a result, GNNs which comprise interactive nodes connected by edges whose weights are defined by anatomical junctions or temporal relationships have received a lot of consideration by leveraging implicit data that exists in a biological system. Additionally, our study incorporates a structural GNN to effectively differentiate between different degrees of infection in both the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Subsequently, demographic data are included, and a multi-task learning architecture is devised, integrating classification and regression tasks. The trials used an authentic dataset, including 800 brain x-ray pictures, consisting of 560 instances classified as moderate cases and 240 instances classified as severe cases. Based on empirical evidence, our methodology demonstrates superior performance in classification, surpassing other comparison methods with a notable achievement of 92.27% in terms of area under the curve as well as a correlation coefficient of 0.62.},

However, in the face of increasingly complex optimization challenges, the Bat algorithm encounters certain limitations, such as slow convergence and sensitivity to initial solutions. In order to tackle these challenges, the present study incorporates a range of optimization components into the Bat algorithm, thereby proposing a variant called PKEBA. A projection screening strategy is implemented to mitigate its sensitivity to initial solutions, thereby enhancing the quality of the initial solution set. A kinetic adaptation strategy reforms exploration patterns, while an elite communication strategy enhances group interaction, to avoid algorithm from local optima. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the proposed PKEBA is rigorously evaluated. Testing encompasses 30 benchmark functions from IEEE CEC2014, featuring ablation experiments and comparative assessments against classical algorithms and their variants. Moreover, real-world engineering problems are employed as further validation. The results conclusively demonstrate that PKEBA exhibits superior convergence and precision compared to existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Tibetan medical named entity recognition (Tibetan MNER) involves extracting specific types of medical entities from unstructured Tibetan medical texts. Tibetan MNER provide important data support for the work related to Tibetan medicine. However, existing Tibetan MNER methods often struggle to comprehensively capture multi-level semantic information, failing to sufficiently extract multi-granularity features and effectively filter out irrelevant information, which ultimately impacts the accuracy of entity recognition. This paper proposes an improved embedding representation method called syllable–word–sentence embedding. By leveraging features at different granularities and using un-scaled dot-product attention to focus on key features for feature fusion, the syllable–word–sentence embedding is integrated into the transformer, enhancing the specificity and diversity of feature representations. The model leverages multi-level and multi-granularity semantic information, thereby improving the performance of Tibetan MNER. We evaluate our proposed model on datasets from various domains. The results indicate that the model effectively identified three types of entities in the Tibetan news dataset we constructed, achieving an F1 score of 93.59%, which represents an improvement of 1.24% compared to the vanilla FLAT. Additionally, results from the Tibetan medical dataset we developed show that it is effective in identifying five kinds of medical entities, with an F1 score of 71.39%, which is a 1.34% improvement over the vanilla FLAT.},

  abstract     = {Modern automated generation control (AGC) is increasingly complex, requiring precise frequency control for stability and operational accuracy. Traditional PID controller optimisation methods often struggle to handle nonlinearities and meet robustness requirements across diverse operational scenarios. This paper introduces an enhanced strategy using a multi-objective optimisation framework and a modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (SNSGA). The proposed model optimises the PID controller by minimising key performance metrics: integration time squared error (ITSE), integration time absolute error (ITAE), and rate of change of deviation (J). This approach balances convergence rate, overshoot, and oscillation dynamics effectively. A fuzzy-based method is employed to select the most suitable solution from the Pareto set. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the SNSGA-based approach offers superior tuning capabilities over traditional NSGA-II and other advanced control methods. In a two-area thermal power system without reheat, the SNSGA significantly reduces settling times for frequency deviations: 2.94s for and 4.98s for , marking improvements of 31.6% and 13.4% over NSGA-II, respectively.},

In this research study a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model optimised by the genetic algorithm (GA) is addressed. This paper contributes to enhancing age prediction as a regression problem using a union of two CNNs and exchanging knowledge between them. This specifically re-starts the training process from a possibly higher-quality point in different iterations and, consequently, causes potentially yeilds better results at each iteration. The method proposed, which is called cooperative deep neural network (Co-DeepNet), is tested on two types of age prediction problems. Sixteen datasets containing 1899 healthy blood samples and nine datasets containing 2395 diseased blood samples are employed to examine the method's efficiency. As a result, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) is 1.49 and 3.61 years for training and testing data, respectively, when the healthy data is tested. The diseased blood data show MAD results of 3.81 and 5.43 years for training and testing data, respectively. The results of the Co-DeepNet are compared with six other methods proposed in previous studies and a single CNN using four prediction accuracy measurements ( R 2 , MAD, MSE and RMSE).

However, existing models often fail to fully explore domain-unique knowledge of the target graph for detecting unique anomalies. Additionally, they tend to focus solely on node-level differences, overlooking structural-level differences that provide complementary information for common anomaly detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, Synthetic Graph Anomaly Detection via Graph Transfer and Graph Decouple (GTGD), which effectively detects common and unique anomalies in the target graph. Specifically, our approach ensures deeper learning of domain-unique knowledge by decoupling the reconstruction graphs of common and unique features. Moreover, we simultaneously consider node-level and structural-level differences by transferring node and edge information from the source graph to the target graph, enabling comprehensive domain-common knowledge representation. Anomalies are detected using both common and unique features, with their synthetic score serving as the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving an average performance by 12.6 on the AUC-PR compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

Since recommenders proactively suggest items based on user preference, they are a promising solution for this problem. Travellers visit tourist attractions sequentially by considering multiple attributes at the same time. Therefore, it is desirable to consider this when developing recommenders for tourist attractions. Using GRU4REC, we proposed RNN-based sequence-aware recommenders (RNN-SARs) that use multiple sequence datasets for training the recommended model, named multi-RNN-SARs. We proposed two types of multi-RNN-SARs—concatenate-RNN-SARs and parallel-RNN-SARs. In order to evaluate multi-RNN-SARs, we compared hit rate (HR) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of the item-based collaborative filtering recommender (item-CFR), RNN-SAR with the single-sequence dataset (basic-RNN-SAR), multi-RNN-SARs and the state-of-the-art SARs using a real-world travel dataset. Our research shows that multi-RNN-SARs have significantly higher performances compared to item-CFR. Not all multi-RNN-SARs outperform basic-RNN-SAR but the best multi-RNN-SAR achieves comparable performance to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms. These results highlight the importance of using multiple sequence datasets in RNN-SARs and the importance of choosing appropriate sequence datasets and learning methods for implementing multi-RNN-SARs in practice.},

  abstract     = {Urban traffic prediction with high precision is always the unremitting pursuit of intelligent transportation systems and is instrumental in bringing smart cities into reality. The fundamental challenges for traffic prediction lie in the accurate modelling of spatial and temporal traffic dynamics. Existing approaches mainly focus on modelling the traffic data itself, but do not explore the traffic correlations implicit in origin-destination (OD) data. In this paper, we propose STOD-Net, a dynamic spatial-temporal OD feature-enhanced deep network, to simultaneously predict the in-traffic and out-traffic for each and every region of a city. We model the OD data as dynamic graphs and adopt graph neural networks in STOD-Net to learn a low-dimensional representation for each region. As per the region feature, we design a gating mechanism and operate it on the traffic feature learning to explicitly capture spatial correlations. To further capture the complicated spatial and temporal dependencies among different regions, we propose a novel joint feature, learning block in STOD-Net and transfer the hybrid OD features to each block to make the learning process spatiotemporal-aware. We evaluate the effectiveness of STOD-Net on two benchmark datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art by approximately 5% in terms of prediction accuracy and considerably improves prediction stability up to 80% in terms of standard deviation.},

  abstract     = {Referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to locate a specific region in an image described by a natural language. Existing two-stage methods generate multiple candidate proposals in the first stage, followed by selecting one of these proposals as the grounding result in the second stage. Nevertheless, the number of candidate proposals generated in the first stage significantly exceeds ground truth and the recall of critical objects is inadequate, thereby enormously limiting the overall network performance. To address the above issues, the authors propose an innovative method termed Separate Non-Maximum Suppression (Sep-NMS) for two-stage REC. Particularly, Sep-NMS models information from the two stages independently and collaboratively, ultimately achieving an overall improvement in comprehension and identification of the target objects. Specifically, the authors propose a Ref-Relatedness module for filtering referent proposals rigorously, decreasing the redundancy of referent proposals. A Relatedness module based on robust multimodal pre-trained encoders is built to precisely assess the relevance between language and proposals to improve the recall of critical objects. It is worth mentioning that the authors are the pioneers in utilising a multimodal pre-training model for proposal filtering in the first stage. Moreover, an Information Fusion module is designed to effectively amalgamate the multimodal information across two stages, ensuring maximum utilisation of the available information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the approach achieves competitive performance with previous state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Although the image dehazing problem has received considerable attention over recent years, the existing models often prioritise performance at the expense of complexity, making them unsuitable for real-world applications, which require algorithms to be deployed on resource constrained-devices. To address this challenge, we propose WaveLiteDehaze-Network (WLD-Net), an end-to-end dehazing model that delivers performance comparable to complex models while operating in real time and using significantly fewer parameters. This approach capitalises on the insight that haze predominantly affects low-frequency information. By exclusively processing the image in the frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), we segregate the image into high and low frequencies and process them separately. This allows us to preserve high-frequency details and recover low-frequency components affected by haze, distinguishing our method from existing approaches that use spatial domain processing as the backbone, with DWT serving as an auxiliary component. DWT is applied at multiple levels for better information retention while also accelerating computation by downsampling feature maps. Subsequently, a learning-based fusion mechanism reintegrates the processed frequencies to reconstruct the dehazed image. Experiments show that WLD-Net outperforms other low-parameter models on real-world hazy images and rivals much larger models, achieving the highest PSNR and SSIM scores on the O-Haze dataset. Qualitatively, the proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in handling a diverse range of haze types, delivering visually pleasing results and robust performance, while also generalising well across different scenarios. With only 0.385 million parameters (more than 100 times smaller than comparable dehazing methods), WLD-Net processes 1024 × 1024 images in just 0.045 s, highlighting its applicability across various real-world scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/AliMurtaza29/WLD-Net .},

  abstract     = {Early exiting has shown significant potential in accelerating the inference of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by allowing easy samples to exit from shallow layers. However, existing early exiting methods primarily rely on local information from individual samples to estimate prediction uncertainty for making exiting decisions, overlooking the global information provided by the sample population. This impacts the estimation of prediction uncertainty, compromising the reliability of exiting decisions. To remedy this, inspired by principal component analysis (PCA), the authors define a residual score to capture the deviation of features from the principal space of the sample population, providing a global perspective for estimating prediction uncertainty. Building on this, a two-stage exiting strategy is proposed that integrates global information from residual scores with local information from energy scores at both the decision and feature levels. This strategy incorporates three-way decisions to enable more reliable exiting decisions for boundary region samples by delaying judgement. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark validate that the method achieves an average speed-up ratio of 2.17× across all tasks with minimal performance degradation. Additionally, it surpasses the state-of-the-art E-LANG by in model acceleration, along with a performance improvement of 0.6 points, demonstrating a better performance-efficiency trade-off.},

  abstract     = {The goal of point cloud completion is to reconstruct raw scanned point clouds acquired from incomplete observations due to occlusion and restricted viewpoints. Numerous methods use a partial-to-complete framework, directly predicting missing components via global characteristics extracted from incomplete inputs. However, this makes detail recovery challenging, as global characteristics fail to provide complete missing component specifics. A new point cloud completion method named Point-PC is proposed. A memory network and a causal inference model are separately designed to introduce shape priors and select absent shape information as supplementary geometric factors for aiding completion. Concretely, a memory mechanism is proposed to store complete shape features and their associated shapes in a key-value format. The authors design a pre-training strategy that uses contrastive learning to map incomplete shape features into the complete shape feature domain, enabling retrieval of analogous shapes from incomplete inputs. In addition, the authors employ backdoor adjustment to eliminate confounders, which are shape prior components sharing identical semantic structures with incomplete inputs. Experiments conducted on three datasets show that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to improve anomaly detection techniques, particularly in the context of high-dimensional, distributed clinical data. Analysing patient data within clinical settings reveals a pronounced focus on refining diagnostic accuracy, personalising treatment plans, and optimising resource allocation to enhance clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, this domain faces unique challenges, such as irregular data collection, inconsistent data quality, and patient-specific structural variations. This paper proposed a novel hybrid approach that integrates heuristic and stochastic methods for anomaly detection in patient clinical data to address these challenges. The strategy combines HPO-based optimal Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise for clustering patient exercise data, facilitating efficient anomaly identification. Subsequently, a stochastic method based on the Interquartile Range filters unreliable data points, ensuring that medical tools and professionals receive only the most pertinent and accurate information. The primary objective of this study is to equip healthcare professionals and researchers with a robust tool for managing extensive, high-dimensional clinical datasets, enabling effective isolation and removal of aberrant data points. Furthermore, a sophisticated regression model has been developed using Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to assess the impact of the ensemble abnormal pattern detection approach. Various statistical error estimation techniques validate the efficacy of the hybrid approach alongside AutoML. Experimental results show that implementing this innovative hybrid model on patient rehabilitation data leads to a notable enhancement in AutoML performance, with an average improvement of 0.041 in the score, surpassing the effectiveness of traditional regression models.},

This work presents a Stacking Ensemble-based Deep Learning Framework for Enhanced Lung Disease Diagnosis (SEDLF-LDD). The stacking is a widely used ensemble learning technique that enhances the model's performance by combining the predictions from multiple base-learners using a meta-learner. The proposed framework selects the five best-performing pre-trained models, namely, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, VGG16, VGG19, and DenseNet201, as the base-learners and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) as a meta-learner. To ensure broader applicability, we curated a dataset of chest X-ray images of Lung Disease. Initially, we choose the ten transfer learning models, fine-tune them to extract features relevant to respiratory diseases on the dataset, and select Top-5 best-performing models as base-learners. The effectiveness of the framework is determined by analysis of precision, recall, F1-score, or the area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve. The experimental results show an effective result with 97.65% accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Despite high predictive performance, machine learning models can be unfair towards specific demographic subgroups characterized by sensitive attributes such as gender or race. This paper presents a novel approach using Computational Profile Likelihood (CPL) to assess potential bias in neural network decisions with respect to sensitive attributes. CPL estimates the conditional probability of a network's internal neuron excitation levels during predictions. To assess the impact of sensitive attributes on predictions, the CPL distribution of individuals sharing a particular value of a sensitive attribute and a specific outcome (e.g., “women” and “high income”) is compared to a subgroup sharing another value of the sensitive attribute but with the same outcome (e.g., “men” and “high income”). The resulting disparities between distributions can be used to quantify the bias with respect to the sensitive attribute and the outcome class. We also assess the efficacy of bias reduction techniques through their influence on the resulting disparities. Experimental results on three widely used datasets indicate that the CPL of the trained models can be used to characterize significant differences between multiple protected groups, highlighting that these models display quantifiable biases. Furthermore, after applying bias mitigation methods, the gaps in CPL distributions are reduced, indicating a more similar internal representation for profiles of different protected groups.},

However, existing active DA methods often struggle in real-world scenarios where, due to data privacy concerns, only a pre-trained source model is available, rather than the source samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called the structure-based uncertainty estimation model (SUEM) for source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA). To be specific, we introduce an innovative active sample selection strategy that combines both uncertainty and diversity sampling to identify the most informative samples. We assess the uncertainty in target samples using structure-wise probabilities and implement a diversity selection method to minimise redundancy. For the selected samples, we not only apply standard-supervised loss but also conduct interpolation consistency training to further explore the structural information of the target domain. Extensive experiments across four widely used datasets demonstrate that our method is comparable to or outperforms current UDA and active DA methods.},

  abstract     = {Skeleton-based action recognition using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) has achieved remarkable performance, but recognising ambiguous actions, such as ‘waving’ and ‘saluting’, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on a serial combination of GCNs and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), where spatial and temporal features are extracted independently, leading to an unbalanced spatial-temporal information, which hinders accurate action recognition. Moreover, existing methods for ambiguous actions often overemphasise local details, resulting in the loss of crucial global context, which further complicates the task of differentiating ambiguous actions. To address these challenges, the authors propose a lightweight plug-and-play module called Synchronised and Fine-grained Head (SF-Head), inserted between GCN and TCN layers. SF-Head first conducts Synchronised Spatial-Temporal Extraction (SSTE) with a Feature Redundancy Loss (F-RL), ensuring a balanced interaction between the two types of features. It then performs Adaptive Cross-dimensional Feature Aggregation (AC-FA), with a Feature Consistency Loss (F-CL), which aligns the aggregated feature with their original spatial-temporal feature. This aggregation step effectively combines both global context and local details, enhancing the model's ability to classify ambiguous actions. Experimental results on NTU RGB + D 60, NTU RGB + D 120, NW-UCLA and PKU-MMD I datasets demonstrate significant improvements in distinguishing ambiguous actions.

  abstract     = {In the field of oncology, lung cancer is a leading contributor to cancer-related mortality, highlighting the need for early detection of lung nodules for effective intervention. However, accurate segmentation of lung nodules in Computed Tomography (CT) images remains a significant challenge due to issues such as heterogeneous nodule dimensions, low contrast, and their visual similarity with surrounding tissues. To address these challenges, this study proposes the Edge-Enhanced Feature Pyramid SwinUNet (EE-FPS-UNet), an advanced segmentation model that integrates a modified Swin Transformer with a feature pyramid network (FPN). The research objective is to enhance boundary delineation and multi-scale feature aggregation for improved segmentation performance. The proposed model uses the Swin Transformer to capture long-range dependencies and integrates an FPN for robust multi-scale feature aggregation. Its window-based self-attention mechanism also reduces computational complexity, making it well-suited for high-resolution CT images. Additionally, an edge detection module enhances segmentation by providing edge-related features to the decoder, improving boundary precision. A comparative analysis evaluates the EE-FPS-UNet against leading models, including PSPNet, U-Net, Attention U-Net, and DeepLabV3. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms these models, achieving a Dice Similarity of 0.91 and a sensitivity of 0.89, establishing its efficacy for lung nodule segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Accurate point correspondences is critical for rigid point cloud registration in correspondence-based methods. Many previous learning-based methods employ encoder-decoder backbone for point feature extraction, while applying attention mechanism for sparse superpoints to deal with the partial overlap situation. However, few of these methods focus on the intermediate layers yet mainly pay attention on the top-most patch features, thus neglecting multi-faceted feature perspectives leading to potential overlap areas estimation inaccuracy. Meanwhile, obtaining correct correspondences is usually interfered with the one-to-many case and outliers. To address these issues, we propose a multi-level features extraction network with integrating linear dual attention mechanism into skip-connection stage of encoder-decoder backbone, both efficiently suppressing irrelevant information and guiding residual features to learn the common regions on which the network should focus to tackle the overlap estimation inaccuracy issue, combined with a parallel-structured decoder forming distinguishable features and potential overlapping regions. Additionally, a two-stage correspondences pruning process is designed to tackle the mismatch issue, which mainly depends on the rigid geometric constraint. Extensive experiments conducted on indoor and outdoor scene datasets demonstrate our method's accuracy and stability, by outperforming state-of-the-art methods on registration recall.},

Therefore, precise segmentation of lesions has become an essential prerequisite for patient condition assessment and formulation of treatment plans. Significant achievements have been made in research related to the U-Net model in recent years. It improves segmentation performance and is extensively applied in the semantic segmentation of medical images to offer technical support for consistent quantitative lesion analysis methods. First, this paper classifies medical image datasets on the basis of their imaging modalities and then examines U-Net and its various improvement models from the perspective of structural modifications. The research objectives, innovative designs, and limitations of each approach are discussed in detail. Second, we summarise the four central improvement mechanisms of the U-Net and U-Net variant algorithms: the jump-connection mechanism, the residual-connection mechanism, 3D-UNet, and the transformer mechanism. Finally, we examine the relationships among the four core enhancement mechanisms and commonly utilized medical datasets and propose potential avenues and strategies for future advancements. This paper provides a systematic summary and reference for researchers in related fields, and we look forward to designing more efficient and stable medical image segmentation network models based on the U-Net network.},

  abstract     = {The extensive coverage of satellite constellations has rendered the satellite–terrestrial integrated network (STIN) a pivotal solution for communication and computation services in internet of vehicles (IoVs) rescuing in remote or disaster areas with limited terrestrial networks. To optimise network resource utilisation and service quality, the integration of the service function chain (SFC) into STIN-enabled IoV rescuing systems has become essential. However, traditional SFC-based STIN systems encounter challenges in flow scheduling flexibility, stemming from the sequential execution of subtasks on satellites equipped with virtual network functions (VNFs). This leads to a trade-off between data volume reduction and the additional communication and computation energy costs incurred in the orbit. To address this issue, this paper introduces a space ground collaborative SFC (SGC-SFC) flow scheduling strategy. This strategy enables the execution of subtasks on either VNF-equipped satellites or the ground vehicle formation, contingent on network conditions. Firstly, we carry out a computation–space–time graph (CSTG) model specifically for the STIN-enabled IoV rescuing system with SFC. This model integrates the computational layer into the space–time graph (STG), accurately capturing the data volume reduction characteristics and sequential execution constraints of SFC in the STIN-enabled IoV rescuing system. Secondly, a SGC-SFC flow scheduling algorithm is designed to identify a set of feasible paths with minimal energy cost and maximum processable data volume. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed SGC-SFC under diverse conditions.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel computational framework for modeling complex thermo-mechanical fracture behavior. A high-order element formulation is established on the basis of the hierarchical quadrature element method (HQEM) to perform spatial discretization of transient heat conduction problems. Due to the use of hierarchical, high-order shape functions, temperature gradients can be effectively captured even on relatively coarse meshes. The discretized transient heat conduction equation is subsequently solved using an implicit time integration scheme, specifically, the backward difference method. Numerical validation against the commercial software ABAQUS demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed approach in simulating heat transfer and predicting thermoelastic deformation fields under mixed thermal boundary conditions. Furthermore, HQEM is integrated with the virtual crack closure method (VCCM) for the evaluation of fracture parameters in two-dimensional cracked structures subjected to coupled thermo-mechanical loadings. Within the VCCM framework, a unified explicit expression of the virtual crack closure integral is derived for HQEM with arbitrary nodal configurations.

The study focuses on defining and examining various types of consensus within this model, addressing strict and more relaxed disagreements. The consensus problem is then explored at the coalition level. The key properties and quantitative measures for evaluating consensus quality are discussed. Finally, the negotiation process is investigated. The first approach is based on the expanding range of preferences derived from different definitions of consensus, and the second is focusing on issues position adjustment in order-based conflict situation. Using examples, including a medical case with multiple specialists, the paper demonstrates the practical utility of the methods. In general, this work improves the understanding of preference-based conflicts and the possibility of consensus, contributing to more effective decision-making processes.},

In this method, the governing equations are spatially discretized within the framework of the total Lagrangian material point method (TLMPM) and temporally discretized using an explicit time integration scheme. To address the issue of decreased computational accuracy of the material point method (MPM) near physical domain boundaries, a Gaussian kernel function with kernel correction is employed to establish the interpolation formulas between particles and the background grid. Furthermore, to mitigate volumetric locking caused by the nearly incompressible nature of soft materials, the F -bar method is further developed within the framework of TLMPM. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed STLMPM are demonstrated by several representative numerical examples, and the simulation results are compared with analytical solutions and other numerical methods.},

  abstract     = {The long-term performance of pavement structures is influenced by the combined effects of repeated traffic loads and environmental conditions, such as temperature variations. Traditional numerical approaches face significant challenges in simulating the decades-long lifespan of pavements due to the vast disparity between the time scales of individual loading events and the overall lifespan. This paper presents a novel framework for the thermo-mechanical analysis of pavement structures, based on a time homogenization technique to efficiently predict long-term performance. An Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation is employed to simulate the mechanical response of pavements to consecutive tire overruns, while a thermo-mechanical material model accounts for the effects of temperature variations. A key innovation is the treatment of history variables (HVs). The framework incorporates both spatial and temporal mapping of HVs, enabling the extrapolation of material behavior when the evolution rate of HVs stabilizes. This allows for the skipping of computationally expensive tire overruns, significantly reducing simulation time without compromising accuracy. Numerical examples demonstrate the framework's ability to predict the long-term response of pavement structures under realistic traffic and thermal conditions.},

  abstract     = {Reduced-basis methods (RBMs) constitute a promising technique for delivering numerical solutions of parameterized PDEs in real time and with reasonable accuracy. The most significant drawback of RBMs is the requirement of parametric affinity, a condition that only very trivial problems satisfy. Without parametric affinity, the reduced model cannot be quickly assembled in the online stage. The most common solution to this issue is to establish a form of approximate parametric affinity. However, most methods for doing so are highly intrusive: they require in-depth expert knowledge of the problem to be solved, of the high-fidelity simulation software for solving it, or both. It is often impossible to adapt a high-fidelity software package for RBMs without significant source-code edits. We present an approach for approximate affinization based on least-squares projected quantities over a predetermined function space. We contend that this offers a method for affinization with minimal impact, which we demonstrate by producing linear elastic RBMs for components using two widely different simulation software packages, without source code edits and with no significant expert knowledge.},

Computational methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) typically face convergence problems for such microstructures unless specific discretizations are used, most prominently the discretization on the staggered grid. FFT-based methods were originally developed for periodic boundary conditions, and recent work provided extensions to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the unit cube faces by utilizing dedicated sine and cosine series. Unfortunately, such approaches were only developed for discretizations that fail to converge for complex porous microstructures. The article at hand closes this gap by constructing the appropriate Eshelby-Green operator for the displacement gradient associated with the staggered grid discretization and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The eponymous staggering of the displacement variables infers certain challenges to be resolved, that is, the construction is significantly more difficult than for the cases discussed in the literature. However, our innovative techniques permit treating the class of microporous materials—which have a wide range of applicability—in a robust and efficient way.

Their popularity comes from their effective minimization of expensive function evaluations, their capability to leverage gradients, and their efficient use of noisy data. Bayesian optimizers have commonly been applied to global unconstrained problems, with limited development for many other classes of problems. In this article, two alternative methods are developed that enable rapid and deep convergence of nonlinearly-constrained local optimization problems using a Bayesian optimizer. The first method uses an exact augmented Lagrangian and the second augments the minimization of the acquisition function to contain additional constraints. Both of these methods can be applied to nonlinear equality constraints, unlike most previous methods developed for constrained Bayesian optimizers. The new methods are applied with a gradient-enhanced Bayesian optimizer and enable deeper convergence for three nonlinearly-constrained unimodal optimization problems than previously developed methods for constrained Bayesian optimization. In addition, both new methods enable the Bayesian optimizer to reach a desired tolerance with fewer function evaluations than popular quasi-Newton optimizers from SciPy and MATLAB for unimodal problems with 2 to 30 variables. The Bayesian optimizer had similar results using both methods. It is recommended that users first try using the second method, which adds constraints to the acquisition function minimization, since its parameters are more intuitive to tune for new problems.},

The depth allows introducing rankings and orderings to data living in multivariate, or function spaces. Though widely applied and with much experimental success, little theoretical progress has been made in analysing functional depths. This article highlights how the common h -depth and related depths from functional data analysis can be viewed as a kernel mean embedding, widely used in statistical machine learning. This facilitates answers to several open questions regarding the statistical properties of functional depths. We show that (i) h -depth has the interpretation of a kernel-based method; (ii) several h -depths possess explicit expressions, without the need to estimate them using Monte Carlo procedures; (iii) under minimal assumptions, -depths and their maximisers are uniformly strongly consistent and asymptotically Gaussian (also in infinite-dimensional spaces and for imperfectly observed functional data); and (iv) several -depths uniquely characterise probability distributions in separable Hilbert spaces. In addition, we also provide a link between the depth and empirical characteristic function based procedures for functional data. Finally, the unveiled connections enable to design an extension of the -depth towards regression problems.},

It shows that the emerging best practice relies heavily on the approach and tools created by the original authors of the causal forest such as their grf package and the approaches given by them in examples. Generally, researchers use the causal forest on a relatively low-dimensional dataset relying on observed controls or in some cases experiments to identify effects. There are several common ways to then communicate results–by mapping out the univariate distribution of individual-level treatment effect estimates, displaying variable importance results for the forest and graphing the distribution of treatment effects across covariates that are important either for theoretical reasons or because they have high variable importance. Some deviations from this common practice are interesting and deserve further development and use. Others are unnecessary or even harmful. The paper concludes by reflecting on the emerging best practice for causal forest use and paths for future research.},

In theory, we establish the sure screening property under less restrictive assumptions on data types. The proposed procedure does not require model specification, gives a more effective geometric measure to compare the discrepancy between distributions and avoids introducing biases caused by the choice of slicing rules for continuous data. Numerical comparison indicates that the proposed Wasserstein-SIS method performs better than existing methods in various models.

Subsequently, a new estimand, which calibrates the ‘true’ chance-corrected IRA, is introduced while accounting for the potential ‘probabilistic certainty’. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the reviewed IRA methods under various practical scenarios and were summarised by an agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis.

  abstract     = {Despite the widespread success of the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) method in molecular simulations, its high computational cost due to dense molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) sampling limits its application in large-scale systems. Here we present DF-RESP, which combines the density fitting MEP (DF-MEP) method with RESP charge derivation to dramatically accelerate calculations while maintaining accuracy. Compared to conventional RESP calculations, DF-RESP achieves excellent accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) in charges below 0.003 e for the S22 benchmark and electrostatic interaction energy deviations under 0.1 kcal/mol. For androgen receptor–ligand complexes, DF-RESP achieves an MAE of less than 0.06 kcal/mol. Notably, DF-RESP precisely captures conformational energy variations in Ser-Ala-Gly tripeptide dynamics through charge analysis and achieves a 14-fold speedup for the 1493-atom protein 1h59 while maintaining comparable accuracy. These results demonstrate that DF-RESP is a computationally efficient and reliable approach for RESP charge calculations in large-scale biomolecular simulations.},

This research investigates the structural, optical, and electrical properties of Ca 3 BiCl 3 utilizing the CASTEP module in the context of density functional theory (DFT). To enhance the photovoltaic efficacy of Ca 3 BiCl 3 -based solar cells (SCs), two hole transport layers (HTLs), Spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT, and two electron transport layers (ETLs), C 60 and WS 2 , were investigated. The Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D) was utilized to undertake a comprehensive numerical analysis of Ca 3 BiCl 3 SCs, employing essential semiconductor equations such as Poisson's equation, the carrier continuity equations, and the drift-diffusion model. A comprehensive parameter analysis was performed, including factors such as layer thickness, doping density, temperature, carrier production and recombination rates, defect densities at the interfaces and the bulk material, quantum efficiency, and series vs. shunt resistance. After optimizing the ETL and HTL settings, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 27.54% was attained using WS 2 as the ETL and P3HT as the HTL. This arrangement produced a short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 23.393 mA/cm 2 , an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.313 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 89.64%. The results highlight the significant potential of Ca 3 BiCl 3 as an effective absorber material, especially in conjunction with WS 2 and P3HT, for the progression of high-efficiency perovskite heterostructure SCs.},

In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanism influencing the need for orbital planarity and the role of frontier orbital overlap in magnetic exchange interactions. To study this, we designed a series of 12 polyacene-coupled triarylmethyl diradicals, systematically increasing in length of polyacene. We have used nine different DFT functionals for the calculation of the magnetic exchange coupling constant ( J ). The calculation of magnetic exchange coupling reveals that the GGA functionals define a more accurate spin state, hence more correct magnetic behavior than the meta-GGA and hybrid functionals. We have studied the effect of orbital orientation and their energy gap to understand the high magnetic exchange coupling in the higher polyacene-coupled diradicals. Our calculations revealed that the planarity and overlap of the frontier molecular orbitals are one of the key factors in influencing the strength and behavior of the magnetic exchange interactions in diradicals. Specifically, the overlap between SOMOs and LUMO influences the strength of the magnetic exchange interaction.},

Yet, they hold the promise to be efficient light emitters. Their high-throughput identification demands exceptionally accurate excited-state modeling to minimize qualitatively wrong predictions. We benchmark twelve energy gaps to find that the local-correlated versions of ADC(2) and CC2 excited state methods deliver excellent accuracy and speed for screening medium-sized molecules. Notably, we find that double-hybrid DFT approximations (e.g., B2GP-PLYP and PBE-QIDH) exhibit high mean absolute errors ( ) despite very low standard deviations ( ). Exploring their parameter space reveals that a configuration with 75% exchange and 55% correlation, which reduces the mean absolute error to below 5 meV, but with an increased variance. Using this low-bias parameterization as an internal reference, we correct the systematic error while maintaining low variance, effectively combining the strengths of both low-bias and low-variance DFT parameterizations to enhance overall accuracy. Our findings suggest that low-variance DFT methods, often overlooked due to their high bias, can serve as reliable tools for predictive modeling in first-principles molecular design. The bias-correction data-fitting procedure can be applied to any general problem where two flavors of a method, one with low bias and another with low variance, have been identified a priori.},

Insight from the intra -organizational leadership literature suggests that an effective inter -organizational leadership model could help address project-level coordination challenges. Adopting an agency theory view complemented by role theory, this study examines the antecedents and outcomes of rotational leadership (i.e., shifting leadership roles in a process) in a buyer NPD project involving suppliers. The results indicate a U-shaped relationship between rotational leadership and project performance by analyzing a paired sample of quantitative and qualitative data for 279 NPD projects. In a post hoc qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), this study triangulates quantitative results using interview data, showing that buyers adopt boundary buffering to address potential rotational leadership risks while achieving high project performance. Both buyer risk-taking and supplier relationship-specific investments contribute to the emergence of rotational leadership. These results enrich supplier involvement in the NPD literature by demonstrating (1) when rotational leadership emerges and (2) how it affects project performance. The findings also provide managerial implications for leadership role arrangements and boundary-buffering decisions in the context of collaborative innovation in the supply chain.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses a critical gap in understanding the development of crossover products, particularly in the context of collaborative product development within the PC game market's supply chain. Traditionally, firms have focused on incorporating common product characteristics from a single market segment (e.g., genre) to minimize potential penalties associated with ambiguous product identities. However, recent trends show that “crossover” products, those that integrate distinctive features from multiple segments, have emerged due to their superior performance. Developing such innovative products requires profound expertise across multiple market segments, especially when supply chain partners collaborate. While prior research has explored the market performance of crossover products, it has offered limited understanding of the conditions required for their development. To address this gap, we propose a theoretical framework grounded in the input–output perspective of operations management, which examines how portfolio similarity between partners influences the ease of expertise reconfiguration and the breadth of segment-spanning expertise needed for crossover product development. Our findings reveal an inverted U-shaped relationship between portfolio similarity and the degree of crossover, suggesting that moderate similarity fosters the most effective reconfiguration of expertise. Further, we find that collaboration experience with the partner moderates the inverted U-shaped relationship.},

Furthermore, our results reveal that the policy's unintended consequences were intensified under high levels of prescribing workload and market competition. These findings augment the understanding of the negative impacts of the former and unveil an unfavorable corollary to the positive impacts of the latter. We complemented these results with a qualitative study that revealed the presence of coercive, mimetic, and normative pressures and the influence of prescribing workload and market competition in the prescribing context, instilling confidence in our theorizing, results, and contributions.

  abstract     = {How does the development of Analytics Capability (AC) of a firm influence its supply chain performance? With increasing numbers of firms adopting data analytics to enhance their supply chains and overall performance, this question has become particularly important. To answer the question, this study proposes and tests three dominant supply chain capabilities (integration, flexibility, and resilience) as key mechanisms through which AC is linked with operational performance. We use 405 effect sizes reported in 174 prior empirical studies based on data gathered from 104,296 informants to draw insights using a meta-analytic structural equation modeling approach. The theory developed herein contributes to the literature by demonstrating that integration, flexibility, and resilience mediate the association between AC and operational performance, which in turn affects customer service performance. Specifically, a substantial degree of variance in the effects of AC on operational performance is mediated by integration, flexibility, and resilience, respectively. We also find that the effect size for the association between AC and operational performance is higher in developing economies, while the link between operational performance and customer service performance is higher in developed economies. Our analyses are robust to several empirical challenges, including (a) common method bias, (b) outliers, (c) endogeneity, and (d) journal quality, attesting to the stability of the findings. Overall, our results suggest that supply chain integration, flexibility, and resilience are key domains of managerial and theoretical focus for implementing firms' data analytics initiatives, reinforcing the role of the supply chain in leveraging data analytics capabilities.},

As organizational defenses and tactics of antagonistic actors (e.g., hackers) adapt to emerging conditions, certain actors of organizations become compromised as entry points into the targeted organizations. A disruption (i.e., COVID-19) induces operational changes (i.e., digital transformation), and we study the co-evolution of attacks and defenses as if the antagonistic actors, organizations, and their internal and external actors are engaged in a dance together. Building on routine activity theory, our study theorizes the adaptive target suitability where the properties of actors, the types of actors involved, and the consequential phases co-evolve following the disruption. We leverage the COVID-19 pandemic as the empirical context and use a novel dataset of 3497 publicly reported cyber breaches. Analyses reveal that cyberattacks initially focused on internal actors (i.e., deception-based attacks on employees) and then shifted to external actors (i.e., system vulnerability-based attacks on digital infrastructure providers and product suppliers). Semi-structured interviews with experts (e.g., hackers and cybersecurity managers) and subsequent econometric analyses elucidate how strategic interactions between dance partners lead to disruptions that dynamically reshape the landscape of chained vulnerability.},

We also consider two conditions that may strengthen the relationship between female board representation and workplace safety: (1) the power of the female directors on the board, which may cause them to speak out more, and cause others to heed their perspectives; (2) accountability pressures faced by the board, which may increase board member epistemological motivation (the willingness to invest effort to fully understand the board's tasks and decisions being made). Analyzing a unique dataset that covers 1442 firm-year observations across 266 firms, we show that female board representation improves workplace safety when women have more power and when boards face greater accountability pressures. In an empirical extension, we examine how the representation of racial/ethnic minority directors impacts workplace safety and the synergistic effect of female and minority board representation. Our findings deepen our understanding of how board diversity interacts with situational factors to influence operational outcomes.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the field of identifying financial asset price bubbles, particularly through the development of time-series unit-root tests featuring fractionally integrated errors and panel unit-root tests. This study introduces an innovative approach for assessing the sign of the persistence parameter ( α ) within a panel fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, based on the least squares estimator of α . This method incorporates three distinct test statistics based on the Hurst parameter ( H ), which can take values in the range of ( 1 / 2 , 1 ) , be equal to 1 / 2 , or fall within the interval of ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) . The null hypothesis corresponds to α = 0 . Based on a panel of continuous records of observations, the null asymptotic distributions are obtained when the time span ( T ) is fixed and the number of cross sections ( N ) goes to infinity. The power function of the tests is obtained under the local alternative where α is close to zero in the order of 1 / ( T ⁢ N ) . This alternative covers the departure from the unit root hypothesis from the explosive side, enabling the calculation of lower power in bubble tests. The hypothesis testing problem and the local power function are also considered when a panel of discrete-sampled observations is available under a sequential limit, that is, the sampling interval shrinks to zero followed by the N goes to infinity.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we develop two families of sequential monitoring procedure to (timely) detect changes in the parameters of a GARCH(1,1) model. Our statistics can be applied irrespective of whether the historical sample is stationary or not, and indeed without previous knowledge of the regime of the observations before and after the break. In particular, we construct our detectors as the CUSUM process of the quasi-Fisher scores of the log likelihood function. To ensure timely detection, we then construct our boundary function (exceeding which would indicate a break) by including a weighting sequence which is designed to shorten the detection delay in the presence of a changepoint. We consider two types of weights: a lighter set of weights, which ensures timely detection in the presence of changes occurring “early, but not too early” after the end of the historical sample; and a heavier set of weights, called “Rényi weights” which is designed to ensure timely detection in the presence of changepoints occurring very early in the monitoring horizon. In both cases, we derive the limiting distribution of the detection delays, indicating the expected delay for each set of weights. Our methodologies can be applied for a general analysis of changepoints in GARCH(1,1) sequences; however, they can also be applied to detect changes from stationarity to explosivity or vice versa, thus allowing to check for “volatility bubbles”, upon applying tests for stationarity before and after the identified break. Our theoretical results are validated via a comprehensive set of simulations, and an empirical application to daily returns of individual stocks.},

  abstract     = {In economics and finance, speculative bubbles take the form of locally explosive dynamics that eventually collapse. We propose a test for the presence of speculative bubbles in the context of mixed causal-noncausal autoregressive processes. The test exploits the fact that bubbles are anticipative, that is, they are generated by an extreme shock in the forward-looking dynamics. In particular, the test uses both path-level deviations and growth rates to assess the presence of a bubble of a given duration and size, at any moment in time. We show that the distribution of the test statistic can be either analytically determined or numerically approximated, depending on the error distribution. Size and power properties of the test are analyzed in controlled Monte Carlo experiments. An empirical application is presented for a monthly oil price index. It demonstrates the ability of the test to detect bubbles and to provide valuable insights in terms of risk assessments in the spirit of Value-at-Risk.},

This article explores the usefulness of quantile regression (QR) technique in detecting and surveilling financial bubbles, encompassing both global testing and real-time monitoring. We demonstrate that the QR-based quantile unit root test, coupled with an optimal quantile selection technique, serves as an effective tool for a global bubble test without necessitating additional recursive techniques. Moreover, we propose two QR-based bubble monitoring techniques. We show that the monitoring statistics follow a random variate under the null hypothesis of no bubbles but diverge to positive infinity in the presence of a mildly explosive bubble, and hence consistently date the origination of a bubble. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that compared with their LS counterparts, in the presence of skewed distributions, the QR-based global test delivers substantially greater power, while the QR-based monitoring procedures offer higher bubble detection rate and more accurate dating of the bubble origination. As an illustration, we conduct a pseudo real-time monitoring exercise with the S&P 500 composite index.},

In this article, I show that unit root quantile autoregressive models can approximate such dynamics by allowing the largest autoregressive root to take values below unity at low quantiles, which correspond to price crashes, and above unity at upper quantiles, that correspond to bubble expansions. On this basis, I employ two unit root tests based on quantile autoregressions to detect bubbles. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the two tests have good size and power properties, and can outperform recursive least-squares-based tests. The merits of the two tests are further illustrated in three empirical applications that examine Bitcoin, US equity and US housing markets. In the empirical applications, special attention is given to the issue of controlling for economic fundamentals. The estimation results indicate the presence of asymmetric dynamics that closely match those of the simulated bubble processes.},

We first consider a data generating process that entails a switch from a unit root regime to an explosive regime followed by a collapse and subsequent return to unit root behavior. We demonstrate analytically that the standard OLS estimates are inconsistent and date both the origination and implosion points with a delay in large samples. A simple modification that involves omitting the residual corresponding to the implosion date is shown to yield consistent estimates. We also develop an efficient dating algorithm that can accommodate a framework with multiple bubbles. The algorithm exploits the explicit form of the unit root restrictions to directly embed them into the recursive optimization problem which obviates the need to rely on an iterative scheme that requires initial values. Extensive simulation experiments indicate that our proposed procedure typically delivers estimates with lower bias and root mean squared error relative to competing alternatives.

This modification, based on the approach developed in Beare (2018) in the context of conventional unit root testing, is achieved by purging the impact of unconditional heteroskedasticity from the data using a kernel estimate of volatility before the application of the bubble detection methods proposed in Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015) (PSY). The modified statistic is shown to achieve the same limiting null distribution as the corresponding (heteroskedasticity-uncorrected) statistic from PSY would obtain under homoskedasticity, such that the usual critical values provided in PSY may still be used. Versions of the test based on regressions including either no intercept or a (redundant) intercept are considered. Representations for asymptotic local power against a single bubble model are also derived. Monte Carlo simulation results highlight that neither one of these tests dominates the other across different bubble locations and magnitudes, and across different models of time-varying volatility. Accordingly, we also propose a test based on a union of rejections between the with- and without-intercept variants of the modified PSY test. The union procedure is shown to perform almost as well as the better of the constituent tests for a given DGP, and also performs very well compared to existing heteroskedasticity-robust tests across a large range of simulation DGPs.},

Against this background, this study investigates the formation of speculative bubbles in the Nasdaq stock market with a specific focus on the so-called Magnificent Seven (Mag-7) individual stocks during the AI boom, spanning the period from January 2017 to January 2025. We apply the real-time PSY bubble detection methodology of Phillips et al. (2015a, 2015b) while controlling for market and industry factors for individual stocks. Confidence intervals to assess the degree of speculative behavior in asset price dynamics are calculated using the near-unit root approach of Phillips (2023). The findings reveal the presence of speculative bubbles in the Nasdaq stock market and across all Mag-7 stocks. Nvidia and Microsoft experience the longest speculative periods over January 2017–December 2021, while Nvidia and Tesla show the fastest rates of explosive behavior. Speculative bubbles persist in the market and in six of the seven stocks (excluding Apple) from December 2022 to January 2025. Near-unit-root inference indicates mildly explosive dynamics for Nvidia and Tesla (2017–2021) and local-to-unity near explosive behavior for all assets in both periods.},

R J ‾ $$ R\overline{J} $$ is formed by a rarefaction wave R $$ R $$ and a discontinuity J ‾ $$ \overline{J} $$ attached to the wavefront of this rarefaction wave. It should be stressed that the rarefaction wave and the shock wave share the same wave velocity on this discontinuity J ‾ $$ \overline{J} $$ . In the asymptotic limits of the Riemann solutions, not all solutions converge to those of the conservation law equations when the perturbation parameters tend to 0 with the same initial data. What is interesting is that the vacuum and delta shock wave solutions are obtained by the small Riemann solution S + J $$ S&amp;#x0002B;J $$ , which consists of a shock wave S $$ S $$ followed by a contact discontinuity J $$ J $$ , where the small Riemann solution means that the solution whose structure remains unchanged for the solution of the Riemann problem of the macroscopic production model with modified Chaplygin gas under the small enough perturbation parameters.},

  abstract     = {Predator-prey models, such as the Leslie-Gower model, are essential for understanding population dynamics and stability within ecosystems. These models help explain the balance between species under natural conditions, but the inclusion of factors like the Allee effect and intraspecific competition adds complexity and realism to these interactions, enhancing our ability to predict system behavior under stress. To detect early indicators of population collapse, this study investigates the intricate dynamics of a modified Leslie-Gower predator-prey model with both Allee effect and intraspecific competition. We analyze the existence and stability of equilibria, as well as bifurcation phenomena, including saddle-node bifurcations of codimension 2, Hopf bifurcations of codimension 2, and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations of codimension at least 4. Detailed transitions between bifurcation curves–specifically saddle-node, Hopf, homoclinic, and limit cycle bifurcations–are also examined. We observe a novel transition phenomenon, where a system jumps from saddle-node bifurcation to homoclinic and limit cycle bifurcations. This suggests that burst oscillations may serve as an early warning of system collapse rather than simply a tipping point. Our findings indicate that moderate levels of intraspecific competition or Allee effect support coexistence of both populations, while excessive levels may destabilize the entire biological system, leading to collapse. These insights offer valuable implications for ecological management and the early detection of risks in population dynamics.},

In detail, nonlinear multisource disturbance encompasses the disturbances brought about by exogenous systems and norm-bounded disturbances. In this relation, two kinds of PDE-type disturbance observers are put forward for the purpose of estimating the disturbances produced by the exogenous systems. Subsequently, an output feedback-based secured control law is devised through the assistance of estimation information gathered from the constructed observer. In addition, hybrid cyber attacks are undertaken in the control channel with the goal of enhancing the security of the system. In this context, a Bernoulli distributed white sequence is utilized for the purpose of managing the randomness of cyber attacks. Also, the gain fluctuations in the control framework are considered within a structure of linear fractional form to improve the control design robustness. Apart from this, with the intent of addressing the norm-bounded disturbances, an extended dissipative technique is implemented. At the end, a numerical example accompanied by the simulation findings is provided to showcase the efficacy of the developed theoretical results and control mechanism.},

  abstract     = {The equivalence problem in differential geometry investigates whether two geometric structures can be transformed into one another through an appropriate change of variables. This issue is central to understanding the invariants associated with dynamical systems, which remain unchanged under such transformations. The Cartan equivalence method provides a powerful and systematic framework for addressing these problems by reducing complex equivalence questions to more tractable ones involving coframes and structure equations. In this study, we apply Cartan's method to second-order autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs), offering insights into the intrinsic geometric structure of these systems under coordinate transformations. Specifically, we examine a class of second-order ODEs that model nonlinear dynamical behavior, employing the pseudogroup of web transformations to identify differential invariants and symmetry classes. The study introduces a step-by-step construction of an invariant coframe, elucidates the structure equations governing the system, and provides a classification of the equations based on their differential invariants. Two representative physical systems are investigated in detail: the motion of a damped spring-mass system and the van der Pol oscillator. In addition to these applications, the paper explores the interplay between equivalence, symmetry reduction, and integrability. By leveraging Cartan's method, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the equivalence problem in the context of higher order differential equations, highlighting both the theoretical elegance and practical utility of the approach in uncovering hidden geometric features, symmetries, and conserved quantities.},

Numerical results substantiate the outcomes of the control-induced system, and we have compared the results under various maximum control efforts.

The fractional derivative has been introduced within the context of transmission and recovery process, displaying characteristics similar to tempered fractional ( T F $$ TF $$ ) derivatives. It has been established that under certain condition, a function's T F $$ TF $$ derivatives are proportional to the function itself. Applying the following observation, we examined the stability of several steady-state solutions, such as disease-free and endemic states, in light of this newly formulated model, using the reproduction number ( R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ ). In addition, the precise range of epidemiological parameters for the fractional-order model was determined by calibrating weekly registered dengue incidence in the San Juan municipality of Puerto Rico, from April 9, 2010, to April 2, 2011. We performed a global sensitivity analysis method to measure the influence of key model parameters (along with the fractional-order coefficient) on total dengue cases and the basic reproduction number ( R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ ) using a Monte Carlo-based partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC). Moreover, we formulated a fractional-order model with fractional control to assess the effectiveness of different interventions, such as reducing the recruitment rate of mosquito breeding, controlling adult vectors, and providing individual protection. Also, we established the existence of a solution for the fractional-order optimal control problem. Finally, the numerical experiment illustrates that policymakers should place importance on the fractional-order transmission and recovery parameters that capture the underlying mechanisms of disease, along with reducing the spread of dengue cases, carried out through the implementation of adult vector control.},

  abstract     = {A priori estimates and the nonexistence of nonconstant positive steady-state solutions of a charge transfer model are established. Steady-state and Hopf bifurcations are carried out in detail, especially under the degenerate conditions such as invalid simple eigenvalue condition or crossing condition. It is shown that the steady-state solutions under the violated simple eigenvalue are characterized by a coupling of two eigenfunctions, and the bifurcation direction from simple eigenvalue is supercritical or subcritical. Meanwhile, there is no nonconstant steady-state solution under the degenerate case of violated crossing condition. In addition, whether the transversality condition in Hopf bifurcation is true or not, instead of the center manifold theory, we apply the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method and the singularity theory to illustrate the existence and stability of periodic solutions as well as the bifurcation diagrams. But it is proved that the usual pitchfork Hopf bifurcation is changed to the transcritical bifurcation through the invalid transversality condition. Finally, some numerical simulations allow us to identify the influence of external current on the predicted dynamics. The novel results on the effect of degeneracy obtained in this paper shall complement classical theories and enrich numerical examples in the existing work.},

Adjoint operators play an essential part in deriving an optimal system of subalgebras.

By employing the vector fields obtained from the optimal system, we efficiently transform the governing model into a collection of ordinary differential equations. Consequently, we attain group invariant solutions and elucidate their graphical behavior. Moreover, we obtain conservation laws for the governing model by utilizing it is nonlinear self-adjoint properties and employing the direct multiplier method.},

According to the credit period provided by the supplier to retailer, three distinct scenarios may arise among which are discussed in detail. The corresponding optimization problems are solved with the help of three tournament-based hybrid algorithms (tournament differential evolution [TDE], tournament teaching learning-based optimization [TTLBO], and tournament RAO-3 algorithms).

The model, represented by a system of ordinary differential equations, captures the complex interaction between the host's immune response and viral infection. The study focuses on the model's fundamental aspects, such as equilibrium analysis, computing the basic reproduction number ℛ 0 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ , stability analysis, bifurcation phenomena, numerical simulations, and sensitivity analysis. The analysis reveals both an infection equilibrium, which indicates the persistence of the illness, and an infection-free equilibrium, which represents disease control possibilities. Applying matrix-theoretical approaches, stability analysis proved that the infection-free equilibrium is both locally and globally stable for ℛ 0 < 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;lt;1 $$ . For the situation of ℛ 0 > 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;gt;1 $$ , the infection equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable via the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. We also studied the uniform persistence of the infection, demonstrating that the infection remains present above a positive threshold under certain conditions. The study also found a transcritical forward-type bifurcation at ℛ 0 = 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;amp;#x0003D;1 $$ , indicating a critical threshold that affects the system's behavior.

  abstract     = {Software has been increasingly important in many critical systems. To measure the growth of software reliability during testing phases, several software reliability growth models (SRGMs) have been investigated. Different from hardwares, softwares' failure mechanisms follow the basic rules of logic, behavior, and psychology rather than physical laws. Consequently, software testing phase embodies lots of epistemic uncertainties, which are not suitable to be modeled by probability theory-based SRGMs. In addition, fuzzy theory-based SRGMs may give counterintuitive results. Confronted with these, we proposed a software belief reliability growth model (SBRGM) under the framework of uncertainty theory which is a new mathematics system to deal with epistemic uncertainties. However, testing coverage, a key factor in software testing, has not been considered in SBRGM. Therefore, a novel SBRGM considering testing coverage, named SBRGM with testing coverage (TCSBRGM), is proposed in this paper. Based on belief reliability theory, several essential belief reliability indexes for software such as belief reliability and belief reliable time are considered. Unknown parameters in the proposed TCSBRGM are estimated. Finally, real data analysis using two real-world software testing data is carried out to compare the performance of our proposed model with some representative SRGMs. The results exhibit that the proposed model gives a better fitting and predictive performance.},

Three SIR type models considering several aspects in the spread of the disease are considered with 3, 6, and 10 unknown parameters, respectively. The parameter identification is carried through a search algorithm based on a combination of a stochastic domain exploration and a heuristic calculation of a descent direction, in order to avoid stopping the algorithm at a local optimum. The models are validated using the epidemic data found. Finally, it was confirmed that the basic reproductive ratio is consistent with those previously reported in the literature. We conclude that the proposed optimization method improves computation time with respect to a genetic algorithm or an exhaustive search in the parameter space.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the Nicholson's blowflies equation with stage structure and harvest is investigated. By employing the property of Lambert W $$ W $$ function, the existence of positive equilibria is obtained. With aid of the distribution of the eigenvalues in the characteristic equation, the local stability of the equilibria and the existence of Hopf bifurcation of the single-species model are obtained. Furthermore, it is found that when the harvest rate is sufficiently small, the directions of the Hopf bifurcations at the first and last bifurcation values are forward and backward, respectively, and the bifurcating periodic solutions are all asymptotically stable. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {In nature, there is no ideal impulse response system. When the input is switched, the output cannot respond to this input instantaneously, which needs some time. This causes a transient oscillation process, which will inevitably affect the control accuracy, produce noise, and even cause fatigue damage. The usually adopted integer mathematical model is an ideal impulse response model and has no memory property. The fractional model has memory property, but the historical information before the switching time is usually lost. The transient oscillation process caused by intermittent control has rarely been reported in the obtained achievements with both the integer model and the fractional model. In this paper, based on the input-output property of a system, we have studied this transient oscillation. First, the impulsive response is approximated as a short memory model according to its decaying property. Second, the intermittent signal is treated as a piece-wise continuous signal to study. The study indicates that the transient oscillation is inevitable. This transient process is affected by the historical information within the memory length, and its duration is equal to the memory length. Different systems have different memory lengths. To optimize the transient oscillation process, we have to study the intermittent control approaches for different systems case by case. These do well with the engineering applications of intermittent control. Some numerical examples verify our theoretical analysis.},

Unlike the traditional approach, which replaces the Fourier kernel with the LCT kernel, this method employs convolution to capture the linear canonical spectrum over limited temporal intervals, constrained by a window function. This approach not only reduces computational complexity but also holds significant potential for applications in various scientific and engineering fields. We begin our investigation by examining fundamental properties of the proposed transform, such as the orthogonality relation, inversion formula, and characterization of the range, using tools from LCT and convolution theory. Further, we explore the time-frequency resolution and the uncertainty principles associated with the proposed transform. Additionally, we present several potential applications, including the Poisson summation formula, Paley-Wiener criterion, and a sampling formula. To support our theoretical findings, clear examples are provided throughout the paper.},

Given the mapping between traversal trees and cuts in a graph, we propose to deal with the problem from a new perspective, namely, cut enumeration. The algorithm enumerates the cuts using the depth-first traversal tree, locates the optimal tree per node with the smallest local cut, and compacts them for acceleration. Any node pair can be separated by compacted trees containing only one of them. Its serial implementation is validated to be effective in obtaining the accurate solution for 99.9% or more pairs of vertices in a graph. Its calculation time per pair is as low as a thousandth of that of the most efficient existing method, that is, several microseconds in a graph with tens of millions of edges using an off-shelf computing node, thus serving as an effective heuristic for min-cut approximation.},

  abstract     = {Influenza is one of the key persistent viral diseases globally, with the potential to cause seasonal outbreaks and occasional pandemics. Currently, it poses a significant health challenge in various regions, and there is concern that it may evolve into a more severe global threat. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic approach to modeling an influenza outbreak. The study begins by formulating a mathematical representation that incorporates random fluctuations influencing the disease's progression. We demonstrate that the proposed model guarantees a positive global solution. By utilizing Lyapunov functionals, we investigate specific parametric conditions under which the disease may be eliminated from the population. Additionally, an ergodic stationary distribution is used to demonstrate conditions under which the infection may persist. A threshold quantity is identified, offering insight into key parameters that influence other dynamic aspects of the model. The stochastic model of influenza is further examined through graphical representation for better understanding.},

This paper looks at modular businesses that have income and costs directly proportional to the number of units. This work assumes that all of the plants or units have the same capital cost, operating costs, and revenue and that the company reinvests all net profit into purchasing more units. Furthermore, this model ignores depreciation, inflation, fluctuating market prices, and market saturation. With these assumptions, the question of when the company can afford to scale and purchase the next unit is directly related to the payback period and the harmonic number. This work describes a novel growth function called the harmonic growth function based on harmonic numbers. This function is related to the standard ROI. The harmonic growth function is explained and applied to a micro combined heat and power (mCHP) station, a biomass company expanding the number of biorefineries, and biochar retort kilns for biochar production.},

  abstract     = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are major public health concern worldwide, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. Managing co-infection between HIV and HBV presents additional challenges in clinical treatment and patient outcomes. In this article, we developed a comprehensive co-infection model to explore the complex transmission dynamics between HIV and HBV in the United States. Our model incorporates crucial factors such as infection through birth or migration, HBV vaccination, and the possibility of reinfection following HBV recovery. Our mathematical analysis started with the analysis of the two non-co-infection submodels, that is, for HIV-only and HBV-only models. We derived the basic reproduction number for each submodel and appliedthe Routh-Hurwitz criterion to assess the local stability of their respective disease-free equilibrium points. Our investigation revealed that the HIV-only submodel is globally asymptotically stable when its basic reproduction number remains below one. Conversely, the HBV-only submodel exhibits a backward bifurcation, meaning that both disease-free and endemic equilibrium states can coexist even when the reproduction number falls below one. This phenomenon complicates HBV control strategies under such conditions. However, in the absence of reinfection, the HBV-only model reaches global stability at the disease-free equilibrium whenever its reproduction number is below one. Using center manifold theory, we further demonstrated that the full HIV-HBV co-infection model also undergoes backward bifurcation. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the basic reproduction numbers of HIV and HBV to identify critical parameters influencing the transmission dynamics of both infections. Our results indicate a positive correlation between the spread of one infection and the prevalence of the other. Additionally, we validated the model by fitting it to annual cumulative data on new HIV cases and reported acute HBV infections in the United States. Numerical simulations suggest that increasing condom use adherence, enhancing treatment coverage for both infections, and boosting HBV vaccination rates can substantially reduce the prevalence of HIV, HBV, and their co-infection.},

The proposed method is theoretically proven to be asymptotically equivalent to the oracle estimator derived from the entire dataset, offering advantages in computational and memory efficiency. Unlike previous approaches that impose constraints on batch numbers or data variance, our method is unconstrained by these factors. Meanwhile, numerical simulations and experiments on real data sets demonstrate that our estimator not only surpasses existing methods in handling both homogeneous and heterogeneous data but also performs better than traditional Quantile Regression in various scenarios. These findings highlight the suitability of our approach for real-world streaming data applications.},

The gated recurrent unit (GRU) is employed to capture long-term dependencies in the sequence and generate predictions for multiple quantiles through a fully connected layer, thereby enabling both point forecasts and interval forecasts with varying confidence levels. In the proposed prediction algorithm, the loss function incorporates coverage loss, median loss, interval width loss, and regularization loss. An adaptive weight adjustment mechanism was implemented to dynamically optimize the weights of these different loss terms, enhancing the accuracy and stability of the predictions when dealing with multidimensional explanatory variables. Subsequently, we conducted Monte Carlo experiments to validate the algorithm's effectiveness in both point and interval predictions. Ultimately, the algorithm was applied to predict Amazon's and NVIDIA's stock prices, showcasing its potential applications in complex financial market environments.},

Unlike traditional time-series clustering methods that yield static membership parameters, our approach allows each time series to dynamically change cluster memberships over time. Thus, each time series has a dynamic posterior probability of belonging to each cluster. The proposed mixture model is flexible, assuming a Dirichlet evolution for the mixture weights that enables smooth membership transitions over time. This approach accounts for correlations between weights, thereby avoiding abrupt membership changes caused by outlying observations in the series. Posterior estimates of model parameters and membership probabilities are obtained via Gibbs sampling. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient alternative method based on stochastic expectation maximization and gradient descent to obtain point estimates. We illustrate the proposed method using a tri-variate panel dataset combining Gapminder and World Bank indicators—life expectancy, GDP per capita, and crude birth rate—for 78 European and African countries from 1960 to 2007. The selected regions provide strong socioeconomic and demographic contrasts, allowing the model to effectively capture temporal and structural changes in cluster membership.},

  abstract = {Random binnings generated via recursive binary splits are introduced as a way to detect, measure the strength of, and to display the pattern of association between any two variates, whether one or both are continuous or categorical. This provides a single approach to ordering large numbers of variate pairs by their measure of dependence and then to examine any pattern of dependence via a common display, the departure display (coloring bins by a standardized Pearson residual). Continuous variates are first ranked and their rank pairs binned. The Pearson's goodness of fit statistic is applicable but the classic approximation to its null distribution is not. Theoretical and empirical investigations motivate several approximations, including a simple approximation with real-valued, yet intuitive, degrees of freedom. Alternatively, applying an inverse probability transform from the ranks before binning returns a simple Pearson statistic with the classic degrees of freedom. Recursive random binning with different approximations is compared to recent grid-based methods on a variety of non-null dependence patterns; the method with any of these approximations is found to be well-calibrated and relatively powerful against common test alternatives. Method and displays are illustrated by applying the screening methodology to a publicly available data set having several continuous and categorical measurements of each of 6497 Portuguese wines.

In addition to selection bias, non-probability samples may also suffer from missingness in practice, even nonignorable nonresponse with unknown response probabilities. Superpopulation model methods have been discussed for reducing selection biases from non-probability samples, but not for dealing with nonignorable missingness for non-probability samples yet. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear superpopulation model inference approach for non-probability samples with nonignorable missingness. We develop rigorous procedures for estimating the response probabilities for units in the non-probability sample and the nonlinear superpopulation model parameters, and construct the finite population mean estimator based on the nonlinear superpopulation model, response probabilities, and inclusion probabilities. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and variance estimation are also discussed under the proposed framework. In a simulation study, we compare the proposed method with some existing methods.

However, recent studies have demonstrated that their treatment effect coefficient estimators may correspond to ambiguous estimands when the models are misspecified or when there exist informative cluster sizes. In this article, we present a unified approach that standardizes output from a given regression model to ensure estimand-aligned inference for the treatment effect parameters in cluster-randomized trials. We introduce estimators for both the cluster-average and the individual-average treatment effects (marginal estimands) that are always consistent regardless of whether the specified working regression models align with the unknown data generating process. We further explore the use of a deletion-based jackknife variance estimator for inference. The development of our approach also motivates a natural test for informative cluster size. Extensive simulation experiments are designed to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed estimators under a variety of scenarios. The proposed model-robust standardization methods are implemented in the MRStdCRT R package.},

  abstract     = {Clinical trials or studies oftentimes require long-term and/or costly follow-up of participants to evaluate a novel treatment/drug/vaccine. There has been increasing interest in the past few decades in using short-term surrogate outcomes as a replacement for the primary outcome, that is, in using the surrogate outcome, which can potentially be observed sooner, to make inferences about the treatment effect on the long-term primary outcome. Very few of the available statistical methods to evaluate a surrogate are applicable to settings where both the surrogate and the primary outcome are time-to-event outcomes subject to censoring. Methods that can handle this setting tend to require parametric assumptions or be limited to assessing only the restricted mean survival time. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric approach to evaluate a censored surrogate outcome, such as time to progression, when the primary outcome is also a censored time-to-event outcome, such as time to death, and the treatment effect of interest is the difference in overall survival. Specifically, we define the proportion of the treatment effect on the primary outcome that is explained (PTE) by the censored surrogate outcome in this context, and estimate this proportion by defining and deriving an optimal transformation of the surrogate information. Our approach provides the added advantage of relaxed assumptions to guarantee that the true PTE is within , along with being model-free. The finite sample performance of our estimators is illustrated via extensive simulation studies and a real data application examining progression-free survival as a surrogate for overall survival for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of precision medicine and targeted therapies in cancer, new challenges in the statistical design of clinical trials have naturally emerged. Most randomized clinical trial designs incorporating predictive biomarkers (those associated with treatment efficacy) assume biomarkers are dichotomous, or dichotomize naturally continuous biomarkers upfront, or find cut points mid-way through the trial to classify patients as biomarker-positive or biomarker-negative. However, these practices ignore or discard information about continuous and possible nonlinear or non-monotone prognostic or predictive effects. In this article, we propose a novel adaptive enrichment trial design to handle continuous biomarkers with any effect shape, including Bayesian marker-adaptive randomization. We demonstrate that this design can correctly make marker-specific trial decisions with high efficiency, resulting in improved performance and patient-centered decisions compared to adaptive cut-point selection approaches without adaptive randomization that further ignore or oversimplify true underlying marker relationships.},

Further, the missingness can occur due to dropout of individuals, termed sporadically missing data, or dropout of clusters, termed systematically missing data, and these two types of missingness could have potentially different missing data mechanisms. We aimed to develop a well-performing and practical approach to handle inference in CRTs when outcome data may be both sporadically and systematically missing. To this end, we first examined the performance of several multilevel multiple imputation (MI) methods to handle sporadically and systematically missing CRT outcome data via a simulation study. Specifically, we examined performance under a multilevel covariate-dependent missingness assumption. Our findings indicated that several full conditional specification (FCS) methods designed for missingness in linear mixed models performed well under various scenarios, while an FCS approach using a two-stage estimator often performed poorly. We then developed methods for conducting sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of inferences under different missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR) assumptions. The methods allow for different MNAR assumptions for cluster dropout and individual dropout to reflect that they may arise from different missing data mechanisms. We used graphical displays to visualize sensitivity analysis results. Our methods are illustrated using a real data application.},

  abstract     = {An important goal of environmental epidemiology is to quantify the complex health effects posed by a wide array of environmental exposures. In studies of a small number of exposures, flexible models like Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) are appealing because they allow for non-linear and non-additive associations among exposures. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of low power and difficult interpretation, particularly in exposomic analyses when the number of exposures is large. We propose a flexible framework that allows for the separate selection of additive and non-additive effects, unifying additive models and kernel machine regression. The proposed approach yields increased power and simpler interpretation when there is little evidence of interaction. Further, it allows users to specify separate priors for additive and non-additive effect s, and allows for statistical inference on non-additive interactions. We extend the approach to a class of multiple index models, in which the special case of kernel machine-distributed lag models is nested. We apply the method to motivating data from a subcohort of the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) study containing 65 mixture components grouped into 13 distinct exposure classes.},

  abstract     = {Gene-environment (GxE) interactions crucially contribute to complex phenotypes. The statistical power of a GxE interaction study is limited mainly due to weak GxE interaction effect sizes. Joint tests of the main genetic and GxE effects for a univariate phenotype were proposed to utilize the individually weak GxE effects to improve the discovery of associated genetic loci. We develop a testing procedure to evaluate combined genetic and GxE effects on multiple related phenotypes to enhance the power by merging pleiotropy in the main genetic and GxE effects. We base the approach on a general linear hypothesis testing framework for multivariate regression of continuous phenotypes. We implement the generalized estimating equations (GEE) technique under the seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) setup for binary or mixed phenotypes. We use extensive simulations to show that the test for joint multi-phenotype genetic and GxE effects outperforms the univariate joint test of genetic and GxE effects and the test for multi-phenotype GxE effect concerning power when there is pleiotropy. The test produces a higher power than the test for the multi-phenotype marginal genetic effect for a weak genetic and substantial GxE effect. For more prominent genetic effects, the latter performs better with a limited increase in power. Overall, the multi-phenotype joint approach offers robust, high power across diverse simulation scenarios. We apply the methods to lipid phenotypes with sleep duration as an environmental factor in the UK Biobank. The proposed approach identified ten independent associated genetic loci missed by other competing methods. In a multi-phenotype analysis of apolipoproteins, ApoA1, and ApoB, our approach discovered two distinct loci considering sleep duration as the environmental factor.},

The biomarker data is incomplete (missing and irregular) multivariate longitudinal data. We propose a normal model with structured covariance designed for our setting. To sample from the posterior distribution of parameters, we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to address the positive definiteness constraint on the structured correlation matrix. In particular, we propose a novel approach to compute the support of the parameters in the structured correlation matrix; we modify the approach from [1] on the set of the largest possible submatrices of the correlation matrix, where the correlation parameter is a unique element. For each posterior sample, we compute the optimal weights of our construct. We conduct data analysis and simulation studies to evaluate the algorithm and the frequentist properties of the posteriors of correlations and weights. We found that the lower extremities are the most responsive muscles at the early and late ambulatory disease stages, and the biceps brachii is the most responsive at the nonambulatory disease stage.},

In rare diseases, oncology, or in pediatric drug development, single-arm trials, or platform trials consisting of a series of single-arm trials are increasingly being used, both to establish proof-of-concept and to provide pivotal evidence for a marketing application. Often, these single-arm trials are designed as two-stage designs, or they include sequential or continuous monitoring approaches. They are analyzed using standard frequentist, Bayesian, or other methods. In this paper, we describe how to define analysis strategies based on confidence distributions for such single-arm trials or for platform trials that consist of a series of single arm trials. We focus on binary endpoints and show how to define the corresponding decision rules for final and interim analyses and how to derive their operating characteristics exactly, for example, without simulation. Our approach uses predictive probabilities rather than conditional probabilities (as with stochastic curtailment) to define the interim decision rules. It can be applied to platform, basket, and umbrella trials that consist of a series of single-arm trials but also to stand-alone single arm trials.},

For this reason, one common strategy is to fit flexible nonparametric models to capture the true exposure-response surface. However, once such a model is fit, further decisions are required when it comes to summarizing the marginal and joint effects of the mixture on the outcome. In this work, we describe the use of soft Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) to estimate the exposure-risk surface describing the effect of mixtures of chemical air pollutants and temperature on asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits during the warm season in Atlanta, Georgia, from 2011 to 2018. BART is chosen for its ability to handle large datasets and for its flexibility to be incorporated as a single component of a larger model. We then summarize the results using a strategy known as accumulated local effects to extract meaningful insights into the mixture effects on asthma-related morbidity. Notably, we observe negative associations between and asthma ED visits and harmful associations between ozone and asthma ED visits, both of which are particularly strong on lower temperature days.},

We introduce six different strategies for how such events could be handled. We introduce the estimand concept for diagnostic accuracy studies, which consists of the attributes population, target condition, index test, accuracy measure, and the strategies for handling interfering events. The estimand determines which effect is estimated based on the study objective. To bridge the gap between the clinical study objective and the method for the estimation, we illustrate the necessary steps using a fictitious computed tomography scan study. The defined estimand improves the structure of the planning phase, enhances the interdisciplinary exchange, and supports the interpretation based on the study objective.},

  abstract     = {A common issue in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is the identification of subgroups and the estimation of their effects. Typically, RCTs are not powered to estimate the effects of subgroups. However, in some circumstances, treatment may work for some groups and not others, and it is of interest to identify these subgroups and estimate their treatment effects. In this paper, we introduce a novel hierarchical grouped horseshoe prior (HGHP) for subgroup identification and estimation. We show via simulation that our proposed approach yields superior positive predictive value and narrower credible intervals compared to other shrinkage priors. We apply our method to a real clinical trial for COVID-19.},

  abstract     = {Multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) is an efficient class of trial designs that helps to assess multiple treatment strategies at the same time using an adaptive design. These designs can substantially reduce the average number of samples required compared to an equivalent single stage multi-arm trial. However, if patient recruitment is continued while we await treatment outcomes, a long-term primary outcome leads to a number of ‘pipeline’ patients getting recruited in the trial, who do not benefit from the early termination of a futile arm. This study focuses on quantifying the efficiency loss a MAMS design undergoes, in terms of the expected sample size (ESS), because of outcome delay. We first estimate the number of ‘pipeline’ patients (recruited during the interim analysis (IA) while awaiting outcome data) analytically through different recruitment models, given the total recruitment time. We then compute the ESS accounting for delay and assess the Efficiency Loss (EL). The results indicate that more than 50% of the expected efficiency gain is typically lost due to delay when the delay is more than of the total recruitment length. Although the number of stages have little influence on the efficiency loss, the timing of the IA can impact the efficiency of MAMS designs with delayed outcomes; in particular, conducting the IAs earlier than an equally-spaced design can be harmful for the design. Finally, we conclude that, in order to gain maximum benefit of MAMS in terms of a reduced sample size in multi-arm trials, the outcome delay should be less than a third of the total recruitment length.},

  abstract     = {Given the high incidence of cardio and cerebrovascular diseases (CVD), and their association with morbidity and mortality, their prevention is a major public health issue. A high level of blood pressure is a well-known risk factor for these events, and an increasing number of studies suggest that blood pressure variability may also be an independent risk factor. However, these studies suffer from significant methodological weaknesses. In this work, we propose a new location-scale joint model for the repeated measures of a marker and competing events. This joint model combines a mixed model including a subject-specific and time-dependent residual variance modeled through random effects, and cause-specific proportional intensity models for the competing events. The risk of events may depend simultaneously on the current value of the variance, as well as, the current value and the current slope of the marker trajectory. The model is estimated by maximizing the likelihood function using the Marquardt–Levenberg algorithm. The estimation procedure is implemented in an R-package and is validated through a simulation study. This model is applied to study the association between blood pressure variability and the risk of CVD and death from other causes. Using data from a large clinical trial on the secondary prevention of stroke, we find that the current individual variability of blood pressure is associated with the risk of CVD and death. Moreover, the comparison with a model without heterogeneous variance shows the importance of taking into account this variability in the goodness-of-fit and for dynamic predictions.},

  abstract     = {In vaccine trials with long-term participant follow-up, it is of great importance to identify surrogate markers that accurately infer long-term immune responses. These markers offer practical advantages such as providing early, indirect evidence of vaccine efficacy, and can accelerate vaccine development while identifying potential biomarkers. High-throughput technologies such as RNA-sequencing have emerged as promising tools for understanding complex biological systems and informing new treatment strategies. However, these data are high-dimensional, presenting unique statistical challenges for existing surrogate marker identification methods. We introduce Rank-based Identification of high-dimensional SurrogatE Markers (RISE), a novel approach designed for small sample, high-dimensional settings typical in modern vaccine experiments. RISE uses a nonparametric univariate test to screen variables for promising candidates, followed by surrogate evaluation on independent data. Our simulation studies demonstrate RISE's desirable properties, including type one error rate control and empirical power under various conditions. Applying RISE to a clinical trial for inactivated influenza vaccination, we sought to identify genes whose expression could serve as a surrogate for the induced immune response. This analysis revealed a signature of genes appearing to function as a reasonable surrogate for the neutralizing antibody response. Pathways related to innate antiviral signaling and interferon stimulation were strongly represented in this derived surrogate, providing a clear immunological interpretation.},

  abstract     = {Single-arm control trials are increasingly proposed as a potential approach for treatment evaluation. However, the limitations of this design restrict its methodological acceptability. Regulatory agencies have raised concerns about this approach, although it is sometimes required in applications based solely on such studies. Consequently, the need for accurate indirect treatment comparisons has become critical, especially when constructing external control arms using routinely collected data as outcome measurements may differ from those recorded in the single-arm trial leading to potential misclassification of outcomes. This study aimed to quantify the bias from ignoring misclassification of a binary outcome within unanchored indirect comparisons, through simulations, and to propose a likelihood-based method to correct this bias (i.e., the outcome-corrected model). Simulations demonstrated that ignoring misclassification results in significant bias and poor coverage probabilities. In contrast, the outcome-corrected model reduced bias, improved 95% confidence interval coverage probability and root mean square error in various scenarios. The methodology was applied to two hepatocellular carcinoma trials illustrating a practical application. The findings underscore the importance of addressing outcome misclassification in indirect comparisons. The proposed correction method may improve reliability in unanchored indirect treatment comparisons.},

  abstract     = {Treatment of cancer has rapidly evolved over time in quite dramatic ways, for example, from chemotherapies, targeted therapies to immunotherapies and chimeric antigen receptor T-cells. Nonetheless, the basic design of early phase I trials in oncology still follows predominantly a dose-escalation design. These trials monitor safety over the first treatment cycle to escalate the dose of the investigated drug. However, over time, studying additional factors such as drug combinations and/or variation in the timing of dosing became important as well. Existing designs were continuously enhanced and expanded to account for increased trial complexity. With toxicities occurring at later stages beyond the first cycle and the need to treat patients over multiple cycles, the focus on the first treatment cycle only is becoming a limitation in nowadays multi-cycle treatment therapies. Here, we introduce a multi-cycle time-to-event model (TITE-CLRM: Time-Interval-To-Event Complementary-Loglog Regression Model), allowing guidance of dose-escalation trials studying multi-cycle therapies. The challenge lies in balancing the need to monitor the safety of longer treatment periods with the need to continuously enroll patients safely. The proposed multi-cycle time-to-event model is formulated as an extension to established concepts like the escalation with overdose control principle. The model is motivated by a current drug development project and evaluated in a simulation study.},

Such evaluation is often done in phase 2 studies in a randomized manner. In this article, we evaluate the strategy of applying an adaptive phase 2/3 seamless design for dose selection in oncology studies. Specifically, we consider the “drop-the-losers” design, where multiple treatment arms and a control arm are administered during the initial stage, and a more effective arm is identified for later stages by a binary surrogate endpoint such as overall response. We derive the theoretical type I error inflation scale and conduct simulation studies to illustrate the impact of various factors on the type I error inflation in such designs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the findings through the design of a lung cancer trial and introduce a software that implements the proposed design.},

  abstract     = {Circadian transcriptome studies often use trigonometric regression to model gene expression over time. Ideally, protocols in these studies would collect tissue samples at evenly distributed and equally spaced time points over a 24-hour period. This sample collection protocol is known as an equispaced design, which is considered the optimal experimental design for trigonometric regression under multiple statistical criteria. However, implementing equispaced designs in studies involving individuals is logistically challenging, and failure to employ an equispaced design could introduce variability in the statistical power of a hypothesis test relative to a model's phase-shift parameter estimates. This article is motivated by the variability in power for hypothesis testing when tissue samples are not collected under an equispaced design, and considers a weighted trigonometric regression as a remedy. Specifically, the weights for this regression are the normalized reciprocals of estimates derived from a kernel density estimator for sample collection time, which inflates the weight of samples collected at underrepresented time points. A search procedure is also introduced to identify the hyperparameter for kernel density estimation that relates to maximizing the smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian of weighted squared loss, which is motivated by the -optimality criterion from experimental design literature. Simulation studies consistently demonstrate that this weighted regression mitigates variability in power for hypothesis tests performed with an estimated model. Illustrations with six circadian transcriptome datasets further indicate that this weighted regression consistently yields larger test statistics than its unweighted counterpart for first-order trigonometric regression, or cosinor regression, which is prevalent in circadian transcriptome studies.},

To account for heterogeneity in activity levels, we developed a mixed HMM that allows for individual differences. Through extensive simulations, we quantified the added gains relative to a standard HMM from using a mixed HMM to account for heterogeneity across several realistic scenarios. We found that mixed HMMs are often more accurate than standard HMMs when follow-up times are shorter. In situations with many repeated measurements per individual, a standard and mixed HMM have similar levels of accuracy, although a standard HMM is faster and easier to implement. Afterward, we applied our HMMs to actigraphy data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We present results on sleep summary statistics by age and BMI. Summary statistics about the sleep–wake cycle extracted by the standard and mixed HMM were qualitatively similar. Differences in results, however, were likely driven by the heterogeneity in physical activity due to BMI and age, which we identified using a post hoc investigation of the data-driven clusters produced by the mixed HMM.},

In this paper, we propose a novel criterion, the Minimum Area Confidence Set (MACS) criterion, for finding the optimal SCB for percentile regression lines. This criterion focuses on the area of the constrained regions for the newly proposed pivotal quantities, which are generated from the confidence set for the unknown parameters of an SCB. We employ the new pivotal quantities to construct exact SCBs over any finite covariate intervals and use the MACS criterion to compare several SCBs of different forms. The optimal SCB under the MACS criterion can be used to construct the interval estimate of the true shelf-life. Furthermore, a new computationally efficient method is proposed for calculating the critical constants of exact SCBs for percentile regression lines.

In this work, we assume the existence of a lower-dimensional linear subspace such that the conditional tail index depends on the covariate only through its projection onto this subspace. We propose a method to estimate this dimension reduction subspace and establish its consistency. Additionally, we introduce an estimator of the conditional tail index that leverages this dimension reduction and prove its consistency.

  abstract     = {Fréchet regression has received considerable attention to model metric-space valued responses that are complex and non-Euclidean data, such as probability distributions and vectors on the unit sphere. However, existing Fréchet regression literature focuses on the classical setting where the predictor dimension is fixed, and the sample size goes to infinity. This paper proposes sparse Fréchet sufficient dimension reduction with graphical structure among high-dimensional Euclidean predictors. In particular, we propose a convex optimization problem that leverages the graphical information among predictors and avoids inverting the high-dimensional covariance matrix. We also provide the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Theoretically, the proposed method achieves subspace estimation and variable selection consistency under suitable conditions. Extensive simulations and a real data analysis are carried out to illustrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Equality-constrained models naturally arise in problems in which the measurements are taken at different levels of resolution. The challenge in this setting is that the models usually induce a joint distribution which is intractable. Resorting to instead sampling from the joint distribution by means of a Monte Carlo approach is also challenging. For example, a naive rejection sampler does not work when the probability mass of the constraint is zero. A typical example of such constrained problems is to learn energy consumption for a higher resolution level based on data at a lower resolution, for example, to decompose a daily reading into readings at a finer level. We introduce a novel Monte Carlo sampling algorithm based on Langevin diffusions and rejection sampling to solve the problem of sampling from equality-constrained models. Our method has the advantage of being exact for linear constraints and naturally deals with multimodal distributions on arbitrary constraints. We test our method on statistical disaggregation problems for electricity consumption datasets, and our approach provides better uncertainty estimation and accuracy in data imputation compared with other naive/unconstrained methods.},

The proposed statistics enable testing of relevant hypotheses in one-sample, two-sample, and single or multiple change points problems, and exhibit oracle efficiency, meaning that developed procedures are asymptotically indistinguishable from those with true trajectories.

The adjustment minimizes the Wasserstein distance to a null-approximating continuous distribution, tackling some fundamental challenges inherent in combining statistical significances derived from discrete distributions. The related theory justifies Lancaster's mid-p and mean-value chi-squared statistics for Fisher's combination as special cases. To counter the conservative nature of Lancaster's testing procedures, we propose an updated null-approximating distribution. It is achieved by further minimizing the Wasserstein distance to the adjusted statistics within an appropriate distribution family. Specifically, in the context of Fisher's combination, we propose an optimal gamma distribution as a substitute for the traditionally used chi-squared distribution. This new approach yields an asymptotically consistent test that significantly improves Type I error control and enhances statistical power.},

To meet this requirement, we defined a type of enhanced branching Latin hypercube designs and developed several novel construction methods by integrating orthogonal arrays and sliced Latin hypercube designs. These designs exhibit attractive low-dimensional stratification properties and perform well in terms of column correlation. Additionally, the size of each design can be flexibly chosen based on the trade-off between the experimental budget and estimation accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design method exhibits significant superiority in terms of design metrics and estimation accuracy.

  abstract     = {Factor models are indispensable tools in economics and finance, providing valuable insights into the latent structures underlying complex datasets. Nevertheless, the prevalence of heavy-tailed macroeconomic and financial data, often characterized by extreme values and greater skewness than that found in a normal distribution, presents significant analytical challenges. This article introduces mode-adaptive factor models (MAFM) for robust factor analysis in high-dimensional panel data, inspired by the equivalence between conventional principal component analysis and the constrained least squares method in factor models. Unlike traditional factor models that concentrate on mean estimation, MAFM leverage the mode to capture central tendencies more effectively, particularly in the presence of skewed and heavy-tailed distributions. To facilitate MAFM for factor analysis, we develop an iterative mode regression algorithm that integrates the expectation-maximization procedure, ensuring convergence to a stationary solution. We establish the theoretical properties of the MAFM estimators without imposing moment constraints on idiosyncratic errors and propose a mode information criterion for consistent factor number selection. We also suggest a data-dependent bandwidth selection procedure to enhance the flexibility of MAFM. The simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of MAFM across diverse distributional settings. An empirical application to macroeconomic forecasting further highlights the practical advantages of MAFM, showcasing their robustness and efficacy in real-world analyses.},

Its stochastic properties, including stationarity and geometric ergodicity, are studied. Particular attention is given to a generalization of the INAR( p ) model which parallels the extension of the INARCH( p ) to the INGARCH( p , q ) model. For inference, we consider maximum likelihood, Gaussian quasi-likelihood, and moment-based approaches, along with likelihood ratio tests to distinguish between selected instances of our class. Models from the proposed class have a natural interpretation as stochastic epidemic processes, which throughout the article is used to illustrate our arguments.

If differences of this nature are to be detected, specific tests for scale or omnibus tests need to be employed. However, the latter often suffer from low power, and they do not yield interpretable effect measures. In this article, we extend by additionally incorporating the recently introduced distribution overlap index (nonparametric dispersion measure) that can be expressed in terms of the quantile process. We derive the joint asymptotic distribution of the respective estimators of and and construct confidence regions. Extending the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test, we introduce a new test based on the joint use of these functionals.

There are many available methods of bandwidth selection for spatial point patterns, but no consensus on the best option. Popular methods and software default options lead to very different intensity estimates and contrasting conclusions about the data that can be difficult to reconcile. In response, we propose new bandwidth selectors with more stable and consistent performance. These are adapted from popular plug-in and cross-validation techniques developed for general multivariate density estimation. The theoretical and practical performance of these proposed methods is explored and compared with other available methods in both simulated and real-data scenarios.

Traditional diagnostic methods include ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, and liver biopsies, the latter being the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have enhanced liver biopsy accuracy, improving treatment outcomes. This study investigates how various AI techniques aid histopathologists, gastroenterologists, and liver specialists in diagnosing and assessing liver damage due to abnormal fat accumulation. We conducted a systematic review of AI applications in evaluating fatty liver diseases, particularly through histopathological image analysis. Our search encompassed five scientific databases: PubMed Central, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Google Scholar. We focused on peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, theses, and book chapters, adhering to specific terminology. The data synthesis followed the PRISMA guidelines, comparing literature based on four key indices and their annual distribution. We evaluated 37 studies utilizing histopathological imaging for the diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, including related conditions, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. The review summarized the performance of various algorithms and explored the distribution of machine learning efforts. Given the complexity of histopathological images, AI algorithms can effectively stratify liver samples affected by fat. Our findings indicate that AI's diagnostic performance closely matches traditional pathological interpretations, offering reliable results for clinical applications.

  abstract     = {Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as transformative tools, enabling direct communication between the brain and external devices, particularly for individuals with neuromuscular disabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of feature extraction (FE) methods across all major signal processing domains and various types of BCIs, addressing a significant gap in existing reviews and surveys that often focus exclusively on EEG-based systems. Also, a detailed comparative analysis of FE techniques, highlighting their formulas, advantages, limitations, and practical applications, is provided. The study not only reviews state-of-the-art methods but also evaluates recent research, identifying trends and gaps in the field. Key insights reveal a growing foundation for invasive BCI research, which, while currently limited, shows promise for future advancements. Based on this analysis, we identify and discuss open challenges such as inter-subject variability, real-time processing demands, integration of multiple modalities, and user training and adaptation. Additionally, we examine pressing concerns related to security, privacy, and the transferability of models. By addressing these challenges, this paper aims to guide the development of robust, efficient, and inclusive BCI systems, paving the way for cutting-edge innovations and real-world applications.

  abstract     = {Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a vital technology for remote healthcare, offering non-invasive and accessible health monitoring through off-the-shelf standard video cameras. rPPG facilitates the assessment of key health indicators like heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) from video data, providing advantages in early disease diagnosis and routine health assessments. Recognizing its potential, researchers from multiple fields have substantially progressed rPPG by establishing a strong theoretical basis for signal acquisition and developing signal processing and data-driven algorithms for rPPG extraction. While most rPPG reviews primarily focus on HR signal extraction methods, our research provides an overview of the potential scope of rPPG. We systematically organize research on rPPG signal acquisition and extraction techniques and provide a critical review of recent rPPG advancements in diverse health parameter estimation. Besides providing a thorough HR estimation review, we incorporate the extraction of derivative signals such as RR and SpO 2 from rPPG data, including their applications and limitations. We also highlight the adaptation of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Computer Vision (CV) techniques with rPPG technologies, and accumulate available critical rPPG resources like datasets, codes, and tutorials. Finally, we identify challenges and research gaps, such as motion artifacts, varying lighting conditions, and differences in skin tone. We aim to uplift advancements in rPPG systems by outlining future research directions. Our comprehensive review aims to support the development of robust and safe applications by advancing the field of contactless health parameter sensing. This article is categorized under:},

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing has recently evolved as a distributed human problem-solving method and has received considerable interest from academics and practitioners in various domains. The proliferation of crowdsourcing has made it much simpler to utilize the intelligence and adaptability of many people to learn new knowledge to solve the problem of acquiring new knowledge. In the past, numerous crowdsourcing works have highlighted multiple aspects; however, no surveys have been conducted that focus on the entire crowdsourcing process. This concentrated survey provides a comprehensive review of the technical advances from a systematic perspective. This survey systematically reviews technical advances for a crowdsourcing process that contains four dimensions: task modeling, crowdsourcing data acquisition, the learning process, and predictive model learning, and proposes a comprehensive and scalable framework from CROWD4AI (Crowdsourcing Framework with 4 Dimensions for Artificial Intelligence). In addition, this paper focuses on each dimension's potential challenges and future direction, encouraging researchers to participate in crowdsourcing. To bridge theory with practice, we also include a detailed case study that demonstrates the real-world application of our proposed framework in the context of annotating cultural heritage damages using crowdsourced input. The case study illustrates how the framework supports effective task design, label collection, robust learning strategies, and accurate predictive modeling in a practical setting.

  abstract     = {With renewable energy being aggressively integrated into the grid, energy supplies are becoming vulnerable to weather and the environment, and are often incapable of meeting population demands at a large scale if not accurately predicted for energy planning. Understanding consumers' power demands ahead of time and the influences of weather on consumption and generation can help producers generate effective power management plans to support the target demand. In addition to the high correlation with the environment, consumers' behaviors also cause non-stationary characteristics of energy data, which is the main challenge for energy prediction. In this survey, we perform a review of the literature on prediction methods in the energy field. So far, most of the available research encompasses one type of generation or consumption. There is no research approaching prediction in the energy sector as a whole and its correlated features. We propose to address the energy prediction challenges from both consumption and generation sides, encompassing techniques from statistical to machine learning techniques. We also summarize the work related to energy prediction, electricity measurements, challenges related to energy consumption and generation, energy forecasting methods, and real-world energy forecasting resources, such as datasets and software solutions for energy prediction.

  abstract     = {Forecasting soil moisture is critical for keeping groundwater levels stable, monitoring droughts, and assisting agricultural productivity. Surface soil moisture has a tremendous impact on both the environment and society. To provide proper soil moisture, the right tools are required. Gravimetric, physical, and empirical models produce reliable results, but they are generally context-dependent and inappropriate for large-scale investigations. Remote sensing has developed as a credible technology for estimating large-scale soil moisture levels. However, various obstacles exist when getting soil moisture data using remote sensing, including the availability and precision of data sources. The spatial and temporal limits of many remote sensing sources, such as microwave and optical sensors, combined with environmental conditions, provide considerable feasibility issues. As a result, a robust model capable of accurately capturing both linear and nonlinear connections between multiple surface soil variables is critical. Recently, AI approaches have been identified as promising options for managing complicated factors in this domain. This review paper investigates the use of several AI algorithms for estimating soil moisture content (SMC). It focusses on AI-enabled frameworks built with remote sensing satellite imagery. In addition to including in situ observations, the study discusses the advantages of AI approaches, the issues they solve, and provides a detailed description of the integration of microwave, optical, and combination (synergistic) data sources. This paper also addresses the most common AI approaches applied with various types of remote sensing data and the results they produced. By exploring the strengths and technical problems associated with diverse data sources, this work hopes to help researchers make wise choices about data selection and model construction. Finally, the proposed future research directions are likely to assist emerging researchers in broadening the scope of this critical topic in a way that corresponds with future demands.

  abstract     = {Intracranial hemorrhage (IH) is a critical condition requiring rapid and accurate diagnosis to ensure effective treatment and reduce mortality rates. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) models have demonstrated significant potential in automating the detection and analysis of brain injuries in IH patients. However, the “black-box” nature of many AI systems raises concerns about transparency, reliability, and clinical applicability. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses these challenges by making AI models more interpretable, allowing healthcare professionals to understand and trust the decision-making processes. This review paper explores various XAI techniques—such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation (RISE), Class Activation Mapping (CAM), and its variants—and their specific applications in IH clinical tasks. We systematically examine studies incorporating XAI for curing IH patients, highlighting how these methods enhance model transparency and support clinical decision-making. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology was employed to select the papers. Studies are categorized into those using tabular data and those using image data. The literature indicates a rapidly growing number of XAI publications in this field. SHAP is the most commonly used XAI method for tabular data, while CAM-based methods, such as Grad-CAM, dominate in image-based applications. Furthermore, we discuss current limitations of XAI methods and future research directions. This review aims to provide researchers and clinicians with valuable insights into the role of XAI in improving the reliability and practical integration of AI-driven tools for IH patient care.

This abuse manifests in multiple ways, including hate speech, cyberbullying, emotional abuse, grooming, and shame sexting or sextortion. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the different forms of abuse prevalent in social media, with a particular focus on how emerging technologies, such as Language Models (LMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), are reshaping both the detection and generation of abusive content within these networks. We delve into the mechanisms through which social media abuse is perpetuated, exploring the psychological and social impact. To achieve this, we conducted a literature review based on PRISMA methodology, deriving key insights in the field of cyber abuse detection. Additionally, we examine the dual role of advanced language models—highlighting their potential to enhance automated detection systems for abusive behavior while also acknowledging their capacity to generate harmful content. This paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on online safety and ethics by offering both theoretical and practical insights into the evolving landscape of cyber abuse, as well as the technological innovations that simultaneously mitigate and exacerbate it. The findings support platform administrators and policymakers in developing more effective moderation strategies, conducting comprehensive risk assessments, and integrating AI responsibly to create safer digital environments.
