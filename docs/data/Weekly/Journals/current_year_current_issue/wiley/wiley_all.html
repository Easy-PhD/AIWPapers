  abstract     = {Cyber-attacks pose a security threat to military command and control networks, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, and civilian critical national infrastructure. The use of artificial intelligence and autonomous agents in these attacks increases the scale, range, and complexity of this threat and the subsequent disruption they cause. Autonomous Cyber Defence (ACD) agents aimto mitigate this threat by responding at machine speed and at the scale required to address the problem. Additionally, they reduce the burden on the limited number of human cyber experts available to respond to an attack. Sequential decision-making algorithms such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) provide a promising route to create ACD agents. These algorithms focus on a single objectivesuch as minimising the intrusion of red agents on the network, by using a handcrafted weighted sum of rewards. This approach removes the ability to adapt the model during inference, and fails to address the many competing objectivespresent when operating and protecting these networks. Conflicting objectives, such as restoring a machine from a back-up image, must be carefully balanced with the cost of associated down-time or the disruption to network traffic or services that might result. Instead of pursuing a Single-Objective RL (SORL) approach, here we present a simple example of a multi-objective network defense game that requires consideration of both defending the network against red-agents and maintaining the critical functionality of green-agents. Two Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms, namely Multi-Objective Proximal Policy Optimization (MOPPO) and Pareto-Conditioned Networks (PCN), are used to create two trained ACD agents whose performance is compared on our Multi-Objective Cyber Defense game. The benefits and limitations of MORL ACD agents in comparison to SORL ACD agents are discussed based on the investigations of this game.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a hybrid methodology for evaluating leading retail companies based on customer perspectives, combining Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven sentiment analysis with fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM). The framework integrates large-scale customer review analysis with expert decision-making to provide a comprehensive assessment of retail performance. The process begins with AI-based text mining to collect and analyze customer reviews, extracting emotional tones and identifying frequently mentioned criteria. Expert judgment is then applied to refine, organize, and assign importance to these criteria. The q-rung orthopair fuzzy set MCDM methodology is employed to address uncertainty, conflicting objectives, and qualitative expert opinions by translating them into a structured quantitative evaluation. This hybrid approach offers a balanced assessment that combines subjective and objective dimensions. As a case study, 2000 customer reviews from each of four major U.S. retailers—Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and Target—were analyzed to derive key evaluation criteria based on user feedback. The proposed method distinguishes itself through its unique integration of sentiment analysis and decision-makers' expert evaluations, enabling a holistic and robust evaluation of alternatives. By bridging customer perceptions with expert analysis, this methodology provides a deeper, more nuanced understanding of retailer performance, contributing to improved supplier selection and business decision-making processes. A second analysis, enabled by this methodology, also highlighted key performance differences among the retailers in areas such as customer service, delivery experience, and return/refund processes. Among the findings, Target and Amazon showed the strongest overall sentiment performance, while Costco excelled in return policies and Walmart exhibited weaker results in customer service and delivery. As a result, this hybrid methodology offers valuable insights for both decision-makers aiming to optimize supplier selection and customers seeking better shopping experiences.},

  abstract     = {This review evaluates classical machine learning-based hypertension prediction models, emphasizing their role in addressing global health burdens , particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Hypertension affects over 1.28 billion people globally and contributes to cardiovascular disease and mortality. The review compares machine-learning techniques with traditional methods, focusing on key datasets, evaluation metrics, and model development to advance early detection and effective hypertension management. The review used the PRISMA framework, using databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE explorer to identify studies published between 2020 and 2024 on machine learning techniques, predictive models, and early detection of hypertension based on relevance, methodological rigor, and inclusion criteria. The study analyzed hypertension prediction models across various countries, including the US, England, Korea, Japan, China, Indonesia, Thailand, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and several African countries. The models' performance varied with AUC statistic values ranging from 0.6 to 0.9, indicating a wide range of predictive accuracy. Machine learning techniques generally reported higher performance metrics than traditional statistical methods. Risk factor heterogeneity was evident, with models like random forest, logistic regression, and gradient-boosted trees showing high predictive accuracy. Emerging techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and ensemble methods improved unbalanced data set performance. The review explores the potential of machine learning-based hypertension prediction models in healthcare, highlighting their ability to accurately predict hypertension risk, tailor interventions to specific populations, and optimize healthcare resources in low- and middle-income countries. However, challenges include data quality, model explainability, and ethical considerations. Despite these, ML integration offers scalable and cost-effective solutions, especially in resource-limited settings. Future research should focus on diverse datasets, advanced feature integration, and longitudinal validations.},

  abstract     = {The sterile insect technique (SIT) represents a highly effective and promising method for combating tsetse fly-related infections, which involves the release of sterilized male tsetse flies in the assigned zones. However, tsetse fly rearing poses specific challenges, particularly in the tsetse sex separation, as this process is labor-intensive and incurs significant costs. Here, we report a simple model that classifies tsetse flies by sex using an object detection model based on the YOLO algorithm. This paper also conducted a comparative analysis of YOLOv8 and YOLO11 deep learning models, focusing on their efficacy in tsetse fly detection and classification using a range of performance metrics and statistical analysis. The findings reveal that the classification accuracy of YOLO11 stands at 97.6%, whereas YOLOv8 achieves 95.6%. The classification precision of YOLO11 in identifying tsetse flies is 88.6%, while that of YOLOv8 is 85.9%. Additionally, YOLO11 demonstrates an inference speed of 13.0 ms, slightly faster than YOLOv8's 13.4 ms in tsetse sex detection. Moreover, YOLO11 outperformed YOLOv8 in both F1 score and mAP@0.5–0.9, a success attributed to its enhanced architectural design. However, statistical tests indicate there is no significant difference between the two models, achieving p values ≥ 0.05 for all metrics. This study adds value to tsetse rearing and fly-based disease control by offering automated tsetse sex detection insights into its practical uses in real-world contexts. Furthermore, this research enriches the understanding of the two models with tsetse flies as the focal point and recommends a more effective and accurate detection approach. Finally, integrating the model with the mobile object detection Android app will reduce tsetse sex sorting dependency on experienced technical experts and enhance tsetse rearing productivity.},

Repetitiveness is a common characteristic of human behavior. Repetitiveness indicates which node is updated frequently and its importance. A chatbot needs to solve a situation regarding how quickly it will access its neural memory to retrieve information. Thus, the ranking of nodes in a neural network is necessary to allocate them to the chatbot's memory. The proposed ranking methodology takes affinity, number of edges, adjacency, average weight, and update time interval parameters into account to calculate the ranked value of each node. After that, a ranking tree is generated. This tree is finally considered the memory navigation path in that neural graph. If a node updates regularly with each clock pulse, which resembles a repetitive task, then its ranked value increases. This node should get preference over other low-ranked nodes. This study provides an approach to convert a neural graph into a ranking tree and a path to navigate through it. Thus, the chatbot can identify which node is more promising and has a shorter path than other nodes for information retrieval.},

It divides these numbers into nine groups based on their first digit, with the largest category comprising numbers beginning with 1, followed by those starting with 2, and so on. Each neuron within a neural network (NN) is associated with a numerical value called a weight, which is updated according to specific functions. This research examines the Degree of Benford's Law Existence (DBLE) across two language model methodologies: (1) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and (2) long short-term memory (LSTM). Additionally, this study investigates whether models with higher performance exhibit a stronger presence of DBLE. Two neural network language models, namely: (1) simple RNN and (2) LSTM, were selected as the subject models for the experiment. Each model is tested with five different optimizers and four different datasets (textual corpora selected from Wikipedia). This results in a total of 20 different configurations for each model. The neuron weights for each configuration were extracted at each epoch, and the following metrics were measured at each epoch: (1) DBLE, (2) training set accuracy, (3) training set error, (4) test set accuracy, and (5) test set error. The results show that the weights in both models, across all optimizers, follow Benford's Law. Additionally, the findings indicate a strong correlation between DBLE and the performance on the training set in both language models. This means that models with higher performance on the training set exhibit a stronger correlation of DBLE.},

In this paper, thematic analysis has been performed on unstructured opinions obtained from 11 experts about the integration of LLMs in the field of software development to understand their benefits and limitations using two natural language processing (NLP) techniques: sentiment analysis and keyword extraction and analysis. Sentiment analysis suggests that most experts were optimistic and pragmatic about the use of generative artificial intelligence in software development, although some experts engaged in critical reflection.

  abstract     = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to become an essential tool for defending against machine-speed attacks on increasingly connected cyber networks and systems. It will allow self-defending and self-recovering cyber-defence agents to be developed, which can respond to attacks in a timely manner. But how can these agents be trusted to perform as expected, and how can they be evaluated responsibly and thoroughly? To answer these questions, a Test and Evaluation (T&E) process has been developed to assess cyber-defence agents. The process evaluates the performance, effectiveness, resilience, and generalizability of agents in both low- and high-fidelity cyber environments. This paper demonstrates the low-fidelity part of the process by performing an example evaluation in the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment on Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents trained as part of Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 2. The process makes use of novel Measures of Effectiveness (MoE) metrics, which can be used in combination with performance metrics such as the RL reward. MoE are tailored for cyber defence, allowing a greater understanding of agents' defensive abilities within a cyber environment. Agents are evaluated against multiple conditions that perturb the environment to investigate their robustness to scenarios not seen during training. The results from this evaluation process will help inform decisions around the benefits and risks of integrating autonomous agents into existing or future cyber systems.},

  abstract     = {The brain tumor grows abnormally in the human brain, which causes brain cancer. Death rates have been rising annually for the past few decades due to negligence of early treatment of brain tumors. To reduce the death rate, early identification of tumors is crucial. Early brain tumor detection may potentially lower the risk of life. Manual tumor diagnosis is complex, challenging, and time-consuming for medical professionals. Therefore, automatic detection and segmentation methods simplify the diagnosing procedure. Thus, automatic segmentation and classification methods are taken up to make the diagnosis process easy. This research proposes a two-dimensional cumulative sum average filter (2D-CSAF) for preprocessing images and an improved deviation sparse fuzzy C-means (IDSFCM) with neighbor information for segmenting brain tumors from magnetic resonance images. The novel IDSFCM segmentation increases the noise reduction capability and enhances segmentation accuracies. The hybrid modified sine cosine algorithm-crow search algorithm (MSCA-CSA)–based WELM model is proposed to classify the brain tumor. The MSCA-CSA algorithm optimizes the weights of the WELM model to increase the classification capability. The gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) feature extraction technique is employed to extract the features from the segmented images, and extracted features are given as input to the MSCA-CSA-WELM model for classification. The brain tumor dataset from Harvard Medical School is considered for this research. The proposed IDSFCM segmentation achieved 99.53% segmentation accuracy. The accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity performance measures are considered for the classification. The classification performance was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics. The proposed MSCA-CSA–based WELM model outperformed feature extraction–based classifiers, achieving 99.37% accuracy, 99.87% sensitivity, and 99.44% specificity during training.},

  abstract     = {A neurodevelopmental illness called autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is frequently associated with sensory problems including an excessive or insufficient sensitivity to noises, scents, or touch. Children with autism typically do not talk much and keep to themselves, but they can imitate certain actions from cartoons and movies. They may exhibit unsafe or unexpected behavior as a result. Early detection and therapy can assist in improving the diseases. In this study, we suggested a data-driven machine learning (ML) model for examining the autism dataset of diverse age groups (toddlers, children, and adults) to classify autism in the initial stage. The proposed ML model can efficiently analyze autism patients’ datasets and correctly classify and detect ASD features. We utilized a data preprocessing technique followed by feature selection methods using information gain and Pearson correlation. Then, we employed five different ML classifiers (KNN, RF, SVM, NB, and MLP) together with a hyperparameter optimization strategy. We assess their work using performance metrics such as prediction accuracy and the F1-measure. After comparing the accuracy between different classifiers, SVM produced the highest accuracies of 98%, 99%, and 100% for the toddler, child, and adult datasets while MLP produced an accuracy of 0.94 for the Pakistani child dataset, respectively. These thorough experimental assessments suggest that correct fine-tuning of the ML techniques can be crucial in the classification of autism in individuals of various ages. We believe that the thorough feature significance analysis presented in this study can guide medical professionals’ judgment when screening ASD individuals. In comparison with other methods currently used for the timely identification of ASD, the suggested framework has shown encouraging results.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of the digital age, data have become insecure, which requires techniques to secure data. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has become an increasingly secure technology for storing next-generation digital data. DNA provides superior capabilities due to its high and efficient storage capacity and long lifespan. Protecting these data is of utmost importance, especially data with sensitive content. In this study, the proposed encryption algorithm is a new and novel contribution; a new cryptographic methodology is presented that leverages the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank to create cryptographic keys. This key dictionary is created by nucleotide sequences created from the GenBank database. The proposed methodology uses databases such as the National Center GenBank, which contains huge repositories of genetic information, to improve the effectiveness of data security. By converting traditional digital data into DNA sequences, this methodology provides new features of cryptographic protection. The security and reliability of the proposed methodology were thoroughly tested through simulation and data analysis. The results indicate that the proposed encryption methodology has a superior ability to withstand many types of cryptographic attacks, which confirms its effectiveness and strength in data protection. The paper also presented several findings, including a low encryption time of 250 ms and decryption time of 230 ms, as well as a memory usage of 50 MB for large datasets. Furthermore, the proposed method demonstrated exceptionally high stability. Across all these metrics, the proposed approach outperformed other existing methods. The proposed methodology is applicable to ensure the security and integrity of DNA-based digital storage systems. This methodology was developed independently and has not been previously studied. This modern methodology represents an advance in digital data security and protection, providing an advanced solution in the digital age of cybersecurity.},

Models explored for regression in this paper include linear regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN).

This study developed a neural network classifier to determine the nutritional requirements for four types of Type 2 diabetic patients: those with chronic hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity, or all three conditions. The classifier was trained using Kenya Food Composition Tables data on food nutrients and processing techniques. The neural network had five layers, including three hidden layers with 10 neurons each, using tanh and sigmoid activation functions, gradient descent optimization, cross-entropy loss function, and 0.1 learning rate. Training used 40 hidden neurons per layer, 60,000 epochs and 0.2 learning rate. The neural network was evaluated against random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). The neural network achieved high performance with 91.4% accuracy, 88% recall, 86.8% precision, and 87.3% F1-score.

  abstract     = {The prevailing method for grading oil palm fruit bunches in mills relies on human graders conducting visual inspections, resulting in frequent errors and inconsistent assessments. This is a significant open problem when developing a detector for oil palm fruit ripeness and oil content, which are related factors. Current trends focus on computer vision techniques based on image processing and machine learning to improve grading of oil palm fruit bunches at an individual factory, resulting in limited diversity of the data used for evaluation. Collecting data from all factories offers informational advantages but raises privacy concerns. Addressing these challenges, this study proposes federated learning (FL) to develop local and global prediction models for grading oil palm fruit ripeness while preserving data privacy. FL facilitates collaborative model training across factories, mitigating privacy risks and enhancing model development efficiency. The proposed model uses the color of palm husks to determine the ripeness stage, which is used as a factor in predicting the yield of oil from the crop. A predictive model was created using FL principles with a training dataset of 5209 images, which was divided into two subsets: single-palm (2571 images) and multipalm (2638 images). The classification accuracy of a global model was 90.0%, while the local models were expanded to include private data for each of 4 testing clients. The predictive global and local models from FL were used to implement the system in a web application form and to validate its performance in calling the oil palm ripeness stage.},

Proper garbage waste processing, management, and recycling are crucial for both ecological and economic reasons. Computer vision techniques have shown advanced capabilities in various applications, including object detection and classification. In this study, we conducted an extensive review of the use of artificial intelligence for garbage processing and management. However, a major limitation in this field is the lack of datasets containing top-view images of garbage. We introduce a new dataset named “KACHARA,” containing 4727 images categorized into seven classes: clothes, decomposable (organic waste), glass, metal, paper, plastic, and wood. Importantly, the dataset exhibits a moderate imbalance, mirroring the distribution of real-world garbage, which is crucial for training accurate classification models. For classification, we utilize transfer learning with the well-known deep learning model MobileNetV3-Large, where the top layers are fine-tuned to enhance performance. We achieved a classification accuracy of 94.37% and also evaluated performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. These results demonstrate the model’s strong generalization in aerial/top-view garbage classification.},

This study proposes an AutoGluon–Shapley additive explanations (AutoGluon-SHAP) approach, which automatically predicts concrete mechanical strength while providing insightful interpretations of the results. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to enhance global accessibility to the model. AutoGluon leverages powerful algorithms such as LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, random forest, ensembles, and neural networks within its TabularPredictor to automate model selection. The models were trained and tested using a comprehensive dataset of 1760 concrete samples sourced from the published literature, encompassing diverse concrete types, cement brands, additives, target compressive strengths, and curing periods. Results show that the WeightedEnsemble_L2 predictive model demonstrated robust performance in estimating flexural, tensile, and compressive strengths. All the predictive models achieved high performance with R 2 of more than 0.98 for all the strengths’ properties. SHAP offered both global insights into the influence of the predictors on mechanical strength and local explanations for individual predictions, ensuring transparency and reliability.

This study presents a comprehensive hybrid modeling approach to predict oil prices in the context of Russia and Ukraine across three distinct periods: before the war, during the war, and the immediate aftermath of the conflict. Using advanced machine learning techniques, we developed a hybrid system combining Random Forest, ElasticNet, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regressor models. These models were integrated through a Voting Regressor to enhance prediction accuracy. Our analysis revealed varying levels of predictive performance across the different periods. Prior to the war, the models showed strong predictive capabilities, evidenced by low mean-squared error (MSE) values and high coefficients of determination ( R 2 ). However, during the war, the models struggled to capture extreme volatility, resulting in significantly increased MSE and negative R 2 values. Predictions for the immediate aftermath of the conflict demonstrated improvements, with a reduction in MSE and positive R 2 values, indicating a return to relatively more stable market conditions. Notably, combining data from both before the war and war periods could further improve predictive accuracy, as it would reduce the impact of the conflict’s volatility on model performance. These results emphasize the challenges of forecasting oil prices in periods of geopolitical instability and underscore the importance of hybrid modeling approaches to adapt to rapidly changing market dynamics.},

In this study, we propose an efficient approach combining dynamic contrast stretching (DCS) method, advanced morphological operation–based segmentation, triangle thresholding, and a final postprocessing step. Our preprocessing step enhances the contrast of retinal images acquired under various lighting conditions, enabling reliable and accurate segmentation. This enhancement is achieved using the DCS method, which is compared to two widely used contrast enhancement techniques: adaptive histogram equalization (AHE) and contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). The second step combines morphological operations and triangle thresholding to enhance vessel structures, eliminate noise, and separate blood vessels effectively. Postprocessing addresses artifacts and ambiguous areas at image boundaries. Our approach is evaluated using widely recognized reference datasets, including Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE), Structured Analysis of the Retina (STARE), and High-Resolution Fundus (HRF). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior segmentation accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. Specifically, we achieve average accuracy rates of 98.08%, 97.14%, and 98.94% for the DRIVE, STARE, and HRF datasets, respectively. In addition, our method is distinguished by exceptionally fast execution times, reaching 0.013 s for the DRIVE and STARE datasets.

  abstract     = {Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the virus has posed a grave threat to human health. Automated segmentation of COVID-19 lung computed tomography (CT) scans is a crucial diagnostic tool that aids physicians in providing accurate and timely diagnoses, as it contains significant radiomics information. Given that the specificity for discriminating between the causes of conventional pulmonary features is lower than its sensitivity, the primary goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a CT-based radiomics model capable of distinguishing between COVID-19 and other lung diseases. To address this, we propose an efficient, modified radiomics feature processing method that integrates an optimal aerial perspective (OAP) parameter-based intensity dark channel prior (IDCP) with a 50-layer residual deep neural network (ResNet50 DNN) for autolesion segmentation (ALS-IOAP-DNN). To further enhance COVID-19 lesion estimation, novel optimization strategies, including a hybrid simulated annealing-cuckoo search (SA-CS) algorithm, are introduced alongside the original SA method. The SA-CS algorithm extends SA by preventing entrapment in local minimum and enhancing global exploration. Five benchmark functions are used to accelerate convergence and address the issue of local optima. As a result, the hybrid approach outperforms 10 recent studies on two publicly available datasets (COVID-CT-Dataset and HUST-19), achieving an average accuracy score of 100% across different epochs, along with perfect accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 100% specificity. The proposed models significantly outperform the baseline model, with accuracy improvements of 13.6% on Data1 and 2.5% on Data2. While the baseline model achieves 88% accuracy on Data1 and 97.6% on Data2, the proposed ALS-IOAP-DNN4 model attains perfect accuracy (100%) on both datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of ALS and advanced optimization techniques. Furthermore, the use of OAP with IDCP enhances the precision of COVID-19 lesion estimation, underscoring its significance in COVID-19 diagnosis and medical imaging management.},

Highly accurate and reliable T w forecasts are essential for the ecological management of rivers. This study evaluates the performance of machine learning-based predictive models in forecasting T w in the Catu River. The models were trained using climatic and hydrological data collected from 2009 to 2016 and validated with real data from 2023. The evaluated models include backpropagation neural network (BPNN), Random Forest, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Air2Stream, and NARX, employing nine input variables such as atmospheric pressure, air temperature, and water vapor concentration. The results show that the BiLSTM model achieved the best performance, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12°C and R 2 = 0.98, followed by BPNN with an RMSE of 0.18°C and R 2 = 0.91, and the Random Forest model, which obtained an NSE of 0.95. These models demonstrated a strong ability to predict T w under both normal and extreme conditions, capturing the thermal dynamics of the Catu River with high precision during events involving minor thermal variations. Conversely, the NARX and Air2Stream models exhibited lower performance, proving more prone to errors under conditions of extreme variability. The findings of this study provide valuable scientific insights for river T w prediction and the protection of aquatic ecosystems, with practical applications in water resource management in tropical regions.},

  abstract     = {Biometric security systems must be able to detect phony fingerprints to provide reliable authentication. The findings of this study suggest a hybrid approach to the detection of fake fingerprints that uses information on the texture and shape of the fingerprint. The novelty of this approach lies in integrating both traditional fingerprint information and geometric features obtained through wavelet transformation, which has not been extensively explored in previous studies. The proposed procedure uses the traditional fingerprint information and the geometric features that may be collected by wavelet modification. This allows it to take advantage of the complementary capabilities that these two types of capabilities offer. In addition, the hybrid feature set improves the system’s robustness and accuracy by leveraging each feature type’s unique strengths. To achieve this goal, the standard fingerprint information and the geometric aspects of the fingerprint are combined. It is possible to efficiently identify authentic and forged fingerprints by using these hybrid features and training a gradient boosting classifier. The findings of the studies demonstrate that the suggested technique achieves an accuracy of 96% on medium spoofing photos from the SOCOFing dataset, 97% on hard spoofing images, and 98% on mixed spoofing images. This high level of accuracy, especially on mixed spoofing images, showcases the effectiveness of the novel hybrid approach in diverse and challenging scenarios. This places it in the position of being the most accurate way currently accessible among the existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed method’s scalability and adaptability make it suitable for real-world applications, potentially setting a new standard in biometric security. There is a great deal of optimism that the technique that has been described can increase the reliability and safety of biometric systems when used in situations representative of the actual world.},

This study proposes an efficient spectrum-sharing technique for dual-hop CRNs using NOMA, optimized by an improved artificial bee colony (IABC) algorithm and guided by a single-input single-output fuzzy rule-based system (SISO-FRBS). In this setup, a distant primary transmitter communicates with the primary receiver via a secondary NOMA relay. The objective is to maximize the sum data rate of secondary users (SUs) while minimizing total transmission power. SISO-FRBS enhances the IABC search process by dynamically guiding the search agents, improving both optimization quality and convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves the primary data rate benchmark of 5 bit/s/Hz at a transmit power of 19 mW, compared with 23 mW with traditional ABC, achieving a 19.04% improvement in power efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Computer vision plays a crucial role in current day tasks due to its wide range of merits and applications in many fields like disease diagnosis, medical decisions, military, security, scientific applications, and business. Identifying plant species upon their leaf images is a very challenging and complex task. In this study, we introduced a model for classifying a variety set of plant leaves using different techniques such as factorization machine (FM), dimensionality reduction (DR), and ensemble learning (EL). In our study, FM is used as a classification algorithm, whereas DR is included in two stages, namely, feature extraction (FE) and feature selection (FS). FE has been used to extract the features from images in tabular form; on the other hand, FS is used to reduce the size of the data by getting rid of noisy (redundant and irrelevant) features. In addition, we utilized two methods for FS, filter-based and wrapper-based approaches. The used filter was the minimum redundancy maximum relevance, and the used wrapper was the improved binary cuckoo search algorithm that is based on Lévy flight and abandon nest functions. Regarding EL, it was used to declare different versions of FM by passing different subsets of features that are deduced from the original ones to improve its performance. We used the Swedish and Flavia leaf datasets for training and testing phases. The proposed model achieved a high performance in terms of accuracy that produced 95.67% on Swedish dataset and 99.6% on Flavia dataset. According to the results and in comparison to other methods, we proved that our proposed model ensures a favorable plant leaf classification approach. Finally, the proposed wrapper FS approach showed very good results without setting up the number of features to be selected by the user.

Recently, there has been an increase in the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in hydrogeology to estimate GWL in monitoring wells. This study presents a novel technique for predicting GWL changes that uses three independent datasets: historical GWL and climatic variables (CVs) data such as rainfall and temperature influencing groundwater dynamics. In our experimental research, the models’ prediction output on real-world datasets ensures that the model’s significant patterns are recorded while taking into account the noise in the data, resulting in a perfect balance of bias and variance. The DL models’ results show a significant score of root mean square error (RMSE) between 2.20 and 12.40 and coefficient of determination ( R -squared between 0.84–0.99), showing a significant improvement in RMSE and mean absolute error (MAE) in the testing and validation categories, when compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. This study improves our understanding of GWL modeling and provides decision-makers with a reliable tool for controlling change. The study advances environmental modeling by exhibiting methodological complexity and emphasizes the importance of comprehensive data analysis in water resource management.},

  abstract     = {Stroke disease has been the leading cause of death globally for the last several decades. Thus, the death rate can be decreased by early recognition of disease and ongoing surveillance. However, the largest obstacle to perform advanced analytics using the conventional approach is the growth of massive amount of data from various sources, including patient histories, wearable sensor devices, and medical data. The current technology that could have a large impact on the healthcare sector is the integration of machine learning with big data analytics (scalable machine learning), particularly in the early diagnosis of this disease. To address this issue, a scalable stroke disease prediction model for a multinode distributed environment, which was developed by combining big data analytics concepts with machine learning to handle extensive healthcare datasets, an aspect not seen in the prior literature on stroke disease detection, is presented in this work. We have implemented four scalable algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient-boosting tree, and decision tree, using a dataset that was collected from a Medical Quality Improvement Consortium database. As a result, two worker nodes and one master node were used to analyze the dataset. The model’s performance was assessed using performance metrics including the area under the curve (AUC) and confusion matrix. With an accuracy of 94.3% and an AUC score of 99%, the random forest was determined to be better based on the experimental results. It was also shown that the main risk factor for stroke disease is diabetes, which is followed by hypertension. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of using Spark’s scalable machine learning techniques to forecast stroke disease and identify risk factors earlier. The findings of this study can be utilized by physicians as clinical decision aids to aid in the more accurate identification of stroke disease.},

  abstract     = {The accurate prediction of subscriber traffic is a critical challenge in telecommunication networks, as it is essential for making informed decisions to maintain consistent service quality. Various artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been explored for this purpose, with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) being particularly popular. However, RNNs often suffer from the gradient vanishing problem, which reduces their effectiveness in processing long sequences of data. Long short–term memory (LSTM) networks partially address this issue by controlling the propagation of learning errors, but they still face challenges related to convergence speed and residual learning errors. To address these limitations, this study proposes a new hybrid RNN architecture that combines features of Jordan and Frasconi networks for improved subscriber traffic prediction. The proposed architecture integrates two sublayers, a sigmoid and a Gaussian function, within a hidden layer that forms a loop. This configuration enables the network to leverage incremental learning through restricted Coulomb energy (RCE) at the local level, while also benefiting from global learning through backpropagation. The architecture was tested on a dataset consisting of cellular traffic data collected from a telecommunication operator in Cameroon. The results demonstrated that the hybrid RNN model outperforms traditional Jordan and Frasconi networks, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 14.18 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.61 using the Adam optimizer with a batch size of 64. In addition, the hybrid model showed superior performance in terms of RMSE, MAE, and convergence speed compared to the existing models. These findings suggest that the proposed model could support telecom operators in proactive congestion management and resource optimization.},

Unfortunately, traditional approaches to predicting readmissions frequently lack accuracy. This presents a critical challenge, as identifying patients at high risk for readmission is essential for implementing preventive measures. The study introduces a novel method that employs machine learning to automatically extract features from patient data, eliminating labor-intensive manual feature engineering. The primary goal is to develop predictive models for unplanned readmissions for UTI patients at Jordan University Hospital within 3 months postdischarge. This is executed through a retrospective analysis of electronic health records from January 2020 to June 2023. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the study identifies high-risk patients by evaluating demographic, clinical, and outcome characteristics, ensuring model reliability through thorough optimization, validation, and performance assessment. Three predictive models were developed as follows: a gradient-boosting classifier (GBC), logistic regression (LR), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The GBC, SGD, and LR achieved impressive accuracy rates of 99%, 95%, and 89%, providing strong confidence in the methodology. The study’s findings reveal key risk factors associated with readmissions, enhancing our understanding of this process and offering a valuable framework for improving patient care, optimizing resource allocation, and supporting evidence-based decision-making in healthcare management.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is characterized by abnormal cell growth, which leads to tumor formation. Autonomous breast cancer detection has seen good progress. However, there are still several challenges to robust detection. This survey article explores the complexities inherent in multiclass classification for breast cancer diagnosis, aiming to improve patient care, efficiency, and timeliness. In our study, we focus on using histopathology slide images and assess the current state of breast cancer classification, particularly with artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning and convolutional neural networks. The histopathology images are key tools in the diagnosis process, allowing pathologists to visually assess tissue samples for signs of cancer. Our analysis reveals several challenges that hinder the effectiveness of current diagnostic methods. One significant issue is the need for more diversity in the existing datasets, which often fail to represent a wide range of patient populations. This limitation reduces the accuracy of diagnostic results, mainly when applied to different clinical environments. Furthermore, class imbalances within these datasets, where certain cancer types or stages are underrepresented, lead to biased diagnoses, with more common cases being easily identified while rarer cases are frequently missed. Another challenge is the limited generalizability of current diagnostic techniques, which perform well in controlled environments but often need to improve when applied to new, unseen data from different institutions or imaging systems. Additionally, the complexity of histopathological analysis means that it can be difficult for clinicians to interpret certain findings, leading to uncertainty in the diagnostic process. Our study reveals that addressing these issues requires collaborative efforts to improve the quality of datasets, reduce class imbalances, and develop optimal standardized diagnostic methods. By overcoming these challenges, we can enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility of breast cancer diagnosis, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and global healthcare. We believe that by examining several factors and variables and conducting an in-depth analysis of the state of the art, this study will contribute to the state of the art and benefit researchers in both computing and medical domains.},

  abstract     = {In today’s mobile communication society, the integration of mobile technology in education has revolutionised learning through m-Learning. This approach leverages wireless mobile technology and computing, enabling learners to access educational resources anytime and anywhere, thereby enhancing flexibility and freedom. Mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets and PDAs, facilitate m-Learning by providing mobility and interactive learning environments. M-Learning is characterised by its personalised, collaborative, and ubiquitous nature, offering learners context-aware experiences tailored to their immediate surroundings and needs. Context awareness plays a pivotal role in m-Learning, distinguishing it from traditional education by dynamically adapting content delivery based on factors beyond just location, including time, network conditions and user preferences. This adaptability poses significant challenges in designing effective teaching strategies that meet diverse learner requirements. To address these challenges, this study explores the application of machine learning techniques—specifically “Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS)”—in developing a Context-Aware m-Learning platform. Performance comparisons based on RMSE, MAE and accuracy metrics reveal ANFIS as the optimal method for enhancing the proposed m-Learning system, aligning with the contextual demands and parameters defined for effective mobile education. ANFIS’s ability to minimise absolute prediction errors more effectively than the other methods. In terms of accuracy, ANFIS again leads the performance metrics, achieving an accuracy of 82.46% with 10 neurons. In comparison, ANN and KNN achieved accuracies of 81.17% and 80.74%, respectively. These accuracy values indicate that ANFIS not only reduces prediction errors but also consistently delivers higher predictive accuracy.

  abstract     = {As smart cities have evolved through the constant incorporation of advanced technologies such as Internet of Things, the importance of efficient data collection and robust security monitoring has increased massively. These smart cities, while monitoring and evaluating different activities, utilize a network of interconnected sensors and devices. This would not only enhance the provision of public services but also ensure increased safety measures. However, the extensive implementation of such systems has increased the concerns related to privacy and data protection. The growing dependence on surveillance technology in smart cities, though beneficial in terms of security, has also increased challenges associated with the protection of individual privacy. As such, different research has been conducted to develop advanced solutions that ensure the security of an individual while also safeguarding their personal privacy. This study examines the different aspects of privacy preservation in the context of security surveillance in smart cities. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of 100 research articles, it elucidates the current state of research and identifies emerging solutions aimed at safeguarding citizen privacy while simultaneously upholding the integrity of smart urban environments.},

This research investigates the application of deep feature extraction for classifying eight different ocular diseases. The VGG16, a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model, was employed for feature extraction, while the fine k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier was utilized for classification. Experimental results showed an initial classification accuracy of 89.2% using features from Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) heatmaps and 83.1% using Multiscale Retinex (MSR) enhanced images. However, combining both feature sets led to an improved classification accuracy of 96.5%. Despite these promising results, several challenges remain, including the need for models that generalize across diverse patient imaging and demographics modalities, the accessibility of extensive annotated datasets, and the interpretability of models. Ethical issues and legal frameworks are also crucial for the safe and fair implementation of AI in medical services. The study suggests that future efforts in deep learning for ophthalmology should focus on creating large-scale, annotated datasets to enhance the detection of ocular diseases.},

The models were trained using historical price, weather, and rainfall data using time-series forecasting methods, specifically LSTM and CNN. The findings indicate that stepwise feature selection minimizes prediction errors and improves MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and MAE. Preliminary experiments revealed that the LSTM model with feature selection outperformed the other models, particularly in feature selection. Employing standard hyperparameters of 100 epochs, 32 batches, and five windows, the model demonstrated superior performance with a lower MSE (0.0010), RMSE (0.0274), MAPE (3.7803), and MAE (0.0158) than the CNN model. Statistical hypothesis testing revealed significant variations between the LSTM and CNN models, with feature selection p -values below 0.05. These results indicate that LSTM with feature selection models optimized through refined hyperparameters leads to more accurate Thai morning glory price forecasting, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in their decision-making processes. Additionally, this study can forecast prices for 5, 7, 14, and 21 days in advance based on different Window_len values, addressing various planning needs. The 5- and 7-day forecasts support short-term decision-making, such as scheduling harvest cycles and weekly market planning, whereas the 14-day forecast assists farmers in optimizing planting schedules and logistics. Furthermore, the 21-day forecast is beneficial for medium-term market planning, including negotiating forward contracts and adjusting distribution strategies to maximize profitability.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer is a significant global health issue, ranking as the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early diagnosis of this disease is of utmost importance to increase the survival rate and enhance the healthcare system. Many machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods have been proposed to facilitate automated early diagnosis of this cancer. However, label noise in medical images and the dependence on a single model can lead to suboptimal model performance, which could potentially hinder the development of a sophisticated automated solution. In this paper, we address label noise in training data and propose a stacking-ensemble model for classifying colorectal cancer along with a trustworthy computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. Initially, a variety of filtering methods are extensively analyzed to determine the most suitable image representation, with subsequent data augmentation techniques. Second, a modified VGG-16 model was proposed with fine-tuning that was utilized as a feature extractor to extract meaningful features from the training samples. Third, a prediction uncertainty and probabilistic local outlier factor (pLOF) were applied to the extracted features to address the label noise issue in the training data. Fourth, we adopted a random forest–based recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE) feature selection method with various combinations of features to recursively select the most influential ones for accurate predictions. Fifth, four base ML classifiers and a metamodel were selected to build our final stacking-ensemble model, which integrates the prediction probabilities of multiple models into a meta-feature set to ensure trustworthy predictions. Finally, we integrated these strategies and deployed them into a web application to demonstrate a CAD system. This system not only predicts the disease but also generates the prediction probabilities of each class, which enhances both clarity and diagnostic insight. Our proposed model was compared with different state-of-the-art ML classifiers on a publicly available dataset and demonstrated the highest accuracy of 92.43%.},

In this study, we aimed to (1) determine the typical region of body thermograms and (2) propose a soft-vote fusion algorithm to develop a more accurate result in obesity detection. The typical regions of thermograms were selected by training and testing the pretrained CNN models with the thermogram dataset of all-region and single-region. All-region dataset includes thermograms from five regions, namely, supraclavicular (SCV), abdomen, forearm, palm, and shank, while each of single-region dataset consists of thermograms from an individual region. When tested on all-region dataset, the CNN model achieved the highest accuracy of 90.00%. When tested with a single-region dataset, three regions, namely, SCV, abdomen, and forearm, achieved the highest accuracy of 94.23% (SCV) and 96.15% (abdomen and forearm), which indicated that these regions were more representative than palm and shank. Then, we proposed a soft-vote fusion algorithm in which different trained CNN models from the previous experiments were combined to improve the detection performance. We found that the combination of those three regions can achieve the highest accuracy with the smallest model size. One of those proposed combinations achieved an accuracy of 98.08% with a framework size of 19.4 MB by only using SCV and abdomen thermogram as the inputs.},

The input text alone often provides limited knowledge to generate contextually correct and meaningful translation. Relying solely on the input text could yield translations that lack accuracy. Side information related to either source or target side is helpful in the context of NMT. In this study, we empirically show that training an NMT model with target-side additional information used as knowledge can significantly improve the translation quality. The acquired knowledge is leveraged in the encoder-/decoder-based model utilizing multiencoder framework. The additional encoder converts knowledge into dense semantic representation called attention. These attentions from the input sentence and additional knowledge are then combined into a unified attention. The decoder generates the translation by conditioning on both the input text and acquired knowledge. Evaluation of translation from Urdu to English with a low-resource setting yields promising results in terms of both perplexity reduction and improved BLEU scores. The proposed models in the respective group outperform in LSTM and GRU with attention mechanism by +3.1 and +2.9 BLEU score, respectively. Extensive analysis confirms our claim that the translations influenced by additional information may occasionally contain rare low-frequency words and faithful translation. Experimental results on a different language pair DE-EN demonstrate that our suggested method is more efficient and general.},

  abstract     = {A traffic network exhibits inherent characteristics of networks while also possessing unique features that hold significant research value. In this study, the limitations of static graph structures and the challenges of accurately modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in traffic flow have been addressed through a hybrid GCN-gated recurrent unit (GRU)-transformer model. The proposed model integrates a dynamic topology module (DTM) with graph attention networks (GATs), GRUs, and transformer-based temporal modules to adaptively capture the evolving dynamics of traffic networks. The DTM dynamically updates graph structures based on real-time traffic conditions, while GATs focus on identifying critical spatial relationships. GRUs efficiently capture temporal dependencies, and the transformer model captures long-term sequential patterns, providing a comprehensive framework for real-time traffic forecasting. The proposed model was trained and evaluated using the METR-LA dataset, which comprises traffic data from 207 sensors at 5-minute intervals. The model demonstrated superior performance across various metrics, achieving RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values of 4.125%, 2.985%, and 5.432%, respectively, for 15-minute predictions, with an R 2 value of 0.928. For longer prediction horizons (30, 45, and 60 min), the model consistently outperformed baseline methods, maintaining competitive RMSE and MAPE values. The experimental setup included normalization, graph construction using adjacency matrices, and preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and robustness. The integration of spatial and temporal features through the GCN-GRU-transformer framework enhanced the model’s ability to generalize across varying traffic scenarios, including peak hours and disruptions. Compared to traditional methods, which often rely on static graphs and fail to adapt to real-time changes, the hybrid model effectively addresses both spatial heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. The results indicate its robustness in handling complex traffic dynamics, adaptability to real-world variations, and potential applications in intelligent transportation systems. Future work will focus on incorporating multimodal data sources and enhancing computational efficiency to achieve broader scalability and deployment in smart city infrastructures.},

Consequently, hate speech and offensive content have turned out to be a widespread issue that negatively affects both individuals and society and needs to be controlled through detection and removal. This paper aims to provide a further understanding of the meaning of hate speech and offensive language and to provide a comprehensive discussion of the various techniques to detect hate speech and offensive language. A systematic literature review (SLR) of 90 research papers published between 2018 and 2024 was conducted to discover gaps within the literature. This review revealed challenges and possibilities for further development and improvement of previous findings. The results show that most of these works classified hate speech and offensive language using techniques from machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), and the most common performance metrics were Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-measure. The benchmark datasets are also described. Twitter was the most commonly utilized social network for obtaining datasets, while Facebook is sometimes used. Moreover, the findings of this review offer insight into research trends in Arabic hate speech and offensive language, as well as new research directions. The most interesting finding is that until now most Social Media Network Developers have not included autodetection of hate speech or offensive language plugins. Finally, this study presents a guideline for choosing the best strategies and techniques to detect and predict Arabic offensive language and hate speech.},

  abstract     = {This study presents ensemble machine learning (ML) models for predicting residential energy consumption in South Africa. By combining the best features of individual ML models, ensemble models reduce the drawbacks of each model and improve prediction accuracy. We present four ensemble models: ensemble by averaging (EA), ensemble by stacking each estimator (ESE), ensemble by boosting (EB), and ensemble by voting estimator (EVE). These models are built on top of Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT). These base predictor models leverage historical energy consumption patterns to capture temporal intricacies, including seasonal variations and rolling averages. In addition, we employed feature engineering methodologies to further enhance their predictive abilities. The accuracy of each ensemble model was evaluated by assessing various performance indicators, including the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination R 2 . Overall, the findings illustrate the efficiency of ensemble learning models in providing accurate predictions for residential energy consumption. This study provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in predicting energy consumption in residential buildings and the benefits of using ensemble learning models in the building and energy research domains.},

  abstract     = {A vast variety of neural network (NN)–based controllers use indirect adaptive control structures for their implementation, which primarily aims at estimating the nonlinear dynamics of the system and thereby generating a suitable control action. However, the most commonly used gradient descent weight update rule of the NN-based indirect adaptive controllers often fails to identify the system dynamics appropriately, and the control action becomes ineffective on the system under control. Further, a significant number of existing works in this domain employ randomized or suboptimal initial NN weights, which can potentially hamper the transient performance of the control loop. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative control scheme that utilizes the strength of indirect adaptive control of NN, along with the robustness of the PID controller. Since the PID control structure is often independent of plant dynamics and generates a control action to mitigate any error between the reference and the current plant output, it can be easily augmented with the control action generated by inverse neural network (INN) to mitigate any effects of unlearnt dynamics by INN. Further, we have used a bio-inspired optimization algorithm, that is, particle swarm optimization (PSO), to optimize the initial weights of the INN along with the PID controller’s parameters to get an optimal control performance. The proposed INN + PID controller scheme has been tested on a cart-mounted inverted pendulum system due to its challenging control requirement owing to its intricate nonlinear dynamics. Detailed simulation studies for the proposed INN + PID and PID controllers have been carried out for various control requirements, viz. set point tracking, disturbance rejection, and robustness testing. Further, an extensive comparative study has been devised based on the integral of absolute error (IAE) to test the efficacy of the proposed INN + PID controller against the conventional PID controller. Through extensive comparative studies, it was deduced that the proposed INN + PID controller is capable of handling the intricate nonlinear dynamics of the cart-mounted inverted pendulum system and provides a sturdy stabilization of the angular position of the pendulum with respect to the desired trajectory and superior transient control in comparison with the conventional PID controller. In terms of quantitative comparison, the improvement in IAE achieved by the proposed INN + PID controller was found to be 94.84%, 94.62%, and 69.86% better in comparison to the conventional PID controller for set point tracking, disturbance rejection for introduced impulsive force, and time-varying force variation, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Skin cancer spreads quickly as the skin is the most vulnerable organ, and melanoma (MEL) is a fatal type of skin cancer. Detecting MEL in the early stage can hugely increase the chance of a cure. There are several methods based on machine learning to detect MEL from dermoscopic images. However, increasing the accuracy of detection is still challenging. This paper presents a new method for MEL detection that considers the combination of deep and handcrafted time–frequency local features. After short preprocessing, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) extract the deep features. To this end, feature maps at the output of the flatten layer are considered as deep features. The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptors are handcrafted local features computed from the four subbands of one-level two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D DWT). After the fusion of the mentioned features, semisupervised discriminant analysis (SDA) reduces the highly correlated and redundant features. The Bayesian optimizer finds the optimum parameters of the SDA and Gaussian kernel of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to maximize the classification accuracy. The HAM10000 dataset with data augmentation is considered to assess the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results show that the proposed method reaches the accuracy and sensitivity of 94.19% and 96.22%, respectively. The most challenging parts of the proposed method are extraction of deep features and tuning the parameters of SDA and Gaussian-SVM.},

  abstract     = {This research focuses on developing an intelligent administrative chatbot for Roman Urdu to overcome the language barrier that hinders individuals who are not fluent in English from utilizing existing chatbot frameworks. While chatbot architectures can be rule based or artificial intelligence (AI) based, the core objective of a chatbot is to effectively address user queries across diverse domains. AI-based chatbots have demonstrated higher interactivity, scalability, adaptability to human interests, and evolving knowledge compared with rule-based architectures. However, the majority of existing chatbot frameworks is in English, which poses a challenge in regions like Pakistan where only a small percentage of the population is proficient in English. In response to this challenge, this research introduces an intelligent administrative chatbot specifically developed for Roman Urdu. Roman Urdu is the practice of writing Urdu, the native language of Pakistan, using the English alphabet. The proposed chatbot allows students to post their questions in either English or Roman Urdu, enabling them to obtain conclusive answers. The chatbot system utilizes a sentence analysis approach to generate relevant and productive responses to user queries. The core building block of the proposed chatbot is the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model with long short-term memory (LSTM) units. To train the model, a dataset was meticulously collected from various administrative offices at the University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore, initially in English and subsequently translated into Roman Urdu using different writing styles. The effectiveness of the proposed system was evaluated through a human judgment approach, assessing the contextual relevance and productivity of the chatbot’s responses to relevant questions. In conclusion, this research aims to bridge the language gap in chatbot frameworks, enhancing accessibility and usability.},

  abstract     = {Face recognition is a reliable biometric technology that utilizes artificial intelligence and computer vision to identify and verify an individual’s identity based on facial features. Its rapid development has enabled integration into diverse applications, including security systems, access control, forensics, and mobile devices. However, challenges such as recognizing faces across different ages persist, presenting opportunities for further research. Developing robust face recognition models requires substantial training datasets, but manually labeling large collections of facial images is both time-intensive and costly. Our previous study demonstrated that a ResNet-50 model trained on a dataset of 44,000 facial images, combining the original FaceScrub dataset with HyperStyle age and smile augmentations, achieved an F1-score of 79%, significantly outperforming the model trained solely on the authentic FaceScrub dataset (F1-score: 63%). Building upon these findings, this study explores a broader range of augmentation styles, including pose and domain adaptation, e.g., Pixar, Toonify, Sketch, and Disney, using the HyperStyle scheme. Models trained with domain adaptation showed reduced performance (F1-score: 64%) due to the domain gap introduced by cartoon-like styles. In contrast, models trained with pose augmentation achieved an F1-score of 75%, demonstrating the importance of augmentations resembling real-world variations. When training incorporated all augmentation styles, e.g., age, smile, pose, and domain adaptation, the F1-score reached 78%, slightly lower than the model trained with age and smile augmentations only (F1-score: 79%). To further evaluate the impact of age and smile augmentations, additional experiments were conducted using various CNN models, including VGGNet-16, MobileNetV3Small, SEResNet-18, and ResNet-50, under different hyperparameter configurations. Among these, ResNet-50 achieved the highest F1-score (82%), surpassing VGGNet-16 (60%), MobileNetV3Small (65%), and SEResNet-18 (81%). The study also introduced modifications to the HyperStyle scheme in both the preprocessing and postprocessing stages, which further enhanced model performance. The ResNet-50 model trained with the modified HyperStyle scheme, and the original FaceScrub dataset achieved the highest F1-score of 83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of these modifications in improving face recognition performance.},

The utilized dataset, combined with multiple open-source datasets, comprises 43,000 real, 31,000 fake, and 80,000 AI–generated news articles and is augmented with an ensemble large language model. We combined three open-source LLMs (GPT-2, GPT-NEO, and Distil-GPT-2) into an ensemble LLM to generate new news titles, selecting the best outputs through majority voting for further dataset expansion. Preprocessing involved data cleaning, lowercasing, stop word removal, tokenization, and lemmatization. We applied six machine learning and five natural language processing models to this dataset. The two top-performing natural language–based models (RoBERTa and DeBERTa) have been combined to develop an ensemble transformer model. Among the machine learning models, random forest achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 92.49% and an F1 score of 92.60%. Among the natural language processing models, the ensemble transformer model attained the highest results, with 96.65% accuracy and an F1 score of 96.66%. The proposed ensemble model is optimized by applying model pruning (reducing parameters from 265M to 210M, improving training time by 25%) and dynamic quantization (reducing model size by 50%, maintaining 95.68% accuracy), enhancing scalability and efficiency while minimizing computational overhead. The DistilBERT-Student model, trained using a balanced combination of feature- and logit-based distillation from the RoBERTa-base Teacher network, achieved strong classification performance with 96.17% accuracy. Visualize-based attention maps are constructed for different news categories to enhance the interpretability of the applied transformer–based ensemble news detection models. Finally, a website was developed to enable users to identify fake, real, or AI–generated news content.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of cold-deck, mean, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) imputation techniques for predicting thyroid disease using a dataset of 9172 observations with 31 clinical features (5.2% missing values). Feature importance analysis identified thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (TT4), and free thyroxine index (FTI) as consistently significant biomarkers across all imputation methods. Five classifiers—Naïve Bayes, linear regression, support vector machines (SVM), LightGBM, and recurrent neural networks (RNN)—were assessed on imputed datasets, with performance evaluated through accuracy, F1 score, and recall. The KNN imputation method enhanced LightGBM’s accuracy by 0.47% over mean imputation (99.06% vs. 98.99%) and by 1.47% over cold deck (99.06% vs. 98.59%), demonstrating its superiority in preserving feature relationships and enhancing predictive power. LightGBM achieved the highest performance with KNN imputation (accuracy: 99.06%, F1: 97.57%, and recall: 97.83%), outperforming other classifiers by 2.5%–4.0% in accuracy. These results underscore the necessity of robust imputation techniques for reliable thyroid disease prediction.

Traditional clustering methods, such as K-means, are limited by fixed cluster numbers and sensitivity to outliers, often missing small or irregular fraud patterns. This research introduces an adaptive clustering algorithm (AD-KMeans) that dynamically adjusts the number of clusters based on variance and density thresholds, enabling better identification of hidden fraudulent activity. Using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, the proposed method is evaluated against standard K-means using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F 1-score, silhouette score, Davies–Bouldin index (DBI), and the Calinski–Harabasz index (CHI). Experimental results show that compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed AD-KMeans achieves the highest fraud recall (91.2%) and F 1-score (87.6%), improving recall by 22.3 percentage points over the best hybrid model (hybrid DNN + clustering, 68.9%) and F 1-score by 11.5 points (from 76.1% to 87.6%). Moreover, it identifies distinct fraud-prone clusters and adapts effectively to data structure variations.

Therefore, early prediction and detection are critical, leading to timely and appropriate interventions at early stages. Four ensemble tree-based algorithms were used in this study: adaptive boosting, extreme gradient boosting, random forest, and extremely randomized trees, investigating their ability to predict heart disease. Data related to heart disease clinical features was obtained from the open Kaggle Machine Learning Dataset repository. Adaptive Boosting stands out as the highest performer, achieving an average testing accuracy of 93.70%, precision of 93.71%, recall of 93.70%, and F1 score of 93.69%, along with the highest AUC score of 0.9708, across all competing models considered in the study. These metrics indicate a superior ability to distinguish between patients with and without heart disease, effectively making it particularly valuable for clinical applications where early detection can save lives. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework adopted to investigate the relative importance of the features in predicting heart disease revealed the most influential predictors (ST slope, chest pain type, old peak, and cholesterol), further aiding the understanding of heart disease mechanisms. Future work should explore the integration of ensemble learning algorithms with real-time patient monitoring systems. This integration could allow for continuous health status updates, equipping predictive models with the information necessary to facilitate dynamic, real-time interventions that are more closely aligned with patient needs.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative filtering (CF)-based personalized recommendation systems are among the most widely adopted strategies for addressing information overload in modern markets. However, a significant challenge that hinders the effectiveness of these systems is data sparsity. To address this limitation, advanced methodologies such as matrix factorization and deep learning models have been developed to improve CF system performance in sparse data scenarios. Despite their advancements, most existing models rely solely on either implicit or explicit user–item interactions to generate recommendations. Traditional CF approaches often struggle with sparsity, necessitating the development of hybrid methods that integrate both explicit and implicit feedback to enhance performance. To address this gap, this study introduces DeepBlendRec, an innovative deep learning-based framework that leverages both explicit user ratings and implicit user behaviour. By utilizing this dual-input methodology, the model captures richer information regarding user–item interactions, thereby significantly improving recommendation accuracy. DeepBlendRec employs an enhanced autoencoder with a constrained decoder to process implicit ratings, thereby improving reconstruction quality and facilitating the creation of robust latent space representations. Simultaneously, explicit ratings are processed through a multilayer perceptron. The reconstructed outputs are then fused to generate a Top-N recommendation list. Experimental evaluations conducted on the MovieLens datasets demonstrate that DeepBlendRec consistently outperforms existing models across several key performance metrics, including mean-squared error (MSE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), precision, recall, and F1-score. These results highlight the potential of DeepBlendRec to advance the capabilities of recommendation systems in handling data sparsity and improving predictive accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel approach to engineering design optimization through the development of an improved mountain gazelle optimizer (iMGO) that incorporates variable neighborhood search (VNS) techniques. The enhanced algorithm effectively addresses engineering optimization challenges by identifying optimal design solutions within specified constraints. In particular, iMGO significantly improves solution diversity and mitigates the risk of premature convergence to local optima, thereby overcoming the limitations of the original MGO. A comprehensive analysis was conducted using 12 functions from the CEC 2022 benchmark suite, and the algorithm was applied to five engineering problems, including the design of an I-beam, pressure vessel, three-bar truss, cantilever beam, and tension spring. Comparative results indicate that iMGO outperforms established metaheuristic techniques, such as MFO, WOA, GOA, MPA, TSO, and SCSO, as well as the original MGO. The results validate iMGO’s effectiveness in navigating the complexities of constrained engineering optimization. For instance, in practical applications, the manufacturing cost of the pressure vessel design was reduced from 6014.4537 to 5915.3358, and the weight of the tension spring was decreased from 0.0149154 to 0.0130101 relative to the original MGO. These enhancements underscore the significant potential of iMGO in real-world applications across aerospace engineering, structural design optimization, energy system planning, and other fields, thereby contributing to more efficient and sustainable engineering solutions.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning–based segmentation models have gained significant focus in various computer vision applications, including remote sensing and medical imaging. There exist deep learning architectures for semantic and instance segmentation separately, with limitations prevailing such as imprecise boundary delineation, poor spatial consistency, improper fine-grained object separation, and inaccurate instance segmentation, particularly while handling intricate object structures in remote sensing images (RSI). To mitigate the aforementioned issues, in the present work, we propose a unified deep framework that integrates both semantic and instance segmentation within a single architecture tailored for high-resolution RSI. Our framework combines an improved attention residual U-Net (IARU-Net) for pixel-level semantic segmentation and a dynamic Mask R-CNN for instance-level segmentation. To further refine spatial coherence and boundary delineation, we incorporate the postprocessing technique such as conditional random fields (CRFs) on the output segmentation map of the enhanced U-Net to improve spatial consistency and edge sharpness. This refined semantic mask serves as input to the dynamic Mask R-CNN model for instance segmentation, where the graph-based refinement module (GRM) is employed to improve boundary accuracy by leveraging graph-based smoothing techniques. Our approach ensures improved object delineation, increases the segmentation accuracy, and decreases false positives compared to conventional deep learning architectures. Evaluation outcomes on standard datasets illustrate that the proposed approach attains superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in both semantic and instance segmentation tasks. The results validate the effectiveness of jointly modeling semantic and instance-level information, providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex remote sensing scenes.},

First, in order to enhance the efficiency of cooperative hunting, a novel task allocation method is proposed based on a leader–follower structure, where follower and leader MSVs perform the target encircling task and the target tracking task, respectively. Second, on the basis of task allocation, adaptive control design is employed for the follower MSVs to enhance the control performance of target encircling; optimal feedback control design combined with adaptive feedforward control design is considered using the RL algorithm for the leader MSVs to ensure the optimality of target tracking. Finally, the stability of the multi-MSV hunting control system is guaranteed and all signals are uniformly ultimately bounded based on the Lyapunov theory in the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through simulation results.},

  abstract     = {While analyzing health data is important for improving health outcomes, class imbalance in datasets poses major challenges to machine learning classification models. This work, therefore, considers the class imbalance problem in stroke prediction using models such as K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, logistic regression, random forest, and decision tree. This work balances the stroke dataset, thereby enhancing model performance, through various oversampling strategies: random oversampling (RO), ADASYN, SMOTE, and SMOTE–Tomek. Compared to the results of the imbalanced dataset, all applied oversampling techniques enhanced the correct classification of stroke events by the ML model. Among these, RO–SVM with RBF kernel was the best in terms of sensitivity, specificity, G-mean, F1-score, and accuracy values, offering the highest results with respective values of 89.87%, 94.91%, 92.36%, 89.64%, and 89.87%. After applying oversampling techniques, all the machine learning classifications were good enough to classify stroke status, especially for the minority class. This study has highlighted the importance of class imbalance issues in health datasets. Precise detection of instances of minority classes can be enhanced considerably by employing classification models with the implementation of hybrid strategies to effectively solve class imbalance issues, which, in turn, will help improve healthcare outcomes. Further research in integrating more advanced deep learning techniques into other health datasets with imbalances is encouraged to further validate or refine class imbalance approaches, as effective handling of imbalanced classes can substantially promote predictive model performance in the analysis of healthcare.},

  abstract     = {Behçet's uveitis (BU), characterized by recurrent bilateral panuveitis, is a severe manifestation of Behcet's disease (BD). However, disease-specific metabolic alterations in BU remain largely unknown. Here, untargeted metabolomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are performed in patients with BU and healthy controls (HC). scRNA-seq data of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) mice are also incorporated. The data showed an altered metabolic profile, characterized by upregulated glycolysis in BU. MYC is predicted to be a hub molecule regulating glycolysis and T cell response. Notably, it is discovered that the expression level of MYC is higher in BU compare to HC and may reflect the treatment response of BU disease. Correspondingly, the scRNA-seq data of EAU mice also reveal higher glycolysis levels and MYC expression. Further studies reveal that inhibition of MYC repressed glycolysis and exerted therapeutic effects similar to those of glycolysis inhibitors, including amelioration of EAU and repression of the abnormal response of effector T cells (T helper [Th]-1 and Th17 cells). Mechanically, inhibiting MYC disrupts the glycolysis-PI3K signaling circuit to curb the effector T cell response in uveitis. Collectively, the study indicated that MYC promoted glycolysis to fuel abnormal T-cell responses, thus therapeutically targeting MYC would provide an attractive approach for treating BU.},

Sheep are not only one of the most important livestock species in agriculture but also serve as an ideal preclinical model for studying human disease. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of sheep preimplantation embryos from embryonic day (E) 1 to E14 is performed to investigate the pluripotency changes of epiblast and elucidate the pluripotent regulation signaling. By combination of growth factors or inhibitors of JAK/STAT3, FGF, WNT, and TGF-β pathways in the culture medium, sheep formative and primed pluripotent stem cells (sfPSCs and spPSCs) are established respectively. The newly derived PSCs could maintain over 100 passages and differentiate into three germ layers. In addition, sfPSCs and spPSCs exhibit different molecular features, and sfPSCs have the ability of contribution to ICM and can be used as donor cells for producing cloned embryos efficiently. A cross-species comparison of early embryo development in mouse, pig and sheep illustrates the conservation of the epiblast naïve to primed state transition process and the divergence of the developmental events time points, the specific gene expression patterns and pluripotent regulation signaling. These studies are expected to improve our understanding of mammal early embryo development and present a reference for defining pluripotency.},

However, simultaneous delivery of copper and iron ions and the role of mitochondria-targeted copper in inducing cuproptosis remain underexplored. Here, a dual-functional nano-heterojunction platform, MIL-Cu 1.8 S-TPP/FA, is reproted, integrating iron- and copper-based components for synergistic ferroptosis and cuproptosis induction. Mitochondria-targeted Cu 1.8 S nanodots demonstrated high biocompatibility and efficiently induced cuproptosis by disrupting mitochondrial iron-sulfur proteins. Combined with MIL-88B, the iron-based metal-organic framework, the MIL-Cu 1.8 S heterojunction exhibited enhanced ROS catalytic activity, confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) analysis, with improved H 2 O 2 adsorption and lower energy barriers for peroxidase (POD)-like reactions. The dual-targeting MIL-Cu 1.8 S-TPP/FA nanoplatform effectively delivered copper ions to mitochondria and iron ions to tumor cells, modulating key ferroptosis- and cuproptosis-related markers, such as GPX4, GSH, FDX-1, and HSP70.

Herein, it is successfully synthesized a series of versatile transparent films (PUMW) that combine photothermal self-healing function and mechanical strength through integrating polyurethane (PU) self-healing polymers with plasmonic enhanced MXene and W 18 O 49 hybrids (MXene@W 18 O 49 ). The resulting comprehensive film (PUMW4) maintained a visible-light transmittance of over 79% in 0.2 mm thickness, and could rapidly reach 102 °C within 5 min under light irradiation of 0.45 W cm −2 . Furthermore, it demonstrated a favorable ability for photothermal self-healing, with surface scratches disappearing in 2 min. Besides, the tensile strength of PUMW4 significantly increased from 22.7 to 30.7 MPa, in comparison with PUMW0 (pure PU). The proof of concept for an indoor thermal insulation test demonstrates that the organic glass house model covered with the film exhibited a temperature reduction of 10 °C compared to the naked model, highlighting the potential of as-prepared PUMW films in energy-saving applications for large-scale out-door buildings.},

In this study, administration of ginseng neutral polysaccharide (GPN) is found to alleviate gut leak and low-grade inflammation, concomitantly with improving the physiological function aged mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation and fecal conditioned medium are used to assess the specific involvement of gut bacterial metabolites in the effects of GPNs. Comprehensive multi-omics analyses showed that GPN significantly enriched the abundance of Alistipes senegalensis , an indole-producing commensal bacterium. Increased expression of tight junction-associated proteins, as well as activation of gut stem cells, are found to be mediated by the AhR pathway, indicating the causal mechanism by which GPN reduced increases in gut permeability. The results are verified in Caco-2/THP-1 cells, Caenorhabditis elegans , and enteroids.

  abstract     = {Impairment of neuronal plasticity is involved in a spectrum of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, yet its regulatory mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, it is reported that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor DEC2 serves as a pivotal regulator of both neuronal plasticity and epileptogenesis through its repression of sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 2 (SCN2A). Knockdown of DEC2 in hippocampal neurons elevates intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, exacerbating seizure susceptibility and severity. Conversely, overexpression of DEC2 in hippocampus reduces intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, ultimately decreasing seizure susceptibility. Mechanistically, DEC2 functions as a transcriptional repressor of Scn2a by directly binding class B E-boxes (CACGTG) in its promoter. Additionally, DEC2 forms complexes with myoblast determination protein 1 (MYOD1) and occupies the CAGCTG E-boxes within the Scn2a promoter; however, this interaction does not affect Scn2a transcription in vivo. These findings also reveal that cannabidiol (CBD) can modulate the DEC2-SCN2A axis. Notably, CBD predominantly enhances DEC2's direct transcriptional repression of SCN2A. In summary, this study identifies DEC2 as a critical regulator of neuronal plasticity in epilepsy progression, suggesting a novel therapeutic pathway for epilepsy treatment.},

  abstract     = {Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) share similar cellular features and various antigens profiles with cancer cells. Leveraging these characteristics, iPSCs hold great promise for developing wide-spectrum vaccines against cancers. In practice, iPSCs are typically combined with immune adjuvants to enhance antitumor immune responses; however, traditional adjuvants lack controllability and can induce systemic toxicity, which has limited their broad application. Here, a r ed/far-red light-controlled i PSC-based va ccine (RIVA) based on the chimeric photosensory protein FnBphP and its interaction partner LDB3 is developed; RIVA preserves the intrinsic tumor antigens of iPSCs and enables optogenetic control of an immune adjuvant's (IFN-β) expression under red light illumination. Experiments in multiple mouse tumor models demonstrate that RIVA inhibits tumor growth and improves animal survival in prophylactic and therapeutic settings, including against pulmonary metastatic 4T1 breast cancer. RIVA efficiently stimulates dendritic cell maturation, eliciting innate immune activation effects through NK cells and elicit adaptive immune anti-tumor responses through CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Moreover, RIVA protects animals against tumor re-challenge by inducing strong immunological memory, with minimal systemic toxicity. This study demonstrates RIVA as an effective optogenetic approach for developing safe multi-antigen vaccines for the prevention and treatment of cancer.},

Whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing identify DEE-induced mutational signatures (DBS3, ID1/ID2), associated with polymerase epsilon (POLE) exonuclease domain mutations and mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency. Besides, 52 exonic mutations, 734 copy number variations (CNVs), and 2519 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are discovered which are enriched in the suppressed DNA damage repair pathways and the activated lung cancer related signaling pathways including JAK-STAT, PI3K-Akt, MAPK in the DEE-induced malignant transformed cells. Further assays confirm DEE-induced malignant transformed cells harbor both POLE and MMR defects, leading to high mutation burden and genomic instability. Additionally, POLE deficiency exacerbates DEE-induced DNA damage and genomic instability, promoting the cell malignant transformation.

Emphasis is placed on their role in regulating mitophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis via the Notch signaling pathway. The physicochemical properties of WSGC@FA@PEG/PEI-SPIONs are thoroughly characterized, demonstrating favorable biocompatibility, stable size distribution, and efficient peptide loading. In vitro experiments show that these nanoparticles significantly inhibit GA cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by downregulating mitophagy-associated proteins (LC3, PINK1, and Parkin), primarily through modulation of the Notch pathway. In vivo studies, using a GA nude mouse model, confirm the therapeutic potential of WSGC@FA@PEG/PEI-SPIONs, revealing marked tumor growth inhibition and increased apoptotic activity.

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly aggressive subtype, currently lacks potent targeted therapies. ARID1B, a key SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex subunit, is linked to high-grade malignancies and poor prognosis, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. However, its function and regulation remain unclear. Here, it is found that uncontrolled accumulation of ARID1B and its dysregulated nuclear import promoted oncogenesis and drug resistance. ARID1B negatively regulates ARID1A, impairing SWI/SNF-mediated tumor suppression and enhancing tumor survival. Using protein complex purification and mass spectrometry, the KPNA2–KPNB1–RANBP2 protein cascade is identified as critical for facilitating ARID1B nuclear import. Replacing R1518, H1519, and D1522 residues on ARID1B with T1518, G1519, and G1522 attenuates the ARID1B–KPNA2/KPNB1 interaction, preventing recruitment of ARID1B to the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Pharmacologically inhibiting KPNB1 suppressed ARID1B translocation, limiting its nuclear levels. In TNBC mouse models, ARID1B knockout (KO) significantly reduces tumor growth and enhances PARP inhibitor efficacy. Collectively, these findings uncover an undocumented mechanism for ARID1B nuclear translocation and reveal that blockade of ARID1B nuclear translocation can be a new therapeutic strategy for TNBC.},

Furthermore, it is discovered that corticosterone and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) play an important role in mediating this phenomenon. Additionally, a new direct target gene of GR, Lama5 , is identified and confirmed in vivo and in vitro that the corticosterone-GR-LAMA5 axis is a significant pathway mediating chronic psychological stress-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

Using high-throughput screening, the approved all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is identified that exhibit high selectivity in killing HMA-resistant AML cells compared to parental cells. Mechanistically, HMA-resistant cells are overloaded with DNA hypomethylation-associated endogenous viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) which, however, fails to trigger an anticancer interferon (IFN) immune response due to downregulation of dsRNA sensor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). ATRA compensates for RIG-I expression, thereby re-triggering IFN response and potently inhibiting HMA-resistant AML cell lines, xenograft mice, and patient-derived primary cells. A library of potential RIG-I-inducing compounds is rationally constructed and screened, in which the approved M3 AML treatment drug tamibarotene (TAM) exhibits strikingly 28036-fold selectivity and 779 p m IC 50 in killing HMA-resistant AML cells. ATRA and TAM do not selectively inhibit p53-mutant cancer cells. Together, this study uncovers a common resistance mechanism in HMA-treated AML patients and, in addition, provides highly potent and selective agents that can overcome resistance through re-triggering IFN anticancer immune response.},

Functionally, USP10 inhibits ferroptosis via transcriptionally upregulating the expression of SLC7A11 in HNSCC. Targeting USP10 via gene depletion and antagonist sensitizes HNSCC cells to ferroptosis inducers both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, USP10 directly interacts with the largest RNA Polymerase II Subunit A (POLR2A), removes the K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains of POLR2A through its deubiquitinase activity and prevents ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Then, POLR2A transcriptionally activates SLC7A11 , eventually leading to the suppression of ferroptosis. Overall, the study indicates that a novel USP10-POLR2A-SLC7A11 axis regulates ferroptosis, positioning USP10 as a potential therapeutic target in patients with HNSCC.},

TDP-43 regulates RNA processing, including cryptic exon splicing. Here, we demonstrate that TDP-43 directly controls growth-associated protein (GAP43) expression by binding to its pre-mRNA. Loss or hyperphosphorylation of TDP-43 disrupts this binding, leading to the inclusion of cryptic exon 4a1 , which introduces premature stop codons and reduces GAP43 protein levels. RNA sequencing analysis of ALS and AD brains revealed GAP43 downregulation, while 4a1 is upregulated in AD cases with phosphorylated TDP-43. TDP-43 knockdown impaired axonal regeneration in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons, whereas GAP43 restoration rescued this defect. These findings suggest that the loss of GAP43 contributes to neurodegeneration in ALS and AD.

Acod1 knockout led to a further increase in NETs levels in CLP mice, aggravated the inflammatory response, worsened organ damage, and reduced the survival rate. Further studies indicate that E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5 interacts with PAD4 (one of the core proteins for NETs generation). Acod1/itaconate (ITA) enhanced the enzymatic activity of UBR5 through alkylation modification, promoting the K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of PAD4, thereby inhibiting NETosis. In conclusion, this study combines transcriptomics, metabolomics, genetic engineering, and co-immunoprecipitation techniques to reveal the molecular mechanism of Acod1/ITA in regulating NETs, providing new potential targets and theoretical basis for the treatment of sepsis.},

High-performance Sb 2 Se 3 solar cell is closely tied to the quality of Sb 2 Se 3 active layer, which requires careful design of the interfacial and bulk defects, as well as crystallinity of the thin films. Postprocessing procedures show great potential to address defect issues and improve the conductivity of solar cells. Therefore, developing efficient and reliable post-treatment techniques is crucial for advancing Sb 2 Se 3 solar cell technology. In this review, recent post-treatment methodologies are summarized toward high-quality Sb 2 Se 3 thin films, categorizing the strategies into two main types: thermal annealing (TA)-related techniques and TA-free techniques. Furthermore, the effects of these strategies are discussed on Sb 2 Se 3 crystal characteristics, including defects, optoelectronic properties, and film morphology, all of which are closely related to device performance. Finally, the critical challenges and perspectives are proposed regarding this new solar cell materials, practical guidelines are also provided for fabricating high-quality Sb 2 Se 3 layers for highly efficient Sb 2 Se 3 solar cells.},

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising next-generation energy storage technologies due to their exceptionally high theoretical energy density, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. Nevertheless, their practical deployment is significantly constrained by several challenges, including the intrinsic low conductivity of sulfur, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPS), sluggish redox kinetics, and instability of the Li anode. To overcome these limitations, the integration of catalytic materials has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate sulfur redox reactions, promote LiPS conversion, and enhance cycling stability. Recently, high-entropy catalysts (HEC), comprising five or more metallic elements in near-equimolar ratios, have garnered increasing attention owing to their entropy-stabilized structures, abundant active sites, and tunable electronic properties. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the design principles, synthesis methods, and electrochemical applications of various HEC families, including high-entropy alloys, oxides, sulfides, nitrides, phosphides, MXenes, and Prussian blue analogues, in Li–S battery systems. The synergistic effects arising from multicomponent interactions, structural advantages, and underlying catalytic mechanisms are systematically discussed. Finally, key challenges such as scalable synthesis, in-depth mechanistic elucidation, and rational compositional design are addressed, along with future directions aimed at advancing high-performance HEC-based Li–S battery systems.},

In contrast, the ordered structure design in MEA provides well-defined arrangements of pores, channels, or pathways within catalysts, catalyst layers, porous transport layers, and ion exchange membranes (IEMs). These ordered configurations facilitate efficient pathways for charge and mass transport. Particularly, in comparison with first-order structure, hierarchical structure designs exhibit more obvious advantages in reaction interface, charge, and mass transport. Recently, the diverse hierarchical structure in the MEA designs has demonstrated significant improvements in overall electrolysis efficiency in both proton exchange membrane (PEM) and anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers. This review will examine recent advancements in hierarchical structure designs in the MEAs for water electrolyzers, focusing on innovations in fabrication methods and enhancement mechanisms, as well as their electrolysis performance.

Their intrinsic advantages—such as superior interfacial contact with electrodes, tunable ionic conductivity, and compatibility with scalable manufacturing methods—as well as the key technical challenges they face, including limited thermal stability, narrow electrochemical windows, and interfacial degradation, are examined. This study highlights emerging solutions from recent research, including polymer molecular design, polymer–ceramic composites, and in situ polymerization strategies. In contrast to oxide and sulfide systems, which face significant barriers in cost, manufacturability, and integration, polymer-based electrolytes offer a realistic and economically viable path to large-scale deployment.

  abstract     = {Redox, a native modality in biology involving the flow of electrons, energy, and information, is used for energy-harvesting, biosynthesis, immune-defense, and signaling. Because electrons (in contrast to protons) are not soluble in the medium, electron-flow through the redox modality occurs through redox reactions that are sometimes organized into pathways and networks (e.g., redox interactomes). Redox is also accessible to electrochemistry, which enables electrodes to receive and transmit electrons to exchange energy and information with biology. In this Perspective, efforts to develop electrochemistry as a tool for redox-based bio-information processing: to interconvert redox-based molecular attributes into interpretable electronic signals, are described. Using a series of Case Studies, how the information-content of the measurements can be enriched using: diffusible mediators; tuned electrical input sequences; and cross-modal measurements (e.g., electrical plus spectral), is shown. Also, theory-guided feature engineering approaches to compress the information in the electronic signals into quantitative metrics (i.e., features) that can serve as correlating variables for pattern recognition by data-driven analysis are described. Finally, how redox provides a modality for electrogenetic actuation is illustrated. It is suggested that electrochemistry's capabilities to provide real-time, low-cost, and high-content data in an electronic format allow the feedback-control needed for autonomous learning and deployable sensing/actuation.},

  abstract     = {Organophosphinic acids, R 2 P(O)(OH), and their derivatives are versatile compounds with applications in catalysis, material chemistry, biomolecular bridging, metal extraction, and flame retardancy. Current synthetic methods primarily rely on white phosphorus (P 4 ) as a precursor, which is converted into nucleophilic or electrophilic P-synthons through acid-/base-induced disproportionation (e.g., PH 3 , [H 2 PO 2 ] – ) or chlorination (PCl 3 ). However, P 4 poses significant drawbacks due to its highly pyrophoric nature, environmental hazards, and the energy-intensive production process from phosphate ores. Previously, we introduced a method to bypass P 4 in the synthesis of P V compounds through the redox-neutral activation of phosphates using trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (Tf 2 O) and pyridine, yielding the electrophilic PO 2 + phosphorylation reagent [(pyridine) 2 PO 2 ][OTf] ( 1a [OTf]). While this reagent exhibits high selectivity for alcohols, amides, and (pseudo)halides, it failed to react efficiently with organometallic compounds to form organophosphinates. Here, we present mechanistic studies that rationalize this limitation and report an optimized strategy, which successfully facilitates reactions with Grignard reagents. By replacing the pyridine leaving group in 1a [OTf] with 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), the reagent [(DMAP) 2 PO 2 ][OTf] ( 1b [OTf]) is obtained, which enables the selective synthesis of a broad range of diaryl- and dialkynylphosphinates, thereby expanding the scope of redox-neutral phosphate activation.},

In this study, a range of Trp metabolites are evaluated for their potential to modulate tumor immunogenicity using a co-culture assay with tumor cells and T cells. Indole-3-aldehyde (I3A) is identified as an indole derivative that significantly enhances tumor immunogenicity both in vitro and in vivo. This enhancement is attributed to the upregulation of antigen presentation and immunogenic molecules on tumor cells by I3A, thereby promoting their immunogenicity. Mechanistically, I3A induces the activation and degradation of Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), leading to increased expression of MHC-I molecules on tumor cell surfaces. Meantime, I3A induces rapid degradation of c-MYC in tumor cells and further enhances T cell activation. In mouse melanoma and lymphoma models, I3A demonstrates immune-dependent antitumor effects and enhances the efficacy of adoptive OT-I T cell therapy. Moreover, overexpression of the Trp metabolic enzyme interleukin-4-induced gene-1 (IL4I1) in tumor cells increases the intracellular level of I3A and enhances tumor immunogenicity. In summary, I3A is identified as a tumor immunogenicity inducer, which holds the potential to enhance antitumor immunotherapy efficacy.},

  abstract     = {The confinement of breast cancer cells at the interface of the mammary gland lumen and its surrounding extracellular matrix is thought to be a key physical driver of cellular plasticity. The relationship between confinement-induced solid stress and drug resistance is not well understood due to a scarcity of models that faithfully isolate the contribution of confinement on cancer cell behavior. Herein, drop-on-demand printing is used to uniquely replicate the spatial compartmentalization of the native cancer-host interface: MCF-7 breast cancer cells are dispensed within bioinert cup-shaped alginate-based hydrogels in high-throughput to yield “confined” spheroids. Hydrogel confinement affects the emergence of CD44+-CD133+ cells at the spheroid interface that drives a two-fold increase in doxorubicin/tamoxifen resistance compared to control “unconfined” spheroids. Whilst the peripheral drug-resistant phenotype is observed clinically, the model is unique in facilitating the emergence of this population in an in vitro setting. Pharmacological modulation of mechanotransduction proteins (YAP, myosin), abrogated the emergence of this peripheral phenotype, implicating mechanotransduction pathways as an effective way to target solid stress-induced drug resistance. Together, this supports an “interfacial stress—stemness—drug resistance” relationship that sheds new light on the existing paradigm of spatial emergence of drug resistance in breast cancer.},

In this review, we summarize recent progress in characterizing TME features associated with ICI responsiveness, highlighting key immune cell subsets involved in ICI therapy and emphasizing their phenotypic plasticity and functional adaptability following ICIs. Additionally, we outline the spatial architecture of the TME in terms of its effects on immune cell behavior and interactions, and discuss the critical role of stromal components and the microbiota in modulating the immune landscape and influencing ICI responsiveness.

  abstract     = {Observing the surface structure and charge dynamics of catalysts during catalytic reactions is crucial for elucidating reaction mechanisms. However, nanoscale characterization of the catalyst structure and charge states in the presence of reactive gases presents experimental challenges. Here, the structures and charge states of a gold nanoparticle (NP) are directly visualized on ceria during redox cycles using electron holography, a method related to transmission electron microscopy. The introduction of oxidizing O 2 gas to the microscope led to structural changes on the NP surface and decrease the intrinsic negative charge of the NP. Conversely, under reducing H 2 gas, the surface structure and charge state of the NP remained almost unchanged compared to those in vacuum. Systematic analysis revealed that the injection and removal of O 2 gas caused reversible changes in the charge state of the NP within the range of a few electrons. The effect of O 2 gas on charging of the NP is confirmed by first-principles calculations. These findings demonstrate the potential of electron holography in gas environments for advancing the understanding the reaction mechanisms on heterogeneous catalysts.},

However, a significant challenge in this field lies in the development of highly efficient photocatalysts capable of achieving high-concentration H 2 O 2 production. Here the rational design of two O 2 reduction cores into one polymer framework is showcased for synergistically facilitating H 2 O 2 production via the “self-marketing & cooperation” strategy. Photoactive units of pyrrolo[3,2- b ] pyrrole and porphyrin are successfully settled in covalent organic polymers (COPs) through polycyclizations of the relevant aldehydes, anilines, and butane-2,3-dione. Two orderly separated active sites not only involve each of them in the oxygen reduction reaction but also mutually promote the production of H 2 O 2 , which is demonstrated by electron spin resonance experiments, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, and a series of control experiments. Remarkably, PP-COP- 4 delivers an outstanding H 2 O 2 concentration of 16.2 m M in a continuous-flow system, demonstrating its strong potential for scalable, solar-driven production of commercial-grade H 2 O 2 .},

  abstract     = {Hormonal mechanisms of fatty liver formation require in-depth exploration, and corresponding therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Here, through serological testing of mice with fatty liver, it is found that the rhythms of prolactin secretion are disturbed and that the circulating prolactin level is reduced. Based on these findings, prolactin's biological effects on fatty liver are investigated, and biomimetic photothermal-responsive core–shell microneedles with periodically prolactin releasing are proposed to inhibit lipid accumulation in liver. The microneedles are comprised of poly(lactic- co -glycolic acid) shells and prolactin-loaded cores of photothermal black phosphorus, phase-change gelatin, and carrageenan. Under periodically stimulation of near infrared (NIR), the prolactin in the microneedles can be released in a rhythmic manner for inhibiting the lipid accumulation in liver cells. Based on these features, it is demonstrated in mice with fatty liver that the bioinspired-responsive microneedles can facilitate prolactin mitigating hepatic steatosis through its interaction with the hepatic prolactin receptor (PRLR) and by modulating the expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36). Thus, these photothermal-responsive core–shell microneedles with prolactin pulse release hold significant promise for the treatment of fatty liver disease.},

Ultragentle, high-contrast switching of interfacial adhesion is the key to reliable small-scale object manipulation. Here, a novel approach is presented for surface adhesion control utilizing a liquid-permeable nanoporous surface, which can switch from off-state adhesion (< 0.002 kPa) to on-state attraction (0.8 kPa) without preload. The surface of the gripper is composed of vertically aligned composite nanowires with an average diameter of 79 nm. When a liquid is injected into the nanoporous membrane, capillary adhesion occurs, allowing the object to be picked up. As the liquid evaporates, the object can be released by extremely sparse contact. The off-state adhesion of a millimeter-scale gripper is even lower than the gravitational force of thin polymer films (0.18 mN cm −2 ), enabling the solid-contactless release of lightweight materials. We characterize and model the mechanism across length scales and provide pick-and-place demonstrations including LED chips, micro-architected materials, and thin-film electronics.},

This study pioneers a novel approach to fabricating Mg-Ta incompatible LMCs via crystal orientation regulation, achieving in situ formed serrated mechanically interlocked interfaces with exceptional bonding strength (80.5 MPa) through hot-rolling. It also exhibits exceptional tensile properties with an ultimate tensile strength of 340–395 MPa, a yield strength of 301–363 MPa, and an elongation of 5–10.2%. Systematic multiscale investigations combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a hierarchical interfacial architecture comprising dual heterointerfaces zone (hexagonal close-packed /face center cubic Mg/Cu and face centered cubic /body-centered cubic Cu/Ta), with strain-modulated micro-serrations (width: 1.6–5.5 µm; depth: 6–15 µm) morphology, along with atomic interdiffusion zones (1.1–3.1 µm). A quantifiable inverse correlation is identified between serration dimensions and interfacial strength, with reduced width and depth directly enhancing bond integrity. Furthermore, the heterointerface evolution mechanism is decoupled into three thermomechanical stages: 1) crystallographic orientation optimization via dissimilar atomic contact, 2) strain-driven micro-sawtooth generation through dislocation slip competition, and 3) geometric interlocking completion via interface self-assembly. This work establishes a universal paradigm for designing multifunctional structural materials through strain-engineered heterointerface manipulation, rather than just applying several specific deformations processes.},

The mechanical property of present RMPEA shows less strain-rate dependence and strong resistance to softening at high temperatures. Under high strain-rate loading, the formation of thin type-I twins is observed, which could lead to an increase in strain-hardening rates. However, this hardening mechanism competes with adiabatic heating effects, resulting in the deterrence of strain-hardening behaviors. In contrast, substantial strain-hardening occurs at cryogenic temperatures due to the formation of twins, which act as stronger barriers to dislocation motion and interact with each other. To further understand the different strain-hardening behaviors, density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict relatively low stacking fault energies and high twinning stress for the NbTaTiV RMPEA.},

Often soluble metal salts are precipitated as metal hydroxides or -carbonates, which subsequently are converted to the corresponding oxide(s) upon thermal treatment. The thermal treatment step is used to induce compositional homogeneity on the atomic level. In order to shed some more light on this effect, detailed analyses of a mixed Li-Ni-Mn-oxide with the target composition LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 (LNMO), which is a promising cathode material for rechargeable Li-ion batteries are performed. The first synthesis step is the precipitation of a Ni-Mn-carbonate, which is subsequently thermally lithiated and transformed into an oxide. A combination of X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Raman microscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX) in combination with elemental analysis, as well as electrochemical characterization, revealed that chemical inhomogeneities present already in the precursor particles have a direct influence on the electrochemical performance of the final product. The broader implications of these results in relation to co-precipitation-based syntheses of functional materials are discussed, with special focus on the importance of the particle size distribution of the secondary particles.},

However, the absence of alkali metal cations in the SSE-based CO 2 RR process at the cathode poses a challenge, constraining the performance and stability of CO 2 RR and exacerbating the hydrogen evolution side reaction. Herein, a novel strategy for the tunable production of both electrolyte-free HCOOH and sodium formate (HCOONa) solution through the regulation of anolyte composition in an SSE-based cell is reported. Employing this strategy, the continuous generation of a ≈0.27 m electrolyte-free HCOONa solution and ≈0.22 m electrolyte-free HCOOH solution with extended stabilities of 300 and 200 h, respectively is achieved. More importantly, the introduction of sodium ions resulted in a reduction of cell voltage by ≈1000 mV and further enhances the stability of the cell. In situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that GB-Bi requires a lower applied potential for formate production, owing to its stronger binding energy to the key intermediate OCHO* compared to Bi. Finally, a techno-economic analysis indicates that this strategy for HCOONa solution production possesses excellent economic viability.},

One U-finger resonating at 50 Hz serves as energy harvester (EH), while the other resonating at 185 Hz acts as current or magnetic sensor, enabling the resonator to simultaneously and wirelessly capture 50 Hz stray magnetic field ( H AC ,50 Hz ) energy and ground fault message of power lines by injecting an additional non-grid-frequency (185 Hz) current. The EH U-finger generates an output power of 1.53 mW RMS under a weak H AC ,50 Hz of only 0.5 Oe, achieving a normalized power density surpassing current standards. While the sensing U-finger shows a high sensitivity to H AC ,185 Hz with a detectability of 710 pT, even the EH U-finger is operating.

However, the exact photophysical behaviors at 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure remain ambiguous, which makes it challenging to form the desired 3D/2D heterostructure. Herein, via combining the state-of-the-art ultrafast spectroscopies of femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, transient absorption microscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, charge transfer and recombination dynamics are unveiled at 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure, for comparison, where the 2D layers are fabricated through the two distinct approaches of organic ligand surface reaction (2D L ) and 2D crystal seed direct deposition (2D S ), respectively. 3D/2D S heterostructure exhibits superior hole transfer from 3D to 2D S , featuring a large spatial diffusion constant and high charge mobility compared to 3D/2D L , attributed to the higher phase purity and the lower defects in 2D S . Moreover, 3D/2D S heterostructure yields suppressed nonradiative recombination, reduced Langevin recombination, and increased quasi-Fermi level splitting, significantly aiding fast photoinduced charge transfer at such heterostructure. These advantages are further confirmed by a remarkably improved PSC efficiency using 3D/2D S , especially in terms of enhanced open-circuit voltage and diminished energy loss. This work sheds light on the dynamics at 3D/2D heterostructures, providing a promising guideline for designing 3D/2D high-performance PSCs.},

Herein, by incorporating both the µ -oxo bridged Fe III -porphyrins and NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) mimics into an allosteric coordination capsule, the regulation of O 2 activation and the upregulation of intracellular methionine depletion have been achieved, resulting in effective pH-activated tumor immunotherapy. Upon light irradiation, the transition from the tensed bridged Fe III -porphyrins to the relaxed unbridged Fe IV = O/Fe II porphyrin pair induces unique conformational switching. The relaxed state of the capsule facilitates the binding of substrates for the oxygen atom transfer reaction. The in situ formed Fe II -porphyrin pair, following the substrate oxygenation, activates O 2 with the intervention of NADH mimics to restore the tensed state of the capsule, thereby releasing the product for the next cycle. Regulated by the acid/base content in the system, this allostery-triggered metabolic behavior enhances the efficacy of intracellular methionine depletion therapy through the accumulation of local methionine sulfoxide, thereby improving safety. The allosteric switching strategy offers an improved approach for precise tumor treatment via dual light-and-guest stimuli-responsive regulation.},

  abstract     = {Dual-atom catalysts (DACs) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene have been widely studied for electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO 2 R), primarily yielding CO. However, achieving selectivity for C1 hydrocarbons remains challenging. Here, 32 Janus DACs (J-M'M) are designed and investigated for CO 2 R using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, identifying 13 capable of producing methanol and methane. Notably, J-FeCo and J-CoNi exhibit favorable limiting potentials (−0.38 and −0.45 V vs. RHE) for CH 3 OH and CH 4 production, respectively, based on constant-potential calculations. Compared to normal DACs (N-M'M), Janus DACs demonstrate enhanced initial CO 2 hydrogenation and stronger CO adsorption. Oxygen coordination in J-FeCo and J-CoNi induces a downshift/upshift of majority-/minority-spin energy levels of d z2 , d yz , and d xz orbitals toward the Fermi level relative to N-FeCo and N-CoNi, strengthening the bonding state and weakening the antibonding state, thereby improving CO adsorption. Furthermore, an effective descriptor based on atomic features is identified to evaluate *CO binding strength. This work highlights the critical role of partial oxygen coordination in DACs for C1 hydrocarbons production and proposes a robust descriptor to guide the design of related catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Hydrazine-assisted hybrid alkaline seawater electrolysis offers a dual-functional platform for environmentally benign remediation of toxic hydrazine and energy-autonomous hydrogen generation. Addressing the critical need for simplified system integration, a single-metal bifunctional catalyst is developed by modulating electronic metal-support interactions (EMSI) to construct semi-crystalline Ru domains with metastable crystalline-amorphous interfaces. The optimized catalyst achieves ultralow overpotentials of 21.5 mV (hydrogen evolution) and 254 mV (hydrazine oxidation) at 10 mA cm⁻ 2 , alongside spontaneous hydrazine decomposition at open-circuit potential. This synergy enables near-zero energy input for electrolysis, evidenced by a steep polarization slope (1.235 A cm⁻ 2 V⁻¹), which surpasses conventional hybrid systems. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that amorphous Ru sites near the interface induce charge redistribution, which partially optimizes the free energy changes associated with adsorption * H and the dehydrogenation process from * N₂H₄ to * N₂H₃. This is accompanied by a transformation of the rate-determining step into the * N₂H → * N₂ pathway, thereby advancing the kinetics of the bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction/hydrazine oxidation reaction (HER/HzOR) reactions. The work redefines catalyst design paradigms by leveraging interfacial metastability, bridging pollutant elimination with high-efficiency hydrogen economies.},

In this study, the model dioecious spinach ( Spinacia oleracea ), a widely cultivated leafy vegetable, is investigated by analyzing spatial transcriptomes of the shoot apices at different developmental stages. The findings elucidate key regulatory pathways underlying both inflorescence development and sex differentiation. Through the characterization of dynamic transcriptional changes across four consecutive developmental phases, distinct cell types within the shoot apex and stage-specific marker genes are identified. Notably, pseudotime trajectory analysis reveals that spinach sex differentiation occurs at the four-leaf stage. Furthermore, the critical involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in this process is demonstrated. By integrating functional genetic validation, the epigenetic regulator MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA 1 (MSI1) together with histone deacetylase HDT2 is discovered to promote female differentiation. Collectively, this work provides comprehensive insights into the regulatory networks controlling inflorescence development and sexual differentiation in spinach and establishes a valuable resource for advancing sex differentiation research in dioecious plants.},

  abstract     = {Zr 2 Fe alloy is a promising candidate as a tritium-getter material for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), but its practical application is hindered by undesirable inverse disproportionation behavior and poor anti-disproportionation properties. In this study, theoretical computational screening is utilized to predict the effects of partially substituting Fe with Co, Cu, and Ni on regulating the Zr 2 Fe 1-x M x (M = Co, Cu, Ni; x = 0.1–0.5) hydrogen storage systems. Experimentally, these modifications successfully correct the distorted inverse disproportionation reaction and achieve full reversibility in the Zr 2 Fe 1-x M x- H systems. Notably, Zr 2 Fe 0.8 Cu 0.2 and Zr 2 Fe 0.7 Ni 0.3 alloys retain excellent hydrogen storage properties, while their kinetic energy barriers of hydriding disproportionation reaction increase significantly from 87.88 kJ mol −1 (Zr 2 Fe) to 184.35 kJ mol −1 (Zr 2 Fe 0.8 Cu 0.2 ) and 192.32 kJ mol −1 (Zr 2 Fe 0.7 Ni 0.3 ), respectively. The corresponding deceleration of hydriding disproportionation kinetics behaviors is clearly visualized by TEM observations. Combined density functional theory analyses reveal that the mechanism underlying enhanced anti-disproportionation properties in the optimized Zr 2 Fe 1-x M x- H systems involves the homogenization and stabilization of Zr─H bonds within the hydrogen storage interstices, along with the effective suppression of disproportionation-favorable chemical environments.},

These LNPs exhibit unique advantages of great biocompatibility, biodegradability, extended circulation, and tumor-targeting capabilities, which enable precise drug delivery, controlled release, and circumvention of drug resistance mechanisms.

Particularly, their distinctive structural characteristics offer promising prospects for suppressing ion migration, which is highly advantageous for X-ray detection. Herein, by gradually modifying the cyclohexylmethylamine cation into the 4-aminomethyltetrahydropyran cation, a layered heterostructure single crystal (PbCl 2 ) 2 (4-Aminomethyltetrahydropyran) 2 PbCl 4 is successfully obtained. It comprises two distinct inorganic frameworks, namely a perovskite layer built from PbCl₆ octahedra and an intergrowth layer consisting of PbCl₂ units, wherein the organic components are firmly anchored to the intergrowth layer via Pb─O bonds, thereby enhancing the crystal stability and effectively suppressing ion migration, as evidenced by high ion migration activation energy (1.64 eV) and extremely low dark current drift (2.86 × 10 −18 A cm −1 V −1 s −1 ). X-ray devices based on the ultra-stable heterostructure single crystal demonstrate an extraordinary sensitivity of 8453.3 µC Gy −1 cm −2 (at 40 V), ultra-low detection limit of 5.2 nGy s −1 and superior air stability (≈1 year).

However, their stability in aqueous environments remains a challenge. This study investigates the stability and degradation mechanisms of the 2D Ruddlesden-Popper phase phenylethyl ammonium lead iodide (PEA (+) 2 PbI 4 ) thin films in aqueous electrolytes under dark and illuminated conditions. While PEA (+) 2 PbI 4 thin films appear to be thermodynamically stable in an aqueous electrolyte with phenylethyl ammonium iodide (PEAI), illumination causes significant photodegradation generating a deprotonated and dehalogenated 2D intercalation product: phenylethylamine-lead iodide, 2PEA (0) -PbI 2 . The degradation of the 2D semiconductor leads to substantial reduction in the photovoltage, adversely impacting the material performance in photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices. To intercept photo-excited charge carriers in the 2D semiconductor, the I 3 − /I − redox is added, which reduced photodegradation. The findings underscore that while catalytic reactions at halide perovskite electrodes in aqueous electrolytes are feasible, reversible and irreversible photodegradation remains a critical limitation that must be addressed in the design of PEC devices employing metal halide semiconductor layers for direct electrochemical energy conversion.},

In this work, the first experimental demonstration of topological QI-like effect is reported in a 1D on-chip system, where two different topological mechanisms are induced to provide robustness for slow light. Topological charges rooted in the parameter space can offer immunity to parameter deviations, such as coupling strengths, and topological edge states rooted in the momentum space can manifest robustness against structural disturbances, like width disorders and bending deformations. By incorporating bright and dark edge states into a composite waveguide, the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) window is observed and switching between slow light and fast light is demonstrated by measuring the transmission and group delays.

Herein, by analyzing the bioengineered trachea, it is found that multiple tissue senescences occur, and poor endogenous cellular contact and exogenous immune microenvironment dysregulation are identified as two crucial factors during senescence. Therefore, a Hebe engineered trachea (Hebe-ET) with a ring–ring structure and dual anti-senescence designs is proposed for maintaining regenerative homeostasis after transplantation. First, in the cartilage rings, a fiber-film structural scaffold is designed to promote close-packed cellular contact, significantly reducing senescent P21+ chondrocytes. Furthermore, between the cartilage rings are distributed fibrous connective tissue rings, in which the loaded quercetin induces an immune cascade to restrain senescence in multiple cells, including chondrocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts via mitochondrion-targeted oxidative stress scavenging, promoting the development of the full tracheal components in vivo. Based on these designs, 12 weeks after orthotopic transplantation, the Hebe-ET achieves sustainable youth and develops a natural-like structure with mature cartilage phenotype, reconstructed vascular network, and epithelium coverage. The mechanical property exceeds that of the natural trachea, and 87.5% of animals survived. This study first reveals the necessity of anti-senescence design in the fabrication of complex organ substitutes and proposes an effective engineering strategy for segmental trachea reconstruction.},

In this study, a sequential drug delivery system is comprised of chitosan hydrogel (G-CS) loaded with Angiotensin (1-7) and mesoporous silica nanospheres (MSN) coating with α-mangostin to achieve synergistic effects of anti-inflammatory and regulation of metabolic disorders of the ECM in NPCs. The system first explosively releases outer G-CSloaded Angiotensin (1-7) by exploiting the different solubility characteristics of the two drugs, which improves the inflammatory environment by inhibiting the integrated stress response and regulating the macrophage phenotype. During the second stage, the inner layer of the MSN controlled-release loaded α-mangostin to regulate ECM metabolism and synthesis, slowing cell aging and apoptosis. Furthermore, α-mangostin promotes mitophagy in NPCs by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and activating the Pink1/Parkin pathway, promoting the clearance of damaged mitochondria.

  abstract     = {Superlattice structures, created by the periodic arrangement of two or more distinct materials, have attracted significant interest. This paper proposes a strategy for designing superlattice structures in soft materials with improved dielectric and mechanical properties. Two types of acid-functionalized block copolymers and a series of zwitterions with varying cationic and anionic structures are synthesized. When the zwitterion anion possesses a localized charge and the cation exhibits weak interactions with the acid groups in the polymers, the zwitterions preferentially localize at the interfacial layers between the ionic and ionophobic domains. As the zwitterion concentration increases and ion–dipole interactions strengthen within the confined subdomains, the interfacial curvature of the superlattice transitions from lamellae to cylindrical morphology and further evolves to Frank-Kasper phases. Notably, these morphological transitions occur despite the symmetrical volume fractions of the ionic phases. These superlattice structures and Frank-Kasper phases exhibit thermal stability up to 150 °C, a high static dielectric constant of 25, and excellent mechanical properties including a modulus of 360 MPa, hardness of 16 MPa, stiffness of 772 N m −1 , and energy dissipation index of 0.675 at 22 °C, making them highly promising candidates for advanced applications in soft electronics and memory devices.},

  abstract     = {Injectable hydrogels have been developed for transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) of hepatic tumor owing to their flexibility in injection and embolization. However, the dual requirement for high mechanical robustness and good injectability poses a fundamental challenge, as improvements in one often compromise the other. Colloidal gels offer tunable mechanical properties and feasible injectability through the bottom-up assembly of building blocks. Here an interfacial reinforcement strategy is developed by enhancing specific surface area and roughness to fabricate nanosheet-mica (NM) magnetic colloidal gels (NMMG). The negatively charged NM, exfoliated from natural ground mica (GM), possessed increased binding sites, while in situ grown Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles enhanced building block roughness, reducing intergranular displacement and thereby maintaining mechanical strength while ensuring injectability. Compared with GM-based magnetic colloidal gels, NMMG can be injected through 2.6 F catheter with ≈20 N force (40% of manual limit), while storage modulus improved from ≈800 to ≈1800 Pa (2.25-fold higher than embolization minimum limit). Transcatheter embolization with NMMG significantly inhibited tumor growth. Furthermore, NMMG-mediated minimally invasive therapies, including TAE combined with magnetothermal therapy, achieved synergistic therapeutic effects in hepatic tumor-bearing rabbits. The rough-interface strengthening strategy facilitates the development of high-performance colloidal gels with mechanical integrity and tailored functions.},

  abstract     = {Topological zeroth-order Landau levels offer a promising avenue for steering acoustic and electromagnetic waves. However, the helical Landau levels in 2D acoustic systems remain an unresolved challenge. Moreover, previous studies on zeroth-order Landau levels have primarily focused on hexagonal lattices, leaving their counterparts in square lattices largely unexplored. In this study, the helical Landau levels rooted in acoustic quantum spin Hall systems are theoretically proposed and experimentally validated. By linearly increasing the local bandgap through the lifting of the double Dirac cone in acoustic crystals with both square and hexagonal lattices—achieved via topology optimization method—a position-dependent effective mass is introduced in the Dirac Hamiltonian, thereby synthesizing in-plane pseudomagnetic fields. This results in the emergence of spin-locked helical Landau levels, which has been experimentally validated. The large-area conveyance of acoustic energy facilitated by these helical Landau levels is demonstrated and the robustness of Landau-level-mediated propagation against defects is confirmed. A new pathway for exploring acoustic helical Landau levels based on spin Hall physics is opened.},

Beating dephasing in these systems by ultrafast energy transfer requires coupling single emitters to a plasmonic nanoresonator with ultrasmall mode volume and optimal spectral overlap. Typically, strong coupling is inferred from normal mode splittings in luminescence spectra, offering rough estimates of coupling strength. However, achieving a full anticrossing and characterizing uncoupled components in advance is challenging. Here, the oxygen-dependent blue-shift of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots, recorded at 33 ms time resolution, is leveraged to deterministically tune their transition energy across a scanning plasmonic slit resonator to yield a complete anticrossing, after characterizing both uncoupled states beforehand. The findings provide clear evidence of strong coupling at room temperature, with a Rabi splitting at zero detuning of , consistent with theoretical modeling.

Under mild, energy-efficient conditions (−200 mA), this approach converts cinnamaldehyde to benzaldehyde with complete conversion (100%) and >99% selectivity, outperforming traditional harsh oxidants. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the tailored coordination environment of the catalyst enhances * OOH formation, enabling targeted oxidative activity. The method operates at ambient conditions, eliminates toxic reagents and high energy-consuming process, and aligns with sustainable chemistry principles.

To address this, the phase separation-assisted pre-enrichment (PSAP) technology is presented that exploits differential polymer-polymer partitioning to achieve 47-fold antigen and 44-fold RNA enrichment simultaneously. Through systematic optimization of interfacial chemistry, including pH modulation, polymer hydrophilicity, mass fraction, and molecular weights, the protocol is refined to enable direct integration with commercial diagnostics. PSAP-boosted rapid antigen ests (RATs) detected SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza viruses at tenfold and fivefold lower limits, respectively. In clinical validation, 53 clinical specimens (containing PCR undetectable samples as controls) are analyzed. The PSAP method significantly enhanced detection accuracy for both viral antigens and RNA, particularly improving positivity rates in low viral load specimens (27 < Ct < 31) compared to conventional approaches while maintaining specificity in high-Ct and negative controls. With its universality and tunability, PSAP demonstrates universal applicability across respiratory pathogens and lays the foundation for next-generation point-of-care diagnostics.},

However, reliable biomarkers for precision medicine treatment remain elusive due to cellular heterogeneity. Conventional Models based on bulk RNA sequencing and ex vivo assays often fail to capture the intricate molecular pathways and gene networks that underlie treatment response and resistance. Here, NetAML, a novel network-based precision medicine platform that systematically develops 87 drug sensitivity prediction models for 87 clinical drugs using ex vivo drug responses from 520 AML patients with RNA-Seq is presented. The approach leverages network-based analysis and machine learning to identify biologically interpretable gene signatures that capture the complex molecular interactions driving differential drug responses. Notably, the signature genes derived from the models reveal distinct cellular mechanisms. For instance, the co-expression of C19ORF59 and FLT3 is associated with resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. In summary, NetAML offers a powerful strategy for personalized AML treatment by constructing drug-specific models, identifying clinically actionable biomarkers, and supporting the development of optimized, patient-specific therapeutic regimens.},

In this review, it is aimed to examine the various pathomechanisms identified to date and synthesize them into a unified concept. Particular emphasis is placed on key drivers believed to be critical in the onset and progression of the disease—namely mechanical stress, inflammation, and vascular changes. By exploring molecular signaling pathways and conditions involved in tendinopathy, how these mechanisms interact and reinforce one another is illustrated, forming a complex and dynamic signaling network, referred to as the tendinopathic loop. In the future, this network is expected to become even more intricate with the inclusion of emerging concepts such as intratendinous pressure and the potential influence of metabolic factors.},

This holds in particular for magnesium-ion batteries, where the polymer displays reversible insertion of Mg 2+ ions with high cycling stability.

The morphologies of L-Glu:L-Phe proteinoid microspheres and their interactions with algae are studied using scanning electron microscopy, revealing complex structures with budding forms and traits of self-assembly. Electrical measurements demonstrate that both pure algae and algae-proteinoid mixtures generate spontaneous oscillations with unique amplitude and frequency patterns across different recording channels. The algae-proteinoid mixture exhibits a broad range of oscillatory dynamics with amplitudes varying from 25.49 to 191.42 mV and periods ranging from 251.92 to 5471.01 s. These oscillatory behaviors are utilized to perform Boolean logic operations, through post-processing of biological signals rather than autonomous computing, with pure algae systems showing superior performance for direct gates (AND, OR) while the mixture excels at inverse gates (NAND, NOR). Temperature and pH emerge as critical factors controlling oscillatory dynamics. The findings indicate that algae-proteinoid electrochemical systems represent a step toward biohybrid computing and offer a sustainable and biocompatible alternative for unconventional computing, providing enhanced signal stability, environmental resilience, and more effective information processing compared to traditional electronic systems while acknowledging current limitations in autonomous learning capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), a leading cause of chronic low back pain, arises from nucleus pulposus (NP) cell dysfunction due to oxidative stress-induced mitophagy impairment and ferroptosis, though regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. F-box only protein 2 (FBXO2), a Kruppel-like factor 10 (KLF10)-regulated F-box protein, is downregulated in degenerated human NP tissues and correlates with disease severity. Overexpression of FBXO2 restores extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis by promoting matrix component synthesis and inhibiting catabolic enzymes, while its knockdown exacerbates ECM degradation. Under oxidative stress, FBXO2 activates PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, restoring mitochondrial membrane potential and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Proteomics reveals that FBXO2 suppresses ferroptosis by attenuating lipid peroxidation, glutathione depletion, and iron overload. Mechanistically, FBXO2 binds lipocalin-2 (LCN2) via its FBA domain, promoting K27-linked polyubiquitination to drive proteasomal degradation of this ferroptosis inducer. FBXO2 co-expression reverses LCN2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis markers. In vivo, adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated overexpression of FBXO2 ameliorates IVDD in rats, whereas FBXO2 knockout (KO) mice exhibit exacerbated IVDD. LCN2 silencing in FBXO2-deficient mice partially restores disc integrity and matrix component expression. These findings identify FBXO2 as a dual regulator coordinating mitophagy activation and ferroptosis suppression, offering therapeutic potential for IVDD progression.},

This carbon-enriched catalyst demonstrates exceptional electrochemical behavior when transitioned into a battery context. Without any conductive additives, Fe@C900 delivers a reversible capacity of 380 mAh g⁻¹ with 98% retention over 1000 cycles at 1 C. Under a 5000 G magnetic field, spin alignment within the Fe cores triggers directional lithium-ion migration, enhancing rate performance by 150%. Multimodal characterization reveals accelerated lithium kinetics, stable SEI evolution, and deep lithiation behavior. DFT calculations further confirm strong lithium adsorption (−24.14 eV) and low insertion barriers (−22.85 eV), validating the spin-guided diffusion mechanism. This work introduces a new class of hydrogen-derived ferromagnetic anodes, where the byproduct of a clean hydrogen process is re-engineered into a high-rate, conductor-free lithium storage platform. By coupling hydrogen generation with energy storage through shared material intermediates, this strategy offers a scalable path to carbon-efficient, magnetically enhanced battery systems.},

  abstract     = {CRISPR-Cas is an adaptive immune system that protects prokaryotes from the invasion of foreign genetic elements. The components and immunity mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas have been extensively studied, but the regulation of this system in Staphylococci remains unclear. Here, it is shown that the cell-cell communication, known as quorum sensing (QS), inhibits the expression and activity of the type III-A CRISPR-Cas system in S. aureus . The QS regulator, AgrA, directly binds to the promoters of two transcriptional regulators encoding the genes sarA and arcR to inhibit their expression. However, both SarA and ArcR act as positive regulators that promote the transcription of cas genes by directly binding to a novel promoter P cas . Furthermore, the P cas of 300 bp located in cas1 displays as a critical regulatory node to initiate the transcription of cas10 and csm3 . Our data reveal a new regulatory mechanism for QS-mediated repression of the Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system, which may allow S. aureus to acquire foreign genetic elements encoding antibiotic resistance or virulence factors specifically at high cell density.},

Here, structurally constrained cyclic (diacyloxyiodo)arenes are presented as a transformative platform to resolve the reactivity/selectivity-generality paradox, enabling one-pot synthesis of diverse hypervalent iodine(III) reagents. The synthetic utility and sustainability of the in situ controlled-release approach are demonstrated through catalytic reactions, asymmetric variations, and biocompatibility studies, including peptide modifications. Central to this success is the discovery of cyclic (diacyloxyiodo)arenes—a previously unexplored chemical entity.

  abstract     = {Bacterial biohybrid microrobots possess significant potential for targeted cargo delivery and minimally invasive therapy. However, many challenges, such as biocompatibility, stability, and effective cargo loading, remain. Bacterial membrane vesicles, also referred to as minicells, offer a promising alternative for creating sub-micron scale biohybrid swimmers (minicell biohybrids) due to their active metabolism, non-dividing nature, robust structure, and high cargo-carrying capacity. Here, a biohybrid system is reported that utilizes motile minicells, ≈400 nm in diameter, generated by aberrant cell division of engineered Escherichia coli ( E. coli ), for the first time. Achieving over 99% purification from their parental bacterial cells, minicells are functionalized with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to enable external magnetic control. Minicell biohybrids are capable of swimming at an average speed of up to 13.3 µm s −1 and being steered under a uniform magnetic field of 26 mT. Furthermore, they exhibit a significantly high drug loading capacity (2.8 µg mL −1 ) while maintaining their motility and show pH-sensitive release of anticancer drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) under acidic conditions. Additionally, drug-loaded minicell biohybrids notably reduce the viability of SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells in vitro. This study introduces minicell biohybrids and establishes their potential as magnetically guided, drug-loaded biohybrid systems for targeted therapies in future medical applications.},

Here, a soft, stretchable, thermally expandable system is introduced for precise, localized, on-demand deactivation or destruction of electronic systems. The incorporation of thermal expansion particles into a polymer matrix produces soft, resilient composites that generate substantial thermo-mechanical forces at a predefined temperature, enabling the direct collapse of electronic devices. Integration with multichannel microfluidics and wireless systems creates a vanishing, self-destructive optoelectronic system and bio-safe drug delivery vehicle for frequency-based selective release, demonstrating the broad potential of this approach in the fields of defense/security and biomedical devices as well as other envisioned areas.},

However, low hysteresis achieved through purely elastic mechanisms easily exhibits poor crack propagation resistance. By leveraging the significant gap between the strain rate during large-strain service conditions and the crack propagation rate in the fracture process, this study presents a facile strategy for constructing a highly competitive dynamic hydrogen bonding system to produce near-zero-hysteresis and highly crack-resistant D-gels. Through tuning the relaxation dynamics of strong hydrogen bonding interactions with polymer segments by insert deep eutectic solvent (DES) components, the highly dynamic hydrogen bonds are rendered mechanically “invisible” during service condition—an essential factor in achieving a low-hysteresis attribute (low hysteresis: <3%). Meanwhile, the relaxation time of those dynamic bonds is comparable to the inverse of crack propagation rate, effectively alleviating stress concentration at the crack tips, thereby enhancing the ultimate fracture strain (1500%) and crack propagation strain (550%) of the gels. This approach provides a general strategy for synthesizing gels that overcome the traditional trade-off between high crack propagation resistance and high elasticity.},

In the order Cypriniformes, additional lineage-specific WGDs have further contributed to species diversification. While polyploidy is well characterized in species like common carp and goldfish, other polyploid taxa—particularly loaches—remain understudied. Here, high-quality, chromosome-level genome assemblies are presented for two loach species: Sinibotia superciliaris (Golden Chinese Loach) and Parabotia fasciatus (Yichang Sand Loach). By integrating these genomes into a comparative framework with 20 other cypriniform species, key phylogenetic relationships are reconstructed, and introduce a novel subgenome partitioning method (M3). Unlike previous approaches, M3 uses differential sequence divergence to accurately and rapidly assign subgenomes, completing partitioning within minutes and outperforming existing tools. Applying M3, a markedly reduced subgenome is uncovered in the Golden Chinese Loach, with lineage-specific molecular changes in several candidate genes, suggesting potential adaptive significance. This study offers a comprehensive view of polyploidy and subgenome evolution in loaches, highlighting the genomic complexity shaped by repeated WGDs in Cypriniformes and providing valuable resources for future research on vertebrate genome evolution and adaptation.},

Here, a stiffness-tunable polyimide probe, termed Neurotentacle, is proposed for deep brain implantation. Its tunability is enabled by embedded microchannels with controllable liquid pressure. During insertion, the Neurotentacle becomes stiff under elevated internal pressure, allowing penetration of brain tissue without additional materials or tools. Once inserted, it regains flexibility by reducing the internal pressure. The novel ultra-thin microchannel fabrication technique enables the Neurotentacle to maintain dimensions similar to conventional flexible probes. This minimizes tissue damage during insertion while ensuring long-term biocompatibility and stability, confirmed by histological evaluations in both acute and chronic animal models. In long-term recordings, Neurotentacles outperform traditional shuttle-assisted implantation methods. The technique is straightforward, controllable, and does not require complex devices, making it ideal for minimally invasive implantation and long-term neural recordings.},

Key molecular descriptors are identified for each performance label, and the most accurate model is selected through rigorous benchmarking. The optimal region reveals a preference for medium-to-high salt concentrations; low C, O, and N content; and high F content in salts, along with high C and low O content in solvents.

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is a typical degenerative disease characterized primarily by the degeneration of cartilage. However, current treatments for cartilage degeneration often lead to the formation of hypertrophic cartilage and fibrocartilage, making it challenging to achieve full-thickness cartilage. Here, dual-modular hydrogel microparticles (dmHMPs) are developed, which enable precise spatio-temporal modulation and dynamic equilibrium between immune responses and cartilage regeneration. dmHMPs can modulate the inflammatory microenvironment of the joint by promoting the polarization of synovial macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Consequently, as inflammation is mitigated, synovium-derived mesenchymal stem cells recruited by dmHMPs can efficiently undergo chondrogenic differentiation to repair damaged cartilage in situ. In vivo experiments demonstrate that dmHMPs significantly suppress the expression of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and collagen type X, thereby reducing the formation of hypertrophic cartilage and preserving the structural integrity and biological functions of articular cartilage. This therapeutic modulates the dynamic balance between inflammation and repair, providing a promising approach for full-thickness cartilage regeneration.},

  abstract     = {The gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a promising therapeutic target in cancer treatment. However, the specific mechanisms by which gut bacteria and their metabolites exert therapeutic effects in melanoma remain poorly understood. In this study, it is unexpectedly demonstrated that prophylactic supplementation with Limosilactobacillus reuteri exhibits significant tumor-suppressive properties, primarily mediated by its secreted metabolite, reuterin. This metabolite induces trained immunity through macrophage metabolic reprogramming, thereby enhancing antitumor immune responses. Mechanistically, this process involves stabilizing HIF-1α via the AHR-ROS signaling pathway, enhancing glycerophospholipid metabolism, and elevating arachidonic acid levels, thereby amplifying the trained immunity response. Similar to reuterin, arachidonic acid also induces trained immunity and facilitates macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing. To enhance its therapeutic efficacy, reuterin is encapsulated in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). COF-Reuterin demonstrates superior effects in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), remodulating intratumor bacteria and directly facilitating tumor cell killing. Notably, COF-Reuterin demonstrates superior therapeutic efficacy compared to cisplatin. Furthermore, COF-Reuterin reprogrammed TAMs from an M2 to an M1 phenotype, increasing CD8 + T cell infiltration and decreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), reshaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These findings highlight the potential of probiotics and their metabolites in the metabolic reprogramming of TAMs, offering a promising cancer therapeutic approach.},

Key challenges include distinguishing between living and deceased individuals, differentiating human from animal remains, and estimating postmortem intervals. While specially trained dogs remain the gold standard in some contexts, there is growing demand for faster, scalable, and cost-effective alternatives. Here, a bio-inspired electronic nose comprising 32 metal-oxide sensors, integrated with machine learning, is presented as a non-invasive, real-time, and reliable tool for volatile organic compound profiling. The system accurately classifies postmortem versus antemortem human biosamples (98.1%), discriminates human from animal tissue (97.2%), and estimates postmortem intervals with high temporal resolution. This study introduces a robust AI-driven olfactory platform for forensic scent detection, highlighting its potential to complement or replace traditional methods. By coupling volatilome analysis with sensor miniaturization and algorithmic refinement, this approach lays the groundwork for next-generation forensic diagnostics and odor-based biomarker discovery.},

In the case of pure electric field swing adsorption (EFSA) of solid/gas mixtures, however, experimental knowledge concerning carbon materials is lacking so far. A new approach to the electrical field effect on gas adsorption and desorption is presented. Ar, N 2 and CO 2 interact with an all-solid composite material composed of activated porous carbon and silica characterized by a high amount of charged interfaces under isothermal conditions and ambient temperature. The intimate contact of both components in the composite allows for the formation of multiple resistor-conductor interfaces enabling the reversible physisorption of these gases using electric fields in the lower V and mA range. The adsorptive/desorptive swing effect depends on the polarizabilities of the gases in particular their dipoles and to an even larger extent on the field induced quadrupole moments of the probe gases Ar, N 2 and CO 2 .},

Although substantial progress has been made in elucidating general patterns associated with DSBs, the influence of 3D chromatin structure on DSB formation remains underexplored, particularly concerning its spatial configuration. Here, the ChromInSight framework is introduced. Using standardized datasets,Hi-DSB is developed and deployed in ChromInSight, a genome-wide DSB prediction model based on graph contrastive learning (GCL), and applied advanced interpretability techniques to identify DSB-associated genomic patterns. The findings reveal that the spatial cluster-scene between hub nodes and DSB sites is predominantly shaped by the 3D conformation of chromatin, rather than by linear genomic distance. This phenomenon is validated at both the Loop and topologically associating domain (TAD) levels and proposed a “spatial isolation – damage containment” hypothesis, which illustrates the genome strategy for managing damage. These findings support the role of 3D genome architecture in genomic instability. Consequently, the framework provides a powerful tool for investigating the intricate relationship between chromatin structure and genomic stability.},

However, its practical application is hindered by poor interfacial contact between Li and LLZO, as well as the persistent issue of lithium dendrite formation during cycling. In this study, a novel and efficient strategy is proposed to address these challenges by employing a room-temperature ultrasonic treatment combined with a LiMg alloy anode. The fabricated symmetrical UW-LiMg/LLZO/UW-LiMg cell exhibits a low interfacial resistance and achieves an unprecedented critical current density of 4.45 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, these cells demonstrate excellent cycling stability, maintaining stable lithium plating/stripping for over 1000 h at a high current density of 1 mA cm − 2 with a low overpotential of ≈30 mV. The superior performance is attributed to the enhanced anode ductility achieved through Mg alloying and the formation of an ultra-stable interface layer. The all-solid-state UW-LiMg/LLZO/LiFePO 4 battery, incorporating an ultrasonically treated alloy anode and a fluorinated cathode interface, delivers a specific capacity of 153 mAh g −1 at 0.5 C and retains an impressive capacity retention of 90% after 200 cycles at room temperature.},

Emerging therapies using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs) show promise for IDD treatment. In this study, it is first demonstrated that senescent NP cells promote macrophage polarization toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype in coculture systems. Reciprocally, conditioned medium from M1 macrophages exposed to senescent NP cells accelerates senescence in healthy NP cells. Notably, it is identified that iMSCs-derived exosomes break this pathogenic cycle by reprogramming M1 macrophages toward anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. Mechanistically, these exosomes deliver miR-100-5p to suppress mTORC1 signaling and regulate glycolysis metabolic reprogramming in macrophages. These findings are corroborated in a rat IDD model, where iMSC-exosomes mitigate IDD progression in vivo. This work elucidates a novel iMSC-exosomes mediated mechanism regulating macrophage-NP cell interactions, which provides a promising therapeutic strategy for IDD intervention.},

This nanosystem facilitates magnetic resonance imaging-guided chemodynamic therapy and radiosensitization, efficiently activating the cGAS-STING pathway by disrupting mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Notably, by integrating this nanosystem with an anti-IL-35 blockade, this work successfully mitigates the Breg cell-mediated suppression of NK cells, restores innate immune responses, and enhances antitumor efficacy.

Innovative methods for tailoring the KD, including the use of alternative formulations, ketone esters, and microbiome-focused interventions such as prebiotics and probiotics are examined. Strategies to maximize the diet's benefits while reducing potential side effects are considered.

Functionally, SF3A3 drives tumor progression by promoting cell proliferation, suppressing apoptosis, and enhancing cisplatin resistance in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SF3A3 regulates alternative splicing of fos proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (c-FOS), an oncogene linked to chemoresistance, resulting in a ≈2-fold increase in full-length c-FOS expression and activation of downstream anti-apoptotic pathways. Notably, phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) as a direct inhibitor of SF3A3 through database screening and biophysical validation via surface plasmon resonance and mass spectrometry is identified. PEITC reduces c-FOS expression and induces apoptosis in EC cells. Moreover, encapsulating PEITC in a hydrogel delivery system significantly enhances its therapeutic efficacy by enabling controlled release, reducing dosing frequency, and improving clinical applicability. The therapeutic potential of SF3A3 inhibition is further validated using patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters (PTCs), where PEITC and the c-FOS inhibitor T-5224 exhibit synergistic effects in suppressing EC. Collectively, our findings establish SF3A3 as a novel oncogenic regulator in EC and highlight PEITC, particularly in its hydrogel formulation, as a promising therapeutic strategy for improving clinical outcomes in EC patients.},

  abstract     = {Acute ischemic stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Neuroinflammation following ischemia-reperfusion plays a critical role in the disease's pathogenesis. Neutrophil aggregation and clearance within the brain parenchyma influence neuroinflammatory damage during ischemic stroke. Microglia-mediated phagocytosis plays a pivotal role in mitigating neuroinflammation and promoting brain parenchyma recovery. However, the mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between neutrophils and microglia remain poorly understood. Here, this study demonstrates that neutrophils can trigger microglial functional change to inhibit microglial phagocytosis and promote pyroptosis, which is regulated by neutrophil-derived myeloid-related protein 14. Additionally, interleukin-1 β released by pyroptotic microglia further upregulates myeloid-related protein 14 expression and facilitates neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow, establishing a self-sustaining inflammatory loop. Therefore, neutrophils accumulate in the brain parenchyma and further exacerbate microglial neuroinflammation in the ischemic brain. These findings reveal a previously unknown interaction between neutrophils and microglia after acute ischemic stroke and suggest that targeting myeloid-related protein 14 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke therapy.},

  abstract     = {Despite advances in understanding the STING signaling pathway, mechanisms governing cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)-induced STING trafficking out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remain unclear. This study reveals that STING localization is regulated by the balance between coat protein II (COPII)- and coat protein I (COPI)-mediated trafficking, maintaining ER residency in the inactive state or promoting transport to the cis -Golgi via enhanced COPII-mediated export upon activation. Two novel TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-regulated phosphorylated COPII sorting signals on STING—a conserved pSGME motif and a primate-specific pFS motif—are biochemically and structurally identified. These cGAMP-induced signals drive activated STING toward the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the cis -Golgi complex. Using a cell-free COPII vesicle reconstitution system, TBK1 activation is shown to occur on COPII vesicles, while IRF3 phosphorylation is confined to the ERGIC or the cis -Golgi complex post-uncoating, due to the competitive binding of COPII Sec24 and IRF3 to phosphorylated STING. A class of compounds is also identified that attenuates IRF3 phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphorylated STING packaging into COPII vesicles. These findings elucidate STING trafficking mechanisms and offer therapeutic potential for diseases linked to dysregulated STING activation.},

To tackle challenges in precise biomarker detection in complex blood samples, we propose a metal-organic framework (MOF)-enhanced anti-fouling immunoprobe (MAIP). This sensing platform integrates several key features, including an anti-fouling surface, fully oriented antibody immobilization, and an enhanced electron transfer layer. This platform demonstrates remarkable sensitivity and specificity, capable of detecting trace concentrations of cancer markers, ranging from pg/mL to ng/mL. Comprehensive analysis of clinical serum samples, combined with machine learning (ML) evaluations, underscores the platform's reliability and effectiveness in cancer biomarker detection. Using a combination of three biomarkers, the algorithm demonstrated satisfactory classification performance with an accuracy of 100% on the test set across 64 serum samples. Moreover, when evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, the optimized model maintained a robust accuracy of 0.955 ± 0.09, reinforcing its strong stability and good generalization ability across different data partitions. The MAIP-based platform developed here offers swift analysis, high accuracy, and a simplified testing process. This makes it a promising approach for directly profiling cancer markers from blood, thereby facilitating timely and effective patient care.},

A smart method is proposed for accurate battery health estimation using super-short charging segments. This method combines a degradation mechanism-guided Scale-Invariant Feature Transform for smart health feature identification with machine learning for health evaluation. Validation with 87 batteries with various chemistries, formats, and capacities from 6 manufacturers demonstrates its efficacy. Regardless of battery specifications, health features can be identified automatically from the charging data. The method promises high accuracy (estimation error as low as 1.97%) even with super-short charging covering 10% state of charge span, where all the existing health feature extraction approaches fail.

Factors such as insufficient vascularization, poor retention of therapeutic agents, and the lack of effective mechanical stimulation further hinder the success of current minimally invasive treatments, which often rely on the delivery of drugs or stem cells. Here, magnetic gelatin/hyaluronic acid composite hydrogels micromotors are developed, capable of promoting bone regeneration through localized micromovement stimulation, eliminating the need for therapeutic payloads. By harnessing the mechanical forces generated by the micromotors under an oscillating magnetic field, the approach directly enhances osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, providing a novel mechanism for bone repair. The efficacy of this strategy is further validated in vivo using animal models of bone defects, where moderate micromovement stimulation is shown to significantly increase the volume fraction of newly formed bone by approximately twofold, accompanied by well-aligned collagen and organized mineralization, thereby demonstrating substantial regenerative effects. This work presents a paradigm shift in bone repair with a payload-free, minimally invasive solution that overcomes conventional limitations and offers new insights into microrobotics in regenerative medicine.},

Here, a label-free, ultrasensitive, and rapid assay protocol is described for quantitative protein detections in serum samples, which integrates an ultrasmooth gold nanogroove arrays (UGNA) biosensor with an initial rate analysis (IRA) method. i) Compared with the existing plasmonic biosensors, miscellaneous-protein-mixed scheme substantially accelerates the binding kinetics of analytes by passivation of all channel inner surfaces. Combined with the IRA method, a wide linear range of AFP detection (1–10 4 ng mL −1 ) is obtained, and an enhancement factor of ≈160-fold in detection time (≈70 s) is achieved for an analyte with ultralow concentration. ii) UGNA can achieve an extremely high surface figure of merit (FOM surf ) under normal incidence, which is immensely useful for miniaturization and multiplexing. iii) UGNA are fabricated using a high-reproducibility template-stripping technique, which potentially enables low-cost mass production.

However, the mechanism by which they induce hepatic damage without passive diffusion into the hepatic circulatory system remains unclear. This study demonstrate that indirubin, the main component of indigo naturalis with poor aqueous solubility, predisposes mice with chronic colitis to hepatic injury. This closely mimics the hepatic damage commonly observed in ulcerative colitis patients treated with indigo naturalis. Upon administration, indirubin is detected in the plasma, Peyer's patches, and hepatic tissue, with its distribution linked to macrophage infiltration into the liver. Ablation of macrophages significantly reduces indirubin accumulation and attenuates elevated hepatic transaminases in mice with chronic colitis. Mechanistically, macrophages internalize and transport indirubin aggregates from Peyer's patches through the circulatory system to the livers. This internalization activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the formation of macrophage extracellular traps (METs), which contribute to oxidative stress-induced liver injury. The study identifies indirubin as a potentially toxic component of indigo naturalis that provokes METs-mediated oxidative damage. Additionally, the findings reveal a novel transport pathway for poorly soluble molecules to reach the liver via uptake by macrophages within Peyer's patches.},

Overexpression of TaPPR13 enhanced the antioxidative defense system, whereas knockdown of TaPPR13 led to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caused abnormalities in chloroplast thylakoids under drought stress conditions. RNA-seq analysis showed that overexpression of TaPPR13 significantly upregulated the expression of nuclear-encoded genes involved in ROS scavenging and the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway. Furthermore, TaPPR13 interacted with TaAOR1 and TaSIG5 to facilitate detoxification and regulate chloroplast gene expression, thereby enhancing drought tolerance. Overexpression of TaPPR13 and TaAOR1 mediated stomatal closure to reduce water loss, improving photosynthetic capacity and conferring a yield advantage under drought stress. These findings show that TaPPR13 promotes retrograde signaling to alter nuclear gene expression, with the TaBZR2-TaPPR13-TaAOR1/TaSIG5 module representing a novel signaling pathway that likely plays a pivotal role in drought stress response.},

  abstract     = {The color patterns of mammalian fur are determined by melanocytes' ability to respond to and adapt to microenvironmental cues. However, these patterns can be lost following injury or under pathological conditions, and the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, reconstituted hair-bearing skin is generated using skin organoids derived from dissociated epidermal cells, dermal cells, and melanocyte progenitors. The reconstituted skin exhibited pigmented hair patterns. By investigating the molecular cues involved in re-establishing pigment patterns, it is demonstrated that this process is regulated through a two-step mechanism. First, during skin organoid culture, signaling from dermal fibroblasts to melanocytes via the COL6A3-CD44 pathway promotes the early maintenance of organotypic melanocytes. Subsequently, during hair follicle morphogenesis after skin organoid transplantation, signaling from the bulge to melanocytes via the SEMA3C-NRP1 pathway regulates microtubule stability. This regulation guides melanocytes to migrate to their bulge stem cell niche, thereby enhancing hair pigmentation by promoting the adaptive patterning of melanocytes within the hair follicle. The study reveals two novel signaling mechanisms that shape melanocyte adaptive patterning and highlight the hair follicle as a regulatory hub for melanocyte physiological behaviors. These findings may inspire new clinical strategies for preventing hair greying.},

  abstract     = {High-salt (HS) diet is an established risk factor for cognitive impairment, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study reveals that HS diet reduces SHANK1, a key postsynaptic scaffolding protein, via downregulation of the PKA/CREB pathway, leading to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in rats. RNA sequencing of HS-fed rat hippocampi showed downregulation of cAMP signaling and SHANK1 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of PKA/CREB reduced SHANK1 levels and impaired dendritic structure and synaptic function, while PKA activation restored CREB activity and SHANK1 expression, reversing HS-induced deficits. Notably, CREB activation is essential for SHANK1 regulation, as a CREB mutant (S133A) blocked the effects of PKA activation, and a constitutively active CREB (S133D) prevented SHANK1 downregulation. These findings highlight the PKA/CREB/SHANK1 pathway as a potential therapeutic target for HS-induced cognitive dysfunction.},

  abstract     = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a complex inflammatory bowel disease characterized by multiple factors. Alleviating inflammation is the primary therapeutic approach. However, currently employed anti-inflammatory treatments have limited efficacy and cause side effects. Safer, more effective therapies are needed. Selenium nanosheets (SeNSs) are biocompatible, anti-inflammatory, and low-toxicity nanomaterials with high surface areas and abundant active sites, making them potential therapeutic agents for UC. This study indicates that SeNSs can interact with macrophages and adhere to their cell membranes, significantly increasing their internalization into cells. Proteomic analysis reveals that the main components of the SeNS protein corona are proteins involved in cell proliferation and migration, including those associated with the AKT/PI3K and NF-κB signaling pathways. SeNSs hydrophobically interact with GP130, inhibiting its expression. This interaction downregulates the proteins involved in the aforementioned pathways. In addition, a transcriptomic analysis confirms that SeNSs inhibit apoptosis, cytokine–cytokine receptor interactions, and the chemokine and TNF signaling pathways. In dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC model mice, SeNSs significantly decrease IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, alleviate tissue damage, and lower the disease activity index. These findings suggest that SeNSs can be a safe and effective treatment strategy for UC, offering a novel approach for managing inflammatory diseases.},

  abstract     = {Sunbathing excessively heightens the risk of skin carcinogenesis due to ultraviolet (UV)-mediated immunosuppression. Keratinocytes, the primary cells in epidermis, play a pivotal role in orchestrating the UV-induced immunosuppressive response by releasing platelet-activating factor (PAF) upon UV exposure. Adopting a paradigm shift that transforms a known health hazard as a potential therapeutic asset, a novel therapeutic strategy is set out to investigate for inflammatory conditions by leveraging immunosuppressive properties of UV-irradiated keratinocytes. To safely exploit this mechanism, extracellular vesicles are isolated from UV-irradiated keratinocytes, designate UV KEV, and assess their potential as immunomodulatory agents in the mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis. Subcutaneous administration of UV KEV efficiently stimulates the secretion of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) by keratinocytes and promotes the migration of mast cells to lymph nodes through the PAF/PAF receptor pathway. The as-prepared UV KEV effectively reshapes the immune landscape within the spleen by inhibiting dendritic cell maturation and increasing the population of regulatory T cells. Animal studies confirm that UV KEV can result in robust systemic immune tolerance and significantly alleviate the symptoms of both IBD and psoriasis. This study presents the possibility of UV KEV as natural immunoregulatory therapeutics for the managing inflammatory disorders with promising clinical potential.},

Here, m 6 A modification and its methyltransferase METTL3 are revealed to be upregulated in psoriatic macrophages, while the demethylase ALKBH5 is downregulated. Conditional knockout of Mettl3 in macrophages alleviated psoriasis-like symptoms in mice, whereas knockout of Alkbh5 exacerbated them. Both in vivo and in vitro, Mettl3 deficiency inhibited IMQ-induced M1 macrophage polarization, while Alkbh5 deficiency promoted M1 polarization. The regulation of macrophage polarization by m 6 A is likely mediated by targeting Slc15a3 . SLC15A3 enhances the recruitment of TASL, a recently identified endolysosomal IRF5 adaptor, which functions similarly to the IRF3 adaptors STING and MAVS at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, respectively, to augment IRF5 signaling via SLC15A4.

However, PROTACs are fraught with pharmacokinetic dangers due to poor water solubility and membrane permeability, further posing a huge challenge to the clinical potential. Herein, a nanodelivery system is developed that is elaborately decorated with prodrugs to improve the physicochemical properties and therapeutic efficacy of PROTAC. The nanodelivery, lipid nanodisk (LND), is readily assembled from three commercially available phospholipids, and shows high stability and long circulation time in vivo. The lipid-derived prodrug realizes prolonged retention and precise release of PROTACs at tumor sites under the endogenous stimulus. Collectively, the LND loaded with MZ1 prodrug (LND-MZ1) presents enhanced biocompatibility, improves intracellular accumulation, and superior tumor penetration capacity, enabling more potent and targeted PROTAC therapy with enhanced specificity in vivo. LND-MZ1 shows a more significant anti-tumor effect in the xenograft tumor model, even at a one-tenth dose of the parent PROTACs under the same therapeutic schedule. Overall, the LND-based nanomedicine paves the way for remodeling the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of various drugs to expand the therapeutic scope.},

Here, leveraging the epigenetic landscape of mouse gastrula, p-Enh is identified, an enhancer located within the first intron of Cdx2 and epigenetically pre-marked in the primitive streak region, as a pivotal regulator for posterior tissue development in mouse embryos. Morphological and single-cell transcriptomic analyses confirmed embryonic lethality phenotype with disrupted posterior tissue development trajectories in p-Enh-KO embryos. Molecularly, apart from regulating the neighboring coding-gene Cdx2 in cis , the findings suggest that p-Enh also modulates the global transcriptome and epigenomic landscape, which might through the transient production of eRNA in trans . Further investigation revealed p-Enh-derived eRNAs participate in the regulatory cascades of TGF-β signaling by directly interacting with SMAD4 protein. Combinatorial modulation of TGF-β signaling and p-Enh-eRNA abundance can largely rescue the posterior development deficiency in in vitro gastruloids through a Cdx2 -independent mechanism. Thus, a potential model is proposed in which the broadly distributed p-Enh transcripts within the nucleus can serve as essential cross-modular coordinators, priming the posterior development of mouse embryo.},

However, the immunoregulatory consequences of MET activation remain poorly understood. Herein, a significant positive correlation between phosphorylated MET (p-MET) and tumor-intrinsic PD-1 is verified, both of which are independently associated with adverse prognosis. Elevated p-MET levels correlated with diminished CD8 + T cell cytotoxicity and increased regulatory T cell (Treg) infiltration. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed MET activation selectively drives the accumulation of intratumoral GITR⁺ Tregs—a distinct effector Treg subset with potent immunosuppressive function and high prognostic relevance. Compared to KLF2⁺ naïve Tregs, GITR⁺ Tregs exhibited an activated phenotype and enhanced expression of immunoregulatory markers. Subgroup analysis further demonstrated that elevated GITR⁺ Treg infiltration diminished the prognostic utility of serum CA19-9, underscoring the immunosuppressive dominance of this Treg subset. Mechanistically, MET–IL-23–STAT4 axis orchestrates GITR⁺ Treg-mediated immune evasion in PDAC. In vivo, MET inhibition and GITR agonism synergize to enhance antitumor immunity in an orthotopic PDAC model. Collectively, these findings highlight MET signaling and GITR⁺ Tregs as actionable targets to counteract immune evasion and improve the efficacy of immunotherapeutic strategies in PDAC.},

Interestingly, it is also determined that NSP7 expression impairs the host antiviral response by inhibiting the ISGylation of melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), a key sensor for viral RNA. Through an unbiased esiRNA screen, it is identified that NSP7 ubiquitination is coregulated by β-TrCP1 and the kinase TAF1. Additionally, this study uncovers a small molecule FBXO5 stabilizer that disrupts the β-TrCP1–FBXO5 interaction, thereby markedly enhancing NSP7 degradation and effectively mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Behavioral changes in patients are mirrored in Foxp1 ± mice. It is shown that decreased Foxp1 in the Foxp1 ± striatum results in a significant decrease in phosphodiesterase 10a (Pde10a). Predominantly expressed in medium spiny neurons (MSNs), Pde10a modulates basal ganglia circuitry. Furthermore, the Foxp1 ± striatum exhibits microglial activation, reduced synaptic pruning, and dysregulation of 111 inflammatory genes. These include the downregulated P2ry12 and Fcrls , markers of homeostatic microglia, and upregulated Cd74 , a marker of reactive microglia, suggesting that neuroinflammation contributes to the observed deficits. Interestingly, treatment of Foxp1 ± mice with the PDE10A antagonist MP-10 (PF-2545920) immediately after birth not only corrects behavioral abnormalities, including decreased ultrasonic vocalization, hyperactivity, and anxiety but also normalizes changes in microglia morphology and synaptic pruning. Transcriptomic analysis with a neuroinflammation-specific gene panel reveals nominal gene expression changes after MP-10 treatment, including Bdnf upregulation and enrichment of neurotrophin signaling. Since FOXP1 and its signaling pathway are highly conserved, administration of MP-10 or other Pde10a antagonists may also alleviate the neurological dysfunction seen in humans with FOXP1 syndrome.},

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have functions of repairing skin wounds, while antimicrobial peptides/proteins (AMPs) can prevent the infections of skin. Therefore, if FGFs can act like AMPs, they will have better application potential in promoting skin wound healing. Here, it is found that grass carp fibroblast growth factor 8a (gcFGF8a) has broad-spectrum and potent antibacterial activity through disrupting the cell membrane, indicating that FGF8 is an uncovered AMP. Further study revealed that gcFGF8a can accelerate skin wound healing through dual functions: inhibiting bacterial and activating of glycolysis. Mechanistically, gcFGF8a/FGFR4 signaling induces epithelial cell glycolytic programs for barrier remodeling through the mTORC1/HIF1α pathway. Interestingly, it is found that mouse FGF8b (mFGF8b), the homolog of gcFGF8a, also has antibacterial and skin wound repair activities, indicating that FGF8 is a functionally conserved molecule in vertebrates. To the knowledge, FGF8 is the only member of the FGF family with both antibacterial and wound repair functions at present, greatly enriching the understanding of this pivotal molecule. Furthermore, these findings highlighted the potential application of FGF8 as a skin wound repair drug.},

  abstract     = {Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) is one of the most complex temporomandibular disorders. Cartilage matrix degradation results in the infiltration of nerves, blood vessels, and inflammatory cells, which disrupts chondrocyte function. Therapeutic strategies for TMJOA designed to maintain cartilage homeostasis remain largely unknown. Here, it is reported that orosomucoid 1 (ORM1) attenuated TMJOA progression by maintaining cartilage homeostasis. It is demonstrated that ORM1 is down-regulated in the synovial fluid of patients with TMJOA and condylar cartilage of unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) rats. Administration of ORM1 protein significantly inhibited cartilage matrix degradation and alleviated TMJOA progression in UAC rats. At the mechanistic level, ORM1 binds to vimentin (VIM), a type III intermediate filament cytoskeletal protein, and inhibits the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, thereby significantly decreasing cartilage matrix degradation mediated through inhibiting the cartilage degradation markers matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) and MMP3, and maintaining cartilage homeostasis. Notably, inhibition of VIM in vivo also markedly improved TMJOA progression, including cartilage degradation and subchondral bone destruction. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate the important functions of ORM1 in maintaining cartilage homeostasis via suppressing VIM/MAPK/MMP signaling and suggest that ORM1 is a promising target for therapeutic intervention in TMJOA.},

  abstract     = {Ferroptosis is a specific type of lipid peroxide-mediated cell death which is crucial in tumor suppression. While the mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2) is implicated in lipid homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism, its role in ferroptosis and colorectal cancer (CRC) remains uncharacterized. Here, MTCH2 is identified as a crucial regulator of ferroptosis in CRC progression. Clinically, high expression of MTCH2 in CRC tissues predicts poor prognosis. Functionally, loss of MTCH2 inhibits azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colorectal tumorigenesis in MTCH2 cKO mice and leads to accumulation of ferrous ion and enhances ferroptosis of CRC in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MTCH2 deficiency promotes the proteasome-dependent ubiquitination of E2F4 and attenuates transcriptional inhibition of transferrin receptor (TFRC) by E2F4, ultimately facilitating TFRC-mediated ferroptosis in CRC cells. Moreover, MTCH2 depletion combined with sorafenib treatment synergistically triggers ferroptosis, suppresses liver metastasis, and effectively eradicates tumors in liver metastasis foci. Taken together, This study reveals the mechanism of MTCH2 deficiency-induced ferroptosis to inhibit the progression of CRC and supports a potential therapeutic strategy targeting the MTCH2/E2F4/TFRC signaling axis in CRC patients with liver metastasis.},

In this extended version, we introduce a new snap-to-solve module for handling low-reasoning tasks using edge-deployed LLMs, enabling faster and partially offline interaction. We also include expanded benchmarking experiments, including human expert evaluations and ablation studies, to assess model performance and learning outcomes. Deployed on the Squirrel AI platform, VATE demonstrates high accuracy (78.3%) in error analysis and improves student learning efficiency, with strong user satisfaction.

People also need to search manually and check whether these programs are suitable for them. To address this issue, our study developed a new generative recommender system with both users' information and government subsidy documents. Within our recommender system framework, we modify the existing Residual Quantization Variational Auto-Encoder (RQ-VAE) model to capture deep and abstract information from subsidy documents. Using semantic IDs generated for approximately 185,610 user click-stream histories and 240,000 documents, we train our recommender system to predict the semantic IDs of the next subsidy policy documents in which a user might be interested. In 2024, we successfully deployed our generative recommender system in Wello, a Korean Gov-Tech startup. In collaboration with the Korean government, our generative recommender system helped enhance program effectiveness by saving $7.8 million in unused funds and achieved $27.4 million in advertising efficiency gains. Also, Wello observed a 68% improvement in Click-Through-Ratio (CTR), increasing from 41.4% in the third quarter of 2024 to 69.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024. We thus anticipate that our generative recommender system will have a significant impact on both individuals and the government.},

This paper presents a comprehensive framework for monitoring, benchmarking, and continuously improving such complex, multi-component systems under active development by multiple teams. Our approach encompasses three key elements: (1) a hierarchical “severity” framework for incident detection that identifies and categorizes errors while attributing component-specific error rates, facilitating targeted improvements; (2) a scalable and principled methodology for benchmark construction, evaluation, and deployment, designed to accommodate multiple development teams, mitigate overfitting risks, and assess the downstream impact of system modifications; and (3) a continual improvement strategy leveraging multidimensional evaluation, enabling the identification and implementation of diverse enhancement opportunities. By adopting this holistic framework, organizations can systematically enhance the reliability and performance of their AI Assistants, ensuring their efficacy in critical enterprise environments.

While we humans naturally perceive the world by looking, listening, touching, smelling, and tasting, traditional forms of machine intelligence mostly focus on a single sensory modality, particularly vision. Therefore, my research, which I refer to as multisensory machine intelligence, seeks to bridge this gap by empowering machines to emulate and enhance human capabilities in seeing, hearing, and feeling, ultimately enabling them to comprehensively perceive, understand, and interact with multisensory world.},

My research seeks to directly address this challenge by enabling AI systems to interact with humans to learn aligned and robust behaviors. The way robots and other AI systems behave is often the result of optimizing a reward function. However, manually designing good reward functions is highly challenging and error-prone, even for domain experts. Although reward functions are often difficult to manually specify, human feedback in the form of demonstrations or preferences is often much easier to obtain but can be difficult to interpret due to ambiguity and noise. Thus, it is critical that AI systems take into account epistemic uncertainty over the human's true intent. As part of the AAAI New Faculty Highlight Program, I will give an overview of my research progress along the following fundamental research areas: (1) efficiently quantifying uncertainty over human intent, (2) directly optimizing behavior to be robust to uncertainty over human intent, and (3) actively querying for additional human input to reduce uncertainty over human intent.},

The selection of any one of multiple underway watercraft for patient exchange is complicated by participating aircraft utilization histories and participating watercraft positions and velocities. The selection problem is modeled as a semi-Markov decision process with an action space, including both fixed land and moving watercraft exchange points. Monte Carlo tree search with root parallelization is used to select optimal exchange points and determine aircraft dispatch times. Model parameters are varied in simulation to identify representative scenarios where watercraft exchange points reduce incident response times. We find that an optimal policy with watercraft exchange points outperforms an optimal policy without watercraft exchange points and a greedy policy by 35% and 40%, respectively. In partnership with the United States Army, we deploy for the first time the watercraft exchange point by executing a mock patient transfer with a manikin between two HH-60M medical evacuation helicopters and an underway Army Logistic Support Vessel south of the Hawaiian island of Oahu.

Far from a gradual evolution, its sudden emergence has jolted educational institutions, leaving many academics grappling with a perceived encroachment upon their intellectual domain. This upheaval has sparked intense debates, with concerns ranging from the erosion of academic integrity to the devaluation of scholarly labor. This essay contends that such apprehensions, while understandable, may overlook the transformative potential of AI as a collaborative tool. Drawing parallels to historical disruptions—such as the advent of photography challenging traditional art forms—we explore how AI can augment human creativity rather than supplant it. By examining the dynamics of authorship, originality, and accountability, we argue for a redefinition of these concepts in the context of AI-assisted work. Emphasizing the importance of human oversight in guiding AI outputs, we advocate for a framework that recognizes the symbiotic relationship between human intellect and machine efficiency. Such a perspective not only preserves the essence of academic rigor but also embraces the democratization of knowledge production. Ultimately, this essay calls for a balanced approach that mitigates risks while harnessing the innovative capacities of generative AI in academia.},

Building upon this, this article transcends the traditional binary judgment model and constructs a tiered copyright determination model. Based on the level of human control and contribution in the AI generation process, it introduces dimensions such as technological controllability and density of human intent, classifying generative AI into three tiers: strong protection, weak protection, and non-protection. Regarding the copyrightability of content generated by generative AI, this article argues that the issue should be addressed within the framework of copyright law itself. When human participation is involved and the substantial contribution of the direct user is reflected in the AI-generated content, meeting the requirements for copyrightable works under copyright law, corresponding protective measures should be granted.},

Herein, the dual actuator wave-like navigator (DAWN), a multisurface robot employing two actuated helical wave generators to produce continuous traveling waves on flexible link tracks enclosed in elastomer skins, is presented. These skins provide mechanical resilience, enhanced friction, and adaptability on uneven terrain. The robot demonstrates steering and controlled locomotion on flat surfaces, inclines, and declines. To characterize the robot, locomotion tests are performed on plywood, PMMA, and sand, achieving average linear speeds of 16.00, 15.76, and 1.63 mm s −1 , respectively. A key innovation is cyclic pneumatic actuation of the skins with actuation frequencies of 0.5 and 0.9 Hz, improving locomotion performance on sand to 2.22 and 2.70 mm s −1 . DAWN's capability to move on sand, grass, gravel, and wet soil is also demonstrated. Its modular design enables plug-and-play assembly of components including helical wave generators, flexible link tracks, and elastomer skins, allowing for easy maintenance, modification, and replacements. Potential applications include navigation in complex terrains for search and rescue, inspection, and environmental monitoring.},

This paper presents a novel wearable pneumatic soft physiotherapy device, designed to achieve high-safety and personalized physiotherapy for shoulder and neck acupoint massage. The device integrates four soft massage actuators, four embedded thin-film stress sensors, two miniature airflow sources, and a power supply system, enhancing its portability. Additionally, a hybrid control strategy combining feedforward inverse compensation and PID feedback is proposed to regulate and customize the therapy intensity on human acupoints. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed device can apply therapeutic intensities ranging from 0 to 3.45 N to human acupoints, effectively adapting to the human shoulder and neck region to achieve good wearing comfort, and performing safe acupoint massage with customized physiotherapy intensities. This study explores and realizes the integration of emerging soft robotics technology with TCM, providing a paradigm for the development of more soft physiotherapy devices.},

However, their use in legged and grasping applications remains challenging. A key challenge is striking the right balance between high compliance, which can undermine stability and control, and high stiffness, which can restrict essential movement and demand more powerful actuators. This study presents a tensegrity-inspired spine-like joint that integrates thin McKibben pneumatic artificial muscles and rubber cords directly into its tensile network. The artificial muscles enable active joint bending while also serving as tensile elements. The rubber cords counteract these forces, storing elastic energy to facilitate smooth recovery to the original position. The joint's topology design is primarily influenced by the artificial muscles’ limited 20% contraction. To optimize the balance between range of motion, payload capacity, and structural stability, the joint's geometry is refined through an evolutionary algorithmic form-finding process. Two generated joints are integrated into two functional robotic applications: a crawling robot and a gripper, showcasing their adaptability for diverse robotic applications.},

  abstract     = {Soft robots have garnered significant attention due to their promising applications across various domains. A hallmark of these systems is their bilayer structure, where strain mismatch caused by differential expansion between layers induces complex deformations. Despite progress in theoretical modeling and numerical simulation, accurately capturing their dynamic behavior, especially during environmental interactions, remains challenging. This study presents a novel simulation environment based on the discrete elastic rod (DER) model to address the challenge. By leveraging discrete differential geometry, the DER approach offers superior convergence compared to conventional methods like finite element method, particularly in handling contact interactions—an essential aspect of soft robot dynamics in real-world scenarios. The simulation framework incorporates key features of bilayer structures, including stretching, bending, twisting, and interlayer coupling. This enables the exploration of a wide range of dynamic behaviors for bilayer soft robots, such as gripping, crawling, jumping, and swimming. The insights gained from this work provide a robust foundation for the design and control of advanced bilayer soft robotic systems.},

  abstract     = {Biological organisms excel in dynamically reshaping their bodies to navigate and manipulate ever-changing environments, and some can even tune their mechanical properties for enhanced adaptability. Many existing shape-morphing robots rely on the inherent softness of materials or structures, which sacrifices load-bearing capacity. Despite efforts to achieve both morphing and stiffness tuning in one system, these strategies often rely on separate mechanisms, such as heating liquid metal components to reduce rigidity before employing other mechanisms to change the shape, leading to bulky and complex systems that limit practicality and scalability. Here, a tunable-stiffness architected morphing structure (TSAMS) is introduced, which unifies shape morphing and tunable stiffness in a single, compact platform. By combining 3D-printed tessellated particles with shape memory alloy springs, TSAMS transitions smoothly from soft to rigid states, exhibiting a ≈308 times increase in bending stiffness while concurrently executing intricate shape transformations through electrothermal actuation. This design is demonstrated with the following robotic applications, including rolling robots that can explore diverse terrains by climbing slopes, avoiding obstacles, and carrying loads; compact manipulators that lift objects nearly 50 times heavier than themselves; and snake-inspired robots performing undulation and sidewinding gaits. These results highlight TSAMS's potential to advance next-generation soft robots and bioinspired systems that demand both dynamic shape reconfiguration and robust structural performance in diverse operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in locomoting robotics have demonstrated how shape morphing can enhance efficiency, mobility, and speed during transitions between domains, such as from land to water. However, prior approaches often optimize a robot's propulsor shape, stiffness, and gait to minimize the cost of transport in distinct domains while neglecting the energy required to achieve these shape and stiffness changes at domain interfaces. Additionally, many shape-morphing robots rely on thermally driven materials that couple shape and stiffness changes to environmental temperatures, limiting their applicability in real-world multidomain scenarios. This work introduces the Jamming Amphibious Robotic Turtle (JART), which employs pressure-responsive, topologically altered kirigami laminar jamming to transform its limbs between hydrodynamic flippers and load-bearing legs. Energetic analyses reveal that JART achieves a 98.5% reduction in the energetic cost of morphing compared to thermally driven predecessors. Its pressure-responsive morphing mechanism also enables temperature-independent energy expenditures when morphing, rapid stiffness switching, decoupled control of stiffness and shape, and robust postloading shape recovery. System-level evaluations highlight JART's ability to efficiently transition between domains, demonstrated through a continuous terrestrial–aquatic–terrestrial transition at an ocean inlet. This study provides valuable insights into the design of deployable, multidomain robots, advancing their potential for real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Monarch butterflies’ remarkable migratory abilities, facilitated by their efficient wing structures, inspire the development of bioinspired soft robots and microaerial vehicles. This study presents the design, fabrication, and wing-morphing behavior of 3D-printed magnetic butterflies, focusing on optimal material and design parameters to replicate monarch wing-morphing behavior. Using composite of thermoplastic polyurethane and micron-sized Nd 2 Fe 14 B magnetic powder, 12 unique butterfly designs—varying in size, vein patterns, and stiffness—are fabricated via powder bed fusion (PBF) 3D printing, resulting in 84 specimens. Lightweight and batch-producible with minimal postprocessing, the specimens have weights per unit area of ≈270, 480, and 1045 g m −2 for small, medium, and large sizes, respectively. A permanent magnet induces deformation in the specimens—mimicking monarch butterflies, without embedded electronics. A systematic analysis combining finite element simulations and experiments reveals the effects of size, geometric features, and laser energy scale on wing morphing. Lower laser energy scales result in porous, fast-bending specimens, while higher scales specimen show greater mechanical strength and varied deformation, with vein structures further improving deformation. The results provide a detailed dataset for optimizing wing-morphing designs while highlighting the potential of the PBF process in creating lightweight magnetic bioinspired structures capable of optimal shape morphing.},

  abstract     = {Shape-morphing devices, a crucial branch in soft robotics, hold significant application value in areas like human–machine interfaces, biomimetic robotics, and tools for biological systems. To achieve 3D programmable shape morphing (PSM), the deployment of array-based actuators is essential. However, a critical knowledge gap in 3D PSM is controlling the complex systems formed by these soft actuator arrays to mimic the morphology of the target shapes. This study, for the first time, represents the configuration of shape-morphing devices using point cloud data and employing deep learning to map these configurations to control inputs. Shape Morphing Net (SMNet), a method that realizes the regression from point cloud to high-dimensional control input vectors, is proposed. It has been applied to 3D PSM devices with three different actuator mechanisms, demonstrating its universal applicability to inversely reproduce the target shapes. Further, applied to previous 2D PSM devices, SMNet significantly enhances control precision from 82.23% to 97.68%. In the demonstrations of morphology mimicking, 3D PSM devices successfully replicate arbitrary target shapes obtained either through 3D scanning of physical objects or via 3D modeling software. The results show that within the deformable range of 3D PSM devices, accurate reproduction of the desired shapes is achievable.},

In this article, tiling robots are introduced as a novel paradigm of shape-morphing reconfigurable robots, defining them as polyform-inspired machines capable of transforming between at least two polymorphic shapes. In the study, the existing and future designs of tiling robots by varying base shapes and polygon selections are explored, identifying a significant gap for further exploration of polyforms in their design. The various reconfiguration-enabling mechanisms and locomotion mechanisms of tiling robots are comparatively analyzed. Summarized electromechanical developments, along with a proposed generalized kinematic model and control scheme, contribute to a comprehensive understanding of tiling robots. A comparison of tiling robots with other established reconfigurable robots is conducted to position tiling robotics within the broader landscape of reconfigurable robotics. The introduction of a new naming convention addresses the absence of a standardized nomenclature for tiling robots. In this article, highlighting the current focus on area coverage in autonomy algorithms of tiling robots, future developments in diverse application domains like logistics, entertainment, and education are anticipated, emphasizing the adaptability of tiling robots as a critical feature for their proliferation across various domains.},

  abstract     = {Degradable polymers hold promise for their recyclability and their potential to facilitate the transition toward a circular economy of plastics. As such, a consecutive di-SN2 reaction between dithiols and polyhalogenated compounds was used to produce degradable polymers with tunable amounts of redox-enabled dithioacetal and disulfide linkages. The reaction employed bases of varying strengths and different thiol types, allowing for control over molecular weights ranging from <1 kDa to 16 kDa, with tunable degrees of polymerization ranging from 3 to over 75. The ratio of dithioacetals to disulfides was adjusted by manipulating the concentration of the methylene source, enabling the formation of polymers with up to 100% disulfide linkages or up to 93% dithioacetal linkages. This tunability resulted in polymers with multiple redox degradation pathways, capable of being degraded by either reduction or oxidation. Vinyl ether functionalized, telechelic oligomers were used as crosslinkers in network formation, yielding materials with multiple degradation pathways. This di-SN2 approach provides a promising and straightforward method for creating materials with tailored degradation characteristics.},

Herein, we reported a cage engineering strategy in anion-pillared metal-organic frameworks (APMOFs) for efficient C 2 H 2 and CO 2 capture simultaneously. Specifically, two stable ZrF 6 2− anion-pillared cage-type MOFs (ZNU-17 and ZNU-27) are prepared with both ultramicroporous (∼4 Å) and microporous (>7 Å) cages but featuring different shapes. While ZNU-17 allows the efficient binary C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 separation, ZNU-27 enables the benchmark ternary C 2 H 2 /CO 2 /C 2 H 4 separation by increasing the adsorption affinity toward CO 2 . Notably, remarkably increased C 2 H 2 (170.1 cm 3 g −1 versus 120.1 cm 3 g −1 ) and CO 2 (91.8 cm 3 g −1 versus 64.5 cm 3 g −1 ) adsorption capacities are achieved in ZNU-27, and the IAST selectivity of ZNU-27 for CO 2 /C 2 H 4 is 4.3 times as high as that of ZNU-17 (6.5 versus 1.5). The C 2 H 2 , CO 2 and C 2 H 4 binding sites in ZNU-27 are studied by gas loaded in situ single crystal structure and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, which revealed that the unique fluorinated 8.5 Å spherical cages provide strong hydrogen binding or electrostatic interactions for C 2 H 2 and CO 2 . Dynamic breakthrough tests show that from a C 2 H 2 /CO 2 /C 2 H 4 (1/9/90) mixture, polymer-grade C 2 H 4 (≥99.99%) can be obtained in ZNU-27 with a high productivity of 12.04 mol kg −1 .},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a sustainable platform in constructing C─N bonds for amino acid production. Glycine, a particularly valuable target compound, continues to experience escalating global demand, yet achieving simultaneous high efficiency and operational stability remains a persistent challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a CO 2 -mediated strategy for glycine electrosynthesis using oxalic acid and N 2 /nitrate as feedstocks. By using Pb/Pb 7 Bi 3 -CO 2 catalytic system, a very high glycine Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 91.8% with durable stability over 120 h could be achieved. Moreover, when using nonthermal plasma-activated N 2 as the nitrogen source, the glycine production rate could maintain at 94.4 µmol h −1 cm −2 with N-selectivity as high as 93.2%. Mechanistic investigations combining experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that CO 2 undergoes facile protonation on the Pb/Pb 7 Bi 3 heterointerfaces to form * OCOH intermediate, which donates hydrogen for the reduction of oxalic acid and nitrate into glyoxylic acid and NH 2 OH, respectively, while CO 2 is simultaneously regenerated. Notably, hydrogenation via the * OCOH intermediate significantly lowers the energy barriers compared to direct protonation, thereby promoting the subsequent spontaneous C─N bond formation and enabling highly efficient electrosynthesis of glycine.},

  abstract     = {Scheelite-type oxides have been extensively investigated in diverse inorganic systems due to their exceptional structural versatility and promising multifunctional properties, ranging from luminescence to ionic conduction. However, despite decades of research, borates have remained conspicuously absent from this important structural family. This exclusion stems from a fundamental synthetic and structure chemistry challenge: the difficulty in achieving the essential zero-dimensional anionic framework composed of isolated tetrahedral units, a defining characteristic of scheelite-type materials. In this work, we break this long-standing barrier by reporting the first successful isolation of [BO 2 F 2 ] tetrahedra in a crystalline solid. This breakthrough was enabled by employing Sb's stereochemically active lone pair electrons to stabilize these discrete [BO 2 F 2 ] units, ultimately leading to the discovery of SbBO 2 F 2 —the first borate compound adopting a scheelite-type structure. Through a combination of single-crystal X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic techniques, and first-principles calculations, we unequivocally confirm the scheelite-type framework of SbBO 2 F 2 and demonstrate its remarkable multifunctional properties, including anisotropic thermal expansion, ionic conductivity, and large birefringence. This work not only expands the structural chemistry of scheelite-type oxides with borates but also opens new avenues for designing multifunctional materials through targeted anionic group isolation.},

  abstract     = {β-Amino acids are essential building blocks in bioactive molecules, offering unique properties and potential in peptide and drug synthesis. Among them, β 2,2,3 -amino acids—characterized by a contiguous quaternary and tertiary stereocenter—represent a structurally unique subclass with promising biological potential. However, their broader application has been hampered by the scarcity of general and efficient synthetic methods. To address these challenges, we have developed a visible-light-driven radical-radical coupling strategy enabled by chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. In this synergistic dual catalytic system, β-keto esters are activated by CPA and undergo single-electron oxidation to generate tertiary carbon radicals, while redox-active NHPI esters derived from α-amino acids are reduced via SET to form α-amino alkyl radicals. Under the chiral environment provided by CPA, these radicals engage in highly selective cross-coupling to afford β 2,2,3 -amino esters in good yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivity. This strategy provides a mild, modular approach for the stereo-controlled assembly of structurally complex β 2,2,3 -amino esters, overcoming long-standing limitations in substrate scope and reaction efficiency. Beyond its synthetic utility, this method offers new opportunities for expanding the chemical space of β-amino acid derivatives and holds promise for advancing medicinal chemistry and peptide-based drug discovery.},

In this study, we present the striking results of the spontaneous and ultrafast C─O/C─C bond cleavage of various lignin models in water microdroplets, yielding value-added aromatic chemicals. The β-O-4 linkages, the most abundant interunit linkages in natural lignin, were selectively cleaved at C β ─O bonds, producing phenols in yields exceeding 70%. Mechanistic studies elucidated that the cleavage of β-O-4 linkages is derived from the unique alkaline environment at the air–water interface of a negatively charged water microdroplet, even in the absence of extra alkalis. The challenging cleavage of the highly stable C α ─C β bonds in β-O-4 and β-1 lignin linkages was also accomplished, yielding valuable benzoic acid product. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the oxidation of the substrates by molecular oxygen is the key step for the C α ─C β bond cleavage. Notably, all intermediates, including the fragile peroxide intermediates, were identified using mass spectrometry. Accompanied by evidence from radical scavenging and 18 O labeling, the mechanisms for the selective C─O/C─C bond cleavages have been unambiguously characterized, paving a new and green way for the cleavage of lignin linkages.},

  abstract     = {Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are Cu-containing enzymes that play a crucial role in lignocellulosic biomass degradation for use in biofuel production. These enzymes carry out the selective oxidation of C─H bonds in the sugar units, leading to the cleavage of the glycosidic bond. Creating LPMO mimics facilitates the study of the mechanism of action, the characterisation of the reactive species responsible for the C─H bond activation and the potential scale up for industrial application. Here, we report the design, structural and functional characterisation of two novel Cu-binding β-hairpin peptides, called HisPins, that mimic the Histidine-brace site of LPMOs. Activity assays were conducted with p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (PNPG) and demonstrate that the Cu-HisPins show LPMO-like activity on the model substrate. Furthermore, the Cu-HisPins can also perform light-driven oxidation of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) in the presence of melanin, similarly to some LPMO enzymes. Hence, the Cu-HisPins represent the first structural and functional LPMO mimics based on short, folded peptide sequences and show a light-stimulated melanin-mediated oxidative activity, which is unreported for any LPMO mimic characterised so far. Thus, this work paves the way to further exploration of LPMO mechanism, structure-activity relationship and substrate scope expansion.},

However, the targeted synthesis of self-assembled POM-based superstructures with high-efficiency electrocatalytic performance remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the rational design and construction of three POM-based superstructures with ultrathin graphene-like morphologies and well-organized frameworks via a simple self-assembled method, in which transition metals (TMs) bridge POMs into graphene-like planes, while cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) serves as an intercalation agent, endowing the structures with high surface area and enhanced electronic conductivity. Among the resulting materials (denote as POM-CTAB-TM, TM═Co, Ni, or Cu), POM-CTAB-Co exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieving a low overpotential of 292 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 . In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical calculations underscore that the Co atoms within the POM serve as active sites and facilitate the rate-determining step of *OOH formation. Moreover, an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer employing POM-CTAB-Co as the anode and Pt/C as the cathode demonstrates exceptional performance, delivering a current density of 2 A cm −2 at a cell voltage of 2.247 V, along with remarkable durability exceeding 2000 h at an industrial-grade current density of 500 mA cm −2 .

  abstract     = {Carbonyl-containing organic electrodes have been widely considered as ideal substitutes for traditional inorganic compounds in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their excellent redox reversibility and structural tunability. However, constructing effective Na + diffusion channels in these materials is very challenging. To address this issue, we design a new organic molecule, N,N ’-bis(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide (NDI-DTMA), containing a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) structure. The D–A–D architecture significantly enhances π-conjugation extent of single organic material while narrowing its bandgap, facilitating electron transportation along the NDI-DTMA skeletons. Moreover, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl groups not only suppress dissolution issue but also enlarge the intermolecular planar spacing for Na + mobility through constructing efficient transport channels. As an electrode material for SIBs, NDI-DTMA achieves a reversible capacity of 200 mAh g −1 after 2000 cycles at 1 A g −1 owing to its fast Na + kinetics. Through systematic investigation on the anomalous capacity increase and the dynamic evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), we have elucidated the fundamental mechanisms that the distinctive NDI-DTMA architecture enables exceptional energy storage performance. This work pioneers a design paradigm of organic small molecules that simultaneously address low solubility, high conductivity, and rapid ion transport, thereby providing a transformative strategy for SIBs.},

  abstract     = {The direct C─H amination of arenes is a powerful strategy for synthesizing arylamines, yet existing methods often suffer from limited substrate scope, poor selectivity, or scalability issues, particularly for electron-deficient arenes. Here, we introduce a continuous flow electrochemical C─H amination via a pyridination-aminolysis sequence, enabling the efficient functionalization of arenes with diverse electronic properties. The method operates under continuous flow electrochemical conditions, avoiding the need for divided cells, strong chemical oxidants, or homogeneous transition-metal catalysts. The broad substrate scope includes a wide range of electron-rich, electron-deficient, and halogenated arenes, as well as heterocycles, demonstrating excellent functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the process is readily scalable, as shown by a 4-day continuous operation in parallel microreactors, producing over 100 grams of aniline product with high efficiency. This study highlights the potential of continuous-flow electrochemistry as a versatile and practical platform for sustainable C─H functionalization in organic synthesis.},

TUB41 demonstrates remarkable chemical stability across a wide pH range (1–11) and retains its structural integrity after 2 years of repeated adsorption cycles and activation at 80 °C under ambient humidity. Cryogenic adsorption experiments reveal that TUB41's pores selectively exclude gases with larger kinetic diameters, such as N 2 and Ar, while accommodating smaller molecules like CO 2 and H 2 O at elevated temperatures. The enthalpies of adsorption for CO 2 at a loading 0.01 mmol g −1 and H 2 O at a loading of 0.7 mmol g −1 are −41 and −38 kJ mol −1 , respectively, reflecting their strongly attractive interactions with TUB41 under different conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that CO 2 molecules adopt ordered arrangements in the central hydrophobic regions of the pores, guided by strong nonbonding interactions, while H 2 O molecules preferentially bind to the hydrophilic secondary building units. Mean-squared displacement analyses confirm that both gases remain spatially constrained within the pores. These findings highlight TUB41 as a chemically robust and highly selective MOF, with potential for applications in gas separation, photocatalytic water splitting, and CO 2 reduction under challenging conditions.},

However, limited by the large synthetic difficulties, functional biisoquinoline-containing polymers (BCPs) have rarely been reported. Furthermore, the construction of optically active BCPs via asymmetric catalytic polymerization have not been achieved so far. Herein, we developed a multicomponent cascade C─H activation/annulation polymerization (CAAP) strategy that can facilely convert readily available benzil derivatives, internal diynes, and ammonium acetate into structurally diverse BCPs via successive C─H activation and N -annulation processes in a one-pot and one-step operation. The rhodium-catalyzed CAAP reactions proceed efficiently under air, affording a variety of multisubstituted BCPs with high molecular weights ( M w up to 49900 g mol −1 ) in good yields. Benefiting from the unique structures, the resulting BCPs exhibit excellent solubility, good film-forming capability, and readily tunable luminescent properties. The luminescent thin films of a photosensitive BCP can be applied for the generation of multiscale fluorescent photopatterns with high resolution. Moreover, by using different chiral cyclopentadienyl rhodium catalysts, a series of optically active BCPs and BCP–metal complex with stable axially chiral configurations are in situ generated from the asymmetric CAAP reactions.},

Open-shell luminescent diradicals, featuring two unpaired and synthetically tunable spins, offer a molecular platform to achieve such control. However, previous studies have been restricted to symmetric systems, where spin interactions occur between two identical, luminescent radicals. Here, we demonstrate that a non-luminescent (dark) radical can effectively modulate the spin and photophysical behavior of a luminescent (bright) radical within an asymmetric diradical framework. The resulting molecule exhibits a unique three-stage magnetoluminescence (ML) response at low temperatures, arising from hyperfine coupling (HFC) ( B < 0.05 T), the Δg -induced spin mixing (0.05–0.8 T), and spin polarization (0.8–7 T). Notably, the system exhibits pronounced ML enhancement (>14%) under ultra-low magnetic fields ( B < 0.05 T), a previously unreported phenomenon in molecular spin-optical systems. These findings establish asymmetric bright–dark diradicals as a powerful new motif for spin-photon interface design, providing fresh insights into the fundamental photophysics of open-shell systems.},

Here, for the first time, Fe-triazolate (Fe(ta) 2 ) and its metal substituted derivatives (Fe-Metal(ta) 2 ) Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are characterized as new dual-function materials for photo-absorption and water oxidation catalysis in acidic media.

However, a low interfacial alkyne–water ratio leads to severe hydrogen evolution, making it extremely challenging to obtain alkenes with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE). Here, a strategy involving fluorine···π interaction-induced alkyne concentration and orderly arranged sulfonate-repelled interfacial water-cation is developed over commercial Nafion-modified palladium nanotips, enabling electrolysis of 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBE) with up to 83% FE under −100 mA cm −2 . The fluorine···π effect concentrates the alkyne via its adsorption enhancement, promotes electron transfer, and lowers the activation energy, thus accelerating hydrogenation kinetics. Under the bias potential, the side chain of Nafion undergoing rearrangement from disordered to nearly ordered significantly decreases the interfacial free water coverage and activity, thereby reducing the amount of in situ-generated surface-active hydrogen, which contributes to suppressing hydrogen evolution and improving the FE. An 82% FE and 18.9 mmol h −1 reaction rate of MBE is achieved in a 10 h continuous electrosynthesis at 1.25 A, demonstrating potential utility. Furthermore, the hydrogenation and deuteration of different alkynes with improved Faradaic efficiencies at −100 mA cm −2 rationalize the design concept.},

Relatively, their fluorescence signal change, which should be more sensitive, has always been inefficient, resulting from inherent challenges in excited-state dynamics. Here, we present a charge-rearrangement averaged dye design, instead of traditional donor-acceptor structures, to enable a high locally excited or twisted intramolecular charge transfer emission efficiency. A ratiometric dual-fluorescence behavior can be observed along with a solvent-dependent emission trade-off rather than complete quenching. In this case, the dyes can not only precisely visualize various mixed solvents but also enable heterogeneous detection with over hundreds of reuse cycles after being integrated into a crosslinked polymer. The leading portable material achieves a self-calibrated visual tracking of ethanol content (error<0.2%) with a robust working curve ( R 2 = 0.9992) while applied to E10 ethanol gasoline, operable via user-friendly software analysis through mobile phone photography.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous zinc-bromine (Zn-Br 2 ) batteries have emerged as promising candidates for grid-scale energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, their practical deployment is hindered by the dissolution of polybromide species at the cathode and their subsequent shuttling and corrosive reactions at the zinc anode, which severely limit areal capacity and cycling stability. Herein, a Taiji-inspired dual-electrode stabilization strategy is developed to synergistically regulate interfacial chemistry at both electrodes, enabling durable high-areal-capacity Zn-Br 2 batteries. This design leverages the dynamic balance of opposing yet complementary electrostatic interactions, facilitating targeted attraction (Yin) and repulsion (Yang) of polybromides at cathode/anode interfaces, respectively. At the cathode, positively charged quaternary ammonium groups in poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) enable strong electrostatic binding to polybromides, effectively confining them within the cathode and preventing diffusion into the electrolyte. Simultaneously, a lotus-leaf-biomimetic interphase with high electronegativity and hydrophobicity is constructed on Zn anode to repel polybromides and suppress parasitic reactions. Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopic analyses confirm the effective suppression of polybromide shuttling and Zn corrosion. Consequently, the optimized KB-PDDA//Zn@ZnO-PFNA cell achieves a high areal capacity of 5.5 mAh cm −2 and exceptional cycling stability exceeding 20000 cycles, highlighting the critical importance of dual-interface engineering for advancing practical Zn-Br 2 battery technologies.},

While catalyst advances remain crucial, gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) architecture is equally vital in CO 2 electrolyzer design. Most ECO 2 R studies use pure CO 2 feeds, whereas industrial sources like flue gas contain ∼15% CO 2 , requiring costly purification. Eliminating this step demands electrolyzers that directly process impure streams via in situ separation. Here, we introduce a composite GDE (CGDE) featuring a thin CO 2 -selective interlayer of intrinsically microporous polymer (PIM-1) reinforced with the CO 2 -philic ionic liquid [Emim][BF 4 ]. This layer selectively adsorbs CO 2 and suppresses N 2 /O 2 existence at the catalyst interface. In simulated flue gas (15% CO 2 , 5% O 2 in N 2 ), the CGDE with 20 wt% [Emim][BF 4 ]/PIM-1 achieved >70% CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) at 100 mA cm − 2 , versus ∼20% FE for a pristine GDE. Multiphysics simulations confirmed effective CO 2 delivery through the selective layer, with minimal O 2 permeation. Cost estimation analysis indicates around 25% reduction in CO's minimum selling price using the integrated design and >50% under ideal performance metrics by eliminating compression/transport. These results demonstrate that advanced electrode design with CO 2 -selective interlayer enables direct mixed-gas ECO 2 R, establishes key design criteria for selective layers, and significantly improves process economics.},

However, there is a general concern on the dissolution of Cr 2 O 3 , calling for the development of environment-friendly metal oxides. Here, we employ phenylphosphonic acid (PPOA) as a model surface modifier to decorate the model Rh@CeO 2 cocatalysts and demonstrate the critical role of organic surface passivation in H 2 evolution catalysis. We identify a “surface passivation effect” in photocatalysis, wherein the PPOA modification on CeO 2 overlayers not only suppress the adsorption and activation of oxygen but exhibit strong resistance to hydrogen reduction during POWS. This dual functionality effectively suppresses the reverse reactions by blocking the redox cycle of exposed Rh sites and defective CeO 2 overlayers, resulting in significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability. Importantly, this strategy is not limited to Rh@CeO 2 -PPOA systems; it also improves POWS performance in systems where other reducible oxides-organophosphonic acids structure are used as passivation layers on other noble metal cocatalysts. These findings provide fundamental insights into the universal principles of surface passivation in photocatalysis and offer a practical framework for regulating the reverse reactions and provide guidance for optimizing POWS through targeted surface organic modification.},

  abstract     = {Electroplating technology is crucial for interfacial engineering due to its flexible controllability and excellent protective performance. However, electroplated coatings often exhibit uneven deposition morphology due to the uncontrollable nucleation and growth of metal grains, which results in degraded coating performance. Here, we propose ligand coordination equilibria (LCE) that creates a dense coating by simultaneously modulating the solvation structure and optimizing the reduction process, exemplified by Al/Zr alloy electroplating. Multiscale calculations revealed that Cl − coordination with AlCl 3 and ZrCl 4 forms a dynamic equilibrium between active ionic species Al 2 Cl 7 − and ZrCl 5 − , which is predominantly governed by AlCl 3 due to its stronger Lewis acidity. This coordination mechanism was directly validated by Raman spectroscopy. The dynamic equilibrium between Al 2 Cl 7 − , which dominates nucleation density and growth rate, and ZrCl 5 − , which increases the interfacial diffusion barrier, synergistically promotes the small-sized alloy grain. The resulting compact microstructure significantly enhanced the hardness (268 HV) and corrosion resistance (−0.78 V versus SCE) of the coating, far surpassing that of conventional aluminum alloys coatings. This work highlights the innovative use of LCE for interfacial engineering by tailoring the dynamic equilibrium of active ionic species, providing new insights for the industrial electroplating of high-performance alloys.},

In this study, a series of helical poly(isocyanide anthraquinones) (PIC-AQs), including PIC-1AQ n and PIC-2AQ n , were designed and synthesized via living polymerization using a palladium catalyst (Pd-II). The polymers feature a helical polyisocyanide main chain and anthraquinone (AQ) pendants, offer high yields (approximately 90%), controlled number-average molecular weight ( M n ), and a low polymer dispersity index (PDI). Attributed to a narrow energy band gap, low unoccupied molecular orbitals, and high spatial freedom of PIC-2AQ, it exhibits excellent long-term stability in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), maintaining 141 mAh g −1 after 2000 cycles at 1 A g −1 . Additionally, an in situ polymerized poly(ionic liquid) electrolyte was prepared for assembling a PIC-2AQ all-solid-state soft-pouch battery. And it remained stable under extreme operations like bending or cutting. Such a battery significantly broadens the application scope of organic LMBs and offers great potential for their use in flexible electronic devices.},

However, the impact of high-entropy component compatibility on electrodes’ lattice stress and kinetics remains underexplored. Herein, a series of high-entropy PBAs are served as cathode materials for SIBs. The tailoring Na 2 Mn 0.2 Fe 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 [Fe(CN) 6 ] (HE-Cu) with superior mechanochemical compatibility shows superior phase stability without obvious lattice stress and faster electron/ion transfer kinetics. Intrinsic and accumulated lattice stresses can be obtained by ion-incompatible Sn-based high-entropy PBA (HE-Sn) and valence-electron mismatched Ti-based high-entropy PBA (HE-Ti), thereby exhibiting poor structure stability and dynamics. Serious Jahn–Teller structural distortion and unstable octahedron, observed in Na 2 Mn[Fe(CN) 6 ] with complicated Na-ion storage phase evolution (monoclinic ↔ cubic ↔ tetragonal), can be entirely suppressed by high-entropy effect, appearing a zero-strain solid-solution reaction mechanism for HE-Cu employing Mn, Fe, and Co-ions as redox centers to involve in charge compensation. Consequently, HE-Cu presents high initial specific capacity of 120.4 mAh·g −1 , superior rate capability and outstanding cyclability with ultra-long cycling life of 9000 cycles with the lowest capacity-decay-rate of 0.0042% per cycle. Na-ion full cell demonstrates high initial energy density of 397.0 Wh·kg −1 and perfect cycling stability with long lifespan over 2000 cycles.},

Here, we introduce a pioneering slurry-based strategy leveraging Hofmeister “salting-in” effect to disperse binders in a poor-solvent environment, dramatically expanding the applicable binder spectrum. The copolymer poly(vinylidenefluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVTC) was uniformly dispersed in tetrahydrofuran via Li-salts mediation, reducing chain aggregate to hundreds of nanometers. PVTC with reduced size was homo-dispersed in the Li 6 PS 5 Cl slurry, enabling the film-formation of SSE/ PVTC composite electrolytes (SCEs) with an ultra-low resistance of 0.69 Ω cm −2 , synchronously facilitating the formation of continuous polymer networks to provide mechanical cushioning that stabilizes interfaces during cycling. The high dielectric PVTC enhances Li-salts dissociation, eradicating conduction barriers and establishing efficient Li + -pathways. Notably, the excellent thermal transfer capability of SCEs enables direct lamination onto electrodes, enabling industrial manufacturing. ASSBs featuring LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 cathodes and silicon-based anodes exhibited energy densities exceeding 380 Wh kg −1 and retained 80% capacity over 750 cycles. This work breakthrough traditional binder limitations for sulfide SSEs, addresses the transport obstruction through rational structure design, and ushers in a new era for scalable ASSB production.},

Herein, an interstitial boron doped osmium (B-Os) is ultrafast (10 s) constructed by microwave quasi-solid approach, where theoretical and experimental analysis proves that the interstitial boron triggers electron enrichment at the Os site and the formation of negative charge centers. The modified electronic structure electrostatically inhibits Cl − corrosion as well as promotes H 3 O + adsorption, creating a local acidic microenvironment in the natural seawater, neutralizing OH − and effectively avoiding Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ deposition. In situ spectroscopy and local pH monitoring confirm the pivotal role of the microenvironment in regulating reaction kinetics and stability. Therefore, B-Os exhibits a remarkably low overpotential, for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), of 7 mV@10 mA cm −2 in alkaline seawater, while maintaining stable performance over 400 h of stable operation in an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C.

Here, we report that the discrete Zr-oxo nanocluster-based solid, [Zr 17 O 8 (OH) 24 (OH 2 ) 12 (HCO 2 ) 12 (SO 4 ) 8 ] · 6 HCl · 30 H 2 O (Zr 17 ) serves as an efficient, recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for site-selective proteolysis with tunable fragment selectivity. A combination of solution- and solid-state NMR spectroscopy highlighted the importance of the ligand environment of solid Zr 17 for enabling efficient protein-cluster interaction and controlling reactivity. We demonstrate that Zr 17 achieves a proteolytic performance comparable to natural enzymes while allowing fine modulation of peptide product profiles by adjusting reaction parameters. Substrate adsorption and product desorption were found to be governed by the net charge of both catalyst and substrate, as well as rapid reorganization of the cluster's capping ligands, according to UV-Vis/IR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Crucially, the insoluble nature and excellent stability of Zr 17 , evidenced by pair distribution function analysis, allowed reuse across multiple catalytic cycles, overcoming a major limitation of proteolytic systems. This study reveals how cluster surface chemistry governs substrate interaction and catalysis, guiding rational design of next-generation cluster-based catalysts, including hybrid materials such as metal-organic frameworks.},

Three hydroxyl-substituted phenylacetic acids (p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 2-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid) are incorporated into the perovskite films to investigate the significance of their interaction modes with perovskite in regulating f-PSC performance. These multi-hydroxyl molecules, through their progressively enhanced synergistic interactions with the perovskite, effectively promote greater energy dissipation during stress deformation, reducing the Young's modulus of the perovskite by 11.1% and decreasing the thermal expansion coefficient of perovskite film by 38.5%, thereby improving the mechanical strength of the f-PSCs. Additionally, the multi-hydroxyl molecules regulate the excess PbI 2 during the fabrication process of perovskite, enhancing the film quality and optimizing the energy level alignment. As a result, the inverted f-PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.01%. These devices demonstrated excellent mechanical and thermal stability, retaining 90% of their original PCE after 3000 bending cycles, and maintaining 83% of their initial PCE after continuous heating at 85 °C for 1000 h.},

In this strategy, programmable hydrogen-bonding schemes serve as a predictive handle to propagate local asymmetry into a macroscopic polar network. Using an explicit modular design algorithm, we selected three building units—C 3 H 3 O 4 − , C 4 H 5 O 4 − , and C(NH 2 ) 3 + —and assembled them into two one-dimensional polar chain modules, [C(NH 2 ) 3 C 3 H 3 O 4 ] ∞ and [C(NH 2 ) 3 C 4 H 5 O 4 ] ∞ . These modules crystallize as two new UV NLO materials, C(NH 2 ) 3 C 3 H 3 O 4 and C(NH 2 ) 3 C 4 H 5 O 4 , which exhibit excellent linear and nonlinear optical properties. By shifting the synthetic focus from serendipitous screening to hydrogen-bond-guided, module-level engineering, our strategy establishes a predictive framework for the a priori design of NCS structures with tailored properties.},

Remarkably, our methodology exhibits exceptional compatibility with a broad spectrum of acids, encompassing α-amino acids, peptides, and carboxylic acids, thus facilitating the ring expansion of readily accessible propiolamides. Control experiments and computational investigations provide compelling evidence that the ring expansion mechanism is initiated via a reductive radical-polar-crossover-induced C─N bond cleavage, offering profound insights into the underlying reaction dynamics.

In this study, a tandem-triggered transition system is presented that enables the transformation of single-phase coacervates into multiphase structures through the sequential application of two external stimuli: pH and salt concentration. A polyanion containing acid-labile amide bond is incorporated into the membrane-less coacervates. Upon exposure to an acidic pH, hydrolysis of the amide bond induces charge reversal from polyanion to polycation, triggering the first transition from single-phase to nested multiphase coacervates. This transformation alters the spatial redistribution and viscosity of coacervate components and influences sequestration behavior toward various (macro) molecules. Subsequently, the introduction of hypertonic environment as secondary stimulus induces selective dissociation and structural reconfiguration of nested multiphase coacervates into vesicular-like multiphase coacervates, further altering the coacervate components' fluidity and partitioning properties. Notably, the diverse inherent properties of coacervates among this tandem-triggered transition enables the variation of spatial organization for enzymatic reactions. Overall, the findings demonstrate a strategy for the sequential control of coacervate structural reconfiguration through dual stimuli, providing a versatile platform for the development of programable and adaptive coacervate-based protocells.},

  abstract     = {Developing functionalized cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) that respond to various stimuli, particularly redox, remains challenging yet crucial for advanced nanocarbon applications. Here, we report the exploration of the synergy between the concave π-extended tetrathiafulvalene (exTTF) and the curved CPP scaffold for constructing the rigid, conjugated nanohoop exTTF[10]CPP . X-ray analysis reveals a unique spherical packing arrangement in which six adjacent nanohoops interlock through concave and convex interactions. Interestingly, fluorescence studies revealed that exTTF[10]CPP exhibited unexpected anti-Kasha emissions originating from higher excited states, along with Kasha emission from S 1 excited state in toluene and THF. However, in a PMMA film, it displayed a redshifted Kasha emission. The unique Kasha/anti-Kasha dual-emission behavior represents a rarely explored photophysical phenomenon within exTTF derivatives and nanocarbon-based systems. Ultraviolet-Visible (UV–vis) absorption investigations showed that exTTF[10]CPP demonstrated reversible redox responsiveness with tunable binding affinity for C 60 up to 1.92 × 10 6 M −1 . Notably, femtosecond transient absorption measurements further revealed a prolonged lifetime of the charge-separated state, C 60 •− /exTTF[10]CPP •+ , which provides sufficient time for charge utilization. This exceptional charge-transfer property enhances the photocurrent in C 60 ⊂exTTF[10]CPP -based cast film, which is 2.43 times higher than that of exTTF[10]CPP alone, highlighting its potential in photoelectronic device.},

Using N -substituted 3-carboxamide pyrroles as C─H donors, the reaction gives exclusively C-4 substituted products, while furan analogues yield C-2 substituted derivatives. β-Unsubstituted acrylamides can also be used as C─H sources to give chiral skipped dienes. The additions are equally efficient using monosubstituted and 1,1-disubstituted allenes, enabling the efficient formation of products bearing tertiary and all-carbon quaternary stereocenters. Moreover, a preliminary analysis with chiral bisphosphinite ligands confirms the feasibility of an enantioselective variant.

Notably, although the benzilic ester rearrangement (BER) is an efficient approach to α-hydroxycarboxylates, asymmetric catalytic BER remains poorly developed, largely due to poor stereorecognition of the vicinal diketone substituents by common chiral catalysts. In response to these issues, here we report a copper-catalyzed asymmetric BER of azaarene-derived 1,2-diketones with simple alcohols to give diverse α-azaaryl-α-hydroxy esters. It is proposed that the azaarene nitrogen and the adjacent carbonyl group chelate copper to form a five-membered metallacycle, initiating the subsequent stereoselective 1,2-nucleophilic addition step. Meanwhile, enantiocontrol over vicinal diketones was achieved by a tailored bisoxazoline (BOX) ligand with two rigid, long, and terminally bulky sidearms. This study overcomes the incompatibility between azaarenes and BOX ligands, and also unlocks asymmetric catalytic 1,2-azaarene migrations.},

In this study, the coenzyme mimics of nicotinic acid (NA) and 3-carboxy-1-methylpyridinium iodide (NA-Me, simply denoted as NM) have been modified onto the metal-organic framework UiO-66-NH 2 , affording UiO-66-X (X═NA, NM) with varying the degree of mimicry for the nicotinamide nucleotide coenzyme. Remarkably, UiO-66-NM showcases approximately five- and seven-fold activity higher than UiO-66-NA and the pristine UiO-66-NH 2 , respectively, in the photocatalytic hydrogen production. Both experimental and computational results reveal that the NM dangling on the MOF undergoes structural redox change similar to that in the regeneration process of NAD(P)H coenzyme, which serves as the proton and electron relays surrounding catalytic Pt sites, facilitating proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and thereby boosting photocatalytic activity.

Here, we present a bioorthogonal in situ formation strategy that enables precise, organelle-specific activation of AIEgens within live cells. This system employs a dual-lock mechanism—combining tetrazine quenching and twisted intramolecular charge shuttle (TICS) dynamics—to maintain an ultra-low fluorescence background in the precursor state, even under aggregating conditions. Upon bioorthogonal reactions and molecular aggregation, the resulting AIEgens exhibit tunable emission peaks ranging from 605 to 665 nm, large Stokes shifts (up to 201 nm), and an exceptional fluorescence enhancement (up to 1033-fold). Their high biocompatibility and spatial precision allow for multiplexed, simultaneous labeling of intracellular targets. Compared to conventional fluorogenic and bioorthogonal probes, these AIEgens exhibit a sigmoidal amplification response, enabling the sensitive discrimination of subtle biomarker expression differences and the effective identification of injured cells during disease progression. This strategy significantly enhances the specificity and sensitivity of live-cell imaging, expands the functional utility of AIE luminogens, and offers a versatile platform for high-resolution, multiplexed bioimaging in biomedical research and diagnostics.},

DFT calculations reveal that the adsorption capacity of *CO varies under different interfacial electric field intensities for the Cu, Ag/Cu, Pd/Cu, and Au/Cu models. Accordingly, we design three kinds of self-evolution tandem catalysts and investigate the adsorption and migration behaviors of *CO under interfacial electric fields. Electrochemical CO 2 reduction test results indicate that the higher CO selectivity of Au/Cu is attributed to its weak *CO adsorption capacity, confirmed by in situ attenuated total reflection-infrared and in situ Raman. The low C 2+ selectivity of Pd/Cu is owing to its high reaction energy barrier and low catalytic activity. In contrast, Ag/Cu achieves a high FE C2+ of 89.2% and a partial current density (j c2+ ) of 553.9 mA cm −2 thanks to the low reaction energy barrier and moderate *CO adsorption capacity. COMSOL multiphysics simulations reveal that the effect of the interfacial electric field on *CO external migration could be neglected in the nanometer range. Although a strong interfacial electric field increases the energy barrier for internal migration of *CO, the enhanced adsorption capacity of *CO still dominates C–C coupling in the *CO-rich microenvironment over tandem catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous zinc-ion batteries suffer from electrolyte-induced degradation despite their inherent safety advantages. While localized high-concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) mitigate interfacial instability, the excessive cation–anion association elevate ionic transport barriers, resulting in sluggish migration kinetics. Herein, ion-decoupled LHCE (ID-LHCE) are proposed using amphiphilic 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propanol (TFP) as anion-affinity diluent. The TFP-mediated anion-diluent matrix (ADM) liberates anion OTF − from Zn 2+ solvation sheaths, which maintains Zn 2+ -enriched nanodomains while significantly reducing ionic transport barriers with an elevated Zn 2+ transference number of 0.72. ADM decouples aqueous networks into biphasic H 2 O-rich/poor nanodomains, establishing a localized environment with attenuated water activity that suppresses hydrogen evolution reaction. Concurrently generated water-deficient interfaces and dehydrated OTF − coordination environment synergistically facilitate the construction of dense gradient heterogeneous SEI: an inner ZnF 2 -ZnS inorganic layer and an outer oligomer layer, enabling dendrite-free zinc deposition with ultralong cyclability (3,000 h at 1 mA cm −2 ) and 99.88% coulombic efficiency. Full cells paired with NaV 3 O 8 ·1.5H 2 O cathodes retain 72.5% capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at 0.5 A g −1 . Practical viability is demonstrated by the stable operation of high mass loading ampere-hour-level pouch cells (1.04 Ah). By correlating molecular interactions, nanoscale phase separation, and macroscopic ion migration, this work establishes a multiscale design paradigm for electrolyte nanostructure.},

In this work, we successfully develop a novel electrolyte by effectively modulating the competitive solvation process in LMBs. In this formulation, the C─O─C motifs of glymes are competitively substituted by other anions and solvents to achieve single oxygen site coordination, thereby facilitating a weak solvation effect. At an apparent concentration of 1.25 M, a solvated sheath enriched with anions and single oxygen-bound complexes is formed, which significantly enhances lithium metal compatibility and promotes rapid desolvation kinetics. The designed electrolyte using weakly solvated structures exhibits remarkable stability at both 25° and 80 °C, enabling the lithium iron phosphate (LFP)||Li cell to achieve over 2000 cycles (capacity retention: 90%) and 500 cycles (capacity retention: 96%), respectively. Interestingly, the low N/P ratio LFP||Li (N/P = 1.8) full battery maintains a stable capacity over 50 cycles, and the commercial 1.1 Ah LFP||Li pouch cell shows a great stability (capacity retention: 91.0%, CE: 99.82%) over 20 cycles.

  abstract     = {Selective oxidation of methane to acetic acid with high activity and selectivity remains a significant challenge. Brønsted acid sites (Si─OH─Al) are well-known for their crucial role in facilitating methane oxidation to acetic acid over zeolite-based catalysts. Here, we reported that Fe/ZSM-5-0.25Na with abundant Si─ONa─Al moieties outperformed Fe/ZSM-5 (rich in Brønsted acid sites) in methane oxidation to acetic acid using H 2 O 2 in the presence of CO. The Fe/ZSM-5-0.25Na yielded 144.1 µmol of oxygenated products, achieving an acetic acid selectivity of 81.8% at 50 °C for 2.0 h. These results surpass the performance of the Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst, which produced 131.4 µmol of oxygenated products with an acetic acid selectivity of 58.4%. Spectroscopic characterizations and mechanistic studies revealed that the Si─ONa─Al moieties in Fe/ZSM-5-0.25Na facilitated electron donation to iron species, forming electron-rich iron sites. These electron-rich iron species promoted CO insertion and enhanced the formation of acetic acid through carbon–carbon coupling of methane and CO.},

  abstract     = {Lysine or histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from lysine residues of numerous proteins, thereby regulating their function and activity. HDAC6 is involved in multiple cellular processes, yet its protein interaction network remains poorly understood. To uncover novel HDAC6 substrates, we performed an acetylome analysis of HDAC6 knockdown cells, which served as a basis for the design of an HDAC6-trapping peptide library containing hydroxamic acids. Most probes enriched HDAC6 from cell lysates stronger than HDAC1. Proteomic profiling of the trapping probes revealed a preferential enrichment of HDAC6 and resulted in the identification of novel putative HDAC6 interaction partners. Among those were several components of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB that were independently confirmed as HDAC6 binders. Mechanistically, HDAC6 counteracted NF-κB activity induced upon p300-catalyzed acetylation of NF-κB p50. These findings indicate a potential anti-inflammatory function of HDAC6 in NF-κB signaling.},

Here, we report a fluorogenic hydrazino-Pictet–Spengler (HIPS) probe for lipidic aldehydes “FLipA-HIPS” that generates bright, wash-free fluorescent reaction products in vitro and in cellulo. FLipA-HIPS is essentially nonfluorescent but reacts with aldehydes to give an environmentally sensitive fluorophore with a higher quantum yield in SDS micelles as compared to aqueous buffer alone. FLipA-HIPS reacts with lipidic aldehydes to give 10- to 25-fold higher fluorescence intensities than reactions containing either short-chain aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes in aqueous buffer. Confocal microscopy shows that live cells pretreated with potassium bromate or the aldehydic phospholipid “POVPC” display rapid and selective FLipA-HIPS staining that co-localizes with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), consistent with the ER's known role in accumulating lipidic aldehydes. These results demonstrate that HIPS reactions can exhibit useful fluorogenic properties for aldehyde biosensing applications in live cells.},

  abstract     = {Targeting surface-exposed lysines in kinases through covalent modification presents a major challenge due to their high p K a and inherently low reactivity. While current research primarily targets more reactive catalytic lysines buried in the ATP-binding pocket, no systematic rational strategy has yet been developed for selectively engaging surface-exposed lysines. Herein, we present a versatile strategy for developing cell-active covalent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) by selectively targeting unique surface-exposed lysines using squarate chemistry. By using Aurora A (AURKA) as a proof-of-concept, we systematically evaluated this approach against other well-known lysine-reactive warheads (e.g., EBA, SO 2 F, and OSO 2 F) and demonstrated, for the first time, squarates’ superior efficacy in engaging these challenging low-reactivity lysines. Amongst various AURKA CKIs, AL8 emerged as the first-in-class squarate-based, cell-active inhibitor, exhibiting excellent selectivity in both biochemical and cellular assays with long-residence time in covalently engaging endogenous AURKA. Detailed investigation of effects of leaving groups on squaric esters provided valuable insights for future development of lysine-reactive CKIs. Our finding has established squarate-containing ligands as a unique and readily tunable platform for covalent modification of surface-exposed, non-catalytic lysines in targeted kinase drug discovery.},

  abstract     = {The study of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has become a cornerstone of chemical sciences, providing crucial guidance for advancing a wide range of fields. Within this context, quasi[8]circulenes and indenofluorenes (IFs) have gained considerable attention due to their rich chiroptical, optoelectronic, supramolecular, and redox properties. However, their combined integration into a single molecular framework has not yet been realized. This work demonstrates that curved indeno[2,1- c ]fluorene quasi[8]circulenes are easily accessible through an intramolecular cyclization of a readily available helicene diketone. The cyclization is high yielding and accompanied by an unexpected regioselective triflation that—alongside both ketones—allows orthogonal functionalization. This synthetic utility offers great potential for incorporating 8-membered rings and formally antiaromatic as -indacene moieties into complex architectures. Herein, a series of fully conjugated antiaromatic indeno[2,1- c ]fluorene quasi[8]circulenes were synthesized and studied spectroscopically and electrochemically, showcasing the rich properties of these rare, purely carbon-based quasi[8]circulenes. It is shown that the studied compounds display multiple accessible redox states at mild potentials, which can be significantly altered through adequate substituents. These substituents additionally induce unprecedented aggregation behavior for one of the compounds. Furthermore, the studied IFs exhibit chirality arising from the curved structure of the quasi[8]circulenes, which allowed studying chiroptical properties for one of the structures.},

Only the GFP/NHS system resulted in aptamers that consistently bind to unmodified GFP, whereas the His-tagged GFP yielded aptamers biased toward the His-tag epitope.

However, the inherent contradiction between the fluctuating nature of renewable energy and the need for stable operation in electrochemical processes significantly hinders their development and implementation. To mitigate this, we propose a robust two-electron oxygen reduction reaction system using O-coordinated Co single-atom catalysts for the electrosynthesis of environmentally friendly hydrogen peroxide. It excels in stability and efficiency across various operating conditions, including steady-state, start−stop cycles, and fluctuating power inputs. At a current density of −50 mA cm −2 , the system sustains over 55 stable start−stop cycles with an average Faradic efficiency above 96%. The high selectivity and durability are attributed to the reservoir-containing O-coordinated Co single-atom sites and the self-healing capability of gas diffusion electrodes. Furthermore, we evaluate its practicality under simulated photovoltaic power supply scenarios in the field of smart agriculture, particularly for integrated fertilization, disinfection, and irrigation. By addressing the variability of renewable energy and optimizing the integration of electrochemical processes, our work paves the way for fully realizing green electrification in sustainable chemical synthesis.},

With the increased use of automated platforms for material generation, porosity analysis is now frequently the bottleneck in the discovery of new porous materials. Here, we present a semiautomated pre-screening strategy that uses dye adsorption to create a colorimetric array that is combined with computer vision analysis for porosity screening. By using a six-dye multichannel array and a defined porosity threshold, our method rapidly screened 50 candidate materials that spanned molecular solids, polymers, and metal–organic frameworks. The method showed a 98–100% classification accuracy compared with gas uptake measurements. While this method is more qualitative than quantitative, it is more than 30 times faster than conventional gas sorption measurements, and it has the scope to be made much faster with greater parallelization and automation. This makes this colorimetric method suitable for pre-screening arrays of materials to choose samples that merit more detailed conventional porosity analysis.},

Therefore, catching and degrading NPs are important to manage environmental and human health risks. In this study, we developed a biohybrid catalyst system with two functionalities to capture (Hook) and degrade (Decay) NPs. The biohybrid catalyst is composed of a Grubbs-Hoveyda (GH) type cofactor conjugated to the material-binding peptide LCI_F16C, which immobilizes the GH-cofactor onto superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The anchored biohybrid catalyst initiates a ring-opening metathesis polymerization to generate a hydrophobic polynorbornene film around iron oxide core, which enables to efficiently capture and remove a broad spectrum of hydrophobic NPs, including polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene (PS), poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(methyl methacrylate), and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), with hydrophobic interaction as the main driving force. This hydrophobic coating facilitated rapid adsorption of PS-COOH 500 nm NPs within 10 min, reaching an impressive adsorption capacity of 5.53 ± 0.29 g/g on PS NPs, and demonstrated a high recovery efficiency of 99% for SBR NPs. Notably, the embedded GH-cofactor preserved its ethenolysis activity, cleaving internal C═C bonds of SBR and resulting in 6.5% degradation, thereby validating the concept of simultaneous nanoplastic capture and catalytic breakdown.},

Rh-NS/Rh-NR, characterized by a high density of unsaturated coordination sites and a large specific surface area, greatly enhances the adsorption capacity of NO 2 − and crucial intermediates and lowers the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of *NOH formation from *NO.

  abstract     = {The substrate-specific bond cleavage capability of hydrolases provides a unique strategy for engineering off-on switches. This prompted our hypothesis that confining hydrolases and substrates to distinct biomolecular hierarchies (e.g., a protein and its modifying glycans) could enable transmission of spatial proximity information through localized hydrolysis. Using New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), we developed a localized hydrolysis-based proximity reporting (LHPR) platform for in situ elucidation of the hierarchical architecture of glycoproteins. We constructed protein probes by conjugating target-recognizing molecules with NDM-1, and designed click chemistry-reactive, substrate-caged fluorescent molecules as glycan probes. Programmed NDM-1 activity enabled in situ protein-specific imaging of glycans via proximity-dependent activation within various biological specimens. Within a unified enzymatic framework, we successfully quantified distinct glycans of individual proteins and established the principle of protein-specific glycosylation stoichiometry analysis. Our work provides a powerful tool for developing glycoprotein-based disease biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and diagnostic approaches, offering new possibilities for precision medicine research.},

Most conventional surface passivation strategies frequently introduce electrically resistive interlayers that compromise charge transport/extraction between the perovskite and charge-transport layers. We resolve this challenge through the rational implementation of all-conjugated block copolymers (CBCPs). The CBCPs demonstrate dual-functional capabilities of offering charge transport channels while facile integrating multiple defect-passivating moieties, thereby enabling efficient charge carrier transport and defect passivation. This dual-functional synergy yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.11% in our best device. The target PSCs maintained >90% of their initial PCEs after maximum power point tracking for >1400 hours at 65 °C. This approach offers a promising strategy for interface engineering that improves both charge extraction and defect reduction using conjugated block copolymers.},

However, the strategic potential of alkaline earth metals (e.g., Ca, Sr, and Ba) in HOIP assembly remains largely unexplored, with ferroelectric implementations yet to be realized, despite their historical roots in perovskite evolution dating back to the eponymous CaTiO 3 mineral discovered in 1839. Here, for the first time, we report a new family of alkaline earth metal-based HOIP-like ferroelectrics. Benefiting from three-dimensional cage-like structure and multiaxial characteristics, (pyrrolidinium)Ba(ClO 4 ) 3 as a representative shows pronounced ferroelectricity with robust polarization switching in both bulk single crystals and compressed polycrystalline powder pellets. Molecular fluorination strategy on pyrrolidinium cation further optimizes the comprehensive ferroelectric properties ( R -3-fluoropyrrolidinium)Ba(ClO 4 ) 3 , enhancing Curie temperature, increasing polar axes and doubling polarization values. Combined with their easy preparation and good plasticity, this discovery provides a brand-new structural paradigm for HOIP ferroelectrics and highlights exceptional promise in emerging flexible ferroelectric applications.},

  abstract     = {The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO 2 RR) involves numerous intermediates and simultaneous interactions between these intermediates and water (H 2 O) molecules. Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon-related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H 2 O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H 2 O is critical during CO 2 RR process, as H 2 O molecules are directly involved in CO 2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid–liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper-based catalyst containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities to investigate the influence of H 2 O molecules on CO 2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H 2 O molecules, instead of asymmetric H-bonded H 2 O or ice-like H 2 O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO 2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C 1 FE to 70% C 2 FE. We unveil, via in situ ATR-SEIRAS measurement, that the H 2 O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO 2 reduction pathways.},

  abstract     = {Assembly-line enzymes carry out multistep synthesis of important metabolites by using acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) to shuttle intermediates along defined sequences of active sites. Despite longstanding interest in reprogramming these systems for metabolic engineering and biosynthetic chemistry, the mechanisms underlying their reaction order remain poorly understood and difficult to control. Here we describe a β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase from Pseudomonas putida ( Pp FabG4) with an unusual selectivity for medium chains and use it to explore the molecular basis of substrate specificity in enzymes that pull intermediates from fatty acid synthesis, a common route to specialized products. X-ray crystallography shows no obvious barriers to short-chain binding. Molecular simulations and supporting mutational analyses indicate that substrate preference arises instead from a weak enzyme–ACP interaction that is stabilized by medium acyl chains but not by short chains. Indeed, mutations that strengthen this interaction for Pp FabG4 or weaken it for Ec FabG, an Escherichia coli β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase with a broad substrate specificity, can enhance or reduce activity on short-chain substrates by over 100-fold. Our findings show how the stability of enzyme-ACP interactions can control substrate scope in promiscuous enzymes and guide the exchange of intermediates between (and within) assembly-line systems.},

Herein, we describe a general solution to the synthesis of sterically hindered ethers via an iridium-catalyzed reductive deoxygenation reaction of readily available ester and lactone starting materials. Employing commercially available, bench-stable IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF 3 ) 2 ] 3 ) 2 as a precatalyst at 1 mol% loading with 4 equivalents of tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDS) as the terminal reductant at room temperature, this practical synthetic approach to hindered ethers features a simple, mix-and-stir, single-vessel protocol under ambient conditions and produces a diverse range of both acyclic and cyclic ether products in good to excellent yields. Control experiments demonstrated that the IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF 3 ) 2 ] 3 ) 2 /TMDS catalytic system could not only rapidly hydrosilylate esters to mixed silyl/alkyl hemiacetal intermediates but also catalyze the reduction of acetals directly to ethers, revealing the Lewis acidic and hydridic properties required for this deoxygenative transformation.},

Aside from limited insights into nitrate uptake and storage, foundational nitrate biology has lagged. Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors can address this gap with real-time imaging, but such technologies for mammalian cell applications remain rare. Here, we designed and engineered a biosensor fusing the green fluorescent protein EGFP and the nitrate recognition domain NreA from Staphylococcus carnosus . Seven rounds of directed evolution and 15 mutations resulted in NitrOFF. NitrOFF has a high degree of allosteric communication between the domains reflected in a turn-off intensiometric response ( K d ≈ 9 µM). This was further reinforced by X-ray crystal structures of apo and nitrate-bound NitrOFF, which revealed a large-scale conformational rearrangement changing the relative positioning of the domains by 68.4°. This dramatic difference was triggered by the formation of a long helix at the engineered linker connecting the two domains, peeling the β7 strand off the EGFP and thus extinguishing the fluorescence upon nitrate binding. Finally, we highlighted the utility of NitrOFF to monitor exogenous nitrate uptake and modulation in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line.},

  abstract     = {Ammonia from nitrate-containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag-N/O bonds on one-dimensional WO 3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The resultant catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeding ∼90% over a potential range of −0.6 to −0.2 V RHE with a maximum FE approaching 100% at −0.4 V RHE and a maximum NH 3 yield at −0.55 V RHE . Importantly, the catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm −2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ∼94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), we succeeded in obtaining an NH 3 production rate of 12.75 mmol h −1 at −4 V and maintained the stability for over 30 h with FE > 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis have demonstrated that the formation of Ag-N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of *NO→*NHO, thereby considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities. This work provides insights into acidic nitrate reduction for ammonia electrosynthesis, which develops corrosion-resistant electrocatalysts for energy conversion.},

  abstract     = {Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) catalyzes the conversion of cysteine with dioxygen to yield cysteine sulfinic acid, which lies at the branching point of cysteine catabolism. Despite many years of research there are still many questions related to its functioning. Thus, CDO is inactive with selenocysteine (Sec) or when the central iron ion is replaced by cobalt. In this context, we report here biomimetic CDO models with bound selenocysteamine substrate ligands, namely [Tp Mes Fe(Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )] and [Tp Mes* Fe(Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )] (with Tp Mes = hydrotris(3-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)borate, Tp Mes* = hydrobis((3-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)(5-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)borate) and in addition a cobalt-analogue [Tp Mes Co(Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )]. Upon treatment of the Fe/Se homologues with O 2 – as in case of the parent cysteamine-bound complexes – the dioxygenation of the chalcogen atoms was observed. This suggests that the lack in reactivity of CDO-Sec toward O 2 does not originate in the electronic situation but in the surrounding protein matrix. Subsequent DFT calculations indeed showed lower initial barriers for selenocysteamine than for cysteamine in support of the experimental work. The complex [Tp Mes Co(Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )], where Fe is formally replaced by Co, also reacts with dioxygen – more slowly but selectively – to give [Tp Mes Co(O 2 Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )]. Hence, this is an experimental observation of a dioxygenation with O 2 mediated by a cobalt center in a molecular compound, which is so far without precedence.},

  abstract     = {Supramolecular polymerization of π-extended compounds with hydrogen-bonding sites remains challenging, especially at high concentrations, due to their limited solubility in nonpolar solvents. Herein, we report a novel method incorporating a thermal precursor approach for the supramolecular polymerization of a poorly soluble tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP) derivative with multiple hydrogen-bonding sites and chiral cholesterol groups ( BP Chol ). Polymerization in the nonpolar solvent tetralin is induced by the retro-Diels–Alder reaction of the highly soluble precursor ( CP Chol ) to BP Chol in the hot solution and subsequent natural cooling, as confirmed by monitoring absorption spectra. The emergence of circular dichroism signals corroborates the formation of aggregates with supramolecular chirality, as the first chiroptical characterization of BP aggregates. Detailed structural analysis using high-resolution microscopies reveals a unique pyramidal multilayer structure with a spiral nature. Additionally, faster cooling produces monolayer nanosheets, which differ from the multilayer structures formed upon natural cooling. This is due to a different nucleation process in the cooperative polymerization. By using the nanosheets as seeds, seed-induced polymerization is achieved, resulting in extended sheets. Notably, the indirect precursor method using CP Chol enables outstanding polymerization at high concentrations (mM level) to afford micro-sized pyramids, which cannot be realized by a direct method using BP Chol .},

  abstract     = {Peptide-based biosensors are widely used for in vitro detection of protease activity but often suffer from the limited sensitivity, poor accuracy, and incompatibility with point-of-care testing (POCT) devices. Herein, we developed a versatile deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme)-amplified protease-sensing (DP) platform that integrates the positively charged oligopeptides with a negatively charged DNAzyme biocatalyst for highly-sensitive protease detection. The system leverages the electrostatic peptide–DNAzyme interactions to inhibit DNAzyme catalytic activity, which is reactivated upon the protease-triggered peptide hydrolysis, thus enabling an efficient signal amplification via the successive cleavage of DNAzyme substrate. Compared to conventional peptide-based sensing platform, our DP system offers an enhanced sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio and is highly modular for detecting various clinically relevant proteases through a simple replacement of the peptide blocker. By introducing a dual-enzyme recognition mechanism, we developed a dual-protease-triggered DP platform for enabling the accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 proteases in saliva. We also applied the DP platform to differentiate between normal and cancerous colon cells and tissues by detecting colorectal cancer (CRC)-associated proteases. Overall, this work introduces a universal and scalable biosensing strategy for activity-based protease detection with potential applications in both infectious disease diagnostics and cancer classification, advancing the field of DNAzyme-based POCT technologies.},

Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) shows promise for detecting structurally similar analogs but faces challenges like subtle receptor signal changes and distortion with weakly adsorbing plasticizer analytes. We address these limitations by integrating direct and indirect SERS to capture intrinsic Raman signals and receptor-analyte interactions, achieving 100% classification accuracy eight plasticizer analogs and multiplex quantification of three major plasticizers extracted from canola oil with < 5% predictive errors at a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.01 mg L −1 , despite interference from other lipophilic contaminants such as adipates. Experimental SERS data and interaction energy calculations affirm that direct SERS detects alkyl chains, while indirect SERS identifies aromatic rings and carboxyl groups in eight plasticizer analogs with varying alkyl structures. A hybrid direct-indirect superspectrum was constructed, enabling the differentiation of eight analogs via Partial-Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and further analysis using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) reveals equal contribution from all platforms, which highlights their complementary roles. These findings pave the way for broader applications in rapid, on-site detection of complex contaminants across industries.},

Here, we report on two iodocuprate hybrids (HO 2 C(CH 2 ) n -1 NH 3 )CuI 2 ( n = 3, 4) exhibiting excitation-wavelength-dependent emission. The thermodynamically stable n = 4 compound (2D-C4) is based on a rare 2D iodocuprate network, while a more common 1D network of edge-sharing tetrahedra is found both in the n = 3 compound (1D-C3) and in the metastable n = 4 (1D-C4) hybrid. Depending on the excitation wavelength, 2D-C4 and 1D-C3 hybrids exhibit yellow emission, red emission, or white light emission—resulting from the emission of both components,—while 1D-C4 does not emit in the red region. The description of the electronic structure based on density functional theory (DFT) indicates two different origins for the emissions of 2D-C4 and 1D-C3, in particular from iodide vacancies (red emission), which involve mid-gap states. The emission of 2D-C4 can also be modulated from red to yellow depending on applied pressure. 2D-C4 also has an exceptionally low congruent melting temperature of 110 °C, allowing the solvent-free preparation of thin films. Finally, phosphor-converted-LED based on 2D-C4 have been prepared, showing that either pink or nearly white emission is produced.},

  abstract     = {Electronic structures fundamentally influence material properties, with electron spin playing a pivotal role in defining catalytic activity and reaction pathways. However, the precise spin-mediated mechanisms of adsorption energies and nitrogen–nitrogen transition states on the catalyst surface, remain unclear due to the complexity of spin-mediated promotion factors. Herein, we demonstrate that tuning the spin state of single iron (Fe) sites on TiO 2 can significantly enhance photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Our theoretical predictions reveal that low spin states of single Fe sites facilitate N 2 adsorption and intermediate formation, thereby activating more catalytic sites on TiO 2 for efficient nitrogen fixation. By manipulating the crystal phase and incorporating fluorine dopants, we systematically modulate the spin states of Fe sites, achieving optimized N 2 adsorption and desorption kinetics and suppressing charge recombination. Experimental results combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that these modifications reduce the magnetic moment of Fe sites, lower free energy barriers, and strengthen electronic interactions with key intermediates, particularly during N─NH formation. Intriguingly, we find that weakening N 2 adsorption via reduced Fe magnetization enhances catalytic performance, challenging conventional assumptions that stronger N─N bond activation necessarily improves NRR efficiency. Our experimental results corroborate these findings, showing a remarkable 72-fold increase in ammonia production rate compared to pristine TiO 2 . This work highlights the crucial role of electron spin engineering in designing highly efficient NRR catalysts and provides a new paradigm for rational catalyst design.},

Through operando spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical simulations, we show that fluorine leaches rapidly during electrolysis, transforming Cu 2 ⁺ precursors into metallic Cu⁰ with distinct local structures. Cu-F-4, with the lowest coordination number, exhibits high eCO 2 R activity and favors CO formation with a Faradaic efficiency (FE CO ) of 81% at −0.45 V.

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO 2 where CO 2 enrichment and purification is an energy-intensive process. Herein, we report a Co-COOH-COF with an asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO 2 . The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst, Co 17.7 -COOH-COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1 mmol g −1 h −1 from neat CO 2 and 180.5 mmol g −1 h −1 from 40 vol% CO 2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g −1 h −1 from neat CO 2 and 116.0 mmol g −1 h −1 from 40 vol% CO 2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state-of-the-art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits a widely and continuously adjustable CO/H 2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the covalent organic frame (COF) by the formation of atomically dispersed N–Co–O 4 sites and enhances dissociation of water and CO 2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO 2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for the design of high-performance catalysts for the photoreduction of CO 2 to syngas.},

Molecular catalysts were used to synthesize atactic , syndiotactic , and isotactic P4EH with narrow molecular weight distributions. Ziegler–Natta catalysts were used to synthesize isotactic and processable P4EH. Processable i -P4EH was used to produce discs, and a transmittance of 92%, a haze of 8% and a clarity of 92% were measured. In addition, a density of 0.86 g cm −3 was observed.},

  abstract     = {Photoenzymatic catalysis facilitates stereoselective new-to-nature chemistry under mild conditions. In addition to the rational design of artificial photoenzymes, naturally occurring redox enzymes can be repurposed to promote photoredox catalysis in the chiral protein environment. Here, we show that enzymes utilizing the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) cofactor expand the toolbox of photobiocatalysis. PQQ absorbs visible light and is capable of single-electron transfer. It thus exhibits mechanistic similarities to flavin cofactors, which are widely used for photoenzymatic approaches. First, we established the trimethyl ester PQQMe 3 as a stand-alone photoredox catalyst in pure organic solvent. Upon excitation, PQQMe 3 enables the redox-neutral radical cyclization of an N -(bromoalkyl)-substituted indole. We then tested a panel of PQQ-dependent sugar and alcohol dehydrogenases for photoenzymatic catalysis in aqueous buffer, focusing on a redox-neutral radical reaction to form oxindoles. Under optimized reaction conditions, we obtained a 69% yield and an 82:18 enantiomeric ratio. Our work thus demonstrates that PQQ enzymes are capable of stereoselective photoredox catalysis. Future enzyme engineering efforts based on computational modeling and directed evolution will fully unlock their synthetic potential.},

  abstract     = {Single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs) are designed by covalently bonding anions to the polymers, which is attractive for mitigating anion aggregation-derived polarization. However, one major challenge for developing SICPEs with higher ambient ionic conductivity comes at the expense of structural robustness. Here, boron ion-centered lithium salt (LiT4PAB) with symmetric cross structure and terminal functional C═C was proposed as a units, and then 3D coordination electrolyte (LiPHB) was constructed via chemical cross-linking of LiT4PAB with poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP). The boron ion-centered units catenated by single bonds show the abundant conformation transitions, enabling the deformable architecture of LiPHB with the aid of electrostatic interactions of diphenylsulfonimide. Therefore, LiPHB undergoes adaptive deformation when subjected to impact, achieving good ductility with elastic moduli of 1.4 GPa and a maximum elongation of 447.4%. Moreover, LiPHB demonstrates 3D single lithium-ion transport channels to guide the homogeneous lithium deposition. As a results, lithium symmetric cells exhibit stable plating/stripping cycle for over 1500 h at 0.1 mA cm −2 at 30 °C. Li/LiPHB SICPEs/NCM811 solid-state batteries deliver a capacity retention of 90.3% in 150 cycles at 30 °C and 0.2 C. Our study shed light on the design strategies of the dynamic single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes for solid-state batteries.},

  abstract     = {Upholding data privacy, especially in medical research, has become tantamount to facing difficulties in accessing individual-level patient data. Estimating mixed effects binary logistic regression models involving data from multiple data providers, like hospitals, thus becomes more challenging. Federated learning has emerged as an option to preserve the privacy of individual observations while still estimating a global model that can be interpreted on the individual level, but it usually involves iterative communication between the data providers and the data analyst. In this paper, we present a strategy to estimate a mixed effects binary logistic regression model that requires data providers to share summary statistics only once. It involves generating pseudo-data whose summary statistics match those of the actual data and using these in the model estimation process instead of the actual unavailable data. Our strategy is able to include multiple predictors, which can be a combination of continuous and categorical variables. Through simulation, we show that our approach estimates the true model at least as good as the one that requires the pooled individual observations. An illustrative example using real data is provided. Unlike typical federated learning algorithms, our approach eliminates infrastructure requirements and security issues while being communication efficient and while accounting for heterogeneity.},

Furthermore, their incorporation of normal random effects into beta-binomial models has been done at the sacrifice of certain computational convenience and clear interpretation with beta-binomial models. In this paper, we introduce a new model that incorporates subject-specific and serially correlated time-specific distribution-free random effects on the unit interval into logistic regression multiplicatively with fixed effects. This new multiplicative model facilitates the interpretation of random effects on the unit interval as risk modifiers. This multiplicative model setup also eases the model derivation and random effects prediction. A quasi-likelihood approach has been developed in the estimation of our model. Our results are robust against random effects distributions. Our method is illustrated through the analysis of multiple sclerosis trial data.},

In this paper, we propose including the minimization variable “center” as a random effect and assess its performance using simulations for Gaussian, binary, and Poisson endpoint variables. Our simulation study suggests that the random-effect model controls type-I error and preserves maximum power for all three endpoints under varied clinical trial settings.

The existing online literature mainly considered large-scale studies and constructed powerful but rigid algorithms for these. However, smaller studies, such as platform trials, require high flexibility and easy interpretability to take study objectives into account and facilitate the communication. Another challenge in platform trials is that due to the shared control arm some of the -values are dependent and significance levels need to be prespecified before the decisions for all the past treatments are available. We propose adaptive-discarding-Graphs (ADDIS-Graphs) with FWER control that due to their graphical structure perfectly adapt to such settings and provably uniformly improve the state-of-the-art method.

  abstract     = {Accelerated failure time (AFT) models offer an attractive alternative to Cox proportional hazards models. AFT models are collapsible and, unlike hazard ratios in proportional hazards models, the acceleration factor—a key effect measure in AFT models—is collapsible, meaning its value remains unchanged when adjusting for additional covariates. In addition, AFT models provide an intuitive interpretation directly on the survival time scale. From the recent development of smooth parametric AFT models, we identify potential issues with their applications and note several desired extensions that have not yet been implemented. To enrich this tool and its application in clinical research, we improve the AFT models within a flexible parametric framework in several ways: we adopt monotone natural splines to constrain the log cumulative hazard to be a monotonic function across its support; allow for time-varying acceleration factors, possibly include cure and accommodating more than one time-varying effect; and implement both mixture and nonmixture cure models. We implement all of these extensions in the rstpm2 package, which is publicly available on CRAN. Simulations highlight a varying success in estimating cure fractions. However, in terms of covariate-effect estimation, flexible AFT models appear to be more robust than the Cox model even when there is a high proportion of cured individuals in the data, regardless of whether cure is reached within the observed data. We also apply some of our extensions of AFT models to real-world survival data.},

  abstract     = {Phase I dose escalation trials in oncology generally aim to find the maximum tolerated dose. However, with the advent of molecular-targeted therapies and antibody drug conjugates, dose-limiting toxicities are less frequently observed, giving rise to the concept of optimal biological dose (OBD), which considers both efficacy and toxicity. The estimand framework presented in the addendum of the ICH E9(R1) guidelines strengthens the dialogue between different stakeholders by bringing in greater clarity in the clinical trial objectives and by providing alignment between the targeted estimand under consideration and the statistical analysis methods. However, there is a lack of clarity in implementing this framework in early-phase dose optimization studies. This paper aims to discuss the estimand framework for dose optimization trials in oncology, considering efficacy and toxicity through utility functions. Such trials should include pharmacokinetics data, toxicity data, and efficacy data. Based on these data, the analysis methods used to identify the optimized dose/s are also described. Focusing on optimizing the utility function to estimate the OBD, the population-level summary measure should reflect only the properties used for estimating this utility function. A detailed strategy recommendation for intercurrent events has been provided using a real-life oncology case study. Key recommendations regarding the estimand attributes include that in a seamless phase I/II dose optimization trial, the treatment attribute should start when the subject receives the first dose. We argue that such a framework brings in additional clarity to dose optimization trial objectives and strengthens the understanding of the drug under consideration, which would enable the correct dose to move to phase II of clinical development.},

It can be shown that the new estimator is consistent, which does not depend on the correctness of the working models.

Apart from the sequence tagging paradigm, the proposed method tackles the multitask lexical analysis via two-stage sequence span classification. Firstly, the model detects the word and named entity boundaries by multi-label classification over character spans in a sentence. Then, the authors assign POS labels and entity labels for words and named entities by multi-class classification, respectively. Furthermore, a Gated Task Transformation (GTT) is proposed to encourage the model to share valuable features between tasks.

  abstract     = {Nonlinear transforms have significantly advanced learned image compression (LIC), particularly using residual blocks. This transform enhances the nonlinear expression ability and obtain compact feature representation by enlarging the receptive field, which indicates how the convolution process extracts features in a high dimensional feature space. However, its functionality is restricted to the spatial dimension and network depth, limiting further improvements in network performance due to insufficient information interaction and representation. Crucially, the potential of high dimensional feature space in the channel dimension and the exploration of network width/resolution remain largely untapped. In this paper, we consider nonlinear transforms from the perspective of feature space, defining high-dimensional feature spaces in different dimensions and investigating the specific effects. Firstly, we introduce the dimension increasing and decreasing transforms in both channel and spatial dimensions to obtain high dimensional feature space and achieve better feature extraction. Secondly, we design a channel-spatial fusion residual transform (CSR), which incorporates multi-dimensional transforms for a more effective representation. Furthermore, we simplify the proposed fusion transform to obtain a slim architecture (CSR-sm), balancing network complexity and compression performance. Finally, we build the overall network with stacked CSR transforms to achieve better compression and reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion performance compared to the existing LIC methods and traditional codecs. Specifically, our proposed method achieves 9.38% BD-rate reduction over VVC on Kodak dataset.},

  abstract     = {The cloud data centres evolved with an issue of energy management due to the constant increase in size, complexity and enormous consumption of energy. Energy management is a challenging issue that is critical in cloud data centres and an important concern of research for many researchers. In this paper, we proposed a cuckoo search (CS)-based optimisation technique for the virtual machine (VM) selection and a novel placement algorithm considering the different constraints. The energy consumption model and the simulation model have been implemented for the efficient selection of VM. The proposed model CSOA-VM not only lessens the violations at the service level agreement (SLA) level but also minimises the VM migrations. The proposed model also saves energy and the performance analysis shows that energy consumption obtained is 1.35 kWh, SLA violation is 9.2 and VM migration is about 268. Thus, there is an improvement in energy consumption of about 1.8% and a 2.1% improvement (reduction) in violations of SLA in comparison to existing techniques.},

  abstract     = {Recently, numerous estimation issues have been solved due to the developments in data-driven artificial neural networks (ANN) and graph neural networks (GNN). The primary limitation of previous methodologies has been the dependence on data that can be structured in a grid format. However, physiological recordings often exhibit irregular and unordered patterns, posing a significant challenge in conceptualising them as matrices. As a result, GNNs which comprise interactive nodes connected by edges whose weights are defined by anatomical junctions or temporal relationships have received a lot of consideration by leveraging implicit data that exists in a biological system. Additionally, our study incorporates a structural GNN to effectively differentiate between different degrees of infection in both the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Subsequently, demographic data are included, and a multi-task learning architecture is devised, integrating classification and regression tasks. The trials used an authentic dataset, including 800 brain x-ray pictures, consisting of 560 instances classified as moderate cases and 240 instances classified as severe cases. Based on empirical evidence, our methodology demonstrates superior performance in classification, surpassing other comparison methods with a notable achievement of 92.27% in terms of area under the curve as well as a correlation coefficient of 0.62.},

  abstract     = {The Bat algorithm, a metaheuristic optimization technique inspired by the foraging behaviour of bats, has been employed to tackle optimization problems. Known for its ease of implementation, parameter tunability, and strong global search capabilities, this algorithm finds application across diverse optimization problem domains. However, in the face of increasingly complex optimization challenges, the Bat algorithm encounters certain limitations, such as slow convergence and sensitivity to initial solutions. In order to tackle these challenges, the present study incorporates a range of optimization components into the Bat algorithm, thereby proposing a variant called PKEBA. A projection screening strategy is implemented to mitigate its sensitivity to initial solutions, thereby enhancing the quality of the initial solution set. A kinetic adaptation strategy reforms exploration patterns, while an elite communication strategy enhances group interaction, to avoid algorithm from local optima. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the proposed PKEBA is rigorously evaluated. Testing encompasses 30 benchmark functions from IEEE CEC2014, featuring ablation experiments and comparative assessments against classical algorithms and their variants. Moreover, real-world engineering problems are employed as further validation. The results conclusively demonstrate that PKEBA exhibits superior convergence and precision compared to existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Tibetan medical named entity recognition (Tibetan MNER) involves extracting specific types of medical entities from unstructured Tibetan medical texts. Tibetan MNER provide important data support for the work related to Tibetan medicine. However, existing Tibetan MNER methods often struggle to comprehensively capture multi-level semantic information, failing to sufficiently extract multi-granularity features and effectively filter out irrelevant information, which ultimately impacts the accuracy of entity recognition. This paper proposes an improved embedding representation method called syllable–word–sentence embedding. By leveraging features at different granularities and using un-scaled dot-product attention to focus on key features for feature fusion, the syllable–word–sentence embedding is integrated into the transformer, enhancing the specificity and diversity of feature representations. The model leverages multi-level and multi-granularity semantic information, thereby improving the performance of Tibetan MNER. We evaluate our proposed model on datasets from various domains. The results indicate that the model effectively identified three types of entities in the Tibetan news dataset we constructed, achieving an F1 score of 93.59%, which represents an improvement of 1.24% compared to the vanilla FLAT. Additionally, results from the Tibetan medical dataset we developed show that it is effective in identifying five kinds of medical entities, with an F1 score of 71.39%, which is a 1.34% improvement over the vanilla FLAT.},

  abstract     = {Modern automated generation control (AGC) is increasingly complex, requiring precise frequency control for stability and operational accuracy. Traditional PID controller optimisation methods often struggle to handle nonlinearities and meet robustness requirements across diverse operational scenarios. This paper introduces an enhanced strategy using a multi-objective optimisation framework and a modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (SNSGA). The proposed model optimises the PID controller by minimising key performance metrics: integration time squared error (ITSE), integration time absolute error (ITAE), and rate of change of deviation (J). This approach balances convergence rate, overshoot, and oscillation dynamics effectively. A fuzzy-based method is employed to select the most suitable solution from the Pareto set. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the SNSGA-based approach offers superior tuning capabilities over traditional NSGA-II and other advanced control methods. In a two-area thermal power system without reheat, the SNSGA significantly reduces settling times for frequency deviations: 2.94s for and 4.98s for , marking improvements of 31.6% and 13.4% over NSGA-II, respectively.},

In this research study a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model optimised by the genetic algorithm (GA) is addressed. This paper contributes to enhancing age prediction as a regression problem using a union of two CNNs and exchanging knowledge between them. This specifically re-starts the training process from a possibly higher-quality point in different iterations and, consequently, causes potentially yeilds better results at each iteration. The method proposed, which is called cooperative deep neural network (Co-DeepNet), is tested on two types of age prediction problems. Sixteen datasets containing 1899 healthy blood samples and nine datasets containing 2395 diseased blood samples are employed to examine the method's efficiency. As a result, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) is 1.49 and 3.61 years for training and testing data, respectively, when the healthy data is tested. The diseased blood data show MAD results of 3.81 and 5.43 years for training and testing data, respectively. The results of the Co-DeepNet are compared with six other methods proposed in previous studies and a single CNN using four prediction accuracy measurements ( R 2 , MAD, MSE and RMSE). The effectiveness of the Co-DeepNet and superiority of its results is proved through the statistical analysis.},

Extensive experimental results show substantial improvements in translation quality and a significant reduction in hallucination rates. Fine-tuned models achieve higher evaluation metrics compared to baseline models and state-of-the-art models. An ablation study confirms the contributions of each methodological component and highlights the effectiveness of the refined CD algorithm and advanced models in mitigating hallucinations.

CD-GAD classifies anomalies as unique or common based on their presence in both the source and target graphs. However, existing models often fail to fully explore domain-unique knowledge of the target graph for detecting unique anomalies. Additionally, they tend to focus solely on node-level differences, overlooking structural-level differences that provide complementary information for common anomaly detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, Synthetic Graph Anomaly Detection via Graph Transfer and Graph Decouple (GTGD), which effectively detects common and unique anomalies in the target graph. Specifically, our approach ensures deeper learning of domain-unique knowledge by decoupling the reconstruction graphs of common and unique features. Moreover, we simultaneously consider node-level and structural-level differences by transferring node and edge information from the source graph to the target graph, enabling comprehensive domain-common knowledge representation. Anomalies are detected using both common and unique features, with their synthetic score serving as the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving an average performance by 12.6 on the AUC-PR compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

Since recommenders proactively suggest items based on user preference, they are a promising solution for this problem. Travellers visit tourist attractions sequentially by considering multiple attributes at the same time. Therefore, it is desirable to consider this when developing recommenders for tourist attractions. Using GRU4REC, we proposed RNN-based sequence-aware recommenders (RNN-SARs) that use multiple sequence datasets for training the recommended model, named multi-RNN-SARs. We proposed two types of multi-RNN-SARs—concatenate-RNN-SARs and parallel-RNN-SARs. In order to evaluate multi-RNN-SARs, we compared hit rate (HR) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of the item-based collaborative filtering recommender (item-CFR), RNN-SAR with the single-sequence dataset (basic-RNN-SAR), multi-RNN-SARs and the state-of-the-art SARs using a real-world travel dataset. Our research shows that multi-RNN-SARs have significantly higher performances compared to item-CFR. Not all multi-RNN-SARs outperform basic-RNN-SAR but the best multi-RNN-SAR achieves comparable performance to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms. These results highlight the importance of using multiple sequence datasets in RNN-SARs and the importance of choosing appropriate sequence datasets and learning methods for implementing multi-RNN-SARs in practice.},

The fundamental challenges for traffic prediction lie in the accurate modelling of spatial and temporal traffic dynamics. Existing approaches mainly focus on modelling the traffic data itself, but do not explore the traffic correlations implicit in origin-destination (OD) data. In this paper, we propose STOD-Net, a dynamic spatial-temporal OD feature-enhanced deep network, to simultaneously predict the in-traffic and out-traffic for each and every region of a city. We model the OD data as dynamic graphs and adopt graph neural networks in STOD-Net to learn a low-dimensional representation for each region. As per the region feature, we design a gating mechanism and operate it on the traffic feature learning to explicitly capture spatial correlations. To further capture the complicated spatial and temporal dependencies among different regions, we propose a novel joint feature, learning block in STOD-Net and transfer the hybrid OD features to each block to make the learning process spatiotemporal-aware. We evaluate the effectiveness of STOD-Net on two benchmark datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art by approximately 5% in terms of prediction accuracy and considerably improves prediction stability up to 80% in terms of standard deviation.},

  abstract     = {Referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to locate a specific region in an image described by a natural language. Existing two-stage methods generate multiple candidate proposals in the first stage, followed by selecting one of these proposals as the grounding result in the second stage. Nevertheless, the number of candidate proposals generated in the first stage significantly exceeds ground truth and the recall of critical objects is inadequate, thereby enormously limiting the overall network performance. To address the above issues, the authors propose an innovative method termed Separate Non-Maximum Suppression (Sep-NMS) for two-stage REC. Particularly, Sep-NMS models information from the two stages independently and collaboratively, ultimately achieving an overall improvement in comprehension and identification of the target objects. Specifically, the authors propose a Ref-Relatedness module for filtering referent proposals rigorously, decreasing the redundancy of referent proposals. A Relatedness module based on robust multimodal pre-trained encoders is built to precisely assess the relevance between language and proposals to improve the recall of critical objects. It is worth mentioning that the authors are the pioneers in utilising a multimodal pre-training model for proposal filtering in the first stage. Moreover, an Information Fusion module is designed to effectively amalgamate the multimodal information across two stages, ensuring maximum utilisation of the available information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the approach achieves competitive performance with previous state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Although the image dehazing problem has received considerable attention over recent years, the existing models often prioritise performance at the expense of complexity, making them unsuitable for real-world applications, which require algorithms to be deployed on resource constrained-devices. To address this challenge, we propose WaveLiteDehaze-Network (WLD-Net), an end-to-end dehazing model that delivers performance comparable to complex models while operating in real time and using significantly fewer parameters. This approach capitalises on the insight that haze predominantly affects low-frequency information. By exclusively processing the image in the frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), we segregate the image into high and low frequencies and process them separately. This allows us to preserve high-frequency details and recover low-frequency components affected by haze, distinguishing our method from existing approaches that use spatial domain processing as the backbone, with DWT serving as an auxiliary component. DWT is applied at multiple levels for better information retention while also accelerating computation by downsampling feature maps. Subsequently, a learning-based fusion mechanism reintegrates the processed frequencies to reconstruct the dehazed image. Experiments show that WLD-Net outperforms other low-parameter models on real-world hazy images and rivals much larger models, achieving the highest PSNR and SSIM scores on the O-Haze dataset. Qualitatively, the proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in handling a diverse range of haze types, delivering visually pleasing results and robust performance, while also generalising well across different scenarios. With only 0.385 million parameters (more than 100 times smaller than comparable dehazing methods), WLD-Net processes 1024 × 1024 images in just 0.045 s, highlighting its applicability across various real-world scenarios.

  abstract     = {Early exiting has shown significant potential in accelerating the inference of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by allowing easy samples to exit from shallow layers. However, existing early exiting methods primarily rely on local information from individual samples to estimate prediction uncertainty for making exiting decisions, overlooking the global information provided by the sample population. This impacts the estimation of prediction uncertainty, compromising the reliability of exiting decisions. To remedy this, inspired by principal component analysis (PCA), the authors define a residual score to capture the deviation of features from the principal space of the sample population, providing a global perspective for estimating prediction uncertainty. Building on this, a two-stage exiting strategy is proposed that integrates global information from residual scores with local information from energy scores at both the decision and feature levels. This strategy incorporates three-way decisions to enable more reliable exiting decisions for boundary region samples by delaying judgement. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark validate that the method achieves an average speed-up ratio of 2.17× across all tasks with minimal performance degradation. Additionally, it surpasses the state-of-the-art E-LANG by in model acceleration, along with a performance improvement of 0.6 points, demonstrating a better performance-efficiency trade-off.},

  abstract     = {The goal of point cloud completion is to reconstruct raw scanned point clouds acquired from incomplete observations due to occlusion and restricted viewpoints. Numerous methods use a partial-to-complete framework, directly predicting missing components via global characteristics extracted from incomplete inputs. However, this makes detail recovery challenging, as global characteristics fail to provide complete missing component specifics. A new point cloud completion method named Point-PC is proposed. A memory network and a causal inference model are separately designed to introduce shape priors and select absent shape information as supplementary geometric factors for aiding completion. Concretely, a memory mechanism is proposed to store complete shape features and their associated shapes in a key-value format. The authors design a pre-training strategy that uses contrastive learning to map incomplete shape features into the complete shape feature domain, enabling retrieval of analogous shapes from incomplete inputs. In addition, the authors employ backdoor adjustment to eliminate confounders, which are shape prior components sharing identical semantic structures with incomplete inputs. Experiments conducted on three datasets show that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to improve anomaly detection techniques, particularly in the context of high-dimensional, distributed clinical data. Analysing patient data within clinical settings reveals a pronounced focus on refining diagnostic accuracy, personalising treatment plans, and optimising resource allocation to enhance clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, this domain faces unique challenges, such as irregular data collection, inconsistent data quality, and patient-specific structural variations. This paper proposed a novel hybrid approach that integrates heuristic and stochastic methods for anomaly detection in patient clinical data to address these challenges. The strategy combines HPO-based optimal Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise for clustering patient exercise data, facilitating efficient anomaly identification. Subsequently, a stochastic method based on the Interquartile Range filters unreliable data points, ensuring that medical tools and professionals receive only the most pertinent and accurate information. The primary objective of this study is to equip healthcare professionals and researchers with a robust tool for managing extensive, high-dimensional clinical datasets, enabling effective isolation and removal of aberrant data points. Furthermore, a sophisticated regression model has been developed using Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to assess the impact of the ensemble abnormal pattern detection approach. Various statistical error estimation techniques validate the efficacy of the hybrid approach alongside AutoML. Experimental results show that implementing this innovative hybrid model on patient rehabilitation data leads to a notable enhancement in AutoML performance, with an average improvement of 0.041 in the score, surpassing the effectiveness of traditional regression models.},

To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an Attention-Driven GAN-UNet framework that integrates U-Net with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and a Channel-Spatial Attention Module (CSAM). This innovative approach enhances segmentation accuracy and focus mapping by directing the network's attention to clinically relevant regions. Trained on the BraTS 2020 dataset, our method surpasses traditional techniques, achieving a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.99. The proposed framework visualizes intricate tumor morphologies, reduces false positives, and offers robust computational efficiency, making AttnGAN-UNet a promising tool for clinical brain tumor segmentation and analysis.},

In this context, this paper proposes a right decoupled composite manifold for visual-inertial sliding-window iterative optimization compared with other manifolds including chained translation and rotation , special Euclidean group , and extended pose concerning the orientation, position, and velocity estimation. Furthermore, the inertial measurement unit (IMU) dynamics is propagated through extended pose with half rotation to maintain the accuracy of IMU preintegration. Moreover, to enhance robustness, a robustified Cauchy loss function is employed. The proposed method is evaluated with simulation and experiments on static and more challenging dynamic environments, considering its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Additionally, all necessary Jacobians for visual reprojection residuals and IMU preintegration residuals are provided in analytical form with numerical verification.},

The proposed framework selects the five best-performing pre-trained models, namely, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, VGG16, VGG19, and DenseNet201, as the base-learners and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) as a meta-learner. To ensure broader applicability, we curated a dataset of chest X-ray images of Lung Disease. Initially, we choose the ten transfer learning models, fine-tune them to extract features relevant to respiratory diseases on the dataset, and select Top-5 best-performing models as base-learners. The effectiveness of the framework is determined by analysis of precision, recall, F1-score, or the area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve.

  abstract     = {Despite high predictive performance, machine learning models can be unfair towards specific demographic subgroups characterized by sensitive attributes such as gender or race. This paper presents a novel approach using Computational Profile Likelihood (CPL) to assess potential bias in neural network decisions with respect to sensitive attributes. CPL estimates the conditional probability of a network's internal neuron excitation levels during predictions. To assess the impact of sensitive attributes on predictions, the CPL distribution of individuals sharing a particular value of a sensitive attribute and a specific outcome (e.g., “women” and “high income”) is compared to a subgroup sharing another value of the sensitive attribute but with the same outcome (e.g., “men” and “high income”). The resulting disparities between distributions can be used to quantify the bias with respect to the sensitive attribute and the outcome class. We also assess the efficacy of bias reduction techniques through their influence on the resulting disparities. Experimental results on three widely used datasets indicate that the CPL of the trained models can be used to characterize significant differences between multiple protected groups, highlighting that these models display quantifiable biases. Furthermore, after applying bias mitigation methods, the gaps in CPL distributions are reduced, indicating a more similar internal representation for profiles of different protected groups.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, automated intelligent systems play an increasingly vital role in aiding decision-making processes across various fields. Firefighting represents a crucial area where accurate information gathering is paramount for efficient resource allocation. Social media platforms as Twitter (or X) have emerged as valuable sources of real-time data, often referred to as ‘citizen science’, offering additional insights alongside traditional data sources. In this work, we introduce a novel pipeline that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Twitter data, utilising transformer models to identify and monitor wildfire incidents. Expanding on this approach, we incorporate sentiment analysis to provide deeper insights into public perceptions and emotions related to fire events. Additionally, we present visual representations of geographic data through heat mapping, potentially aiding firefighters in making informed decisions. By integrating advanced NLP techniques with social media data, our approach presents a promising strategy for enhancing wildfire management efforts.},

  abstract     = {The growing availability of conversational data across multiple platforms has intensified interest in dynamic emotion recognition. Speech plays a pivotal role in shaping the emotional climate (EC) of peer conversations. We propose DeepBispec, the first framework to integrate deep bispectral image analysis with affect dynamics (AD) for speech-based EC recognition. Bispectrum representations capture nonlinear and non-Gaussian speech characteristics, while AD descriptors model temporal emotion fluctuations. Evaluated on K-EmoCon, IEMOCAP and SEWA datasets, DeepBispec consistently improved EC classification performance. For example, on K-EmoCon, arousal accuracy increased from 79.0% (bispectrum only) to 81.4% (with AD), while valence accuracy improved from 76.8% to 77.5%; similar trends were observed for IEMOCAP and SEWA. DeepBispec outperformed strong CNN, LSTM, and Transformer baselines, demonstrating robust cross-lingual performance across seven languages. These findings highlight its potential for real-world applications such as mental health monitoring, affect-aware learning platforms and empathetic dialogue systems.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) represents a significant advancement in decentralised machine learning, offering a solution to the privacy concerns associated with traditional centralised approaches. However, a critical limitation of FL arises in the presence of Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data, which is common in real-world scenarios. Traditional FL algorithms, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), tend to underperform when faced with data heterogeneity across participating clients. To address this challenge, we propose CalibSNN, a method that combines calibration re-sampling with Soft Nearest Neighbour (SNN) loss to mitigate the bias and variance introduced by uneven data distributions. Calibration aligns local data distributions with global statistics, while SNN loss improves feature representations across heterogeneous clients. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and non-IID conditions, we demonstrate that CalibSNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a robust solution to the challenges of non-IID data in FL.},

  abstract     = {Time-series forecasting is essential for predicting events in the future and for tracking objects. The conventional recurrent neural network model needs to pad the target with zeros when handling long inputs, resulting in a loss in accuracy. Recently, it was proposed to divide a time series input into patches and merge the learned weights. However, such a model is difficult to interpret. In this article, we consider a mixture of continuous and discrete Markov states to model long-range time dependencies. For example, in a vehicle, each gear level can be a discrete state and the throttle input is continuously controlled to maximise the efficiency of the engine. Data collected from the sensor is prone to noise due to component faults or external disturbances. Hence, we apply a stability constraint to select samples for training. We validate our algorithm on three datasets: (1) Apple Watch, (2) Car engine and (3) Election tweets. On all datasets, we achieve an improvement in the range of 5%–20% in the F-measure. Furthermore, the features learned are easy to explain in terms of real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In various fields, including environmental monitoring, communication, surveillance, and disaster response, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly essential. Autonomous multi-UAV wireless networks (MUWNs), where multiple UAVs work together, offer powerful solutions in these fields. However, making these networks fully autonomous is challenging, especially concerning real-time decision-making, coordination, and resource management. In the field of literature, there is a demand for a comprehensive survey of recent developments in Q-learning (QL) and deep Q-learning (DQL) within MUWNs. To address this gap, we provide a thorough evaluation of QL and DQL approaches, focusing on their application in autonomous MUWNs. We highlight their roles in route planning, communication relays, and network optimization, discussing advantages and limitations. The survey also explores key challenges, including scalability, energy efficiency, and real-time adaptability, and reviews how QL/DQL enhancements address them. In particular, this paper provides an overview of some QL and DQL applications in MUWNs, such as data retrieval, monitoring, aggregation, resource allocation, and task scheduling to support wireless connectivity, UAV-assisted autonomous trajectory planning, navigation, security, and jamming avoidance. The use of these technologies enables the effective use of UAVs in smart cities, monitoring of industrial complexes, agricultural surveys, and border security. Additionally, using the knowledge gathered from our review, we identify and discuss several open challenges.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce Traversal Learning (TL), a novel approach designed to address the problem of decreased quality encountered in popular distributed learning (DL) paradigms such as Federated Learning (FL), Split Learning (SL) and SplitFed Learning (SFL). Traditional FL often suffers an accuracy drop during aggregation due to its averaging function, while SL and SFL face increased loss due to the independent gradient updates on each split network. TL adopts a unique strategy where the model traverses the nodes during forward propagation (FP) and performs backward propagation (BP) at the orchestrator, effectively implementing centralised learning (CL) principles within a distributed environment. The orchestrator is tasked with generating virtual batches and planning the model's sequential node visits during FP, aligning them with the ordered index of the data within these batches. We conducted experiments on six datasets representing diverse characteristics across various domains. Our evaluation demonstrates that TL is on par with classic CL approaches in terms of accurate inference, thereby offering a viable and robust solution for DL tasks. TL outperformed other DL methods and improved accuracy by 7.85% for independent and identically distributed (IID) datasets, macro F1-score by 1.06% for non-IID datasets, accuracy by 2.05% for text classification and AUC by 1.41% and 2.82% for medical and financial datasets, respectively. By effectively preserving data privacy while maintaining performance, TL represents a significant advancement in DL methodologies.},

We discuss the various architectures used in sentiment analysis, review existing datasets and highlight shared tasks that facilitate model evaluation. The review also addresses the challenges specific to this domain, such as the interpretation of humour and sarcasm, which add complexity to sentiment analysis in the context of memes. A key focus of this review is the need for novel datasets that better capture the unique nature of memes, particularly those that blend text and images with cultural and emotional nuances. Existing benchmark datasets often fall short in representing the diversity of meme formats and regional variations, highlighting the necessity for more comprehensive datasets. Looking forward, we anticipate advancements in analytical methodologies and the development of such specialised datasets, which would significantly enhance the accuracy and depth of sentiment analysis models. This review serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested in advancing the study of sentiment analysis in the evolving field of memes.},

However, existing active DA methods often struggle in real-world scenarios where, due to data privacy concerns, only a pre-trained source model is available, rather than the source samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called the structure-based uncertainty estimation model (SUEM) for source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA). To be specific, we introduce an innovative active sample selection strategy that combines both uncertainty and diversity sampling to identify the most informative samples. We assess the uncertainty in target samples using structure-wise probabilities and implement a diversity selection method to minimise redundancy. For the selected samples, we not only apply standard-supervised loss but also conduct interpolation consistency training to further explore the structural information of the target domain. Extensive experiments across four widely used datasets demonstrate that our method is comparable to or outperforms current UDA and active DA methods.},

  abstract     = {Skeleton-based action recognition using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) has achieved remarkable performance, but recognising ambiguous actions, such as ‘waving’ and ‘saluting’, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on a serial combination of GCNs and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), where spatial and temporal features are extracted independently, leading to an unbalanced spatial-temporal information, which hinders accurate action recognition. Moreover, existing methods for ambiguous actions often overemphasise local details, resulting in the loss of crucial global context, which further complicates the task of differentiating ambiguous actions. To address these challenges, the authors propose a lightweight plug-and-play module called Synchronised and Fine-grained Head (SF-Head), inserted between GCN and TCN layers. SF-Head first conducts Synchronised Spatial-Temporal Extraction (SSTE) with a Feature Redundancy Loss (F-RL), ensuring a balanced interaction between the two types of features. It then performs Adaptive Cross-dimensional Feature Aggregation (AC-FA), with a Feature Consistency Loss (F-CL), which aligns the aggregated feature with their original spatial-temporal feature. This aggregation step effectively combines both global context and local details, enhancing the model's ability to classify ambiguous actions. Experimental results on NTU RGB + D 60, NTU RGB + D 120, NW-UCLA and PKU-MMD I datasets demonstrate significant improvements in distinguishing ambiguous actions.

  abstract     = {In the field of oncology, lung cancer is a leading contributor to cancer-related mortality, highlighting the need for early detection of lung nodules for effective intervention. However, accurate segmentation of lung nodules in Computed Tomography (CT) images remains a significant challenge due to issues such as heterogeneous nodule dimensions, low contrast, and their visual similarity with surrounding tissues. To address these challenges, this study proposes the Edge-Enhanced Feature Pyramid SwinUNet (EE-FPS-UNet), an advanced segmentation model that integrates a modified Swin Transformer with a feature pyramid network (FPN). The research objective is to enhance boundary delineation and multi-scale feature aggregation for improved segmentation performance. The proposed model uses the Swin Transformer to capture long-range dependencies and integrates an FPN for robust multi-scale feature aggregation. Its window-based self-attention mechanism also reduces computational complexity, making it well-suited for high-resolution CT images. Additionally, an edge detection module enhances segmentation by providing edge-related features to the decoder, improving boundary precision. A comparative analysis evaluates the EE-FPS-UNet against leading models, including PSPNet, U-Net, Attention U-Net, and DeepLabV3. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms these models, achieving a Dice Similarity of 0.91 and a sensitivity of 0.89, establishing its efficacy for lung nodule segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Accurate point correspondences is critical for rigid point cloud registration in correspondence-based methods. Many previous learning-based methods employ encoder-decoder backbone for point feature extraction, while applying attention mechanism for sparse superpoints to deal with the partial overlap situation. However, few of these methods focus on the intermediate layers yet mainly pay attention on the top-most patch features, thus neglecting multi-faceted feature perspectives leading to potential overlap areas estimation inaccuracy. Meanwhile, obtaining correct correspondences is usually interfered with the one-to-many case and outliers. To address these issues, we propose a multi-level features extraction network with integrating linear dual attention mechanism into skip-connection stage of encoder-decoder backbone, both efficiently suppressing irrelevant information and guiding residual features to learn the common regions on which the network should focus to tackle the overlap estimation inaccuracy issue, combined with a parallel-structured decoder forming distinguishable features and potential overlapping regions. Additionally, a two-stage correspondences pruning process is designed to tackle the mismatch issue, which mainly depends on the rigid geometric constraint. Extensive experiments conducted on indoor and outdoor scene datasets demonstrate our method's accuracy and stability, by outperforming state-of-the-art methods on registration recall.},

Therefore, precise segmentation of lesions has become an essential prerequisite for patient condition assessment and formulation of treatment plans. Significant achievements have been made in research related to the U-Net model in recent years. It improves segmentation performance and is extensively applied in the semantic segmentation of medical images to offer technical support for consistent quantitative lesion analysis methods. First, this paper classifies medical image datasets on the basis of their imaging modalities and then examines U-Net and its various improvement models from the perspective of structural modifications. The research objectives, innovative designs, and limitations of each approach are discussed in detail. Second, we summarise the four central improvement mechanisms of the U-Net and U-Net variant algorithms: the jump-connection mechanism, the residual-connection mechanism, 3D-UNet, and the transformer mechanism. Finally, we examine the relationships among the four core enhancement mechanisms and commonly utilized medical datasets and propose potential avenues and strategies for future advancements. This paper provides a systematic summary and reference for researchers in related fields, and we look forward to designing more efficient and stable medical image segmentation network models based on the U-Net network.},

  abstract     = {The extensive coverage of satellite constellations has rendered the satellite–terrestrial integrated network (STIN) a pivotal solution for communication and computation services in internet of vehicles (IoVs) rescuing in remote or disaster areas with limited terrestrial networks. To optimise network resource utilisation and service quality, the integration of the service function chain (SFC) into STIN-enabled IoV rescuing systems has become essential. However, traditional SFC-based STIN systems encounter challenges in flow scheduling flexibility, stemming from the sequential execution of subtasks on satellites equipped with virtual network functions (VNFs). This leads to a trade-off between data volume reduction and the additional communication and computation energy costs incurred in the orbit. To address this issue, this paper introduces a space ground collaborative SFC (SGC-SFC) flow scheduling strategy. This strategy enables the execution of subtasks on either VNF-equipped satellites or the ground vehicle formation, contingent on network conditions. Firstly, we carry out a computation–space–time graph (CSTG) model specifically for the STIN-enabled IoV rescuing system with SFC. This model integrates the computational layer into the space–time graph (STG), accurately capturing the data volume reduction characteristics and sequential execution constraints of SFC in the STIN-enabled IoV rescuing system. Secondly, a SGC-SFC flow scheduling algorithm is designed to identify a set of feasible paths with minimal energy cost and maximum processable data volume. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed SGC-SFC under diverse conditions.},

The original 3D governing equation is split into a collection of 2D forms by the dimensional splitting method (DSM), and the discrete equation of the 2D problem is derived via the ICVEFG method. The splitting direction is then treated by using the finite element method (FEM), while the time-dependent term in the governing equation is handled by the finite difference method (FDM). Finally, the numerical solution formula is obtained. To verify the accuracy of the CVDCM, the ratio of the L 2 norm to the true value is used as the relative error. The convergence of the proposed method is demonstrated by increasing the number of nodes and meshes. Five numerical examples of transient inhomogeneous heat conduction problems with spatially varying material properties (density, specific heat capacity, and thermal conductivity) are solved using the CVDCM; the results show that the proposed method achieves good convergence and achieves higher accuracy compared to the dimension coupling method (DCM) and the improved element-free Galerkin (IEFG) method in five examples.},

Common topology optimization methods, such as density-based methods and level set methods, focus on global variable optimization. These global optimization approaches often consume substantial computational resources and are not suitable for parallel optimization. In contrast, structures in nature evolve from a combination of numerous local optimization problems, where each cell unit adjusts on the basis of its perception of the surrounding environment, leading to the formation of biological structures. This paper proposes a novel heuristic topology optimization method, the biomimetic moving-mesh (BMM) method, inspired by biological cell growth and evolution. The BMM method uses the positions of mesh nodes as variables to simulate cellular expansion and contraction, thereby creating a new optimization approach. Compared with traditional topology optimization methods, the BMM method offers smoother meshes and is more suitable for handling large-scale parallel optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {The classical material point method (MPM) is particularly suitable for large deformation problems with surface contact, but its capability to capture size effects remains relatively limited. In order to capture the size effect widely observed in solid materials as well as to eliminate mesh dependency, we present an F-bar B-spline MPM for solving finite strain-gradient plasticity in the micromorphic approach. A multiplicative finite strain thermoplasticity model is first regularized in a micromorphic approach, where a global internal variable is introduced to take into account the size effect. An implicit B-spline MPM is developed to solve the coupled problem in a monolithic manner with consistent linearization. This implementation provides a general framework to incorporate phenomenological elasto-plasticity models while preserving the prescribed size effect in the MPM. Although B-spline basis function is effective in suppressing the volumetric-locking deformation pattern when volume-preserving plasticity model is used, severe stress oscillation may manifest when the deformation mode approaches the incompressible limit. Therefore, we propose an F-bar method for the implicit B-spline MPM to suppress the spurious stress oscillation. The exact linearization of the F-bar method and its coupling with the balance equation of micromorphic momentum are derived in closed form. Three representative numerical examples are presented to validate our implementation and demonstrate the advantages of our method. Results show that the proposed method is effective in capturing the size effect at extreme conditions with large distortion and contact, and the F-bar method suppresses the spurious stress oscillations associated with volume-preserving plastic flow. One limitation is that the convergence behavior is less satisfactory when strain-softening model is used due to the inherent limitation of the implicit MPM.},

  abstract     = {Focusing on the homogenization of periodic composite materials, this study investigates computational methods based on volume integral equations. Such formulations are revisited from the standpoint of the preconditioning of the original cell problem by the introduction of a comparison material. This allows for to recovery of simple convergence criteria for iterative steepest-descent and fixed-point schemes for composites with general non-linear behaviour. In the case of linear materials, the preconditioned volume integral formulation coincides with the well-known Lippmann–Schwinger equation. The spectral properties of the featured linear integral operator, which is bounded and self-adjoint, are investigated to shed light on the behaviour of conventional computational homogenization methods. The so-called Lippmann–Schwinger spectrum is analyzed, with its bounds governing the convergence rate of iterative solution methods. The associated eigenvectors, which constitute the eigenstates of the composite material considered, are also described in detail to understand their role in constructing the solution to the cell problem and ultimately in computing the effective properties. Formulated in the continuous setting, this analysis is followed by the investigation of a discrete representation of the integral operator considered. A number of examples on synthetic microstructures are finally considered in the conductivity setting to illustrate the obtained theoretical results and highlight the role of the spectral properties in the operation of computational homogenization methods. This paves the way for the development of reduced models and more efficient computations.},

  abstract     = {Statistical depth is the act of gauging how representative a point is compared with a reference probability measure. The depth allows introducing rankings and orderings to data living in multivariate, or function spaces. Though widely applied and with much experimental success, little theoretical progress has been made in analysing functional depths. This article highlights how the common h -depth and related depths from functional data analysis can be viewed as a kernel mean embedding, widely used in statistical machine learning. This facilitates answers to several open questions regarding the statistical properties of functional depths. We show that (i) h -depth has the interpretation of a kernel-based method; (ii) several h -depths possess explicit expressions, without the need to estimate them using Monte Carlo procedures; (iii) under minimal assumptions, -depths and their maximisers are uniformly strongly consistent and asymptotically Gaussian (also in infinite-dimensional spaces and for imperfectly observed functional data); and (iv) several -depths uniquely characterise probability distributions in separable Hilbert spaces. In addition, we also provide a link between the depth and empirical characteristic function based procedures for functional data. Finally, the unveiled connections enable to design an extension of the -depth towards regression problems.},

It shows that the emerging best practice relies heavily on the approach and tools created by the original authors of the causal forest such as their grf package and the approaches given by them in examples. Generally, researchers use the causal forest on a relatively low-dimensional dataset relying on observed controls or in some cases experiments to identify effects. There are several common ways to then communicate results–by mapping out the univariate distribution of individual-level treatment effect estimates, displaying variable importance results for the forest and graphing the distribution of treatment effects across covariates that are important either for theoretical reasons or because they have high variable importance. Some deviations from this common practice are interesting and deserve further development and use. Others are unnecessary or even harmful. The paper concludes by reflecting on the emerging best practice for causal forest use and paths for future research.},

To handle the mixture of continuous and discrete data, we use Wasserstein distance as a new marginal utility to measure the difference between the joint distribution and the product of marginal distributions. In theory, we establish the sure screening property under less restrictive assumptions on data types. The proposed procedure does not require model specification, gives a more effective geometric measure to compare the discrepancy between distributions and avoids introducing biases caused by the choice of slicing rules for continuous data. Numerical comparison indicates that the proposed Wasserstein-SIS method performs better than existing methods in various models. A real data application also validates the better practicability of Wasserstein-SIS.},

To address this gap, we review a family of chance-corrected IRA statistics for two-rater dichotomous-response cases, a fundamental setting that not only serves as the theoretical foundation for categorical-response or multirater IRA methods but is also practically dominant in most empirical studies, and we propose a novel data-generating framework to simulate correlated decision processes between raters. Subsequently, a new estimand, which calibrates the ‘true’ chance-corrected IRA, is introduced while accounting for the potential ‘probabilistic certainty’. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the reviewed IRA methods under various practical scenarios and were summarised by an agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis. Finally, we provide recommendations for selecting appropriate IRA statistics based on outcome prevalence and rater characteristics and highlight the need for further advancements in IRA estimation methodologies.},

  abstract     = {The bonding in transition metal carbonyls is discussed through the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson (DCD) model of σ -donation from the ligand and π -back donation from the metal. However, there are no reports of direct quantification of the donation and back donation. Whenever it comes to the aspect of electron transfer, the fundamental concepts that are important are ionization energy ( I ), electron affinity ( A ), electronegativity ( χ ), hardness ( η ), and electrophilicity ( ω ). The global reactivity indices are calculated using conceptual density functional theory (CDFT). It was found that the back bonding and hence the experimental CO stretching frequency provide excellent correlation with I , A , and χ with r 2 values of 0.963, 0.903, and 0.965, respectively. While in correlation to η , two categories are developed in correlation to ν CO . However, the best correlation is achieved from the local electrophilicity description of the multiphilic descriptor (Δ ω M ). Finally, the directional approach of the back donation is tackled by the extended transition state-natural orbitals for chemical valence (ETS-NOCV) method, considering CO as one fragment and the rest as the other. A very good correlation to ν CO is found with r 2 = 0.964. The back-bonding aspect is also explained from the second-order perturbation energy term as obtained from the natural bond orbital analysis. These correlations remain valid upon changing the functional and basis sets. In addition, considering Sc(CO) as the starting complex, hydrogen molecules are added to obtain Sc(CO)(H 2 ) n ( n = 1–5) complexes. In these complexes, the Kubas-type interactions are studied employing ETS-NOCV and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analyses.},

  abstract     = {Hexapeptides are increasingly applied as model systems for studying the amyloidogenic properties of oligo- and polypeptides. It is possible to construct 64 million different hexapeptides from the twenty proteinogenic amino acid residues. Today's experimental amyloid databases contain only a fraction of these annotated hexapeptides. For labeling all the possible hexapeptides as “amyloidogenic” or “non-amyloidogenic” there exist several computational predictors with good accuracy. It may be of interest to define and study a simple graph structure on the 64 million hexapeptides as nodes, when two hexapeptides are connected by an edge if they differ by only a single residue. For example, in this graph, HIKKLM is connected to AIKKLM, or HIKKNM, or HIKKLC, but it is not connected with an edge to VVKKLM or HIKNPM. In the present contribution, we consider our previously published artificial intelligence-based tool, the Budapest Amyloid Predictor (BAP for short), and demonstrate a spectacular property of this predictor in the graph defined above. We show that for any two hexapeptides predicted to be “amyloidogenic” by the BAP predictor, there exists an easily constructible path of length at most six that passes through neighboring hexapeptides all predicted to be “amyloidogenic” by BAP. For example, the predicted amyloidogenic ILVWIW and FWLCYL hexapeptides can be connected through the length-6 path ILVWIW-IWVWIW-IWVCIW-IWVCIL-FWVCIL-FWLCIL-FWLCYL in such a way that the neighbors differ in exactly one residue, and all hexapeptides on the path are predicted to be amyloidogenic by BAP. The symmetric statement also holds true for non-amyloidogenic predicted hexapeptides: For any such pair, there exists a path of length at most six, traversing only predicted non-amyloidogenic hexapeptides. It is noted that the mentioned property of the Budapest Amyloid Predictor https://pitgroup.org/bap is not proprietary; it is also true for any linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based predictors; therefore, for any future improvements of BAP using the linear SVM prediction technique.},

However, current technologies often suffer from limited cost-efficiency, sensitivity, and real-world applicability. While traditional carbon allotropes such as graphene, fullerenes, and carbon nanotubes have been explored for explosive sensing and hazard mitigation, emerging sp -hybridized carbon nanostructures like cyclo[ n ]carbons remain underexplored. In this article, we present a theoretical investigation of cyclo[16]carbon (C 16 ), a novel sp -hybridized carbon ring, for interaction with energetic molecules. TNT was selected as a benchmark explosive due to its widespread use, whereas TATB was chosen for its remarkable insensitivity, allowing us to explore safe handling and adsorption scenarios. Our results reveal the formation of stable hollow-layered and sandwich-type supramolecular complexes with TNT and TATB via non-covalent C…O, C…N, and C…C interactions. Notably, the C 16 –TNT and C 16 –TATB complexes exhibit enhanced thermodynamic stability and reduced electrostatic sensitivity. Binding energy and electronic structure analyses indicate tunable optical properties, supporting the role of C 16 as a metal-free, spectroscopically active sensor. These findings underscore the dual functionality of cyclo[16]carbon in promoting safe handling and detection of high-energy materials, positioning it as a promising platform for passive sensing and hazard mitigation in challenging environments.},

We study misinformation diffusion between the decentralized and the centralized platforms and identify three decentralized governance mechanisms to mitigate the spread of misinformation in decentralized networks: user flagging, user article ratings, and user reputation. Our empirical experiments using agent-based simulations leveraging real-world data from two platforms reveal two findings. First, comparing misinformation diffusion between the decentralized Steemit and the centralized Pokec platforms suggests that in the absence of any mitigation mechanisms, misinformation in decentralized platforms affects more users, at faster rates, and reaches shorter distance from the misinformation initiating user. Second, within the decentralized platforms, misinformation affects fewer users, at slower rates, and reaches shorter distance from the misinformation initiating user in the presence of mitigating mechanisms than in their absence. We discuss the implications of these results both for the understanding of misinformation diffusion and for the governance of decentralized social network platforms.},

  abstract     = {We examine the impact of vampire attack, a unique platform entry strategy in the blockchain ecosystem, on the operational performance of the incumbent platform. During the vampire attack period, the entrant (attacker) clones the incumbent platform and offers tokenized incentives to entice users away from the incumbent. Prior studies offer little insight into the impact of vampire attack strategy because of its uniqueness in platform cloning, tokenized incentives, and targeted attacks. We implement a quasi-experimental design by leveraging the first and most famous vampire attack launched by SushiSwap (the attacker) against Uniswap (the incumbent). We examine both the deposit-side and exchange-side impacts of the vampire attack on the operational performance of the liquidity pools on Uniswap. Surprisingly, we find that the vampire attack has no significant effect on the liquidity provision on the deposit side. Even more surprisingly, the vampire attack significantly increases the incumbent's trading volume on the exchange side. We further uncover the underlying mechanisms contributing to these intriguing results. We also demonstrate the efficacy of the novel tokenized incentives strategy. We show the generalizability of our findings by examining an alternative vampire attack event in the context of non-fungible token marketplaces. Our study offers significant contributions to the literature on the implications of blockchain on platform operations and platform competition in operations management.},

  abstract     = {In the burgeoning marketplaces of digital assets, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) revolutionize digital asset ownership and intellectual property (IP) protection, but high minting costs create barriers to marketplace entry and growth. This study examines the impact of “lazy minting,” a new NFT production method introduced by major NFT marketplaces to lower minting costs by deferring blockchain certification until the first sale. In response to the call for further research on emerging technologies in operations management, we explore how this policy affects the net sales performance of existing sellers in the NFT marketplaces. Based on transaction cost economics (TCE) and the literature about different IP protection methods, we distinguish between lazy- and regular-minted NFTs by their differential transaction costs and utilize the staggered difference-in-differences (DID) method to conduct our analysis. We find that lazy minting adoption significantly boosts the net sales performance of existing sellers. This is attributed to their cost-adaptive IP protection behavior. Specifically, they achieve this by minting more NFTs with a larger proportion of style-consistent NFTs through lazy minting, while strategically employing regular minting for style-breaking NFTs, which is contingent upon their reputation. Our study has important theoretical and practical implications for operations management under the emerging technological revolution.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain technologies have catalyzed the rise of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which operate in an incentive network fueled by crypto tokens. In essence, these tokens are imbued with either payment rights (i.e., transactional tokens) or ownership rights (i.e., governance tokens). The decentralized organizational paradigm dismantles the traditional management structure and bring new research opportunities to Operations Management (OM). While the performance of DAOs has been largely examined in current OM literature, the effectiveness of their internal incentive mechanisms—specifically the one that uses ownership as rewards to promote user contributions—remains unclear. Focusing on DAO-enabled virtual communities, we seek to examine whether decentralized ownership provides stronger incentives for user behaviors, such as creation and curation, in comparison to traditional monetary rewards through the lens of psychological ownership theory. We obtained data from Steemit that captures the reward, creation, curation and transaction behaviors of 98,000 users from May 2017 to April 2019. By leveraging the “power-up” action as a shock that increases user ownership shares, we established a quasi-experimental setting. Employing the PSM-DID model, we found that the use of governance tokens is associated with enhanced creation and curation efforts but declined creation novelty, compared to the use of transactional tokens. Our additional analyses further reveal that the incentive effects of governance tokens diminish over time. However, upon the recurrence of the intended choice, these effects become reinforced. Notably, we find that governance token ownership is more strongly associated with curation efforts for users with weaker social ties. Conversely, for users with high reputation scores, their content creation behaviors are less strongly associated with governance token ownership. This study contributes to the burgeoning discourse on blockchain and cryptocurrency from an operational perspective, providing valuable insights for the design of incentive mechanisms in DAOs and advancing our understanding of operational efficiencies and stakeholder engagement in decentralized structures within Operations Management.},

  abstract     = {This study examines how task assignment mechanisms affect the participation of workers on decentralized blockchains. In developing the theory, I highlight that blockchain represents a distinct organizational form for coordinating operations under a highly decentralized structure, in which the essential tasks of system infrastructure maintenance are assigned to third-party crowd workers through the unique governance mechanism of consensus protocol. I specifically focus on two widely adopted consensus protocols in the context of cryptocurrency, namely, proof-of-work (PoW), which assigns tasks that sustain the blockchain system operation based on workers' investments in computing power, and proof-of-stake (PoS), which assigns these tasks based on workers' investments in the native cryptocurrency as stakes. I argue that compared with PoW, PoS increases worker participation and task decentralization because the investment requirement of task participation in the form of blockchain native assets reduces workers' transaction costs in task contracting and their tendencies for hyper-competition. My empirical analysis leverages a natural experiment on Ethereum, namely, the “Merge” event on September 15, 2022, in which the blockchain changed the assignment rules by switching the consensus protocol from PoW to PoS. The results under a difference-in-differences research design confirm my arguments.},

  abstract     = {Smart contracts, enabled by blockchain technology, are increasingly adopted by firms to automate the execution of agreements or contracts without the involvement of intermediaries. However, it is still unclear how smart contracts may affect firms' operational efficiency. We address this issue empirically by conducting a quasi-natural experiment in the United States in which certain states have enacted relevant laws that increase in-state firms' propensity to adopt and use smart contracts. Our difference-in-differences estimation suggests that compared with out-of-state control firms, in-state treatment firms' operational efficiency increases significantly after the enactment of smart contract laws. Our post hoc analysis further suggests that state-level smart contract laws help increase in-state firms' actual smart contract activities, which in turn lead to operational efficiency improvement. We also find that the operational efficiency improvement varies across firms with different supply chain complexities. While firms with a large number of supply chain partners (i.e., high horizontal complexity) gain more operational efficiency improvement, the improvement becomes less pronounced if firms' supply chain partners are distributed across different countries (i.e., high spatial complexity). Overall, our research not only demonstrates smart contracts' ability to improve operational efficiency but also reveals the critical role of supply chain complexity in affecting the operational efficiency improvement.},

However, their decentralized architecture may conflict with the centralized control exercised by platform sponsors, giving rise to a centralization–decentralization paradox. This study explores how this paradox unfolds in a large, blockchain-based logistics platform that was ultimately discontinued. Through an in-depth, longitudinal case study, we identify three interrelated governance contradictions—regarding ownership, trust, and growth—that triggered destabilizing oscillations between centralized and decentralized governance modes. We introduce the concept of semirigid limits to capture the bounded flexibility within which governance can be made and adapted under such paradoxical conditions. Our findings show that the centralization–decentralization paradox is especially difficult to navigate when strategic boundary conditions—here, industry competition, fragmented coordination, and high interdependencies—are present. Our study contributes to the paradox and governance literature by theorizing how governance contradictions emerge and persist and by identifying the mechanisms that constrain alignment and adaptation. We also offer guidance for managers in regard to addressing the competing demands of centralization and decentralization in interorganizational platforms.},

Why are enterprise blockchain adoptions highly susceptible to failure? In our inductive case study of five technology providers offering blockchain services for operations and supply chains, we examine how founders' power (i.e., expert, prestige, and ownership) shapes management behaviors that build blockchain perceptions and influence stakeholders toward strategic adoption. Our findings reveal that high-performing cases actively seek inspiration beyond the blockchain ecosystem for service designs and adopt a centralized decision-making approach where key strategic decisions are made internally. In contrast, low-performing cases struggle due to within-blockchain exploration and decentralized decision-making, leading to slower implementation and limited scalability. Furthermore, we find that founders' behaviors in blockchain adoption are embraced by firm members through performance evaluation and interactions, shaping organizational practices and culture, ultimately determining the success or failure of blockchain technology providers. This study extends previous research at the intersection of founders' power and blockchain literature by developing propositions about how different sources of founders' power lead to distinct management behaviors, influencing the success or failure of blockchain adoption outcomes.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the field of identifying financial asset price bubbles, particularly through the development of time-series unit-root tests featuring fractionally integrated errors and panel unit-root tests. This study introduces an innovative approach for assessing the sign of the persistence parameter ( α ) within a panel fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, based on the least squares estimator of α . This method incorporates three distinct test statistics based on the Hurst parameter ( H ), which can take values in the range of ( 1 / 2 , 1 ) , be equal to 1 / 2 , or fall within the interval of ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) . The null hypothesis corresponds to α = 0 . Based on a panel of continuous records of observations, the null asymptotic distributions are obtained when the time span ( T ) is fixed and the number of cross sections ( N ) goes to infinity. The power function of the tests is obtained under the local alternative where α is close to zero in the order of 1 / ( T ⁢ N ) . This alternative covers the departure from the unit root hypothesis from the explosive side, enabling the calculation of lower power in bubble tests. The hypothesis testing problem and the local power function are also considered when a panel of discrete-sampled observations is available under a sequential limit, that is, the sampling interval shrinks to zero followed by the N goes to infinity.},

Our statistics can be applied irrespective of whether the historical sample is stationary or not, and indeed without previous knowledge of the regime of the observations before and after the break. In particular, we construct our detectors as the CUSUM process of the quasi-Fisher scores of the log likelihood function. To ensure timely detection, we then construct our boundary function (exceeding which would indicate a break) by including a weighting sequence which is designed to shorten the detection delay in the presence of a changepoint. We consider two types of weights: a lighter set of weights, which ensures timely detection in the presence of changes occurring “early, but not too early” after the end of the historical sample; and a heavier set of weights, called “Rényi weights” which is designed to ensure timely detection in the presence of changepoints occurring very early in the monitoring horizon. In both cases, we derive the limiting distribution of the detection delays, indicating the expected delay for each set of weights. Our methodologies can be applied for a general analysis of changepoints in GARCH(1,1) sequences; however, they can also be applied to detect changes from stationarity to explosivity or vice versa, thus allowing to check for “volatility bubbles”, upon applying tests for stationarity before and after the identified break. Our theoretical results are validated via a comprehensive set of simulations, and an empirical application to daily returns of individual stocks.},

In particular, the test uses both path-level deviations and growth rates to assess the presence of a bubble of a given duration and size, at any moment in time. We show that the distribution of the test statistic can be either analytically determined or numerically approximated, depending on the error distribution. Size and power properties of the test are analyzed in controlled Monte Carlo experiments. An empirical application is presented for a monthly oil price index. It demonstrates the ability of the test to detect bubbles and to provide valuable insights in terms of risk assessments in the spirit of Value-at-Risk.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and monitoring financial bubbles is critical, as they can lead to market instability, asset price crashes, and economic downturns with widespread consequences. This article explores the usefulness of quantile regression (QR) technique in detecting and surveilling financial bubbles, encompassing both global testing and real-time monitoring. We demonstrate that the QR-based quantile unit root test, coupled with an optimal quantile selection technique, serves as an effective tool for a global bubble test without necessitating additional recursive techniques. Moreover, we propose two QR-based bubble monitoring techniques. We show that the monitoring statistics follow a random variate under the null hypothesis of no bubbles but diverge to positive infinity in the presence of a mildly explosive bubble, and hence consistently date the origination of a bubble. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that compared with their LS counterparts, in the presence of skewed distributions, the QR-based global test delivers substantially greater power, while the QR-based monitoring procedures offer higher bubble detection rate and more accurate dating of the bubble origination. As an illustration, we conduct a pseudo real-time monitoring exercise with the S&P 500 composite index.},

  abstract     = {Periodically collapsing bubbles, if they exist, induce asymmetric dynamics in asset prices. In this article, I show that unit root quantile autoregressive models can approximate such dynamics by allowing the largest autoregressive root to take values below unity at low quantiles, which correspond to price crashes, and above unity at upper quantiles, that correspond to bubble expansions. On this basis, I employ two unit root tests based on quantile autoregressions to detect bubbles. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the two tests have good size and power properties, and can outperform recursive least-squares-based tests. The merits of the two tests are further illustrated in three empirical applications that examine Bitcoin, US equity and US housing markets. In the empirical applications, special attention is given to the issue of controlling for economic fundamentals. The estimation results indicate the presence of asymmetric dynamics that closely match those of the simulated bubble processes.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a new ordinary least squares (OLS)-based procedure for retrospectively dating the emergence and collapse of bubbles. We first consider a data generating process that entails a switch from a unit root regime to an explosive regime followed by a collapse and subsequent return to unit root behavior. We demonstrate analytically that the standard OLS estimates are inconsistent and date both the origination and implosion points with a delay in large samples. A simple modification that involves omitting the residual corresponding to the implosion date is shown to yield consistent estimates. We also develop an efficient dating algorithm that can accommodate a framework with multiple bubbles. The algorithm exploits the explicit form of the unit root restrictions to directly embed them into the recursive optimization problem which obviates the need to rely on an iterative scheme that requires initial values. Extensive simulation experiments indicate that our proposed procedure typically delivers estimates with lower bias and root mean squared error relative to competing alternatives. An empirical illustration is included.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new class of modified regression-based tests for detecting asset price bubbles designed to be robust to the presence of general forms of both conditional and unconditional heteroskedasticity in the price series. This modification, based on the approach developed in Beare (2018) in the context of conventional unit root testing, is achieved by purging the impact of unconditional heteroskedasticity from the data using a kernel estimate of volatility before the application of the bubble detection methods proposed in Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015) (PSY). The modified statistic is shown to achieve the same limiting null distribution as the corresponding (heteroskedasticity-uncorrected) statistic from PSY would obtain under homoskedasticity, such that the usual critical values provided in PSY may still be used. Versions of the test based on regressions including either no intercept or a (redundant) intercept are considered. Representations for asymptotic local power against a single bubble model are also derived. Monte Carlo simulation results highlight that neither one of these tests dominates the other across different bubble locations and magnitudes, and across different models of time-varying volatility. Accordingly, we also propose a test based on a union of rejections between the with- and without-intercept variants of the modified PSY test. The union procedure is shown to perform almost as well as the better of the constituent tests for a given DGP, and also performs very well compared to existing heteroskedasticity-robust tests across a large range of simulation DGPs.},

Compared to existing alternatives such as Dickey-Fuller type tests, the LBI statistic has a standard limiting distribution and greater power, particularly in the empirically relevant scenario of a moderately explosive root. Further refinements, such as the point-optimal linear test, approach the power envelope remarkably closely. To detect bubbles with an unknown starting date, we consider sequential (CUSUM) schemes based on constant and time-varying boundary functions, where the exponentially weighted CUSUM detector with a constant boundary function turns out to be most powerful. We also propose a simple method for date-stamping the start of the bubble consistently. Finally, we illustrate our methods using two empirical examples.},

These developments have fueled an unprecedented frenzy in the Nasdaq, with AI-focused companies experiencing soaring stock prices that raise concerns about speculative bubbles and real-economy consequences. Against this background, this study investigates the formation of speculative bubbles in the Nasdaq stock market with a specific focus on the so-called Magnificent Seven (Mag-7) individual stocks during the AI boom, spanning the period from January 2017 to January 2025. We apply the real-time PSY bubble detection methodology of Phillips et al. (2015a, 2015b) while controlling for market and industry factors for individual stocks. Confidence intervals to assess the degree of speculative behavior in asset price dynamics are calculated using the near-unit root approach of Phillips (2023). The findings reveal the presence of speculative bubbles in the Nasdaq stock market and across all Mag-7 stocks. Nvidia and Microsoft experience the longest speculative periods over January 2017–December 2021, while Nvidia and Tesla show the fastest rates of explosive behavior. Speculative bubbles persist in the market and in six of the seven stocks (excluding Apple) from December 2022 to January 2025. Near-unit-root inference indicates mildly explosive dynamics for Nvidia and Tesla (2017–2021) and local-to-unity near explosive behavior for all assets in both periods.},

These models help explain the balance between species under natural conditions, but the inclusion of factors like the Allee effect and intraspecific competition adds complexity and realism to these interactions, enhancing our ability to predict system behavior under stress. To detect early indicators of population collapse, this study investigates the intricate dynamics of a modified Leslie-Gower predator-prey model with both Allee effect and intraspecific competition. We analyze the existence and stability of equilibria, as well as bifurcation phenomena, including saddle-node bifurcations of codimension 2, Hopf bifurcations of codimension 2, and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations of codimension at least 4. Detailed transitions between bifurcation curves–specifically saddle-node, Hopf, homoclinic, and limit cycle bifurcations–are also examined. We observe a novel transition phenomenon, where a system jumps from saddle-node bifurcation to homoclinic and limit cycle bifurcations. This suggests that burst oscillations may serve as an early warning of system collapse rather than simply a tipping point. Our findings indicate that moderate levels of intraspecific competition or Allee effect support coexistence of both populations, while excessive levels may destabilize the entire biological system, leading to collapse. These insights offer valuable implications for ecological management and the early detection of risks in population dynamics.},

In this relation, two kinds of PDE-type disturbance observers are put forward for the purpose of estimating the disturbances produced by the exogenous systems. Subsequently, an output feedback-based secured control law is devised through the assistance of estimation information gathered from the constructed observer. In addition, hybrid cyber attacks are undertaken in the control channel with the goal of enhancing the security of the system. In this context, a Bernoulli distributed white sequence is utilized for the purpose of managing the randomness of cyber attacks. Also, the gain fluctuations in the control framework are considered within a structure of linear fractional form to improve the control design robustness. Apart from this, with the intent of addressing the norm-bounded disturbances, an extended dissipative technique is implemented. At the end, a numerical example accompanied by the simulation findings is provided to showcase the efficacy of the developed theoretical results and control mechanism.},

We resolve this SNAEs by employing Newton's iteration method. The convergence examination and error estimation for the suggested scheme are also included by computing the order of convergence.

  abstract     = {The equivalence problem in differential geometry investigates whether two geometric structures can be transformed into one another through an appropriate change of variables. This issue is central to understanding the invariants associated with dynamical systems, which remain unchanged under such transformations. The Cartan equivalence method provides a powerful and systematic framework for addressing these problems by reducing complex equivalence questions to more tractable ones involving coframes and structure equations. In this study, we apply Cartan's method to second-order autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs), offering insights into the intrinsic geometric structure of these systems under coordinate transformations. Specifically, we examine a class of second-order ODEs that model nonlinear dynamical behavior, employing the pseudogroup of web transformations to identify differential invariants and symmetry classes. The study introduces a step-by-step construction of an invariant coframe, elucidates the structure equations governing the system, and provides a classification of the equations based on their differential invariants. Two representative physical systems are investigated in detail: the motion of a damped spring-mass system and the van der Pol oscillator. In addition to these applications, the paper explores the interplay between equivalence, symmetry reduction, and integrability. By leveraging Cartan's method, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the equivalence problem in the context of higher order differential equations, highlighting both the theoretical elegance and practical utility of the approach in uncovering hidden geometric features, symmetries, and conserved quantities.},

Analytically, we have demonstrated the direct involvement of NK cell-mediated immune responses through Interferon - ( ) signaling in the necessary conditions for disease persistence. The stability criteria for disease-free and endemic equilibria are theoretically validated using the basic reproduction number ( ) and the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. Our system exhibits a transcritical bifurcation at , indicating changes in the stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria. We have also investigated the effects of a dual-drug regimen (Azithromycin and ) by introducing two surrogate control parameters into our model, utilizing optimal control theory. The derived optimal drug dosage pair offers a cost-effective and efficient treatment strategy. For model calibration via numerical simulations, we have collected some parameter values from certain published mouse model studies and also performed sensitivity analysis for to assess the relative importance of these parameters for our mathematical system. To evaluate the robustness of model predictions against parameter variations, we have computed sensitivity indices and model sustainability across different parameter regions. Numerical results substantiate the outcomes of the control-induced system, and we have compared the results under various maximum control efforts. Our study suggests that combination therapy using Azithromycin and with optimum drug efficacy can eradicate 100% S . Typhi infection from infected macrophages within 10 days.},

  abstract     = {The current manuscript introduces a single-strain dengue model developed from stochastic processes incorporating fractional-order transmission and recovery. The fractional derivative has been introduced within the context of transmission and recovery process, displaying characteristics similar to tempered fractional ( T F $$ TF $$ ) derivatives. It has been established that under certain condition, a function's T F $$ TF $$ derivatives are proportional to the function itself. Applying the following observation, we examined the stability of several steady-state solutions, such as disease-free and endemic states, in light of this newly formulated model, using the reproduction number ( R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ ). In addition, the precise range of epidemiological parameters for the fractional-order model was determined by calibrating weekly registered dengue incidence in the San Juan municipality of Puerto Rico, from April 9, 2010, to April 2, 2011. We performed a global sensitivity analysis method to measure the influence of key model parameters (along with the fractional-order coefficient) on total dengue cases and the basic reproduction number ( R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ ) using a Monte Carlo-based partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC). Moreover, we formulated a fractional-order model with fractional control to assess the effectiveness of different interventions, such as reducing the recruitment rate of mosquito breeding, controlling adult vectors, and providing individual protection. Also, we established the existence of a solution for the fractional-order optimal control problem. Finally, the numerical experiment illustrates that policymakers should place importance on the fractional-order transmission and recovery parameters that capture the underlying mechanisms of disease, along with reducing the spread of dengue cases, carried out through the implementation of adult vector control.},

Steady-state and Hopf bifurcations are carried out in detail, especially under the degenerate conditions such as invalid simple eigenvalue condition or crossing condition. It is shown that the steady-state solutions under the violated simple eigenvalue are characterized by a coupling of two eigenfunctions, and the bifurcation direction from simple eigenvalue is supercritical or subcritical. Meanwhile, there is no nonconstant steady-state solution under the degenerate case of violated crossing condition. In addition, whether the transversality condition in Hopf bifurcation is true or not, instead of the center manifold theory, we apply the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method and the singularity theory to illustrate the existence and stability of periodic solutions as well as the bifurcation diagrams. But it is proved that the usual pitchfork Hopf bifurcation is changed to the transcritical bifurcation through the invalid transversality condition. Finally, some numerical simulations allow us to identify the influence of external current on the predicted dynamics.

The model, represented by a system of ordinary differential equations, captures the complex interaction between the host's immune response and viral infection. The study focuses on the model's fundamental aspects, such as equilibrium analysis, computing the basic reproduction number ℛ 0 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ , stability analysis, bifurcation phenomena, numerical simulations, and sensitivity analysis. The analysis reveals both an infection equilibrium, which indicates the persistence of the illness, and an infection-free equilibrium, which represents disease control possibilities. Applying matrix-theoretical approaches, stability analysis proved that the infection-free equilibrium is both locally and globally stable for ℛ 0 < 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;lt;1 $$ . For the situation of ℛ 0 > 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;gt;1 $$ , the infection equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable via the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. We also studied the uniform persistence of the infection, demonstrating that the infection remains present above a positive threshold under certain conditions. The study also found a transcritical forward-type bifurcation at ℛ 0 = 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;amp;#x0003D;1 $$ , indicating a critical threshold that affects the system's behavior. The model's temporal dynamics are studied using numerical simulations, and sensitivity analysis identifies the most significant variables by assessing the effects of parameter changes on system behavior.},

  abstract     = {Software has been increasingly important in many critical systems. To measure the growth of software reliability during testing phases, several software reliability growth models (SRGMs) have been investigated. Different from hardwares, softwares' failure mechanisms follow the basic rules of logic, behavior, and psychology rather than physical laws. Consequently, software testing phase embodies lots of epistemic uncertainties, which are not suitable to be modeled by probability theory-based SRGMs. In addition, fuzzy theory-based SRGMs may give counterintuitive results. Confronted with these, we proposed a software belief reliability growth model (SBRGM) under the framework of uncertainty theory which is a new mathematics system to deal with epistemic uncertainties. However, testing coverage, a key factor in software testing, has not been considered in SBRGM. Therefore, a novel SBRGM considering testing coverage, named SBRGM with testing coverage (TCSBRGM), is proposed in this paper. Based on belief reliability theory, several essential belief reliability indexes for software such as belief reliability and belief reliable time are considered. Unknown parameters in the proposed TCSBRGM are estimated. Finally, real data analysis using two real-world software testing data is carried out to compare the performance of our proposed model with some representative SRGMs. The results exhibit that the proposed model gives a better fitting and predictive performance.},

Three SIR type models considering several aspects in the spread of the disease are considered with 3, 6, and 10 unknown parameters, respectively. The parameter identification is carried through a search algorithm based on a combination of a stochastic domain exploration and a heuristic calculation of a descent direction, in order to avoid stopping the algorithm at a local optimum. The models are validated using the epidemic data found. Finally, it was confirmed that the basic reproductive ratio is consistent with those previously reported in the literature. We conclude that the proposed optimization method improves computation time with respect to a genetic algorithm or an exhaustive search in the parameter space.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to proving the global existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to the three-dimensional inhomogeneous incompressible nematic liquid crystal flows. The results hold under the conditions that the initial density lies in the bounded function space with a positive lower bound, the initial velocity is sufficiently small in the critical Besov space B ˙ 2 , 1 1 2 ℝ 3 $$ {\dot{B}}_{2,1}&amp;#x0005E;{\frac{1}{2}}\left({\mathbb{R}}&amp;#x0005E;3\right) $$ , and the gradient of the initial molecular orientation is also small enough in the same critical Besov space B ˙ 2 , 1 1 2 ℝ 3 $$ {\dot{B}}_{2,1}&amp;#x0005E;{\frac{1}{2}}\left({\mathbb{R}}&amp;#x0005E;3\right) $$ . These results align with the Fujita-Kato theorem for the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, as established by Zhang. Additionally, our work provides a lower bound for the lifespan of smooth solutions to the three-dimensional inhomogeneous incompressible nematic liquid crystal flows. The findings also address the uniqueness problem raised by De Anna.},

  abstract     = {In nature, there is no ideal impulse response system. When the input is switched, the output cannot respond to this input instantaneously, which needs some time. This causes a transient oscillation process, which will inevitably affect the control accuracy, produce noise, and even cause fatigue damage. The usually adopted integer mathematical model is an ideal impulse response model and has no memory property. The fractional model has memory property, but the historical information before the switching time is usually lost. The transient oscillation process caused by intermittent control has rarely been reported in the obtained achievements with both the integer model and the fractional model. In this paper, based on the input-output property of a system, we have studied this transient oscillation. First, the impulsive response is approximated as a short memory model according to its decaying property. Second, the intermittent signal is treated as a piece-wise continuous signal to study. The study indicates that the transient oscillation is inevitable. This transient process is affected by the historical information within the memory length, and its duration is equal to the memory length. Different systems have different memory lengths. To optimize the transient oscillation process, we have to study the intermittent control approaches for different systems case by case. These do well with the engineering applications of intermittent control. Some numerical examples verify our theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {To localize the linear canonical spectrum of the time-dependent signals, we propose a novel short-time linear canonical transform that leverages the convolution structure of the linear canonical transform (LCT). Unlike the traditional approach, which replaces the Fourier kernel with the LCT kernel, this method employs convolution to capture the linear canonical spectrum over limited temporal intervals, constrained by a window function. This approach not only reduces computational complexity but also holds significant potential for applications in various scientific and engineering fields. We begin our investigation by examining fundamental properties of the proposed transform, such as the orthogonality relation, inversion formula, and characterization of the range, using tools from LCT and convolution theory. Further, we explore the time-frequency resolution and the uncertainty principles associated with the proposed transform. Additionally, we present several potential applications, including the Poisson summation formula, Paley-Wiener criterion, and a sampling formula. To support our theoretical findings, clear examples are provided throughout the paper.},

Given the mapping between traversal trees and cuts in a graph, we propose to deal with the problem from a new perspective, namely, cut enumeration. The algorithm enumerates the cuts using the depth-first traversal tree, locates the optimal tree per node with the smallest local cut, and compacts them for acceleration. Any node pair can be separated by compacted trees containing only one of them. Its serial implementation is validated to be effective in obtaining the accurate solution for 99.9% or more pairs of vertices in a graph. Its calculation time per pair is as low as a thousandth of that of the most efficient existing method, that is, several microseconds in a graph with tens of millions of edges using an off-shelf computing node, thus serving as an effective heuristic for min-cut approximation.},

Currently, it poses a significant health challenge in various regions, and there is concern that it may evolve into a more severe global threat. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic approach to modeling an influenza outbreak. The study begins by formulating a mathematical representation that incorporates random fluctuations influencing the disease's progression. We demonstrate that the proposed model guarantees a positive global solution. By utilizing Lyapunov functionals, we investigate specific parametric conditions under which the disease may be eliminated from the population. Additionally, an ergodic stationary distribution is used to demonstrate conditions under which the infection may persist. A threshold quantity is identified, offering insight into key parameters that influence other dynamic aspects of the model. The stochastic model of influenza is further examined through graphical representation for better understanding.},

This work assumes that all of the plants or units have the same capital cost, operating costs, and revenue and that the company reinvests all net profit into purchasing more units. Furthermore, this model ignores depreciation, inflation, fluctuating market prices, and market saturation. With these assumptions, the question of when the company can afford to scale and purchase the next unit is directly related to the payback period and the harmonic number. This work describes a novel growth function called the harmonic growth function based on harmonic numbers. This function is related to the standard ROI. The harmonic growth function is explained and applied to a micro combined heat and power (mCHP) station, a biomass company expanding the number of biorefineries, and biochar retort kilns for biochar production.},

  abstract     = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are major public health concern worldwide, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. Managing co-infection between HIV and HBV presents additional challenges in clinical treatment and patient outcomes. In this article, we developed a comprehensive co-infection model to explore the complex transmission dynamics between HIV and HBV in the United States. Our model incorporates crucial factors such as infection through birth or migration, HBV vaccination, and the possibility of reinfection following HBV recovery. Our mathematical analysis started with the analysis of the two non-co-infection submodels, that is, for HIV-only and HBV-only models. We derived the basic reproduction number for each submodel and appliedthe Routh-Hurwitz criterion to assess the local stability of their respective disease-free equilibrium points. Our investigation revealed that the HIV-only submodel is globally asymptotically stable when its basic reproduction number remains below one. Conversely, the HBV-only submodel exhibits a backward bifurcation, meaning that both disease-free and endemic equilibrium states can coexist even when the reproduction number falls below one. This phenomenon complicates HBV control strategies under such conditions. However, in the absence of reinfection, the HBV-only model reaches global stability at the disease-free equilibrium whenever its reproduction number is below one. Using center manifold theory, we further demonstrated that the full HIV-HBV co-infection model also undergoes backward bifurcation. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the basic reproduction numbers of HIV and HBV to identify critical parameters influencing the transmission dynamics of both infections. Our results indicate a positive correlation between the spread of one infection and the prevalence of the other. Additionally, we validated the model by fitting it to annual cumulative data on new HIV cases and reported acute HBV infections in the United States. Numerical simulations suggest that increasing condom use adherence, enhancing treatment coverage for both infections, and boosting HBV vaccination rates can substantially reduce the prevalence of HIV, HBV, and their co-infection.},

  abstract = {The rapid emergence of single-cell data has facilitated the study of many different biological conditions at the cellular level. Cluster analysis has been widely applied to identify cell types, capturing the essential patterns of the original data in a much more concise form. One challenge in the cluster analysis of cells is matching clusters extracted from datasets of different origins or conditions. Many existing algorithms cannot recognize new cell types present in only one of the two samples when establishing a correspondence between clusters obtained from two samples. Additionally, when there are more than two samples, it is advantageous to align clusters across all samples simultaneously rather than performing pairwise alignment. Our approach aims to construct a taxonomy for cell clusters across all samples to better annotate these clusters and effectively extract features for downstream analysis. A new system for constructing cell-type taxonomy has been developed by combining the technique of optimal transport with relaxed marginal constraints (OT-RMC) and the simultaneous alignment of clusters across multiple samples. OT-RMC allows us to address challenges that arise when the proportions of clusters vary substantially between samples or when some clusters do not appear in all the samples. Experiments on more than 20 datasets demonstrate that the taxonomy constructed by this new system can yield highly accurate annotation of cell types. Additionally, sample-level features extracted based on the taxonomy result in accurate classification of samples.},

In this paper, we consider an online renewable algorithm for composite quantile regression, which only needs to retain the key information in the historical data and update the summary statistics with the currently accessible data to obtain a renewable estimator. The proposed method is theoretically proven to be asymptotically equivalent to the oracle estimator derived from the entire dataset, offering advantages in computational and memory efficiency. Unlike previous approaches that impose constraints on batch numbers or data variance, our method is unconstrained by these factors. Meanwhile, numerical simulations and experiments on real data sets demonstrate that our estimator not only surpasses existing methods in handling both homogeneous and heterogeneous data but also performs better than traditional Quantile Regression in various scenarios. These findings highlight the suitability of our approach for real-world streaming data applications.},

This paper proposes an adaptive weighted regularized quantile regression gated recurrent unit (AWR-QRGRU) algorithm. The gated recurrent unit (GRU) is employed to capture long-term dependencies in the sequence and generate predictions for multiple quantiles through a fully connected layer, thereby enabling both point forecasts and interval forecasts with varying confidence levels. In the proposed prediction algorithm, the loss function incorporates coverage loss, median loss, interval width loss, and regularization loss. An adaptive weight adjustment mechanism was implemented to dynamically optimize the weights of these different loss terms, enhancing the accuracy and stability of the predictions when dealing with multidimensional explanatory variables. Subsequently, we conducted Monte Carlo experiments to validate the algorithm's effectiveness in both point and interval predictions. Ultimately, the algorithm was applied to predict Amazon's and NVIDIA's stock prices, showcasing its potential applications in complex financial market environments.},

Unlike traditional time-series clustering methods that yield static membership parameters, our approach allows each time series to dynamically change cluster memberships over time. Thus, each time series has a dynamic posterior probability of belonging to each cluster. The proposed mixture model is flexible, assuming a Dirichlet evolution for the mixture weights that enables smooth membership transitions over time. This approach accounts for correlations between weights, thereby avoiding abrupt membership changes caused by outlying observations in the series. Posterior estimates of model parameters and membership probabilities are obtained via Gibbs sampling. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient alternative method based on stochastic expectation maximization and gradient descent to obtain point estimates. We illustrate the proposed method using a tri-variate panel dataset combining Gapminder and World Bank indicators—life expectancy, GDP per capita, and crude birth rate—for 78 European and African countries from 1960 to 2007. The selected regions provide strong socioeconomic and demographic contrasts, allowing the model to effectively capture temporal and structural changes in cluster membership.},

  abstract = {Random binnings generated via recursive binary splits are introduced as a way to detect, measure the strength of, and to display the pattern of association between any two variates, whether one or both are continuous or categorical. This provides a single approach to ordering large numbers of variate pairs by their measure of dependence and then to examine any pattern of dependence via a common display, the departure display (coloring bins by a standardized Pearson residual). Continuous variates are first ranked and their rank pairs binned. The Pearson's goodness of fit statistic is applicable but the classic approximation to its null distribution is not. Theoretical and empirical investigations motivate several approximations, including a simple approximation with real-valued, yet intuitive, degrees of freedom. Alternatively, applying an inverse probability transform from the ranks before binning returns a simple Pearson statistic with the classic degrees of freedom. Recursive random binning with different approximations is compared to recent grid-based methods on a variety of non-null dependence patterns; the method with any of these approximations is found to be well-calibrated and relatively powerful against common test alternatives. Method and displays are illustrated by applying the screening methodology to a publicly available data set having several continuous and categorical measurements of each of 6497 Portuguese wines.

In addition to selection bias, non-probability samples may also suffer from missingness in practice, even nonignorable nonresponse with unknown response probabilities. Superpopulation model methods have been discussed for reducing selection biases from non-probability samples, but not for dealing with nonignorable missingness for non-probability samples yet. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear superpopulation model inference approach for non-probability samples with nonignorable missingness. We develop rigorous procedures for estimating the response probabilities for units in the non-probability sample and the nonlinear superpopulation model parameters, and construct the finite population mean estimator based on the nonlinear superpopulation model, response probabilities, and inclusion probabilities. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and variance estimation are also discussed under the proposed framework. In a simulation study, we compare the proposed method with some existing methods.

In this article, we propose a new statistical analysis method that enables providing a risk ratio estimator in the multilevel statistical model framework. The valid risk ratio estimation is realized via augmenting pseudo-observations to the original dataset and then analyzing the modified dataset by the logistic mixed-effects model. The resultant estimators of fixed effect coefficients are theoretically shown to be consistent estimators of the risk ratios. Also, the standard errors and confidence intervals of the risk ratios can be calculated by the bootstrap method. All of the computations are simply implementable by using the R package “glmmrr.” We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method via applications to a cluster-randomized trial of the maternal and child health handbook and a longitudinal study of respiratory disease.

  abstract     = {Negative controls have been increasingly used for causal inference when unmeasured confounding exist. Valid negative control exposures (NCEs) could not causally affect outcome, and valid negative control outcomes (NCOs) are not to be causally affected by exposure. In most observational studies, it is easy to find a valid NCO but NCEs are harder to verify due to the current limited knowledge. Invalid NCEs associated with outcome result in biased estimate of causal effects. However, previous work considering invalid negative controls is very limited. In this paper, we develop a double negative control framework for continuous outcomes in the presence of some invalid NCEs. First, we prove that it is possible to identify causal effects with a known pre-defined valid NCO and a pre-defined set of NCEs without knowing exactly their validity. Furthermore, as long as more than 50% of NCEs are valid, the average causal effect could be consistently estimated. Then we design an procedure to select valid NCEs. Finally, we give two kinds of double negative control estimators (sisvNCE and naiveNCE-Median) with a guarantee of theoretical estimation performance. Simulation results show that the performance of our method is robust when the number of invalid NCEs does not exceed a certain threshold. Application results indicate that our method has a promising role in public health.},

We provide three linear mixed modeling approaches to adjust for the baseline outcome and derive the corresponding variance formula of the treatment effect estimator under each. The derived formulas reveal the efficiency implications of including a baseline outcome measurement, and provide a natural vehicle for the efficiency comparisons across adjustment approaches to generate practical recommendations.

Doubly robust methods such as Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW) and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) have the potential to address these challenges, using data-adaptive approaches and cross-fitting, but despite recent advances, limited evaluation and guidance are available on their implementation in realistic settings where high-dimensional confounding is present. Motivated by an early-life cohort study, we conducted an extensive simulation study to compare the relative performance of AIPW and TMLE using data-adaptive approaches for estimating the average causal effect (ACE). We evaluated the benefits of using cross-fitting with a varying number of folds, as well as the impact of using a reduced versus full (larger, more diverse) library in the Super Learner ensemble learning approach used for implementation. We found that AIPW and TMLE performed similarly in most cases for estimating the ACE, but TMLE was more stable. Cross-fitting improved the performance of both methods, but was more important for variance estimation and coverage than for point estimates, with the number of folds a less important consideration. Using a full Super Learner library was important to reduce bias and variance in complex scenarios typical of modern health research studies.},

  abstract     = {In cluster-randomized trials, generalized linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations have conventionally been the default analytic methods for estimating the average treatment effect as routine practice. However, recent studies have demonstrated that their treatment effect coefficient estimators may correspond to ambiguous estimands when the models are misspecified or when there exist informative cluster sizes. In this article, we present a unified approach that standardizes output from a given regression model to ensure estimand-aligned inference for the treatment effect parameters in cluster-randomized trials. We introduce estimators for both the cluster-average and the individual-average treatment effects (marginal estimands) that are always consistent regardless of whether the specified working regression models align with the unknown data generating process. We further explore the use of a deletion-based jackknife variance estimator for inference. The development of our approach also motivates a natural test for informative cluster size. Extensive simulation experiments are designed to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed estimators under a variety of scenarios. The proposed model-robust standardization methods are implemented in the MRStdCRT R package.},

  abstract     = {Clinical trials or studies oftentimes require long-term and/or costly follow-up of participants to evaluate a novel treatment/drug/vaccine. There has been increasing interest in the past few decades in using short-term surrogate outcomes as a replacement for the primary outcome, that is, in using the surrogate outcome, which can potentially be observed sooner, to make inferences about the treatment effect on the long-term primary outcome. Very few of the available statistical methods to evaluate a surrogate are applicable to settings where both the surrogate and the primary outcome are time-to-event outcomes subject to censoring. Methods that can handle this setting tend to require parametric assumptions or be limited to assessing only the restricted mean survival time. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric approach to evaluate a censored surrogate outcome, such as time to progression, when the primary outcome is also a censored time-to-event outcome, such as time to death, and the treatment effect of interest is the difference in overall survival. Specifically, we define the proportion of the treatment effect on the primary outcome that is explained (PTE) by the censored surrogate outcome in this context, and estimate this proportion by defining and deriving an optimal transformation of the surrogate information. Our approach provides the added advantage of relaxed assumptions to guarantee that the true PTE is within , along with being model-free. The finite sample performance of our estimators is illustrated via extensive simulation studies and a real data application examining progression-free survival as a surrogate for overall survival for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.},

Proportional MMRM (pMMRM) reparameterizes this difference as a proportional reduction relative to the placebo mean change. This proportional effect is a nonlinear combination of the means, whereas the difference is a linear combination of the means. It can not only lead to greater power at a single visit by yielding a test statistic lower-bounded by that of the difference but also offers a flexible and intuitive way to combine all or multiple visits for efficacy inference, which can further boost power. It is also asymptotically unbiased. pMMRM with visit-specific proportional effects yields identical parameter estimates to MMRM. When only MMRM outputs are used, the proportional effect calculated by the delta method yields greater power than the difference.},

Most randomized clinical trial designs incorporating predictive biomarkers (those associated with treatment efficacy) assume biomarkers are dichotomous, or dichotomize naturally continuous biomarkers upfront, or find cut points mid-way through the trial to classify patients as biomarker-positive or biomarker-negative. However, these practices ignore or discard information about continuous and possible nonlinear or non-monotone prognostic or predictive effects. In this article, we propose a novel adaptive enrichment trial design to handle continuous biomarkers with any effect shape, including Bayesian marker-adaptive randomization. We demonstrate that this design can correctly make marker-specific trial decisions with high efficiency, resulting in improved performance and patient-centered decisions compared to adaptive cut-point selection approaches without adaptive randomization that further ignore or oversimplify true underlying marker relationships.},

We aimed to develop a well-performing and practical approach to handle inference in CRTs when outcome data may be both sporadically and systematically missing. To this end, we first examined the performance of several multilevel multiple imputation (MI) methods to handle sporadically and systematically missing CRT outcome data via a simulation study. Specifically, we examined performance under a multilevel covariate-dependent missingness assumption. Our findings indicated that several full conditional specification (FCS) methods designed for missingness in linear mixed models performed well under various scenarios, while an FCS approach using a two-stage estimator often performed poorly. We then developed methods for conducting sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of inferences under different missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR) assumptions. The methods allow for different MNAR assumptions for cluster dropout and individual dropout to reflect that they may arise from different missing data mechanisms. We used graphical displays to visualize sensitivity analysis results. Our methods are illustrated using a real data application.},

In studies of a small number of exposures, flexible models like Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) are appealing because they allow for non-linear and non-additive associations among exposures. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of low power and difficult interpretation, particularly in exposomic analyses when the number of exposures is large. We propose a flexible framework that allows for the separate selection of additive and non-additive effects, unifying additive models and kernel machine regression. The proposed approach yields increased power and simpler interpretation when there is little evidence of interaction. Further, it allows users to specify separate priors for additive and non-additive effect s, and allows for statistical inference on non-additive interactions. We extend the approach to a class of multiple index models, in which the special case of kernel machine-distributed lag models is nested. We apply the method to motivating data from a subcohort of the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) study containing 65 mixture components grouped into 13 distinct exposure classes.},

  abstract     = {Stepped-wedge cluster randomized trials (SW-CRTs) are traditionally analyzed with models that assume an immediate and sustained treatment effect. Previous work has shown that making such an assumption in the analysis of SW-CRTs when the true underlying treatment effect varies by exposure time can produce severely misleading estimates. Alternatively, the true underlying treatment effect might vary by calendar time. Comparatively less work has examined treatment effect structure misspecification in this setting. Here, we evaluate the behavior of the linear mixed effects model-based immediate treatment effect, exposure time-averaged treatment effect, and calendar time-averaged treatment effect estimators in different scenarios where these estimators are misspecified for the true underlying treatment effect structure. We show that the immediate treatment effect estimator is relatively robust to bias when estimating a true underlying calendar time-averaged treatment effect estimand. However, when there is a true underlying calendar (exposure) time-varying treatment effect, misspecifying an analysis with an exposure (calendar) time-averaged treatment effect estimator can yield severely misleading estimates which may converge to a value with the opposite sign of the true calendar (exposure) time-averaged treatment effect estimand. In this article, we highlight these two different time scales on which treatment effects can vary in SW-CRTs and clarify potential vulnerabilities that may arise when considering different types of time-varying treatment effects in a SW design. Accordingly, we emphasize the need for researchers to carefully consider whether the treatment effect may vary as a function of exposure time or calendar time in the analysis of SW-CRTs.},

  abstract     = {Gene-environment (GxE) interactions crucially contribute to complex phenotypes. The statistical power of a GxE interaction study is limited mainly due to weak GxE interaction effect sizes. Joint tests of the main genetic and GxE effects for a univariate phenotype were proposed to utilize the individually weak GxE effects to improve the discovery of associated genetic loci. We develop a testing procedure to evaluate combined genetic and GxE effects on multiple related phenotypes to enhance the power by merging pleiotropy in the main genetic and GxE effects. We base the approach on a general linear hypothesis testing framework for multivariate regression of continuous phenotypes. We implement the generalized estimating equations (GEE) technique under the seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) setup for binary or mixed phenotypes. We use extensive simulations to show that the test for joint multi-phenotype genetic and GxE effects outperforms the univariate joint test of genetic and GxE effects and the test for multi-phenotype GxE effect concerning power when there is pleiotropy. The test produces a higher power than the test for the multi-phenotype marginal genetic effect for a weak genetic and substantial GxE effect. For more prominent genetic effects, the latter performs better with a limited increase in power. Overall, the multi-phenotype joint approach offers robust, high power across diverse simulation scenarios. We apply the methods to lipid phenotypes with sleep duration as an environmental factor in the UK Biobank. The proposed approach identified ten independent associated genetic loci missed by other competing methods.

  abstract     = {The goal of this paper is to estimate an optimal combination of biomarkers for individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which provides the most sensitive combinations of biomarkers to assess disease progression (in this case, optimal with respect to standardized response mean (SRM) for 4 muscle biomarkers). The biomarker data is incomplete (missing and irregular) multivariate longitudinal data. We propose a normal model with structured covariance designed for our setting. To sample from the posterior distribution of parameters, we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to address the positive definiteness constraint on the structured correlation matrix. In particular, we propose a novel approach to compute the support of the parameters in the structured correlation matrix; we modify the approach from [1] on the set of the largest possible submatrices of the correlation matrix, where the correlation parameter is a unique element. For each posterior sample, we compute the optimal weights of our construct. We conduct data analysis and simulation studies to evaluate the algorithm and the frequentist properties of the posteriors of correlations and weights. We found that the lower extremities are the most responsive muscles at the early and late ambulatory disease stages, and the biceps brachii is the most responsive at the nonambulatory disease stage.},

  abstract     = {Confidence distributions are a frequentist alternative to the Bayesian posterior distribution. These confidence distributions have received more attention in the recent past because of their simplicity. In rare diseases, oncology, or in pediatric drug development, single-arm trials, or platform trials consisting of a series of single-arm trials are increasingly being used, both to establish proof-of-concept and to provide pivotal evidence for a marketing application. Often, these single-arm trials are designed as two-stage designs, or they include sequential or continuous monitoring approaches. They are analyzed using standard frequentist, Bayesian, or other methods. In this paper, we describe how to define analysis strategies based on confidence distributions for such single-arm trials or for platform trials that consist of a series of single arm trials. We focus on binary endpoints and show how to define the corresponding decision rules for final and interim analyses and how to derive their operating characteristics exactly, for example, without simulation. Our approach uses predictive probabilities rather than conditional probabilities (as with stochastic curtailment) to define the interim decision rules. It can be applied to platform, basket, and umbrella trials that consist of a series of single-arm trials but also to stand-alone single arm trials.},

For this reason, one common strategy is to fit flexible nonparametric models to capture the true exposure-response surface. However, once such a model is fit, further decisions are required when it comes to summarizing the marginal and joint effects of the mixture on the outcome. In this work, we describe the use of soft Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) to estimate the exposure-risk surface describing the effect of mixtures of chemical air pollutants and temperature on asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits during the warm season in Atlanta, Georgia, from 2011 to 2018. BART is chosen for its ability to handle large datasets and for its flexibility to be incorporated as a single component of a larger model. We then summarize the results using a strategy known as accumulated local effects to extract meaningful insights into the mixture effects on asthma-related morbidity. Notably, we observe negative associations between and asthma ED visits and harmful associations between ozone and asthma ED visits, both of which are particularly strong on lower temperature days.},

This paper proposes a general method to reduce the dimension of the design space using group stepwise methods and Monte Carlo simulations, significantly decreasing the number of iterations required to identify near-optimal parameters. The method extends classical Group Sequential Designs but does not rely on normality assumptions and can accommodate complex trial designs.

We introduce six different strategies for how such events could be handled. We introduce the estimand concept for diagnostic accuracy studies, which consists of the attributes population, target condition, index test, accuracy measure, and the strategies for handling interfering events. The estimand determines which effect is estimated based on the study objective. To bridge the gap between the clinical study objective and the method for the estimation, we illustrate the necessary steps using a fictitious computed tomography scan study. The defined estimand improves the structure of the planning phase, enhances the interdisciplinary exchange, and supports the interpretation based on the study objective.},

  abstract     = {Multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) is an efficient class of trial designs that helps to assess multiple treatment strategies at the same time using an adaptive design. These designs can substantially reduce the average number of samples required compared to an equivalent single stage multi-arm trial. However, if patient recruitment is continued while we await treatment outcomes, a long-term primary outcome leads to a number of ‘pipeline’ patients getting recruited in the trial, who do not benefit from the early termination of a futile arm. This study focuses on quantifying the efficiency loss a MAMS design undergoes, in terms of the expected sample size (ESS), because of outcome delay. We first estimate the number of ‘pipeline’ patients (recruited during the interim analysis (IA) while awaiting outcome data) analytically through different recruitment models, given the total recruitment time. We then compute the ESS accounting for delay and assess the Efficiency Loss (EL). The results indicate that more than 50% of the expected efficiency gain is typically lost due to delay when the delay is more than of the total recruitment length. Although the number of stages have little influence on the efficiency loss, the timing of the IA can impact the efficiency of MAMS designs with delayed outcomes; in particular, conducting the IAs earlier than an equally-spaced design can be harmful for the design. Finally, we conclude that, in order to gain maximum benefit of MAMS in terms of a reduced sample size in multi-arm trials, the outcome delay should be less than a third of the total recruitment length.},

A high level of blood pressure is a well-known risk factor for these events, and an increasing number of studies suggest that blood pressure variability may also be an independent risk factor. However, these studies suffer from significant methodological weaknesses. In this work, we propose a new location-scale joint model for the repeated measures of a marker and competing events. This joint model combines a mixed model including a subject-specific and time-dependent residual variance modeled through random effects, and cause-specific proportional intensity models for the competing events. The risk of events may depend simultaneously on the current value of the variance, as well as, the current value and the current slope of the marker trajectory. The model is estimated by maximizing the likelihood function using the Marquardt–Levenberg algorithm. The estimation procedure is implemented in an R-package and is validated through a simulation study. This model is applied to study the association between blood pressure variability and the risk of CVD and death from other causes. Using data from a large clinical trial on the secondary prevention of stroke, we find that the current individual variability of blood pressure is associated with the risk of CVD and death. Moreover, the comparison with a model without heterogeneous variance shows the importance of taking into account this variability in the goodness-of-fit and for dynamic predictions.},

High-throughput technologies such as RNA-sequencing have emerged as promising tools for understanding complex biological systems and informing new treatment strategies. However, these data are high-dimensional, presenting unique statistical challenges for existing surrogate marker identification methods. We introduce Rank-based Identification of high-dimensional SurrogatE Markers (RISE), a novel approach designed for small sample, high-dimensional settings typical in modern vaccine experiments. RISE uses a nonparametric univariate test to screen variables for promising candidates, followed by surrogate evaluation on independent data. Our simulation studies demonstrate RISE's desirable properties, including type one error rate control and empirical power under various conditions. Applying RISE to a clinical trial for inactivated influenza vaccination, we sought to identify genes whose expression could serve as a surrogate for the induced immune response. This analysis revealed a signature of genes appearing to function as a reasonable surrogate for the neutralizing antibody response. Pathways related to innate antiviral signaling and interferon stimulation were strongly represented in this derived surrogate, providing a clear immunological interpretation.},

However, the limitations of this design restrict its methodological acceptability. Regulatory agencies have raised concerns about this approach, although it is sometimes required in applications based solely on such studies. Consequently, the need for accurate indirect treatment comparisons has become critical, especially when constructing external control arms using routinely collected data as outcome measurements may differ from those recorded in the single-arm trial leading to potential misclassification of outcomes. This study aimed to quantify the bias from ignoring misclassification of a binary outcome within unanchored indirect comparisons, through simulations, and to propose a likelihood-based method to correct this bias (i.e., the outcome-corrected model). Simulations demonstrated that ignoring misclassification results in significant bias and poor coverage probabilities. In contrast, the outcome-corrected model reduced bias, improved 95% confidence interval coverage probability and root mean square error in various scenarios. The methodology was applied to two hepatocellular carcinoma trials illustrating a practical application. The findings underscore the importance of addressing outcome misclassification in indirect comparisons. The proposed correction method may improve reliability in unanchored indirect treatment comparisons.},

Nonetheless, the basic design of early phase I trials in oncology still follows predominantly a dose-escalation design. These trials monitor safety over the first treatment cycle to escalate the dose of the investigated drug. However, over time, studying additional factors such as drug combinations and/or variation in the timing of dosing became important as well. Existing designs were continuously enhanced and expanded to account for increased trial complexity. With toxicities occurring at later stages beyond the first cycle and the need to treat patients over multiple cycles, the focus on the first treatment cycle only is becoming a limitation in nowadays multi-cycle treatment therapies. Here, we introduce a multi-cycle time-to-event model (TITE-CLRM: Time-Interval-To-Event Complementary-Loglog Regression Model), allowing guidance of dose-escalation trials studying multi-cycle therapies. The challenge lies in balancing the need to monitor the safety of longer treatment periods with the need to continuously enroll patients safely. The proposed multi-cycle time-to-event model is formulated as an extension to established concepts like the escalation with overdose control principle. The model is motivated by a current drug development project and evaluated in a simulation study.},

With the advancement of molecular targeted agents and immunotherapies, however, evaluating two or more doses has become increasingly critical for dose selection. Such evaluation is often done in phase 2 studies in a randomized manner. In this article, we evaluate the strategy of applying an adaptive phase 2/3 seamless design for dose selection in oncology studies. Specifically, we consider the “drop-the-losers” design, where multiple treatment arms and a control arm are administered during the initial stage, and a more effective arm is identified for later stages by a binary surrogate endpoint such as overall response. We derive the theoretical type I error inflation scale and conduct simulation studies to illustrate the impact of various factors on the type I error inflation in such designs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the findings through the design of a lung cancer trial and introduce a software that implements the proposed design.},

  abstract     = {Circadian transcriptome studies often use trigonometric regression to model gene expression over time. Ideally, protocols in these studies would collect tissue samples at evenly distributed and equally spaced time points over a 24-hour period. This sample collection protocol is known as an equispaced design, which is considered the optimal experimental design for trigonometric regression under multiple statistical criteria. However, implementing equispaced designs in studies involving individuals is logistically challenging, and failure to employ an equispaced design could introduce variability in the statistical power of a hypothesis test relative to a model's phase-shift parameter estimates. This article is motivated by the variability in power for hypothesis testing when tissue samples are not collected under an equispaced design, and considers a weighted trigonometric regression as a remedy. Specifically, the weights for this regression are the normalized reciprocals of estimates derived from a kernel density estimator for sample collection time, which inflates the weight of samples collected at underrepresented time points. A search procedure is also introduced to identify the hyperparameter for kernel density estimation that relates to maximizing the smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian of weighted squared loss, which is motivated by the -optimality criterion from experimental design literature. Simulation studies consistently demonstrate that this weighted regression mitigates variability in power for hypothesis tests performed with an estimated model. Illustrations with six circadian transcriptome datasets further indicate that this weighted regression consistently yields larger test statistics than its unweighted counterpart for first-order trigonometric regression, or cosinor regression, which is prevalent in circadian transcriptome studies.},

  abstract     = {The sleep–wake cycle plays an important and far-reaching role in health. By utilizing personal physical activity monitors (PAMs), inferences about the sleep–wake cycle can be made. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been applied in this area as an accurate unsupervised approach. To account for heterogeneity in activity levels, we developed a mixed HMM that allows for individual differences. Through extensive simulations, we quantified the added gains relative to a standard HMM from using a mixed HMM to account for heterogeneity across several realistic scenarios. We found that mixed HMMs are often more accurate than standard HMMs when follow-up times are shorter. In situations with many repeated measurements per individual, a standard and mixed HMM have similar levels of accuracy, although a standard HMM is faster and easier to implement. Afterward, we applied our HMMs to actigraphy data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We present results on sleep summary statistics by age and BMI. Summary statistics about the sleep–wake cycle extracted by the standard and mixed HMM were qualitatively similar. Differences in results, however, were likely driven by the heterogeneity in physical activity due to BMI and age, which we identified using a post hoc investigation of the data-driven clusters produced by the mixed HMM.},

A key objective in drug stability studies is to estimate the shelf-life of a drug, involving a suitable definition of the true shelf-life and the construction of an appropriate estimate of the true shelf-life. Simultaneous confidence bands (SCBs) for percentiles in linear regression are valuable tools for determining the shelf-life in drug stability studies. In this paper, we propose a novel criterion, the Minimum Area Confidence Set (MACS) criterion, for finding the optimal SCB for percentile regression lines. This criterion focuses on the area of the constrained regions for the newly proposed pivotal quantities, which are generated from the confidence set for the unknown parameters of an SCB. We employ the new pivotal quantities to construct exact SCBs over any finite covariate intervals and use the MACS criterion to compare several SCBs of different forms. The optimal SCB under the MACS criterion can be used to construct the interval estimate of the true shelf-life. Furthermore, a new computationally efficient method is proposed for calculating the critical constants of exact SCBs for percentile regression lines. A real data example on drug stability is provided for illustration.},

Estimating the positive conditional tail index of a heavy-tailed conditional distribution is a crucial step for statistical inference, but the task becomes increasingly challenging as the covariate dimension increases. In this work, we assume the existence of a lower-dimensional linear subspace such that the conditional tail index depends on the covariate only through its projection onto this subspace. We propose a method to estimate this dimension reduction subspace and establish its consistency. Additionally, we introduce an estimator of the conditional tail index that leverages this dimension reduction and prove its consistency. We illustrate the benefits of this dimension reduction approach for estimating the conditional tail index through simulations and an application to real-world data.},

However, existing Fréchet regression literature focuses on the classical setting where the predictor dimension is fixed, and the sample size goes to infinity. This paper proposes sparse Fréchet sufficient dimension reduction with graphical structure among high-dimensional Euclidean predictors. In particular, we propose a convex optimization problem that leverages the graphical information among predictors and avoids inverting the high-dimensional covariance matrix. We also provide the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Theoretically, the proposed method achieves subspace estimation and variable selection consistency under suitable conditions. Extensive simulations and a real data analysis are carried out to illustrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method.},

The challenge in this setting is that the models usually induce a joint distribution which is intractable. Resorting to instead sampling from the joint distribution by means of a Monte Carlo approach is also challenging. For example, a naive rejection sampler does not work when the probability mass of the constraint is zero. A typical example of such constrained problems is to learn energy consumption for a higher resolution level based on data at a lower resolution, for example, to decompose a daily reading into readings at a finer level. We introduce a novel Monte Carlo sampling algorithm based on Langevin diffusions and rejection sampling to solve the problem of sampling from equality-constrained models. Our method has the advantage of being exact for linear constraints and naturally deals with multimodal distributions on arbitrary constraints. We test our method on statistical disaggregation problems for electricity consumption datasets, and our approach provides better uncertainty estimation and accuracy in data imputation compared with other naive/unconstrained methods.},

It is achieved by further minimizing the Wasserstein distance to the adjusted statistics within an appropriate distribution family. Specifically, in the context of Fisher's combination, we propose an optimal gamma distribution as a substitute for the traditionally used chi-squared distribution.

Nevertheless, the prevalence of heavy-tailed macroeconomic and financial data, often characterized by extreme values and greater skewness than that found in a normal distribution, presents significant analytical challenges. This article introduces mode-adaptive factor models (MAFM) for robust factor analysis in high-dimensional panel data, inspired by the equivalence between conventional principal component analysis and the constrained least squares method in factor models. Unlike traditional factor models that concentrate on mean estimation, MAFM leverage the mode to capture central tendencies more effectively, particularly in the presence of skewed and heavy-tailed distributions. To facilitate MAFM for factor analysis, we develop an iterative mode regression algorithm that integrates the expectation-maximization procedure, ensuring convergence to a stationary solution. We establish the theoretical properties of the MAFM estimators without imposing moment constraints on idiosyncratic errors and propose a mode information criterion for consistent factor number selection. We also suggest a data-dependent bandwidth selection procedure to enhance the flexibility of MAFM. The simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of MAFM across diverse distributional settings. An empirical application to macroeconomic forecasting further highlights the practical advantages of MAFM, showcasing their robustness and efficacy in real-world analyses.},

Its stochastic properties, including stationarity and geometric ergodicity, are studied. Particular attention is given to a generalization of the INAR( p ) model which parallels the extension of the INARCH( p ) to the INGARCH( p , q ) model. For inference, we consider maximum likelihood, Gaussian quasi-likelihood, and moment-based approaches, along with likelihood ratio tests to distinguish between selected instances of our class. Models from the proposed class have a natural interpretation as stochastic epidemic processes, which throughout the article is used to illustrate our arguments.

The functional θ measures a location or stochastic tendency effect between two distributions. A limitation of is its inability to capture scale differences. If differences of this nature are to be detected, specific tests for scale or omnibus tests need to be employed. However, the latter often suffer from low power, and they do not yield interpretable effect measures. In this article, we extend by additionally incorporating the recently introduced distribution overlap index (nonparametric dispersion measure) that can be expressed in terms of the quantile process. We derive the joint asymptotic distribution of the respective estimators of and and construct confidence regions. Extending the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test, we introduce a new test based on the joint use of these functionals.

  abstract     = {Intensity estimation through kernel smoothing is a popular non-parametric method of describing the characteristics of an underlying spatial point process. Key to the accuracy of this estimate is the choice of bandwidth. Too large or small a bandwidth can lead to features in the intensity being lost or to the introduction of artefacts. There are many available methods of bandwidth selection for spatial point patterns, but no consensus on the best option. Popular methods and software default options lead to very different intensity estimates and contrasting conclusions about the data that can be difficult to reconcile. In response, we propose new bandwidth selectors with more stable and consistent performance. These are adapted from popular plug-in and cross-validation techniques developed for general multivariate density estimation. The theoretical and practical performance of these proposed methods is explored and compared with other available methods in both simulated and real-data scenarios. We find that our proposed methods perform consistently well across a range of different intensity patterns. We end with a discussion on the implications of edge effects when applying these methods, given the constrained windows in which spatial point patterns are often observed.},

  abstract     = {The global rise in fatty liver diseases is alarming. Traditional diagnostic methods include ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, and liver biopsies, the latter being the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have enhanced liver biopsy accuracy, improving treatment outcomes. This study investigates how various AI techniques aid histopathologists, gastroenterologists, and liver specialists in diagnosing and assessing liver damage due to abnormal fat accumulation. We conducted a systematic review of AI applications in evaluating fatty liver diseases, particularly through histopathological image analysis. Our search encompassed five scientific databases: PubMed Central, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Google Scholar. We focused on peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, theses, and book chapters, adhering to specific terminology. The data synthesis followed the PRISMA guidelines, comparing literature based on four key indices and their annual distribution. We evaluated 37 studies utilizing histopathological imaging for the diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, including related conditions, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. The review summarized the performance of various algorithms and explored the distribution of machine learning efforts. Given the complexity of histopathological images, AI algorithms can effectively stratify liver samples affected by fat. Our findings indicate that AI's diagnostic performance closely matches traditional pathological interpretations, offering reliable results for clinical applications.

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of feature extraction (FE) methods across all major signal processing domains and various types of BCIs, addressing a significant gap in existing reviews and surveys that often focus exclusively on EEG-based systems. Also, a detailed comparative analysis of FE techniques, highlighting their formulas, advantages, limitations, and practical applications, is provided. The study not only reviews state-of-the-art methods but also evaluates recent research, identifying trends and gaps in the field. Key insights reveal a growing foundation for invasive BCI research, which, while currently limited, shows promise for future advancements. Based on this analysis, we identify and discuss open challenges such as inter-subject variability, real-time processing demands, integration of multiple modalities, and user training and adaptation. Additionally, we examine pressing concerns related to security, privacy, and the transferability of models.

Recognizing its potential, researchers from multiple fields have substantially progressed rPPG by establishing a strong theoretical basis for signal acquisition and developing signal processing and data-driven algorithms for rPPG extraction. While most rPPG reviews primarily focus on HR signal extraction methods, our research provides an overview of the potential scope of rPPG. We systematically organize research on rPPG signal acquisition and extraction techniques and provide a critical review of recent rPPG advancements in diverse health parameter estimation. Besides providing a thorough HR estimation review, we incorporate the extraction of derivative signals such as RR and SpO 2 from rPPG data, including their applications and limitations. We also highlight the adaptation of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Computer Vision (CV) techniques with rPPG technologies, and accumulate available critical rPPG resources like datasets, codes, and tutorials. Finally, we identify challenges and research gaps, such as motion artifacts, varying lighting conditions, and differences in skin tone. We aim to uplift advancements in rPPG systems by outlining future research directions.

This concentrated survey provides a comprehensive review of the technical advances from a systematic perspective. This survey systematically reviews technical advances for a crowdsourcing process that contains four dimensions: task modeling, crowdsourcing data acquisition, the learning process, and predictive model learning, and proposes a comprehensive and scalable framework from CROWD4AI (Crowdsourcing Framework with 4 Dimensions for Artificial Intelligence). In addition, this paper focuses on each dimension's potential challenges and future direction, encouraging researchers to participate in crowdsourcing.

  abstract     = {With renewable energy being aggressively integrated into the grid, energy supplies are becoming vulnerable to weather and the environment, and are often incapable of meeting population demands at a large scale if not accurately predicted for energy planning. Understanding consumers' power demands ahead of time and the influences of weather on consumption and generation can help producers generate effective power management plans to support the target demand. In addition to the high correlation with the environment, consumers' behaviors also cause non-stationary characteristics of energy data, which is the main challenge for energy prediction. In this survey, we perform a review of the literature on prediction methods in the energy field. So far, most of the available research encompasses one type of generation or consumption. There is no research approaching prediction in the energy sector as a whole and its correlated features. We propose to address the energy prediction challenges from both consumption and generation sides, encompassing techniques from statistical to machine learning techniques. We also summarize the work related to energy prediction, electricity measurements, challenges related to energy consumption and generation, energy forecasting methods, and real-world energy forecasting resources, such as datasets and software solutions for energy prediction.

  abstract     = {Forecasting soil moisture is critical for keeping groundwater levels stable, monitoring droughts, and assisting agricultural productivity. Surface soil moisture has a tremendous impact on both the environment and society. To provide proper soil moisture, the right tools are required. Gravimetric, physical, and empirical models produce reliable results, but they are generally context-dependent and inappropriate for large-scale investigations. Remote sensing has developed as a credible technology for estimating large-scale soil moisture levels. However, various obstacles exist when getting soil moisture data using remote sensing, including the availability and precision of data sources. The spatial and temporal limits of many remote sensing sources, such as microwave and optical sensors, combined with environmental conditions, provide considerable feasibility issues. As a result, a robust model capable of accurately capturing both linear and nonlinear connections between multiple surface soil variables is critical. Recently, AI approaches have been identified as promising options for managing complicated factors in this domain. This review paper investigates the use of several AI algorithms for estimating soil moisture content (SMC). It focusses on AI-enabled frameworks built with remote sensing satellite imagery. In addition to including in situ observations, the study discusses the advantages of AI approaches, the issues they solve, and provides a detailed description of the integration of microwave, optical, and combination (synergistic) data sources. This paper also addresses the most common AI approaches applied with various types of remote sensing data and the results they produced. By exploring the strengths and technical problems associated with diverse data sources, this work hopes to help researchers make wise choices about data selection and model construction. Finally, the proposed future research directions are likely to assist emerging researchers in broadening the scope of this critical topic in a way that corresponds with future demands.

  abstract     = {Intracranial hemorrhage (IH) is a critical condition requiring rapid and accurate diagnosis to ensure effective treatment and reduce mortality rates. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) models have demonstrated significant potential in automating the detection and analysis of brain injuries in IH patients. However, the “black-box” nature of many AI systems raises concerns about transparency, reliability, and clinical applicability. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses these challenges by making AI models more interpretable, allowing healthcare professionals to understand and trust the decision-making processes. This review paper explores various XAI techniques—such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation (RISE), Class Activation Mapping (CAM), and its variants—and their specific applications in IH clinical tasks. We systematically examine studies incorporating XAI for curing IH patients, highlighting how these methods enhance model transparency and support clinical decision-making. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology was employed to select the papers. Studies are categorized into those using tabular data and those using image data. The literature indicates a rapidly growing number of XAI publications in this field. SHAP is the most commonly used XAI method for tabular data, while CAM-based methods, such as Grad-CAM, dominate in image-based applications. Furthermore, we discuss current limitations of XAI methods and future research directions. This review aims to provide researchers and clinicians with valuable insights into the role of XAI in improving the reliability and practical integration of AI-driven tools for IH patient care.

  abstract     = {Chronic diseases (CDs) present a global health challenge due to their complex, overlapping symptoms and the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Meta-Heuristic Optimization (MHO) algorithms, have emerged as powerful tools for addressing these challenges. This review examines ML and MHO-based approaches for the multi-classification of CDs, highlighting how MHO enhances ML frameworks by addressing key limitations such as class imbalance and suboptimal feature selection. Despite these advancements, MHO-based methods face challenges, including computational complexity and algorithmic biases, which require further research. By critically analyzing existing studies and identifying gaps, this paper provides a foundation for developing more robust and efficient diagnostic models for CDs.

  abstract     = {The success of social media platforms has facilitated the emergence of various forms of online abuse within digital communities. This abuse manifests in multiple ways, including hate speech, cyberbullying, emotional abuse, grooming, and shame sexting or sextortion. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the different forms of abuse prevalent in social media, with a particular focus on how emerging technologies, such as Language Models (LMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), are reshaping both the detection and generation of abusive content within these networks. We delve into the mechanisms through which social media abuse is perpetuated, exploring the psychological and social impact. To achieve this, we conducted a literature review based on PRISMA methodology, deriving key insights in the field of cyber abuse detection. Additionally, we examine the dual role of advanced language models—highlighting their potential to enhance automated detection systems for abusive behavior while also acknowledging their capacity to generate harmful content. This paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on online safety and ethics by offering both theoretical and practical insights into the evolving landscape of cyber abuse, as well as the technological innovations that simultaneously mitigate and exacerbate it. The findings support platform administrators and policymakers in developing more effective moderation strategies, conducting comprehensive risk assessments, and integrating AI responsibly to create safer digital environments.
