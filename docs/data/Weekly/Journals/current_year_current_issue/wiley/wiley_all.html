  abstract     = {Cyber-attacks pose a security threat to military command and control networks, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, and civilian critical national infrastructure. The use of artificial intelligence and autonomous agents in these attacks increases the scale, range, and complexity of this threat and the subsequent disruption they cause. Autonomous Cyber Defence (ACD) agents aimto mitigate this threat by responding at machine speed and at the scale required to address the problem. Additionally, they reduce the burden on the limited number of human cyber experts available to respond to an attack. Sequential decision-making algorithms such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) provide a promising route to create ACD agents. These algorithms focus on a single objectivesuch as minimising the intrusion of red agents on the network, by using a handcrafted weighted sum of rewards. This approach removes the ability to adapt the model during inference, and fails to address the many competing objectivespresent when operating and protecting these networks. Conflicting objectives, such as restoring a machine from a back-up image, must be carefully balanced with the cost of associated down-time or the disruption to network traffic or services that might result. Instead of pursuing a Single-Objective RL (SORL) approach, here we present a simple example of a multi-objective network defense game that requires consideration of both defending the network against red-agents and maintaining the critical functionality of green-agents. Two Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms, namely Multi-Objective Proximal Policy Optimization (MOPPO) and Pareto-Conditioned Networks (PCN), are used to create two trained ACD agents whose performance is compared on our Multi-Objective Cyber Defense game. The benefits and limitations of MORL ACD agents in comparison to SORL ACD agents are discussed based on the investigations of this game.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a hybrid methodology for evaluating leading retail companies based on customer perspectives, combining Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven sentiment analysis with fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM). The framework integrates large-scale customer review analysis with expert decision-making to provide a comprehensive assessment of retail performance. The process begins with AI-based text mining to collect and analyze customer reviews, extracting emotional tones and identifying frequently mentioned criteria. Expert judgment is then applied to refine, organize, and assign importance to these criteria. The q-rung orthopair fuzzy set MCDM methodology is employed to address uncertainty, conflicting objectives, and qualitative expert opinions by translating them into a structured quantitative evaluation. This hybrid approach offers a balanced assessment that combines subjective and objective dimensions. As a case study, 2000 customer reviews from each of four major U.S. retailers—Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and Target—were analyzed to derive key evaluation criteria based on user feedback. The proposed method distinguishes itself through its unique integration of sentiment analysis and decision-makers' expert evaluations, enabling a holistic and robust evaluation of alternatives. By bridging customer perceptions with expert analysis, this methodology provides a deeper, more nuanced understanding of retailer performance, contributing to improved supplier selection and business decision-making processes. A second analysis, enabled by this methodology, also highlighted key performance differences among the retailers in areas such as customer service, delivery experience, and return/refund processes. Among the findings, Target and Amazon showed the strongest overall sentiment performance, while Costco excelled in return policies and Walmart exhibited weaker results in customer service and delivery. As a result, this hybrid methodology offers valuable insights for both decision-makers aiming to optimize supplier selection and customers seeking better shopping experiences.},

  abstract     = {This review evaluates classical machine learning-based hypertension prediction models, emphasizing their role in addressing global health burdens , particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Hypertension affects over 1.28 billion people globally and contributes to cardiovascular disease and mortality. The review compares machine-learning techniques with traditional methods, focusing on key datasets, evaluation metrics, and model development to advance early detection and effective hypertension management. The review used the PRISMA framework, using databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE explorer to identify studies published between 2020 and 2024 on machine learning techniques, predictive models, and early detection of hypertension based on relevance, methodological rigor, and inclusion criteria. The study analyzed hypertension prediction models across various countries, including the US, England, Korea, Japan, China, Indonesia, Thailand, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and several African countries. The models' performance varied with AUC statistic values ranging from 0.6 to 0.9, indicating a wide range of predictive accuracy. Machine learning techniques generally reported higher performance metrics than traditional statistical methods. Risk factor heterogeneity was evident, with models like random forest, logistic regression, and gradient-boosted trees showing high predictive accuracy. Emerging techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and ensemble methods improved unbalanced data set performance. The review explores the potential of machine learning-based hypertension prediction models in healthcare, highlighting their ability to accurately predict hypertension risk, tailor interventions to specific populations, and optimize healthcare resources in low- and middle-income countries. However, challenges include data quality, model explainability, and ethical considerations. Despite these, ML integration offers scalable and cost-effective solutions, especially in resource-limited settings. Future research should focus on diverse datasets, advanced feature integration, and longitudinal validations.},

  abstract     = {The sterile insect technique (SIT) represents a highly effective and promising method for combating tsetse fly-related infections, which involves the release of sterilized male tsetse flies in the assigned zones. However, tsetse fly rearing poses specific challenges, particularly in the tsetse sex separation, as this process is labor-intensive and incurs significant costs. Here, we report a simple model that classifies tsetse flies by sex using an object detection model based on the YOLO algorithm. This paper also conducted a comparative analysis of YOLOv8 and YOLO11 deep learning models, focusing on their efficacy in tsetse fly detection and classification using a range of performance metrics and statistical analysis. The findings reveal that the classification accuracy of YOLO11 stands at 97.6%, whereas YOLOv8 achieves 95.6%. The classification precision of YOLO11 in identifying tsetse flies is 88.6%, while that of YOLOv8 is 85.9%. Additionally, YOLO11 demonstrates an inference speed of 13.0 ms, slightly faster than YOLOv8's 13.4 ms in tsetse sex detection. Moreover, YOLO11 outperformed YOLOv8 in both F1 score and mAP@0.5–0.9, a success attributed to its enhanced architectural design. However, statistical tests indicate there is no significant difference between the two models, achieving p values ≥ 0.05 for all metrics. This study adds value to tsetse rearing and fly-based disease control by offering automated tsetse sex detection insights into its practical uses in real-world contexts. Furthermore, this research enriches the understanding of the two models with tsetse flies as the focal point and recommends a more effective and accurate detection approach. Finally, integrating the model with the mobile object detection Android app will reduce tsetse sex sorting dependency on experienced technical experts and enhance tsetse rearing productivity.},

Repetitiveness is a common characteristic of human behavior. Repetitiveness indicates which node is updated frequently and its importance. A chatbot needs to solve a situation regarding how quickly it will access its neural memory to retrieve information. Thus, the ranking of nodes in a neural network is necessary to allocate them to the chatbot's memory. The proposed ranking methodology takes affinity, number of edges, adjacency, average weight, and update time interval parameters into account to calculate the ranked value of each node. After that, a ranking tree is generated. This tree is finally considered the memory navigation path in that neural graph. If a node updates regularly with each clock pulse, which resembles a repetitive task, then its ranked value increases. This node should get preference over other low-ranked nodes. This study provides an approach to convert a neural graph into a ranking tree and a path to navigate through it. Thus, the chatbot can identify which node is more promising and has a shorter path than other nodes for information retrieval.},

It divides these numbers into nine groups based on their first digit, with the largest category comprising numbers beginning with 1, followed by those starting with 2, and so on. Each neuron within a neural network (NN) is associated with a numerical value called a weight, which is updated according to specific functions. This research examines the Degree of Benford's Law Existence (DBLE) across two language model methodologies: (1) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and (2) long short-term memory (LSTM). Additionally, this study investigates whether models with higher performance exhibit a stronger presence of DBLE. Two neural network language models, namely: (1) simple RNN and (2) LSTM, were selected as the subject models for the experiment. Each model is tested with five different optimizers and four different datasets (textual corpora selected from Wikipedia). This results in a total of 20 different configurations for each model. The neuron weights for each configuration were extracted at each epoch, and the following metrics were measured at each epoch: (1) DBLE, (2) training set accuracy, (3) training set error, (4) test set accuracy, and (5) test set error. The results show that the weights in both models, across all optimizers, follow Benford's Law. Additionally, the findings indicate a strong correlation between DBLE and the performance on the training set in both language models. This means that models with higher performance on the training set exhibit a stronger correlation of DBLE.},

In this paper, thematic analysis has been performed on unstructured opinions obtained from 11 experts about the integration of LLMs in the field of software development to understand their benefits and limitations using two natural language processing (NLP) techniques: sentiment analysis and keyword extraction and analysis. Sentiment analysis suggests that most experts were optimistic and pragmatic about the use of generative artificial intelligence in software development, although some experts engaged in critical reflection.

  abstract     = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to become an essential tool for defending against machine-speed attacks on increasingly connected cyber networks and systems. It will allow self-defending and self-recovering cyber-defence agents to be developed, which can respond to attacks in a timely manner. But how can these agents be trusted to perform as expected, and how can they be evaluated responsibly and thoroughly? To answer these questions, a Test and Evaluation (T&E) process has been developed to assess cyber-defence agents. The process evaluates the performance, effectiveness, resilience, and generalizability of agents in both low- and high-fidelity cyber environments. This paper demonstrates the low-fidelity part of the process by performing an example evaluation in the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment on Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents trained as part of Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 2. The process makes use of novel Measures of Effectiveness (MoE) metrics, which can be used in combination with performance metrics such as the RL reward. MoE are tailored for cyber defence, allowing a greater understanding of agents' defensive abilities within a cyber environment. Agents are evaluated against multiple conditions that perturb the environment to investigate their robustness to scenarios not seen during training. The results from this evaluation process will help inform decisions around the benefits and risks of integrating autonomous agents into existing or future cyber systems.},

  abstract     = {The brain tumor grows abnormally in the human brain, which causes brain cancer. Death rates have been rising annually for the past few decades due to negligence of early treatment of brain tumors. To reduce the death rate, early identification of tumors is crucial. Early brain tumor detection may potentially lower the risk of life. Manual tumor diagnosis is complex, challenging, and time-consuming for medical professionals. Therefore, automatic detection and segmentation methods simplify the diagnosing procedure. Thus, automatic segmentation and classification methods are taken up to make the diagnosis process easy. This research proposes a two-dimensional cumulative sum average filter (2D-CSAF) for preprocessing images and an improved deviation sparse fuzzy C-means (IDSFCM) with neighbor information for segmenting brain tumors from magnetic resonance images. The novel IDSFCM segmentation increases the noise reduction capability and enhances segmentation accuracies. The hybrid modified sine cosine algorithm-crow search algorithm (MSCA-CSA)–based WELM model is proposed to classify the brain tumor. The MSCA-CSA algorithm optimizes the weights of the WELM model to increase the classification capability. The gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) feature extraction technique is employed to extract the features from the segmented images, and extracted features are given as input to the MSCA-CSA-WELM model for classification. The brain tumor dataset from Harvard Medical School is considered for this research. The proposed IDSFCM segmentation achieved 99.53% segmentation accuracy. The accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity performance measures are considered for the classification. The classification performance was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics. The proposed MSCA-CSA–based WELM model outperformed feature extraction–based classifiers, achieving 99.37% accuracy, 99.87% sensitivity, and 99.44% specificity during training.},

  abstract     = {A neurodevelopmental illness called autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is frequently associated with sensory problems including an excessive or insufficient sensitivity to noises, scents, or touch. Children with autism typically do not talk much and keep to themselves, but they can imitate certain actions from cartoons and movies. They may exhibit unsafe or unexpected behavior as a result. Early detection and therapy can assist in improving the diseases. In this study, we suggested a data-driven machine learning (ML) model for examining the autism dataset of diverse age groups (toddlers, children, and adults) to classify autism in the initial stage. The proposed ML model can efficiently analyze autism patients’ datasets and correctly classify and detect ASD features. We utilized a data preprocessing technique followed by feature selection methods using information gain and Pearson correlation. Then, we employed five different ML classifiers (KNN, RF, SVM, NB, and MLP) together with a hyperparameter optimization strategy. We assess their work using performance metrics such as prediction accuracy and the F1-measure. After comparing the accuracy between different classifiers, SVM produced the highest accuracies of 98%, 99%, and 100% for the toddler, child, and adult datasets while MLP produced an accuracy of 0.94 for the Pakistani child dataset, respectively. These thorough experimental assessments suggest that correct fine-tuning of the ML techniques can be crucial in the classification of autism in individuals of various ages. We believe that the thorough feature significance analysis presented in this study can guide medical professionals’ judgment when screening ASD individuals. In comparison with other methods currently used for the timely identification of ASD, the suggested framework has shown encouraging results.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of the digital age, data have become insecure, which requires techniques to secure data. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has become an increasingly secure technology for storing next-generation digital data. DNA provides superior capabilities due to its high and efficient storage capacity and long lifespan. Protecting these data is of utmost importance, especially data with sensitive content. In this study, the proposed encryption algorithm is a new and novel contribution; a new cryptographic methodology is presented that leverages the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank to create cryptographic keys. This key dictionary is created by nucleotide sequences created from the GenBank database. The proposed methodology uses databases such as the National Center GenBank, which contains huge repositories of genetic information, to improve the effectiveness of data security. By converting traditional digital data into DNA sequences, this methodology provides new features of cryptographic protection. The security and reliability of the proposed methodology were thoroughly tested through simulation and data analysis. The results indicate that the proposed encryption methodology has a superior ability to withstand many types of cryptographic attacks, which confirms its effectiveness and strength in data protection. The paper also presented several findings, including a low encryption time of 250 ms and decryption time of 230 ms, as well as a memory usage of 50 MB for large datasets. Furthermore, the proposed method demonstrated exceptionally high stability. Across all these metrics, the proposed approach outperformed other existing methods. The proposed methodology is applicable to ensure the security and integrity of DNA-based digital storage systems. This methodology was developed independently and has not been previously studied. This modern methodology represents an advance in digital data security and protection, providing an advanced solution in the digital age of cybersecurity.},

Models explored for regression in this paper include linear regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN).

This study developed a neural network classifier to determine the nutritional requirements for four types of Type 2 diabetic patients: those with chronic hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity, or all three conditions. The classifier was trained using Kenya Food Composition Tables data on food nutrients and processing techniques. The neural network had five layers, including three hidden layers with 10 neurons each, using tanh and sigmoid activation functions, gradient descent optimization, cross-entropy loss function, and 0.1 learning rate. Training used 40 hidden neurons per layer, 60,000 epochs and 0.2 learning rate. The neural network was evaluated against random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). The neural network achieved high performance with 91.4% accuracy, 88% recall, 86.8% precision, and 87.3% F1-score.

  abstract     = {The prevailing method for grading oil palm fruit bunches in mills relies on human graders conducting visual inspections, resulting in frequent errors and inconsistent assessments. This is a significant open problem when developing a detector for oil palm fruit ripeness and oil content, which are related factors. Current trends focus on computer vision techniques based on image processing and machine learning to improve grading of oil palm fruit bunches at an individual factory, resulting in limited diversity of the data used for evaluation. Collecting data from all factories offers informational advantages but raises privacy concerns. Addressing these challenges, this study proposes federated learning (FL) to develop local and global prediction models for grading oil palm fruit ripeness while preserving data privacy. FL facilitates collaborative model training across factories, mitigating privacy risks and enhancing model development efficiency. The proposed model uses the color of palm husks to determine the ripeness stage, which is used as a factor in predicting the yield of oil from the crop. A predictive model was created using FL principles with a training dataset of 5209 images, which was divided into two subsets: single-palm (2571 images) and multipalm (2638 images). The classification accuracy of a global model was 90.0%, while the local models were expanded to include private data for each of 4 testing clients. The predictive global and local models from FL were used to implement the system in a web application form and to validate its performance in calling the oil palm ripeness stage.},

Proper garbage waste processing, management, and recycling are crucial for both ecological and economic reasons. Computer vision techniques have shown advanced capabilities in various applications, including object detection and classification. In this study, we conducted an extensive review of the use of artificial intelligence for garbage processing and management. However, a major limitation in this field is the lack of datasets containing top-view images of garbage. We introduce a new dataset named “KACHARA,” containing 4727 images categorized into seven classes: clothes, decomposable (organic waste), glass, metal, paper, plastic, and wood. Importantly, the dataset exhibits a moderate imbalance, mirroring the distribution of real-world garbage, which is crucial for training accurate classification models. For classification, we utilize transfer learning with the well-known deep learning model MobileNetV3-Large, where the top layers are fine-tuned to enhance performance. We achieved a classification accuracy of 94.37% and also evaluated performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. These results demonstrate the model’s strong generalization in aerial/top-view garbage classification.},

This study proposes an AutoGluon–Shapley additive explanations (AutoGluon-SHAP) approach, which automatically predicts concrete mechanical strength while providing insightful interpretations of the results. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to enhance global accessibility to the model. AutoGluon leverages powerful algorithms such as LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, random forest, ensembles, and neural networks within its TabularPredictor to automate model selection. The models were trained and tested using a comprehensive dataset of 1760 concrete samples sourced from the published literature, encompassing diverse concrete types, cement brands, additives, target compressive strengths, and curing periods. Results show that the WeightedEnsemble_L2 predictive model demonstrated robust performance in estimating flexural, tensile, and compressive strengths. All the predictive models achieved high performance with R 2 of more than 0.98 for all the strengths’ properties. SHAP offered both global insights into the influence of the predictors on mechanical strength and local explanations for individual predictions, ensuring transparency and reliability.

This study presents a comprehensive hybrid modeling approach to predict oil prices in the context of Russia and Ukraine across three distinct periods: before the war, during the war, and the immediate aftermath of the conflict. Using advanced machine learning techniques, we developed a hybrid system combining Random Forest, ElasticNet, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regressor models. These models were integrated through a Voting Regressor to enhance prediction accuracy. Our analysis revealed varying levels of predictive performance across the different periods. Prior to the war, the models showed strong predictive capabilities, evidenced by low mean-squared error (MSE) values and high coefficients of determination ( R 2 ). However, during the war, the models struggled to capture extreme volatility, resulting in significantly increased MSE and negative R 2 values. Predictions for the immediate aftermath of the conflict demonstrated improvements, with a reduction in MSE and positive R 2 values, indicating a return to relatively more stable market conditions. Notably, combining data from both before the war and war periods could further improve predictive accuracy, as it would reduce the impact of the conflict’s volatility on model performance. These results emphasize the challenges of forecasting oil prices in periods of geopolitical instability and underscore the importance of hybrid modeling approaches to adapt to rapidly changing market dynamics.},

In this study, we propose an efficient approach combining dynamic contrast stretching (DCS) method, advanced morphological operation–based segmentation, triangle thresholding, and a final postprocessing step. Our preprocessing step enhances the contrast of retinal images acquired under various lighting conditions, enabling reliable and accurate segmentation. This enhancement is achieved using the DCS method, which is compared to two widely used contrast enhancement techniques: adaptive histogram equalization (AHE) and contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). The second step combines morphological operations and triangle thresholding to enhance vessel structures, eliminate noise, and separate blood vessels effectively. Postprocessing addresses artifacts and ambiguous areas at image boundaries. Our approach is evaluated using widely recognized reference datasets, including Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE), Structured Analysis of the Retina (STARE), and High-Resolution Fundus (HRF). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior segmentation accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. Specifically, we achieve average accuracy rates of 98.08%, 97.14%, and 98.94% for the DRIVE, STARE, and HRF datasets, respectively. In addition, our method is distinguished by exceptionally fast execution times, reaching 0.013 s for the DRIVE and STARE datasets.

  abstract     = {Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the virus has posed a grave threat to human health. Automated segmentation of COVID-19 lung computed tomography (CT) scans is a crucial diagnostic tool that aids physicians in providing accurate and timely diagnoses, as it contains significant radiomics information. Given that the specificity for discriminating between the causes of conventional pulmonary features is lower than its sensitivity, the primary goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a CT-based radiomics model capable of distinguishing between COVID-19 and other lung diseases. To address this, we propose an efficient, modified radiomics feature processing method that integrates an optimal aerial perspective (OAP) parameter-based intensity dark channel prior (IDCP) with a 50-layer residual deep neural network (ResNet50 DNN) for autolesion segmentation (ALS-IOAP-DNN). To further enhance COVID-19 lesion estimation, novel optimization strategies, including a hybrid simulated annealing-cuckoo search (SA-CS) algorithm, are introduced alongside the original SA method. The SA-CS algorithm extends SA by preventing entrapment in local minimum and enhancing global exploration. Five benchmark functions are used to accelerate convergence and address the issue of local optima. As a result, the hybrid approach outperforms 10 recent studies on two publicly available datasets (COVID-CT-Dataset and HUST-19), achieving an average accuracy score of 100% across different epochs, along with perfect accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 100% specificity. The proposed models significantly outperform the baseline model, with accuracy improvements of 13.6% on Data1 and 2.5% on Data2. While the baseline model achieves 88% accuracy on Data1 and 97.6% on Data2, the proposed ALS-IOAP-DNN4 model attains perfect accuracy (100%) on both datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of ALS and advanced optimization techniques. Furthermore, the use of OAP with IDCP enhances the precision of COVID-19 lesion estimation, underscoring its significance in COVID-19 diagnosis and medical imaging management.},

Highly accurate and reliable T w forecasts are essential for the ecological management of rivers. This study evaluates the performance of machine learning-based predictive models in forecasting T w in the Catu River. The models were trained using climatic and hydrological data collected from 2009 to 2016 and validated with real data from 2023. The evaluated models include backpropagation neural network (BPNN), Random Forest, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Air2Stream, and NARX, employing nine input variables such as atmospheric pressure, air temperature, and water vapor concentration. The results show that the BiLSTM model achieved the best performance, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12°C and R 2 = 0.98, followed by BPNN with an RMSE of 0.18°C and R 2 = 0.91, and the Random Forest model, which obtained an NSE of 0.95. These models demonstrated a strong ability to predict T w under both normal and extreme conditions, capturing the thermal dynamics of the Catu River with high precision during events involving minor thermal variations. Conversely, the NARX and Air2Stream models exhibited lower performance, proving more prone to errors under conditions of extreme variability. The findings of this study provide valuable scientific insights for river T w prediction and the protection of aquatic ecosystems, with practical applications in water resource management in tropical regions.},

  abstract     = {Biometric security systems must be able to detect phony fingerprints to provide reliable authentication. The findings of this study suggest a hybrid approach to the detection of fake fingerprints that uses information on the texture and shape of the fingerprint. The novelty of this approach lies in integrating both traditional fingerprint information and geometric features obtained through wavelet transformation, which has not been extensively explored in previous studies. The proposed procedure uses the traditional fingerprint information and the geometric features that may be collected by wavelet modification. This allows it to take advantage of the complementary capabilities that these two types of capabilities offer. In addition, the hybrid feature set improves the system’s robustness and accuracy by leveraging each feature type’s unique strengths. To achieve this goal, the standard fingerprint information and the geometric aspects of the fingerprint are combined. It is possible to efficiently identify authentic and forged fingerprints by using these hybrid features and training a gradient boosting classifier. The findings of the studies demonstrate that the suggested technique achieves an accuracy of 96% on medium spoofing photos from the SOCOFing dataset, 97% on hard spoofing images, and 98% on mixed spoofing images. This high level of accuracy, especially on mixed spoofing images, showcases the effectiveness of the novel hybrid approach in diverse and challenging scenarios. This places it in the position of being the most accurate way currently accessible among the existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed method’s scalability and adaptability make it suitable for real-world applications, potentially setting a new standard in biometric security. There is a great deal of optimism that the technique that has been described can increase the reliability and safety of biometric systems when used in situations representative of the actual world.},

This study proposes an efficient spectrum-sharing technique for dual-hop CRNs using NOMA, optimized by an improved artificial bee colony (IABC) algorithm and guided by a single-input single-output fuzzy rule-based system (SISO-FRBS). In this setup, a distant primary transmitter communicates with the primary receiver via a secondary NOMA relay. The objective is to maximize the sum data rate of secondary users (SUs) while minimizing total transmission power. SISO-FRBS enhances the IABC search process by dynamically guiding the search agents, improving both optimization quality and convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves the primary data rate benchmark of 5 bit/s/Hz at a transmit power of 19 mW, compared with 23 mW with traditional ABC, achieving a 19.04% improvement in power efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Computer vision plays a crucial role in current day tasks due to its wide range of merits and applications in many fields like disease diagnosis, medical decisions, military, security, scientific applications, and business. Identifying plant species upon their leaf images is a very challenging and complex task. In this study, we introduced a model for classifying a variety set of plant leaves using different techniques such as factorization machine (FM), dimensionality reduction (DR), and ensemble learning (EL). In our study, FM is used as a classification algorithm, whereas DR is included in two stages, namely, feature extraction (FE) and feature selection (FS). FE has been used to extract the features from images in tabular form; on the other hand, FS is used to reduce the size of the data by getting rid of noisy (redundant and irrelevant) features. In addition, we utilized two methods for FS, filter-based and wrapper-based approaches. The used filter was the minimum redundancy maximum relevance, and the used wrapper was the improved binary cuckoo search algorithm that is based on Lévy flight and abandon nest functions. Regarding EL, it was used to declare different versions of FM by passing different subsets of features that are deduced from the original ones to improve its performance. We used the Swedish and Flavia leaf datasets for training and testing phases. The proposed model achieved a high performance in terms of accuracy that produced 95.67% on Swedish dataset and 99.6% on Flavia dataset. According to the results and in comparison to other methods, we proved that our proposed model ensures a favorable plant leaf classification approach. Finally, the proposed wrapper FS approach showed very good results without setting up the number of features to be selected by the user.

Recently, there has been an increase in the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in hydrogeology to estimate GWL in monitoring wells. This study presents a novel technique for predicting GWL changes that uses three independent datasets: historical GWL and climatic variables (CVs) data such as rainfall and temperature influencing groundwater dynamics. In our experimental research, the models’ prediction output on real-world datasets ensures that the model’s significant patterns are recorded while taking into account the noise in the data, resulting in a perfect balance of bias and variance. The DL models’ results show a significant score of root mean square error (RMSE) between 2.20 and 12.40 and coefficient of determination ( R -squared between 0.84–0.99), showing a significant improvement in RMSE and mean absolute error (MAE) in the testing and validation categories, when compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. This study improves our understanding of GWL modeling and provides decision-makers with a reliable tool for controlling change. The study advances environmental modeling by exhibiting methodological complexity and emphasizes the importance of comprehensive data analysis in water resource management.},

  abstract     = {Stroke disease has been the leading cause of death globally for the last several decades. Thus, the death rate can be decreased by early recognition of disease and ongoing surveillance. However, the largest obstacle to perform advanced analytics using the conventional approach is the growth of massive amount of data from various sources, including patient histories, wearable sensor devices, and medical data. The current technology that could have a large impact on the healthcare sector is the integration of machine learning with big data analytics (scalable machine learning), particularly in the early diagnosis of this disease. To address this issue, a scalable stroke disease prediction model for a multinode distributed environment, which was developed by combining big data analytics concepts with machine learning to handle extensive healthcare datasets, an aspect not seen in the prior literature on stroke disease detection, is presented in this work. We have implemented four scalable algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient-boosting tree, and decision tree, using a dataset that was collected from a Medical Quality Improvement Consortium database. As a result, two worker nodes and one master node were used to analyze the dataset. The model’s performance was assessed using performance metrics including the area under the curve (AUC) and confusion matrix. With an accuracy of 94.3% and an AUC score of 99%, the random forest was determined to be better based on the experimental results. It was also shown that the main risk factor for stroke disease is diabetes, which is followed by hypertension. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of using Spark’s scalable machine learning techniques to forecast stroke disease and identify risk factors earlier. The findings of this study can be utilized by physicians as clinical decision aids to aid in the more accurate identification of stroke disease.},

  abstract     = {The accurate prediction of subscriber traffic is a critical challenge in telecommunication networks, as it is essential for making informed decisions to maintain consistent service quality. Various artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been explored for this purpose, with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) being particularly popular. However, RNNs often suffer from the gradient vanishing problem, which reduces their effectiveness in processing long sequences of data. Long short–term memory (LSTM) networks partially address this issue by controlling the propagation of learning errors, but they still face challenges related to convergence speed and residual learning errors. To address these limitations, this study proposes a new hybrid RNN architecture that combines features of Jordan and Frasconi networks for improved subscriber traffic prediction. The proposed architecture integrates two sublayers, a sigmoid and a Gaussian function, within a hidden layer that forms a loop. This configuration enables the network to leverage incremental learning through restricted Coulomb energy (RCE) at the local level, while also benefiting from global learning through backpropagation. The architecture was tested on a dataset consisting of cellular traffic data collected from a telecommunication operator in Cameroon. The results demonstrated that the hybrid RNN model outperforms traditional Jordan and Frasconi networks, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 14.18 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.61 using the Adam optimizer with a batch size of 64. In addition, the hybrid model showed superior performance in terms of RMSE, MAE, and convergence speed compared to the existing models. These findings suggest that the proposed model could support telecom operators in proactive congestion management and resource optimization.},

Unfortunately, traditional approaches to predicting readmissions frequently lack accuracy. This presents a critical challenge, as identifying patients at high risk for readmission is essential for implementing preventive measures. The study introduces a novel method that employs machine learning to automatically extract features from patient data, eliminating labor-intensive manual feature engineering. The primary goal is to develop predictive models for unplanned readmissions for UTI patients at Jordan University Hospital within 3 months postdischarge. This is executed through a retrospective analysis of electronic health records from January 2020 to June 2023. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the study identifies high-risk patients by evaluating demographic, clinical, and outcome characteristics, ensuring model reliability through thorough optimization, validation, and performance assessment. Three predictive models were developed as follows: a gradient-boosting classifier (GBC), logistic regression (LR), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The GBC, SGD, and LR achieved impressive accuracy rates of 99%, 95%, and 89%, providing strong confidence in the methodology. The study’s findings reveal key risk factors associated with readmissions, enhancing our understanding of this process and offering a valuable framework for improving patient care, optimizing resource allocation, and supporting evidence-based decision-making in healthcare management.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is characterized by abnormal cell growth, which leads to tumor formation. Autonomous breast cancer detection has seen good progress. However, there are still several challenges to robust detection. This survey article explores the complexities inherent in multiclass classification for breast cancer diagnosis, aiming to improve patient care, efficiency, and timeliness. In our study, we focus on using histopathology slide images and assess the current state of breast cancer classification, particularly with artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning and convolutional neural networks. The histopathology images are key tools in the diagnosis process, allowing pathologists to visually assess tissue samples for signs of cancer. Our analysis reveals several challenges that hinder the effectiveness of current diagnostic methods. One significant issue is the need for more diversity in the existing datasets, which often fail to represent a wide range of patient populations. This limitation reduces the accuracy of diagnostic results, mainly when applied to different clinical environments. Furthermore, class imbalances within these datasets, where certain cancer types or stages are underrepresented, lead to biased diagnoses, with more common cases being easily identified while rarer cases are frequently missed. Another challenge is the limited generalizability of current diagnostic techniques, which perform well in controlled environments but often need to improve when applied to new, unseen data from different institutions or imaging systems. Additionally, the complexity of histopathological analysis means that it can be difficult for clinicians to interpret certain findings, leading to uncertainty in the diagnostic process. Our study reveals that addressing these issues requires collaborative efforts to improve the quality of datasets, reduce class imbalances, and develop optimal standardized diagnostic methods. By overcoming these challenges, we can enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility of breast cancer diagnosis, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and global healthcare. We believe that by examining several factors and variables and conducting an in-depth analysis of the state of the art, this study will contribute to the state of the art and benefit researchers in both computing and medical domains.},

  abstract     = {In today’s mobile communication society, the integration of mobile technology in education has revolutionised learning through m-Learning. This approach leverages wireless mobile technology and computing, enabling learners to access educational resources anytime and anywhere, thereby enhancing flexibility and freedom. Mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets and PDAs, facilitate m-Learning by providing mobility and interactive learning environments. M-Learning is characterised by its personalised, collaborative, and ubiquitous nature, offering learners context-aware experiences tailored to their immediate surroundings and needs. Context awareness plays a pivotal role in m-Learning, distinguishing it from traditional education by dynamically adapting content delivery based on factors beyond just location, including time, network conditions and user preferences. This adaptability poses significant challenges in designing effective teaching strategies that meet diverse learner requirements. To address these challenges, this study explores the application of machine learning techniques—specifically “Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS)”—in developing a Context-Aware m-Learning platform. Performance comparisons based on RMSE, MAE and accuracy metrics reveal ANFIS as the optimal method for enhancing the proposed m-Learning system, aligning with the contextual demands and parameters defined for effective mobile education. ANFIS’s ability to minimise absolute prediction errors more effectively than the other methods. In terms of accuracy, ANFIS again leads the performance metrics, achieving an accuracy of 82.46% with 10 neurons. In comparison, ANN and KNN achieved accuracies of 81.17% and 80.74%, respectively. These accuracy values indicate that ANFIS not only reduces prediction errors but also consistently delivers higher predictive accuracy.

  abstract     = {As smart cities have evolved through the constant incorporation of advanced technologies such as Internet of Things, the importance of efficient data collection and robust security monitoring has increased massively. These smart cities, while monitoring and evaluating different activities, utilize a network of interconnected sensors and devices. This would not only enhance the provision of public services but also ensure increased safety measures. However, the extensive implementation of such systems has increased the concerns related to privacy and data protection. The growing dependence on surveillance technology in smart cities, though beneficial in terms of security, has also increased challenges associated with the protection of individual privacy. As such, different research has been conducted to develop advanced solutions that ensure the security of an individual while also safeguarding their personal privacy. This study examines the different aspects of privacy preservation in the context of security surveillance in smart cities. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of 100 research articles, it elucidates the current state of research and identifies emerging solutions aimed at safeguarding citizen privacy while simultaneously upholding the integrity of smart urban environments.},

This research investigates the application of deep feature extraction for classifying eight different ocular diseases. The VGG16, a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model, was employed for feature extraction, while the fine k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier was utilized for classification. Experimental results showed an initial classification accuracy of 89.2% using features from Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) heatmaps and 83.1% using Multiscale Retinex (MSR) enhanced images. However, combining both feature sets led to an improved classification accuracy of 96.5%. Despite these promising results, several challenges remain, including the need for models that generalize across diverse patient imaging and demographics modalities, the accessibility of extensive annotated datasets, and the interpretability of models. Ethical issues and legal frameworks are also crucial for the safe and fair implementation of AI in medical services. The study suggests that future efforts in deep learning for ophthalmology should focus on creating large-scale, annotated datasets to enhance the detection of ocular diseases.},

The models were trained using historical price, weather, and rainfall data using time-series forecasting methods, specifically LSTM and CNN. The findings indicate that stepwise feature selection minimizes prediction errors and improves MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and MAE. Preliminary experiments revealed that the LSTM model with feature selection outperformed the other models, particularly in feature selection. Employing standard hyperparameters of 100 epochs, 32 batches, and five windows, the model demonstrated superior performance with a lower MSE (0.0010), RMSE (0.0274), MAPE (3.7803), and MAE (0.0158) than the CNN model. Statistical hypothesis testing revealed significant variations between the LSTM and CNN models, with feature selection p -values below 0.05. These results indicate that LSTM with feature selection models optimized through refined hyperparameters leads to more accurate Thai morning glory price forecasting, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in their decision-making processes. Additionally, this study can forecast prices for 5, 7, 14, and 21 days in advance based on different Window_len values, addressing various planning needs. The 5- and 7-day forecasts support short-term decision-making, such as scheduling harvest cycles and weekly market planning, whereas the 14-day forecast assists farmers in optimizing planting schedules and logistics. Furthermore, the 21-day forecast is beneficial for medium-term market planning, including negotiating forward contracts and adjusting distribution strategies to maximize profitability.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer is a significant global health issue, ranking as the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early diagnosis of this disease is of utmost importance to increase the survival rate and enhance the healthcare system. Many machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods have been proposed to facilitate automated early diagnosis of this cancer. However, label noise in medical images and the dependence on a single model can lead to suboptimal model performance, which could potentially hinder the development of a sophisticated automated solution. In this paper, we address label noise in training data and propose a stacking-ensemble model for classifying colorectal cancer along with a trustworthy computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. Initially, a variety of filtering methods are extensively analyzed to determine the most suitable image representation, with subsequent data augmentation techniques. Second, a modified VGG-16 model was proposed with fine-tuning that was utilized as a feature extractor to extract meaningful features from the training samples. Third, a prediction uncertainty and probabilistic local outlier factor (pLOF) were applied to the extracted features to address the label noise issue in the training data. Fourth, we adopted a random forest–based recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE) feature selection method with various combinations of features to recursively select the most influential ones for accurate predictions. Fifth, four base ML classifiers and a metamodel were selected to build our final stacking-ensemble model, which integrates the prediction probabilities of multiple models into a meta-feature set to ensure trustworthy predictions. Finally, we integrated these strategies and deployed them into a web application to demonstrate a CAD system. This system not only predicts the disease but also generates the prediction probabilities of each class, which enhances both clarity and diagnostic insight. Our proposed model was compared with different state-of-the-art ML classifiers on a publicly available dataset and demonstrated the highest accuracy of 92.43%.},

In this study, we aimed to (1) determine the typical region of body thermograms and (2) propose a soft-vote fusion algorithm to develop a more accurate result in obesity detection. The typical regions of thermograms were selected by training and testing the pretrained CNN models with the thermogram dataset of all-region and single-region. All-region dataset includes thermograms from five regions, namely, supraclavicular (SCV), abdomen, forearm, palm, and shank, while each of single-region dataset consists of thermograms from an individual region. When tested on all-region dataset, the CNN model achieved the highest accuracy of 90.00%. When tested with a single-region dataset, three regions, namely, SCV, abdomen, and forearm, achieved the highest accuracy of 94.23% (SCV) and 96.15% (abdomen and forearm), which indicated that these regions were more representative than palm and shank. Then, we proposed a soft-vote fusion algorithm in which different trained CNN models from the previous experiments were combined to improve the detection performance. We found that the combination of those three regions can achieve the highest accuracy with the smallest model size. One of those proposed combinations achieved an accuracy of 98.08% with a framework size of 19.4 MB by only using SCV and abdomen thermogram as the inputs.},

The input text alone often provides limited knowledge to generate contextually correct and meaningful translation. Relying solely on the input text could yield translations that lack accuracy. Side information related to either source or target side is helpful in the context of NMT. In this study, we empirically show that training an NMT model with target-side additional information used as knowledge can significantly improve the translation quality. The acquired knowledge is leveraged in the encoder-/decoder-based model utilizing multiencoder framework. The additional encoder converts knowledge into dense semantic representation called attention. These attentions from the input sentence and additional knowledge are then combined into a unified attention. The decoder generates the translation by conditioning on both the input text and acquired knowledge. Evaluation of translation from Urdu to English with a low-resource setting yields promising results in terms of both perplexity reduction and improved BLEU scores. The proposed models in the respective group outperform in LSTM and GRU with attention mechanism by +3.1 and +2.9 BLEU score, respectively. Extensive analysis confirms our claim that the translations influenced by additional information may occasionally contain rare low-frequency words and faithful translation. Experimental results on a different language pair DE-EN demonstrate that our suggested method is more efficient and general.},

  abstract     = {A traffic network exhibits inherent characteristics of networks while also possessing unique features that hold significant research value. In this study, the limitations of static graph structures and the challenges of accurately modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in traffic flow have been addressed through a hybrid GCN-gated recurrent unit (GRU)-transformer model. The proposed model integrates a dynamic topology module (DTM) with graph attention networks (GATs), GRUs, and transformer-based temporal modules to adaptively capture the evolving dynamics of traffic networks. The DTM dynamically updates graph structures based on real-time traffic conditions, while GATs focus on identifying critical spatial relationships. GRUs efficiently capture temporal dependencies, and the transformer model captures long-term sequential patterns, providing a comprehensive framework for real-time traffic forecasting. The proposed model was trained and evaluated using the METR-LA dataset, which comprises traffic data from 207 sensors at 5-minute intervals. The model demonstrated superior performance across various metrics, achieving RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values of 4.125%, 2.985%, and 5.432%, respectively, for 15-minute predictions, with an R 2 value of 0.928. For longer prediction horizons (30, 45, and 60 min), the model consistently outperformed baseline methods, maintaining competitive RMSE and MAPE values. The experimental setup included normalization, graph construction using adjacency matrices, and preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and robustness. The integration of spatial and temporal features through the GCN-GRU-transformer framework enhanced the model’s ability to generalize across varying traffic scenarios, including peak hours and disruptions. Compared to traditional methods, which often rely on static graphs and fail to adapt to real-time changes, the hybrid model effectively addresses both spatial heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. The results indicate its robustness in handling complex traffic dynamics, adaptability to real-world variations, and potential applications in intelligent transportation systems. Future work will focus on incorporating multimodal data sources and enhancing computational efficiency to achieve broader scalability and deployment in smart city infrastructures.},

Consequently, hate speech and offensive content have turned out to be a widespread issue that negatively affects both individuals and society and needs to be controlled through detection and removal. This paper aims to provide a further understanding of the meaning of hate speech and offensive language and to provide a comprehensive discussion of the various techniques to detect hate speech and offensive language. A systematic literature review (SLR) of 90 research papers published between 2018 and 2024 was conducted to discover gaps within the literature. This review revealed challenges and possibilities for further development and improvement of previous findings. The results show that most of these works classified hate speech and offensive language using techniques from machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), and the most common performance metrics were Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-measure. The benchmark datasets are also described. Twitter was the most commonly utilized social network for obtaining datasets, while Facebook is sometimes used. Moreover, the findings of this review offer insight into research trends in Arabic hate speech and offensive language, as well as new research directions. The most interesting finding is that until now most Social Media Network Developers have not included autodetection of hate speech or offensive language plugins. Finally, this study presents a guideline for choosing the best strategies and techniques to detect and predict Arabic offensive language and hate speech.},

  abstract     = {This study presents ensemble machine learning (ML) models for predicting residential energy consumption in South Africa. By combining the best features of individual ML models, ensemble models reduce the drawbacks of each model and improve prediction accuracy. We present four ensemble models: ensemble by averaging (EA), ensemble by stacking each estimator (ESE), ensemble by boosting (EB), and ensemble by voting estimator (EVE). These models are built on top of Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT). These base predictor models leverage historical energy consumption patterns to capture temporal intricacies, including seasonal variations and rolling averages. In addition, we employed feature engineering methodologies to further enhance their predictive abilities. The accuracy of each ensemble model was evaluated by assessing various performance indicators, including the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination R 2 . Overall, the findings illustrate the efficiency of ensemble learning models in providing accurate predictions for residential energy consumption. This study provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in predicting energy consumption in residential buildings and the benefits of using ensemble learning models in the building and energy research domains.},

  abstract     = {A vast variety of neural network (NN)–based controllers use indirect adaptive control structures for their implementation, which primarily aims at estimating the nonlinear dynamics of the system and thereby generating a suitable control action. However, the most commonly used gradient descent weight update rule of the NN-based indirect adaptive controllers often fails to identify the system dynamics appropriately, and the control action becomes ineffective on the system under control. Further, a significant number of existing works in this domain employ randomized or suboptimal initial NN weights, which can potentially hamper the transient performance of the control loop. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative control scheme that utilizes the strength of indirect adaptive control of NN, along with the robustness of the PID controller. Since the PID control structure is often independent of plant dynamics and generates a control action to mitigate any error between the reference and the current plant output, it can be easily augmented with the control action generated by inverse neural network (INN) to mitigate any effects of unlearnt dynamics by INN. Further, we have used a bio-inspired optimization algorithm, that is, particle swarm optimization (PSO), to optimize the initial weights of the INN along with the PID controller’s parameters to get an optimal control performance. The proposed INN + PID controller scheme has been tested on a cart-mounted inverted pendulum system due to its challenging control requirement owing to its intricate nonlinear dynamics. Detailed simulation studies for the proposed INN + PID and PID controllers have been carried out for various control requirements, viz. set point tracking, disturbance rejection, and robustness testing. Further, an extensive comparative study has been devised based on the integral of absolute error (IAE) to test the efficacy of the proposed INN + PID controller against the conventional PID controller. Through extensive comparative studies, it was deduced that the proposed INN + PID controller is capable of handling the intricate nonlinear dynamics of the cart-mounted inverted pendulum system and provides a sturdy stabilization of the angular position of the pendulum with respect to the desired trajectory and superior transient control in comparison with the conventional PID controller. In terms of quantitative comparison, the improvement in IAE achieved by the proposed INN + PID controller was found to be 94.84%, 94.62%, and 69.86% better in comparison to the conventional PID controller for set point tracking, disturbance rejection for introduced impulsive force, and time-varying force variation, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Skin cancer spreads quickly as the skin is the most vulnerable organ, and melanoma (MEL) is a fatal type of skin cancer. Detecting MEL in the early stage can hugely increase the chance of a cure. There are several methods based on machine learning to detect MEL from dermoscopic images. However, increasing the accuracy of detection is still challenging. This paper presents a new method for MEL detection that considers the combination of deep and handcrafted time–frequency local features. After short preprocessing, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) extract the deep features. To this end, feature maps at the output of the flatten layer are considered as deep features. The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptors are handcrafted local features computed from the four subbands of one-level two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D DWT). After the fusion of the mentioned features, semisupervised discriminant analysis (SDA) reduces the highly correlated and redundant features. The Bayesian optimizer finds the optimum parameters of the SDA and Gaussian kernel of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to maximize the classification accuracy. The HAM10000 dataset with data augmentation is considered to assess the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results show that the proposed method reaches the accuracy and sensitivity of 94.19% and 96.22%, respectively. The most challenging parts of the proposed method are extraction of deep features and tuning the parameters of SDA and Gaussian-SVM.},

  abstract     = {This research focuses on developing an intelligent administrative chatbot for Roman Urdu to overcome the language barrier that hinders individuals who are not fluent in English from utilizing existing chatbot frameworks. While chatbot architectures can be rule based or artificial intelligence (AI) based, the core objective of a chatbot is to effectively address user queries across diverse domains. AI-based chatbots have demonstrated higher interactivity, scalability, adaptability to human interests, and evolving knowledge compared with rule-based architectures. However, the majority of existing chatbot frameworks is in English, which poses a challenge in regions like Pakistan where only a small percentage of the population is proficient in English. In response to this challenge, this research introduces an intelligent administrative chatbot specifically developed for Roman Urdu. Roman Urdu is the practice of writing Urdu, the native language of Pakistan, using the English alphabet. The proposed chatbot allows students to post their questions in either English or Roman Urdu, enabling them to obtain conclusive answers. The chatbot system utilizes a sentence analysis approach to generate relevant and productive responses to user queries. The core building block of the proposed chatbot is the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model with long short-term memory (LSTM) units. To train the model, a dataset was meticulously collected from various administrative offices at the University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore, initially in English and subsequently translated into Roman Urdu using different writing styles. The effectiveness of the proposed system was evaluated through a human judgment approach, assessing the contextual relevance and productivity of the chatbot’s responses to relevant questions. In conclusion, this research aims to bridge the language gap in chatbot frameworks, enhancing accessibility and usability.},

  abstract     = {Face recognition is a reliable biometric technology that utilizes artificial intelligence and computer vision to identify and verify an individual’s identity based on facial features. Its rapid development has enabled integration into diverse applications, including security systems, access control, forensics, and mobile devices. However, challenges such as recognizing faces across different ages persist, presenting opportunities for further research. Developing robust face recognition models requires substantial training datasets, but manually labeling large collections of facial images is both time-intensive and costly. Our previous study demonstrated that a ResNet-50 model trained on a dataset of 44,000 facial images, combining the original FaceScrub dataset with HyperStyle age and smile augmentations, achieved an F1-score of 79%, significantly outperforming the model trained solely on the authentic FaceScrub dataset (F1-score: 63%). Building upon these findings, this study explores a broader range of augmentation styles, including pose and domain adaptation, e.g., Pixar, Toonify, Sketch, and Disney, using the HyperStyle scheme. Models trained with domain adaptation showed reduced performance (F1-score: 64%) due to the domain gap introduced by cartoon-like styles. In contrast, models trained with pose augmentation achieved an F1-score of 75%, demonstrating the importance of augmentations resembling real-world variations. When training incorporated all augmentation styles, e.g., age, smile, pose, and domain adaptation, the F1-score reached 78%, slightly lower than the model trained with age and smile augmentations only (F1-score: 79%). To further evaluate the impact of age and smile augmentations, additional experiments were conducted using various CNN models, including VGGNet-16, MobileNetV3Small, SEResNet-18, and ResNet-50, under different hyperparameter configurations. Among these, ResNet-50 achieved the highest F1-score (82%), surpassing VGGNet-16 (60%), MobileNetV3Small (65%), and SEResNet-18 (81%). The study also introduced modifications to the HyperStyle scheme in both the preprocessing and postprocessing stages, which further enhanced model performance. The ResNet-50 model trained with the modified HyperStyle scheme, and the original FaceScrub dataset achieved the highest F1-score of 83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of these modifications in improving face recognition performance.},

The utilized dataset, combined with multiple open-source datasets, comprises 43,000 real, 31,000 fake, and 80,000 AI–generated news articles and is augmented with an ensemble large language model. We combined three open-source LLMs (GPT-2, GPT-NEO, and Distil-GPT-2) into an ensemble LLM to generate new news titles, selecting the best outputs through majority voting for further dataset expansion. Preprocessing involved data cleaning, lowercasing, stop word removal, tokenization, and lemmatization. We applied six machine learning and five natural language processing models to this dataset. The two top-performing natural language–based models (RoBERTa and DeBERTa) have been combined to develop an ensemble transformer model. Among the machine learning models, random forest achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 92.49% and an F1 score of 92.60%. Among the natural language processing models, the ensemble transformer model attained the highest results, with 96.65% accuracy and an F1 score of 96.66%. The proposed ensemble model is optimized by applying model pruning (reducing parameters from 265M to 210M, improving training time by 25%) and dynamic quantization (reducing model size by 50%, maintaining 95.68% accuracy), enhancing scalability and efficiency while minimizing computational overhead. The DistilBERT-Student model, trained using a balanced combination of feature- and logit-based distillation from the RoBERTa-base Teacher network, achieved strong classification performance with 96.17% accuracy. Visualize-based attention maps are constructed for different news categories to enhance the interpretability of the applied transformer–based ensemble news detection models. Finally, a website was developed to enable users to identify fake, real, or AI–generated news content.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of cold-deck, mean, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) imputation techniques for predicting thyroid disease using a dataset of 9172 observations with 31 clinical features (5.2% missing values). Feature importance analysis identified thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (TT4), and free thyroxine index (FTI) as consistently significant biomarkers across all imputation methods. Five classifiers—Naïve Bayes, linear regression, support vector machines (SVM), LightGBM, and recurrent neural networks (RNN)—were assessed on imputed datasets, with performance evaluated through accuracy, F1 score, and recall. The KNN imputation method enhanced LightGBM’s accuracy by 0.47% over mean imputation (99.06% vs. 98.99%) and by 1.47% over cold deck (99.06% vs. 98.59%), demonstrating its superiority in preserving feature relationships and enhancing predictive power. LightGBM achieved the highest performance with KNN imputation (accuracy: 99.06%, F1: 97.57%, and recall: 97.83%), outperforming other classifiers by 2.5%–4.0% in accuracy. These results underscore the necessity of robust imputation techniques for reliable thyroid disease prediction.

Traditional clustering methods, such as K-means, are limited by fixed cluster numbers and sensitivity to outliers, often missing small or irregular fraud patterns. This research introduces an adaptive clustering algorithm (AD-KMeans) that dynamically adjusts the number of clusters based on variance and density thresholds, enabling better identification of hidden fraudulent activity. Using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, the proposed method is evaluated against standard K-means using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F 1-score, silhouette score, Davies–Bouldin index (DBI), and the Calinski–Harabasz index (CHI). Experimental results show that compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed AD-KMeans achieves the highest fraud recall (91.2%) and F 1-score (87.6%), improving recall by 22.3 percentage points over the best hybrid model (hybrid DNN + clustering, 68.9%) and F 1-score by 11.5 points (from 76.1% to 87.6%). Moreover, it identifies distinct fraud-prone clusters and adapts effectively to data structure variations.

Therefore, early prediction and detection are critical, leading to timely and appropriate interventions at early stages. Four ensemble tree-based algorithms were used in this study: adaptive boosting, extreme gradient boosting, random forest, and extremely randomized trees, investigating their ability to predict heart disease. Data related to heart disease clinical features was obtained from the open Kaggle Machine Learning Dataset repository. Adaptive Boosting stands out as the highest performer, achieving an average testing accuracy of 93.70%, precision of 93.71%, recall of 93.70%, and F1 score of 93.69%, along with the highest AUC score of 0.9708, across all competing models considered in the study. These metrics indicate a superior ability to distinguish between patients with and without heart disease, effectively making it particularly valuable for clinical applications where early detection can save lives. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework adopted to investigate the relative importance of the features in predicting heart disease revealed the most influential predictors (ST slope, chest pain type, old peak, and cholesterol), further aiding the understanding of heart disease mechanisms. Future work should explore the integration of ensemble learning algorithms with real-time patient monitoring systems. This integration could allow for continuous health status updates, equipping predictive models with the information necessary to facilitate dynamic, real-time interventions that are more closely aligned with patient needs.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative filtering (CF)-based personalized recommendation systems are among the most widely adopted strategies for addressing information overload in modern markets. However, a significant challenge that hinders the effectiveness of these systems is data sparsity. To address this limitation, advanced methodologies such as matrix factorization and deep learning models have been developed to improve CF system performance in sparse data scenarios. Despite their advancements, most existing models rely solely on either implicit or explicit user–item interactions to generate recommendations. Traditional CF approaches often struggle with sparsity, necessitating the development of hybrid methods that integrate both explicit and implicit feedback to enhance performance. To address this gap, this study introduces DeepBlendRec, an innovative deep learning-based framework that leverages both explicit user ratings and implicit user behaviour. By utilizing this dual-input methodology, the model captures richer information regarding user–item interactions, thereby significantly improving recommendation accuracy. DeepBlendRec employs an enhanced autoencoder with a constrained decoder to process implicit ratings, thereby improving reconstruction quality and facilitating the creation of robust latent space representations. Simultaneously, explicit ratings are processed through a multilayer perceptron. The reconstructed outputs are then fused to generate a Top-N recommendation list. Experimental evaluations conducted on the MovieLens datasets demonstrate that DeepBlendRec consistently outperforms existing models across several key performance metrics, including mean-squared error (MSE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), precision, recall, and F1-score. These results highlight the potential of DeepBlendRec to advance the capabilities of recommendation systems in handling data sparsity and improving predictive accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel approach to engineering design optimization through the development of an improved mountain gazelle optimizer (iMGO) that incorporates variable neighborhood search (VNS) techniques. The enhanced algorithm effectively addresses engineering optimization challenges by identifying optimal design solutions within specified constraints. In particular, iMGO significantly improves solution diversity and mitigates the risk of premature convergence to local optima, thereby overcoming the limitations of the original MGO. A comprehensive analysis was conducted using 12 functions from the CEC 2022 benchmark suite, and the algorithm was applied to five engineering problems, including the design of an I-beam, pressure vessel, three-bar truss, cantilever beam, and tension spring. Comparative results indicate that iMGO outperforms established metaheuristic techniques, such as MFO, WOA, GOA, MPA, TSO, and SCSO, as well as the original MGO. The results validate iMGO’s effectiveness in navigating the complexities of constrained engineering optimization. For instance, in practical applications, the manufacturing cost of the pressure vessel design was reduced from 6014.4537 to 5915.3358, and the weight of the tension spring was decreased from 0.0149154 to 0.0130101 relative to the original MGO. These enhancements underscore the significant potential of iMGO in real-world applications across aerospace engineering, structural design optimization, energy system planning, and other fields, thereby contributing to more efficient and sustainable engineering solutions.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning–based segmentation models have gained significant focus in various computer vision applications, including remote sensing and medical imaging. There exist deep learning architectures for semantic and instance segmentation separately, with limitations prevailing such as imprecise boundary delineation, poor spatial consistency, improper fine-grained object separation, and inaccurate instance segmentation, particularly while handling intricate object structures in remote sensing images (RSI). To mitigate the aforementioned issues, in the present work, we propose a unified deep framework that integrates both semantic and instance segmentation within a single architecture tailored for high-resolution RSI. Our framework combines an improved attention residual U-Net (IARU-Net) for pixel-level semantic segmentation and a dynamic Mask R-CNN for instance-level segmentation. To further refine spatial coherence and boundary delineation, we incorporate the postprocessing technique such as conditional random fields (CRFs) on the output segmentation map of the enhanced U-Net to improve spatial consistency and edge sharpness. This refined semantic mask serves as input to the dynamic Mask R-CNN model for instance segmentation, where the graph-based refinement module (GRM) is employed to improve boundary accuracy by leveraging graph-based smoothing techniques. Our approach ensures improved object delineation, increases the segmentation accuracy, and decreases false positives compared to conventional deep learning architectures. Evaluation outcomes on standard datasets illustrate that the proposed approach attains superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in both semantic and instance segmentation tasks. The results validate the effectiveness of jointly modeling semantic and instance-level information, providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex remote sensing scenes.},

Second, on the basis of task allocation, adaptive control design is employed for the follower MSVs to enhance the control performance of target encircling; optimal feedback control design combined with adaptive feedforward control design is considered using the RL algorithm for the leader MSVs to ensure the optimality of target tracking. Finally, the stability of the multi-MSV hunting control system is guaranteed and all signals are uniformly ultimately bounded based on the Lyapunov theory in the closed-loop system.

  abstract     = {While analyzing health data is important for improving health outcomes, class imbalance in datasets poses major challenges to machine learning classification models. This work, therefore, considers the class imbalance problem in stroke prediction using models such as K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, logistic regression, random forest, and decision tree. This work balances the stroke dataset, thereby enhancing model performance, through various oversampling strategies: random oversampling (RO), ADASYN, SMOTE, and SMOTE–Tomek. Compared to the results of the imbalanced dataset, all applied oversampling techniques enhanced the correct classification of stroke events by the ML model. Among these, RO–SVM with RBF kernel was the best in terms of sensitivity, specificity, G-mean, F1-score, and accuracy values, offering the highest results with respective values of 89.87%, 94.91%, 92.36%, 89.64%, and 89.87%. After applying oversampling techniques, all the machine learning classifications were good enough to classify stroke status, especially for the minority class. This study has highlighted the importance of class imbalance issues in health datasets. Precise detection of instances of minority classes can be enhanced considerably by employing classification models with the implementation of hybrid strategies to effectively solve class imbalance issues, which, in turn, will help improve healthcare outcomes. Further research in integrating more advanced deep learning techniques into other health datasets with imbalances is encouraged to further validate or refine class imbalance approaches, as effective handling of imbalanced classes can substantially promote predictive model performance in the analysis of healthcare.},

We sought to identify correlates of decreased CMRGlc in the spectral properties of fMRI signals imaged in the task-free state. Lifespan resting-state fMRI data acquired in 455 healthy adults (ages 18–87 years) and cerebral metabolic data acquired in a separate cohort of 94 healthy adults (ages 25–45 years, 65–85 years) were analyzed. The spectral properties of the fMRI data were characterized in terms of the relative predominance of slow versus fast activity using the spectral slope (SS) measure. We found that the relative proportion of fast activity increases with advancing age (SS flattening) across most cortical regions. The regional distribution of spectral slope was topographically correlated with CMRGlc in young adults. Notably, whereas most older adults maintain a youthful pattern of SS topography, a distinct subset of older adults significantly diverged from the youthful pattern. This subset of older adults also diverged from the youthful pattern of CMRGlc metabolism. This divergent pattern was associated with T2-weighted signal changes in frontal lobe white matter, an independent marker of small vessel disease. These findings suggest that BOLD signal spectral slope flattening may represent a biomarker of age-associated neurometabolic pathology.},

Nevertheless, several current techniques of vacancy engineering, such as controlled solvent thermal growth, plasma bombardment, and chemical etching, suffer from high energy inputs and uncontrollable processing kinetics. Herein, a facile and energy-efficient technique of metal ion-assisted shear exfoliation is proposed to synthesize 2D MoS 2 with edge S-vacancies as an anode for sodium ion batteries. Thanks to the implementation of this vacancy technique, few-layer MoS 2 anode with sulfur defects at the edge presents remarkable rate performance (399.91 mAh g −1 at a current density of 5 A g −1 ) and demonstrates high average capacity with exceptional stability (460.71 mAh g −1 at 1 A g −1 after 100 cycles) when utilized in sodium-ion batteries. The superior electrochemical performance of this elaborate anode can be ascribed to the enhanced electrochemical kinetics and reaction reversibility resulting from the presence of a vacancy defect architecture. This study is expected to provide an effective avenue to develop vacancy defect electrodes for advanced batteries.},

  abstract     = {The performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is crucially affected by the anodic stability of Li-metal and cathodic conversion kinetics of sulfur-carbon (S/C) composites. Herein, a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) with moderate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) solubility, consisting of 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) in non-fluorinated solvent of cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) additive, is employed in Li-S batteries to simultaneously achieve high anodic stability and appropriate cathodic kinetics. This WSE exhibits a good capability of suppressing LiPSs shuttling by forming an anions-dominated Li + solvation structure, effectively inducing a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to guarantee anodic stability of the Li-metal anode. Additionally, the DOL additive in the WSE aids in forming a thin organic-inorganic hybrid cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the surface of S/Li 2 S particles, which maintains good conversion kinetics and suppresses dead S/Li 2 S growth in the S/C cathode. Consequently, Li-S batteries with the WSE deliver a high initial capacity (≈1208 mAh g −1 ), a high average Coulombic efficiency (≈98.6%), and a high capacity retention rate (≈82.4%) over 200 cycles. Stable cycling performance over 100 cycles is also observed in the Li-S pouch cell with the WSE even under harsh conditions.},

However, their clinical efficacy remains limited and is accompanied by severe side effects, including anemia and hemagglutination. To address these limitations, a localized delivery strategy is developed using lipid nanoparticles to encapsulate mRNA encoding a secreted CD47 inhibitor. This mRNA-derived CD47 inhibitor effectively activated macrophages against cancer cells in vitro. To improve its modest tumor-suppressive effects in vivo, a combination therapy is formulated by co-delivering mRNAs encoding the CD47 inhibitor and a cytokine cocktail (interleukins 12, 15, and 21), achieving synergistic antitumor effects. Notably, this strategy induces robust systemic antitumor immunity and long-lasting immunological memory, effectively suppressing metastatic tumor progression following localized treatment of the primary tumor. Mechanistically, the mRNA-derived CD47 inhibitor promoted the differentiation of conventional type 1 dendritic cells, facilitating T cell cross-priming and activating cytotoxic T cells. Additionally, the cytokine cocktail further augmented the antitumor activity of these cytotoxic T cells.

In this study, a combined engineering strategy is developed for MSC-exo via aggregation culture and genetic editing, achieving a substantial increase in both exosome yield and therapeutic specificity in SLE. First, MSCs produce a high yield of engineered exosomes through an aggregation culture engineering strategy (Agg-exo), demonstrating immune organ targeting and promoting Tregs via the Foxp1/STAT5/Foxp3 axis. Then, MSCs are engineered by overexpressing Foxp1 in order to acquire Foxp1 high Agg-exo with enhanced immunomodulatory properties, which showes superior therapeutic effect for SLE. Taken together, a newly dual-engineering strategy is developed to produce high-yield, Foxp1 high Agg-exo, which solved the limitation of low-yield production and non-specific organ distribution of MSC-exos.

  abstract     = {Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a significant cause of dementia. However, the limited availability of animal and cellular models that accurately replicate early DLB pathogenesis hampers the understanding of how Aβ plaques influence α-synuclein (αSyn) pathologies. This study addresses this gap by co-culturing primary neurons with adult hippocampal brain slices from either wild-type or Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice containing abundant Aβ plaques and cytokines. Neurons exposed to AD slices showed impaired dynein-dependent organelle trafficking, reducing endosome–lysosome fusion and causing defective degradation of amyloidogenic αSyn fibrils, thus increasing αSyn inclusions. Notably, an abnormal pre-accumulation of dynein in AD mice suggests that dysfunctional dynein may serve as a nucleation site for αSyn aggregation upon exposure to pathogenic fibrils. Furthermore, Rab7 activation successfully restored endo-lysosomal degradation of αSyn fibrils and reduced inclusion formation in mouse models presenting with both Lewy body and Aβ pathologies. These results highlight the dynein-dependent endo-lysosomal pathway as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating αSyn-related pathologies in co-existing Aβ burden, characteristic of many DLB cases.},

  abstract     = {Hypoglycemia is a commonly neglected complication in elderly diabetic patients, which can lead to cardiovascular events. Endothelial cell dysfunction is the primary inducer of cardiovascular events, and it is associated with hypoglycemia-triggered cytokine release and inflammatory programmed cell death. A comprehensive understanding of lineage-specific variations in pathological vascular changes is essential to mitigate cardiovascular events and ensure therapeutic efficacy. Herein, unbiased clustering analyses and single-nucleus RNA sequencing are performed on cells of the thoracic aorta in db/db and insulin-induced hypoglycemic db/db mice. Comparative analyses show changes in lineage-specific genes, subpopulation composition, intercellular communication, and molecular biology in hypoglycemic diabetic mice. The analyses also revealed the changes of different cells, particularly endothelial cell PANoptosis, macrophage inflammatory polarization, and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) fibrosis. Pseudo-time sequencing, differential expression, and regulation network analyses revealed the association of potential hub genes Klf2 , ETS2 , Elavl1 , C3 , and Nr4a1 with the mentioned pathological processes. It is demonstrated that hypoglycemia induces VSMC fibrosis in vivo, whereas Angptl4 knockdown can attenuate VSMC fibrosis in vitro. These findings demonstrate the hypoglycemic macroangiopathy mechanism and provide important references for future disease intervention and treatment.},

  abstract     = {mRNA vaccines have been widely implemented and revolutionized the landscape of oncology and epidemiology. Potent vaccination demands precise control over injection depth to ensure optimal lymphatic drainage, driving the development of non-invasive imaging techniques to visualize the distribution and efficacy of mRNA vaccines. Herein, near-infrared-II (NIR-II) lipid nanoparticles (NIR-II-LNPs) are fabricated for mRNA delivery by integrating a cationic fluorophore amphiphile (IR780-C16) into traditional LNPs, enabling longitudinal, quantitative, and non-invasive trafficking of mRNA vaccines. The in vivo behaviors of mRNA vaccines are characterized with different vaccination protocols in mice and rabbits by NIR-II fluorescence imaging. Results proved that following a 25 µL injection of mRNA vaccines into the mouse thigh at a depth of 4 mm or a 500 µL injection volume into a rabbit at a depth of 7 mm via the intramuscular route, the vaccines rapidly and abundantly accumulated in the inguinal lymph nodes. Flow cytometry and tissue immunofluorescence analyses further validated that optimized vaccination parameters effectively activated antitumor immunity and greatly boosted the therapeutic efficacy in B16-OVA and HPV-associated mouse tumor models. NIR-II-LNPs offer a unique modality for non-invasively monitoring the fate of vaccines, reinforcing its role in preclinical and clinical mRNA therapeutics.},

Mitophagy is severely inhibited in the podocytes of patients. Damaged mitochondria aggregate in the cytoplasm and can not be removed effectively. Restoring mitophagy may be a novel strategy for the treatment of DKD. In this study, Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are found to reduce podocyte injury in DKD through exosomes. Sequencing and cross-sectional analysis revealed that exosomes from Tregs delivered miR-218-5p to increase mitophagy in podocytes by inhibiting the TNC/TLR4/SRC/FUNDC1 pathway. Treg-Exos are engineered to express RGD peptides on the membrane surface. RGD-Treg-Exos bind to integrins on the surface of podocytes and effectively target podocytes for the delivery of miR-218-5p, thus increasing mitophagy in podocytes, reducing cell apoptosis, and alleviating podocyte injury. In summary, this study revealed that engineered RGD-Treg-Exos effectively ameliorated podocyte injury in DKD, thus constituting a novel method for DKD treatment.},

  abstract     = {Since the properties of electron transfer and orbital interactions in oxygen electrocatalysts are highly spin-dependent, reaction kinetics and thermodynamics are very sensitive to the spin configuration. However, understanding the spin-related origin of catalytic activity in heterogeneous molecular electrocatalysts still remains challenging. Herein, a molecular-atomic coupled catalyst is constructed by integrating iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules with Fe-N 4 atomic sites anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (FePc-Fe-NCNT). The strong electronic coupling between FePc and the Fe-N 4 -containing carbon substrate triggers a transition of the Fe sites from a low-spin state to an intermediate-spin state. Additionally, the formation of σ* bonds between the electron-injected perpendicular d z2 orbitals of intermediate-spin Fe and the 2p orbitals of adsorbed oxygen species suppresses site blocking and accelerates OH* desorption, thereby enhancing the reaction kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The resulting catalyst exhibits exceptional ORR activity in alkaline media, reaching a half-wave potential of 0.89 V and negligible degradation after 10,000 cycles. Remarkably, the quasi-solid-state Zinc-air battery based on this prepared catalyst operates stably from −40 to 70 °C with minimal performance loss. This work reveals a spin-state manipulation strategy for the development of advanced molecular catalysts and provides new insights into the regulation of electronic structure for energy conversion technologies.},

  abstract     = {Historically, directly injecting therapeutics into tumors has been deemed suboptimal and less favorable in clinical settings compared to systemic administration due to the inability to eradicate circulating/metastatic tumor cells until the emergence of the concept of in situ vaccine. In situ vaccine leverages patients’ own tumors as a pool of antigens to elicit systemic antitumor immunity (also known as “abscopal effect”) that aims to eliminate both primary and distal/metastatic tumors. One typical example of an approved product is Talimogene laherparepvec, an oncolytic virus approved in 2015 for treating advanced melanoma. To improve the effectiveness and the biosafety of in situ vaccines, various approaches have emerged, including new generations of oncolytic viruses, engineered bacteria, cytokine treatment, immune adjuvants, nanotechnology-enabled formulations, and photo/radio-therapies, showing remarkable promise in preclinical and clinical settings. These conceptual advances offer tailored solutions to challenges such as low antigen availability, limited immune activation, and side effects. In this review, we explore the current landscape of in situ cancer vaccines, categorizing them based on their functional formulations and highlighting their conceptual innovation in cancer immunotherapy.

Orally administered probiotic treatment has been regarded as a promising strategy for the adjunctive treatment of IBD. However, its efficacy is greatly inhibited due to the harsh gut microenvironment and low targeted delivery volume. Herein, carbon dots are applied to modify Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (C dots@LGG) to enhance the anti-inflammatory and injury healing effects of probiotics. The C-dots coating bestowed probiotics with a remarkable antioxidant capability, thereby mitigating inflammation and safeguarding LGG from the rigors of gastrointestinal circumstances and oxidative harm within the inflamed colon, as well as facilitating its adhesion and colonization. Conjointly, C dots@LGG reconstructs the intestinal barrier by spurring the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells, especially goblet cells, and enhancing the intercellular tight junction (TJ). Moreover, C dots@LGG with enhanced metabolic capacity regulated the gut microbiota by enriching its diversity, suppressing the multiplication of harmful bacteria, and fostering that of beneficial bacteria. Collectively, these combined effects endow C dots@LGG to effectively attenuate mice colitis and promote injury healing in vivo. Given its simple synthesis protocol, it is anticipated that C dots@LGG can provide an effective approach for the collaborative non-immunosuppressive therapy for IBD.},

  abstract     = {The growing threat of fungal infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, is exacerbated by the limited number of antifungal drug classes, increasing resistance rates, and complex hostpathogen interactions. In response to this public health concern, the World Health Organization published its first list of fungal priority pathogens, including C. auris, A. fumigatus, C. neoformans, and C. albicans. These species exhibit multidrug resistance, virulence plasticity, and enhanced biofilm-forming capacity, which contributes to antifungal tolerance and complicates treatment outcomes. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as promising alternatives due to their broad-spectrum activity, rapid membrane-disrupting mechanisms, and low propensity to induce resistance. This review provides an in-depth analysis of AMP-based antifungal strategies, integrating insights from structureactivity relationships, molecular engineering, and targeted delivery systems. Strategies such as peptide hybridization, cyclization, PEGylation, and nanoparticle conjugation are examined to enhance stability, specificity, and pharmacokinetics. Opportunities for rational AMP design are also discussed, leveraging computational toolsincluding machine learning and deep learning approachesalongside immunoproteomic targeting. Together, these multidisciplinary advances underscore the potential of AMPs as next-generation therapeutics against critical fungal pathogens. Nonetheless, clinical translation remains challenging, requiring continued investment in formulation science, regulatory alignment, and translational development pipelines.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous zinc-manganese oxide (Zn-MNO) batteries represent a compelling solution for grid-scale energy storage due to their inherent safety, cost-effectiveness and ecological compatibility. However, the commercialization of this technology faces critical challenges including insufficient electrode durability, limited areal capacity output, and fundamentally ambiguous charge storage principles, which collectively hinder practical implementation. Through systematic mechanistic investigation, a previously overlooked phase evolution paradigm is revealed. It involves that Mn 3 O 4 cathode undergoes a partially in situ phase transition to MnO 2 during the initial charging process, forming a hybrid Mn 3 O 4 /MnO 2 cathode. This self-optimized heterostructure synergistically combines structural reinforcement frameworks with enhanced ion-transport networks, enabling exceptional cycling stability over 4,500 cycles while maintaining record-high areal capacity (10 mAh cm −2 ). The clarified dual-ion (H + /Zn 2+ ) coordination mechanism and stabilized Mn 2+ /MnO 2 redox chemistry establish new design principles for manganese-based cathodes. More importantly, unprecedented scalability is demonstrated through constructing pouch cells (200 mAh) with 1000-cycle durability, achieving a practical energy density of 54 Wh kg −1 . The integrated solar-powered battery system exhibits remarkable operational safety under extreme conditions (piercing, cutting), representing one of the most practically viable Zn-MNO batteries reported to date. This work bridges fundamental mechanistic understanding with industrial-grade device engineering, charting a concrete pathway toward terawatt-hour scale renewable energy storage.},

Ion-pair interactions between PA and quaternary ammonium (QA) groups can effectively mitigate PA loss. Herein, polyphenylene-based quaternized membranes (BAF-QAF and C7-QAF) comprising distinct hydrophobic moieties [BAF = (perfluoropropane-2,2-diyl)dibenzene and C7 = 1,1-diphenylcycloheptane] and fluorenyl groups with pendant QA head groups are designed and used as PA-doped PEMs with low or no fluorine contents to realize high-temperature and low-humidity operability. The resulting membranes exhibited excellent PA retention, maintaining >85% of their initial proton conductivities at 90% relative humidity after 10 humidity cycles. PA-doped membranes PA-C7-QAF and PA-BAF-QAF exhibit superior proton conductivities of 60.3 and 58.4 mS cm −1 at 160 °C, respectively. PA-C7-QAF and PA-BAF-QAF fuel cells deliver peak power densities of 0.579 and 0.537 W cm −2 at 140 °C and 0.706 and 0.640 W cm −2 at 160 °C, respectively, under dehumidified conditions.

Here, the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the drosophila GABA B receptor in both antagonist-bound inactive state and GABA-bound active state in complex with G i protein are reported. The drosophila GABA B receptor exhibits an asymmetric activation, mirroring its human homolog. However, a larger inactive interface prevents drosophila GABA B receptor constitutive activity. Four key residues, which are not conserved in drosophila GABA B receptor, are responsible for the activity of the positive allosteric modulator in its human homolog. Whereas the intracellular loop 2 of drosophila GB2 (dGB2) is less involved, the ordered C terminus of dGB2 and its corresponding region in its human homolog are required for G protein coupling. These evolutionary variations provide a complete understanding of the activation mechanism of the GABA B receptor and new insights for future development of allosteric modulators for medication and insecticides.},

This work reports a multifunctional material constructed via a double-network ionic hydrogel strategy, enabling the integrated realization of efficient electromagnetic shielding and self-powered physiological monitoring. An interpenetrating network skeleton is formed through physical crosslinking of sodium alginate (SA) with Ca 2 ⁺ and in situ polymerization of acrylamide (AM). By regulating the specific coordination of ions to induce directional channels and synergistically regulating salt concentration with hydration, an absorption-dominated shielding mechanism centered on ion polarization-interface relaxation is established. The optimized h -CA-PAM-Li⁺-1.0 hydrogel exhibits an electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (SE T ) of 63.75 dB in the X-band, with absorption loss accounting for over 93%. Leveraging the excellent ionic conductivity of the hydrogel, a self-powered sensor encapsulated in PDMS films and integrated with wireless modules is fabricated, capable of real-time capture of physiological signals such as heartbeat while maintaining high sensitivity and anti-interference capability in dynamic environments. Free of traditional conductive fillers, this material combines biocompatibility, low cost, and designability, providing a material-device-system integrated solution for electromagnetic protection and intelligent monitoring of implantable electronic devices and opening a new research paradigm for multifunctional shielding materials.},

Herein, photoactive 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid (HAC) is integrated into a binuclear dysprosium(III) complex, ( 1 ), which simultaneously exhibits dual light-responsive behaviors of both SMMs and macroscopic mechanical motion. The 365 nm light irradiation induces [4+4] photocycloaddition of anthracene units in 1 , driving a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation to a 1D coordination polymer [Dy₂(HAC)₂(DMF)₂(AC)₆]n ( 1A ). This structural reorganization boosts axial magnetic anisotropy, unlocking SMM behavior with a butterfly-shaped hysteresis loop, whereas thermal annealing regenerates the pristine structure and quenches magnetic bistability. Notably, anisotropic lattice strain from cycloaddition induces macroscopic photomechanical motions, triggering macroscopic torsional dynamics in bulk crystals and pronounced flexural deformations in thin film architectures. This work pioneers the synergistic modulation of magnetic and mechanical properties through light-driven structural dynamics in a single-component system, establishing a fundamental platform for developing intelligent materials with integrated opto-magneto-mechanical functionalities for adaptive sensing and actuation technologies.},

Toward the overall goal, a range of candidate receptor molecules is synthesized, and the leads are selected based on the highest efficacy of protein capture and internalization by the receptor-engineered cells. Receptor performance is validated in model T lymphoblasts, donor-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and hepatocytes. The capture and depletion are achieved over successive additions of the extracellular target protein.  In contrast to pan-IgG degraders, artificial receptors depleted the one, cognate immunoglobulin, leaving the pool of non-cognate proteins un-altered. In an in vitro model system, mimicking hepatic removal of the target protein, receptor-engineered scavenger hepatocytes captured the protein of interest and prevented its association with the cognate receptor on the responder lymphoblasts.},

  abstract     = {To meet the demands of maritime defense and transportation, next-generation microwave absorption (MA) materials must combine efficient attenuation and corrosion resistance (CR). SiC nanofibers, with their moderate dielectric constant and chemical inertness, are ideal multifunctional coating fillers. However, their single-component nature limits microwave attenuation, resulting in low efficiency and narrow bandwidth. Incorporating corrosion-resistant components and employing heterointerface engineering offers a promising strategy to enhance polarization loss and synergistically improve CR. In this study, SiC nanofibers synthesized via chemical vapor deposition are used as precursors; SiO 2 interlayers and nitrogen-doped carbon shells are sequentially introduced to form multilayered core–shell nanofibers. Abundant heterointerfaces and defects effectively regulate impedance matching and introduce multiple loss mechanisms, including conduction, interfacial, and defect-induced dipole polarization. The prepared SiC@SiO 2 @C (SSC) nanofibers achieve a minimum reflection loss of −52.40 dB, a maximum effective absorption bandwidth of 7.68 GHz, and a maximum radar cross-section reduction of 38.42 dB m 2 , demonstrating excellent MA properties. Moreover, SSC/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composite coatings exhibit superior CR performance, with significantly enhanced corrosion potential and reduced current density compared to pure metal and PVDF coatings. This study underscores the synergistic effect of heterointerface engineering in enhancing both MA and CR for harsh environments.},

  abstract     = {The optically pumped atomic magnetometer (OPAM) has emerged as an advanced instrument for magnetic field detection. However, the performance of conventional OPAMs is constrained by factors such as non-uniform atomic polarization and insufficient precision in system polarization control. In this study, a bidirectional-pump OPAM based on spin-decoupled metasurface is presented and experimentally demonstrated. By designing a metasurface structure with a predefined phase distribution, the system generates two circularly polarized (CP) lights with distinct chirality and one linearly polarized (LP) light. Two beams of the CP light are directed in opposite directions along both sides of the cell, which effectively mitigates the polarization gradient within the cell and enhances the stability of the system. Additionally, the use of zero-order LP light as the probe light for the system enhances energy utilization efficiency while simplifying the system architecture. The experimental results demonstrate that the OPAM based on metasurface successfully realizes precise control of atomic spin polarization. The proposed OPAM is capable of performing high-precision magnetic field measurements, and the sensitivity has been improved to 1.85 pT/Hz 1/2 . This research not only advances the application of metasurfaces in quantum precision measurement but also offers a novel approach for enhancing the performance of atomic magnetometers.},

  abstract     = {Nonequilibrium among phonon branches critically influences nanoscale heat transport yet remains largely unexplored in one-dimensional (1D) systems, particularly at cryogenic temperatures. This work reports the first experimental quantification of optical–acoustic phonon coupling factor ( G OA ) in single-walled carbon nanotubes using the frequency-domain energy transport state-resolved Raman technique at cryogenic and room temperatures. Remarkably, a strong suppression of G OA is observed at low temperatures that exceeds the suppression of the coupling of interfacial phonon modes. As temperature increases, G OA is found to increase monotonically, consistent with enhanced anharmonic decay processes of optical phonons. At 93 K, the optical–acoustic phonon temperature difference exceeds 75% of the acoustic phonon temperature rise, which is reduced to about 33% at room temperature. The critical role of laser heating size on phonon nonequilibrium is elucidated, where it gets amplified for a more confined heating size. By utilizing the recently developed equivalent interfacial medium model, the intrinsic temperature-dependent interfacial thermal conductance based on acoustic phonon temperature is obtained. The results show that neglecting the nonequilibrium among phonon branches overestimates the interfacial conductance by ≈30% at room temperature. This research provides fundamental insights into phonon nonequilibrium in 1D nanoscale materials that strongly impact next-generation nanoelectronics and solid-state energy converters.},

While this feature has been widely studied, its application in thermometers based on thermally induced structural phase transitions is a recent development. These thermometers often suffer from a narrow thermal operating range, prompting the search for new host materials. In this context, Na 3 Sc 2 (PO 4 ) 3 :Eu 3+ as a function of temperature and dopant ion concentration. As demonstrated, Na 3 Sc 2 (PO 4 ) 3 :Eu 3+ was investigated as a potential candidate. This material undergoes a reversible phase transition from a monoclinic to a trigonal structure, leading to significant changes in both the emission spectra and the luminescence decay of Eu 3+ ions. These effects enable the development of both ratiometric and lifetime-based luminescent thermometers, achieving maximum relative sensitivities of 3.4% K −1 and 1.0% K − 1, respectively. Furthermore, the thermal operating range can be tuned by adjusting the Eu 3+ concentration. Importantly, this study demonstrates, for the first time, temperature imaging using only Eu 3+ -doped phosphor via a digital camera without the use of optical filters. These results position Na 3 Sc 2 (PO 4 ) 3 :Eu 3+ as a promising multifunctional material for advanced applications in contactless temperature sensing and thermal imaging.},

Differential expression analyses identify metabolic and secretory tissues (i.e., liver, mammary gland, and pituitary) and cell types (e.g., hepatocytes, luminal cells, somatotropes, and lactotropes) that mediate the divergence of milk production. Lactotrope-specific downregulation of TRHDE in river buffalo is associated with high milk production. Integrative analyses of sc/snRNA-seq data with genomic data in buffalo and cattle reveal key cell types (e.g., luminal cells and excitatory neurons) and genes (e.g., RPL13 and LALBA ) associated with milk production.

  abstract     = {Relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) remains the leading cause of MM mortality. FOXM1 is strongly associated with RRMM, making it a compelling therapeutic target. Through three low-throughput screenings, we have identified nine FDA-approved drugs, including the BH3 mimetic Venetoclax, that synergize with FOXM1 inhibitor NB73 in killing MM cells. Venetoclax has shown effects in 6% of non-t(11;14) and 27% of t(11;14) MM cases. The NB73-Venetoclax combination barely induces acute toxicity in vivo and represses MM cells in vivo and ex vivo. NB73 enhances the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of FOXM1, an effect further amplified by Venetoclax. The NB73-Venetoclax combination abolishes FOXM1's binding to promoters of key MYC pathway genes, such as PLK1, leading to significant downregulation of their expression. Furthermore, the PLK1-specific inhibitor GSK461364 synergizes with NB73 to inhibit MM cell growth. Interestingly, NB73 does not sensitize U266 cells, a Venetoclax-resistant t(11;14) MM cell line expressing high FOXM1, to Venetoclax treatment, which is corrected by a new-generation BH3 mimetic Sonrotoclax and ALK inhibitor Ceritinib. Collectively, targeting FOXM1 demonstrates significant potential for enhancing the efficacy of FDA-approved drugs in RRMM. These findings shed new light on the discouraging outcomes of the Phase-III CANOVA study centering Venetoclax with an encouraging molecular clue.},

Traditional AR displays struggle to simultaneously achieve large depth-of-field (DOF), large viewing eyebox, and wide field-of-view (FOV), which limits their practical applicability. Here, a novel AR near-eye display scheme is proposed that addresses these limitations, providing a large DOF, expansive eyebox, and wide FOV. The DOF is largely extended at each viewpoint on the eye pupil plane by directly projecting light rays onto the retina. Meanwhile, numerous viewpoints are generated in space to significantly expand the viewing eyebox, with each viewpoint independently controllable to dynamically track eye movements in real time without the need for mechanical steering parts. Freeform and holographic optics are deeply cooperated in the proposed off-axis display for achieving high performance over the full FOV, eyebox and DOF range, as well as compact form factor. A display system prototype is built, and the display results, featuring a DOF from 0.25 to 10 m, a 50° wide FOV, and a 10 mm×10 mm viewing eyebox, along with good optical see-through viewing, demonstrate the effectiveness and advancement of the proposed scheme, offering valuable insights for the future design of AR displays.},

As a critical factor for achieving 2 nd - and 3 rd -order PSBs, the layer thickness is modulated to achieve multi-wavelength reflectivity within a single film. The films are fabricated using alternating layer deposition of photo-crosslinkable poly(2-vinylnaphthalene- co -benzophenone acrylate) (p(2VN- co -BPA)) and 52%-quaternized poly(4-vinylpyridine- co -benzophenone acrylate) (P4QP-52%). Upon increasing the relative humidity (RH), the films exhibit 1 st -, 2 nd -, and 3 rd -order PSBs with visible color transitions across the spectrum. This behavior becomes evident as the thickness of the P4QP-52% layer increases. Notably, for those films with relatively thick P4QP-52% layers, the shift in the 2 nd - and 3 rd -order PSBs is substantial enough to create composite colors, such as magenta, through the superposition of red from the 2 nd -order PSB and blue from the 3 rd -order PSB. This mechanism represents a significant advancement in PC technology and opens up new possibilities for colorimetric sensing and tunable optical materials. For practical applications, these films are further explored in anti-counterfeiting applications, where their color transitions and hidden patterning are demonstrated. The films showed vivid color changes and distinct patterning in response to high humidity, offering potential for use in security and authentication applications.},

The molecular layer enhances both the desolvation process and transport rate of zinc ions, thereby suppressing the dendrite formation. The interfacial side reactions caused by excessive water molecules in solvated ions are practically minimized as well, thus the zinc anode turns more durable and robust under high-rate conditions. Specifically, at a moderate current density of 1 mA cm −2 @1 mAh cm −2 , the cycle stability of the zinc anode is improved to 8800 h, and up to 1100 h at a high current density of 10 mA cm −2 @5 mAh cm −2 .

However, systematically designing channel topological structures remains challenging for complex turbulent flows. Here, this challenge is addressed by developing a machine learning framework to efficiently perform topology optimization of channel structures for turbulent mass transfer. A topological structure is represented using a neural network (referred to as “neural topology”), which is optimized by employing pre-trained neural operators combined with a fine-tuning strategy with active data augmentation. The optimization is performed targeting two objectives: maximization of mass transfer efficiency and minimization of energy consumption, for the possible considerations of compromise between the two in real-world designs. The developed neural operator with active learning is data efficient in network training and demonstrates superior computational efficiency compared with traditional methods in obtaining optimal structures across a large design space. The optimization results are experimentally validated, proving that the optimized channel improves concentration uniformity by 37% compared to the original channel. The variation of the optimal structures with changes in inlet velocity conditions is also demonstrated, offering insights for designing turbulent mass transfer devices under various operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {2D metal clusters maximize atom–surface interactions, making them highly attractive for energy and electronic technologies. However, their fabrication remains extremely challenging because they are thermodynamically unstable. Current methods are limited to element-specific binding sites or confinement of metals between layers, with no universal strategy achieved to date. Here, a general approach is presented that uses vacancy defects as universal binding sites to fabricate single-layer metal clusters (SLMC). It is demonstrated that the density of these vacancies governs metal atom diffusion and bonding to the surface, overriding the metal's physicochemical properties. Crucially, the reactivity of vacancy sites must be preserved prior to metal deposition to enable SLMC formation. This strategy is demonstrated across 21 elements and their mixtures, yielding SLMC with areal densities up to 4.3 atoms∙nm⁻ 2 , without heteroatom doping, while maintaining high thermal, environmental, and electrochemical stability. These findings provide a universal strategy for stabilizing SLMC, eliminating the need for element-specific synthesis and metal confinement protocols and offering a strategy for efficiently utilizing metals.},

  abstract     = {Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the second-leading cause of cancer-associated mortality. Neutrophil extracellular trap formation (i.e., NETosis) is a crucial process in forming VTE in cancer patients. Nevertheless, how cancer cells contribute to NETosis remains unclear. This study investigated the potential activation effects of cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles (CC-EVs) on neutrophils. Both small and large EVs (sEVs and lEVs) released from cancer cells are found to significantly induce NETosis in neutrophil-like HL-60 (dHL-60) cells. Following an in-depth exploration of EV-induced NETosis, the specific molecular pathways involved in this biological process are elucidated. CYBA enriched in CC-lEVs is delivered to dHL-60, leading to a rapid increase in intracellular ROS levels and upregulation of citH3 expression. This cascade resulted in decondensed chromatin release and subsequent NETosis along with elevated MPO-DNA levels. Injection of CC-lEVs into mice caused more pronounced VTE, which is accompanied by increased peripheral blood levels of the MPO-DNA and thrombin-antithrombin complex. Inhibiting CYBA expression or ROS generation prevented NETosis in vitro and significantly reduced VTE in vivo. In conclusion, CC-lEVs induce NETosis through the CYBA-ROS-citH3 pathway and increase VTE risk. Targeting CYBA expression or ROS production can provide novel strategies for preventing and treating VTE in high-risk cancer patients.},

By leveraging the intimate interplay between PtO 4 sites and 2D substrates, while maintaining a consistent coordination environment, underlying mechanism for enhanced kinetics in interfacial synergistic hydrogen evolution reaction is systematically elucidated. Notably, the self-assembled PtO 4 site exhibits up to a 30-fold enhancement of mass activity compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts, contingent upon the choice of substrate material. Theoretical investigation illustrates facilitated electron transfer, optimized energy barriers, and additional reaction pathways resulting from the synergistic interplay between PtO 4 and Ti 3 C 2 O 2 MXene.

However, the underlying mechanism of Seipin-regulated liver lipid metabolism remains mysterious. Here, experiments show that over-expression of Seipin down-regulates HFD-induced liver triglyceride (TG) accumulation and promotes zebrafish growth. Real-time PCR and immunoblotting suggest that Seipin interacts with Plin2 through its second transmembrane domain to inhibit the expression of Plin2 by promoting Plin2 ubiquitination, thereby ameliorating lipid accumulation. Co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) experiments and Biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis reveal a close interaction between Seipin and phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis enzyme CCTα and CHPT in zebrafish and mice. Thus, Seipin may participate in PC synthesis and increase cellular PC levels. Elevated PC levels subsequently suppress Plin2 expression. Meanwhile, CCTα, the rate-limiting enzyme of the PC synthesis pathway, exhibited a unique regulatory role on Plin2 expression as a potential transcription factor. It is proposed that Seipin balances TG homeostasis, PC synthesis, and Plin2 expression to alleviate hepatic steatosis, providing a promising target for fatty liver disease.},

Herein, a hydroxyl-rich Mg 0.55 Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) support is developed via aqueous miscible organic solvent treatment, circumventing energy-intensive calcination while engineering mesopores for efficient polyethyleneimine (PEI) loading. The optimized 60 wt.% PEI modified Mg 0.55 Al-CO 3 AMO-LDH achieves a CO 2 uptake of 3.92 mmol g −1 under simulated wet air at 25 °C and retains 90.8% capacity over 20 cycles. Crucially, the abundant surface hydroxyls of uncalcined LDH, validated by 1 H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and in situ X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, form hydrogen bonds with PEI, suppressing oxidative degradation. After 3 h at 120 °C in simulated air, PEI-LDH retains a CO 2 capacity of 1.06 mmol g −1 , significantly outperforming PEI/mixed metal oxide and conventional silica-based adsorbents. In situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy further reveals that hydroxyl-mediated amine anchoring minimizes water co-adsorption. This work establishes a dual strategy of hydroxyl preservation and mesopore engineering to design cost-effective DAC adsorbents, achieving both high capacity and exceptional stability under realistic operating conditions.},

We aimed to explore the contribution of atial CFs (ACFs)-derived exosomes to AF development. Cultured primary human ACFs (hACFs) and rat ACFs are treated with angiotensin II, and the secreted exosomes are transferred to rats. Action potential duration and L-type calcium current ( I Ca ) are tested. Global microRNA-224-5p knock-in and fibroblast-specific microRNA-224-5p knock-in ( FMKI ) mice underwent an inducible AF test. Transferred exosomes of Ang II-induced hACFs and primary adult rat ACFs increased AF incidence and prolonged AF duration. The inhibitor of exosomes and knockdown of Dicer rescued the AF phenotype. MicroRNA array suggested upregulated microRNA-224-5p level in both primary adult rat ACFs and ACFs-secreted exosomes. microRNA-224-5p agonist shortened atrial effective refractory period (AERP) and promoted AF. Mechanistically, microRNA-224-5p bound to CACNA1C and inhibited its transcription. Moreover, global microRNA-224-5p knock-in and FMKI mice exhibited increased inducible AF incidence, accompanied by diminished I Ca current in ACMs. Exosome microRNA-224-5p is enhanced in ACFs isolated from atria and plasma of AF patients, and positively correlated with recurrence after radiofrequency ablation. In summary, ACFs-derived exosome microRNA-224-5p contributes to AF by inhibiting CACNA1C to drive atrial electrical remodeling.},

Here, iStretch, a mechano-visual-thermo adaptive e-skin is introduced that integrates durable strain sensing, dynamic heat therapy, and intuitive visual feedback via a multiphasic and bilayer architecture. The strain-sensing bottom layer utilises constrained microcrack propagation in graphene-liquid metal nanocomposites, achieving high sensitivity (GF = 281), broad sensing range (300%), and exceptional durability (10,000 cycles). Simultaneously, the thermoresponsive top layer provides dynamic visual feedback and heat modulation in response to strain.

  abstract     = {The convergence of inorganic electrides and topological quantum phenomena has ushered in novel paradigms for designing advanced quantum materials. While low-dimensional (0–2D) topological inorganic electrides have garnered considerable attention, their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts—featuring intricate interstitial electron networks—remain entirely uncharted territory. Herein, the identification of twelve 3D inorganic electrides within the rare-earth hydride family is reported, nine of which are previously unreported. First-principles calculations reveal a diverse magnetic landscape: two systems exhibit ferromagnetic ordering, while seven demonstrate antiferromagnetic configurations. Strikingly, these materials host rich topological states, encompassing nodal points, nodal lines, and associated surface signatures such as Fermi arcs and drumhead-like states. When spin-orbit coupling is introduced, the magnetic ordering breaks time-reversal symmetry, thereby generating substantial Berry curvature and resulting in a relatively large anomalous Hall conductivity (939 S cm −1 ). Furthermore, these inorganic electrides exhibit ultralow work functions (2.6–3.9 eV) on rare-earth-terminated surfaces. Under external electric fields, the 3D interstitial electrons migrate to the surface, forming a quasi-2D electron gas. Significantly, such low work functions can effectively activate N 2 , enhancing catalytic NH 3 synthesis. These findings establish an ideal platform to explore 3D inorganic electrides, along with their topological features, anomalous transport phenomena, low work functions, and NH 3 synthesis.},

Experimental validation confirms nanometric ranging precision, with Allan deviation below 0.1 nm at 1 ms integration.

Moreover, it detects nanoscale water surface vibrations through precise laser-ranging analysis. Notably, the system maintains high measurement precision across a wide spatial scale—from meter-level free-space ranging to nanometer-scale vibration sensing—demonstrating exceptional versatility. Compared to conventional AOM-based approaches, the method provides enhanced flexibility, reduced RF power consumption, and improved photonic integration compatibility, thus offering substantial benefits for precision metrology and high-resolution sensing applications.},

To address this issue, polypyrrole (PPy) decorated topological quantum insulator (Bi 2 Te 3 @PPy) is introduced as a novel anode in AAIBs. Benefiting from the interconnected PPy network and the gap-free metallic surface state of Bi 2 Te 3 , the Bi 2 Te 3 @PPy anode enables a remarkable discharge capacity of 438 mAh g −1 at a current rate of 0.5 A g −1 . It also maintains a strong discharging plateau even at a higher current rate of 10 A g −1 , outperforming most electrode materials reported so far for AAIBs. The role of the topological surface states of Bi 2 Te 3 in enhancing the ion migration rate is validated by comparing its performance across various morphologies. Ex situ studies and computational analysis reveal that in aqueous systems, Al 3+ is not the sole species responsible for charge storage. Instead, hydronium ions (H 3 O + ) significantly contribute to storing the charges through intercalation into the crystal lattice. Overall, this study pioneers a new approach for developing advanced Al metal-free AAIBs and provides deeper insights into the charge storage mechanisms in aqueous electrolytes.},

After food allergens (peanut, milk, and egg), non-allergen (Rubisco) or pro-inflammatory stimuli (toxin A and LPS) exposure, distinguishable effects on epithelial barrier integrity and moDC driven Th1/Th2 immune responses are observed.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify radioresistance genes and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms using patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Transcriptome analyses are performed on radio-resistant and -sensitive PDOs, CRC cells, and xenograft tissues to screen for radioresistant genes. Additionally, the genetic homology between PDOs and clinical tissues is verified using whole-exome sequencing. Functional experiments are performed to validate the roles of the candidate genes using cellular, organoid, and animal models. Forkhead box P4 (FOXP4) is identified as a differentially expressed genes between the radio-sensitive and -resistant groups that is linked to radioresistance. Further experiments show that FOXP4 promoted radioresistance by suppressing ferroptosis. Mechanistically, FOXP4 regulated GPX4 transcription by binding to the promoter region of GPX4 via the forkhead domain to inhibit the onset of ferroptosis. Doxorubicin (DOX) inhibited FOXP4 expression by promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, eventually increasing radiosensitivity. Notably, DOX combined with irradiation attenuated the compensatory increase in FOXP4 expression and increased radiotherapy efficacy. Conclusively, the combination therapy provides a new strategy for enhancing therapeutic efficacy in CRC.},

  abstract     = {Resolving the severe issues such as electric field distortion, dendritic zinc growth, and uneven zinc deposition under high depths of discharge (DOD) has become a significant hurdle of the aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). To address these challenges, an interfacial regulation strategy is proposed based on the molecular damping effect, in which a trace amount of weakly adsorbing additive is employed to stabilize the Zn anode interface by mitigating energy shocks and ionic disturbances induced by electric field fluctuations. Trace perfluorinated PSVE (erfluoro-3,6-dioxa-4-methyloct-7-enesulphonyl fluoride) is introduced to the traditional ZnSO 4 electrolyte to optimize Zn deposition behavior on the zinc anode. Thus, the Zn//Zn symmetric batteries exhibit a prolonged cycling lifespan of over 200 h, even when operated at a high DOD of 85.5%. Additionally, the NVO (Na 2 V 6 O 16 ) cathodes coupled with Zn anodes and modified electrolyte present a more stable capacity retention, maintaining a capacity of 141.98 mAh g −1 after 1000 cycles. Similarly, the full batteries assembled with the same electrodes in a ZnSO 4 electrolyte retain only 51.49 mAh g −1 capacity after the same conditions. This work highlights the potential of the molecular damping effect as a promising solution for improving high DOD performance in ZIBs.},

  abstract     = {Supercooling preservation holds great promise for extending the storage limits of organs. However, supercooled systems are susceptible to stochastic ice nucleation, which can cause fatal damage to the organs. In this study, an organogel interface composed of nanoscale polydimethylsiloxane and dimethyl-silicone oil is proposed, which presents a significant energy barrier for ice nucleation, comparable to that of homogeneous nucleation. The organogel effectively eliminates primary ice nucleation sites, enabling a quasi-homogeneous supercooling preservation system that does not rely on cryoprotectant agents or machine perfusion. Through a series of statistical experiments, this approach is demonstrated to be able to maintain stable supercooling and preserve mouse hearts at −4 °C for up to 72 h. A comprehensive assessment conducted at multiple scales indicates that the 36-h supercooling preservation at −4 °C significantly mitigates cardiac injury by regulating mitochondrial structure and reducing metabolic rates. Utilizing a heart transplantation model with prognostic evaluations extending up to 3 months post-transplantation, supercooling preservation within the quasi-homogeneous system is confirmed, which can double the storage duration compared to clinically applied hypothermic preservation methods.},

High-performance thermoelectric materials require excellent electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity. Among emerging candidates, AB 2 X 4 (A = Ge, Sn, Pb; B = Sb, Bi; X = Se, Te) compounds have garnered attention due to their unique septuple atomic layered crystal structure and poor lattice thermal conductivity. Here, the septuple atomic layered SnBi 2 Te 4 is successfully synthesized and its thermoelectric performance significantly enhanced through isovalent elements alloying. The peak ZT ≈ 0.56 at 473 K and an average ZT ≈ 0.47 achieved over the temperature 300–673 K, which is 12 and 14 times higher than those in pristine SnBi 2 Te 4 . The incorporation of Sb and Se into p -type SnBi 2 Te 4 system significantly improves thermoelectric performance through three synergistic mechanisms: 1) enhance the electrical conductivity via effective mass enlarging, 2) suppress the bipolar thermal diffusion through bandgap widening, and 3) reduce the lattice thermal conductivity by point defect scattering. The results demonstrate that isovalent elements alloying is an effective strategy to realize the promising high performance of septuple atomic layered p -type SnBi 2 Te 4 , which is applicable strategy for AB 2 X 4 based compounds.},

TGFβ1 represents a critical therapeutic target as a key cytokine involved in immune suppression and tumor progression. Here, a DNA origami-based framework functionalized with anti-TGFβ1 aptamers is developed to act as a captor for efficient TGFβ1 sequestration and fast clearance, thereby improving anti-tumor immunity. By engineering the geometric shapes and pore sizes of three DNA framework captors (DFCs), the superior efficacy of a barrel-shaped captor (DBC) in regulating TGFβ1 levels is demonstrated. In cell culture, DBCs significantly enhance T cell-mediated tumor cytotoxicity, while systemic administration effectively inhibits tumor growth in the mouse model. Moreover, DBCs demonstrate a synergistic effect with PD-L1 antibody to enhance anti-tumor efficacy. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) further confirmes the DBC-mediated reduction of TGFβ in tumor tissue and its biodistribution fate. These findings underscore the importance of cytokine regulation in cancer immunotherapy and provide valuable insights for the rational design and application of structural DNA nano-devices as a transformative tool for precise immunomodulation.},

  abstract     = {As a major component of the cytoskeleton, intermediate filaments are generally considered to play a supporting role in mitotic cells. They also take part in the regulation of cell motility, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, their specific functions during meiosis are largely unknown. Here, a unique role of an intermediate filament protein beaded filament structural protein 2 (BFSP2) is reported, which is predominantly expressed in lens fiber epithelial cells, as a spindle formation controller in oocyte meiosis. BFSP2 is constantly expressed during oocyte meiotic maturation, and specifically distributed on the spindle apparatus at metaphase I (MI) and metaphase II (MII) stages. Depletion of BFSP2 resulted in the meiotic arrest at MI stage due to the aberrant spindle assembly-induced spindle assembly checkpoint activation. Depletion of BFSP2 also led to incorrect kinetochore-microtubule attachments and the occurrence of aneuploidy in oocytes. Mechanistically, immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry analysis identified clathrin heavy chain 1 (CLTC) as the downstream mediator of BFSP2 during meiotic spindle assembly. It is further determined that BFSP2 recruited the molecular chaperone heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) to the spindle apparatus for stabilizing CLTC, and thus driving the spindle formation. In summary, these findings uncover a noncanonical function of the intermediate filament protein BFSP2 as a spindle assembly controller in oocyte meiosis.},

This study introduces a “dimensional rise” strategy integrating 3D-printed porous titanium frameworks with micro-nano hierarchical structures to establish a mechanically robust, high-capacity drug reservoir, surpassing the limitations of conventional 2D surface modifications. Copper-doped carbon quantum dots, synthesized from luteolin, synergize with polydopamine-mediated photothermal activation to disrupt bacterial copper homeostasis, inducing tricarboxylic acid cycle collapse and cuproptosis-like death via reactive oxygen species bursts and lipoylated protein aggregation. Concurrently, glucose oxidase depletes local glucose to activate adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in host cells, restoring mitochondrial integrity and metabolic homeostasis through deacetylation. This dual-action system achieves differential regulation—targeting bacteria while protecting host tissues—and ensures therapeutic coverage across acute infection and chronic healing phases. Validated in three animal models, including Beagles with clinical-grade implants, the strategy demonstrates potent anti-biofilm efficacy, prevention of secondary infections, and accelerated diabetic osseogenesis. By upgrading surface engineering to 3D volumetric drug reservoirs, this work establishes a paradigm for differentiated multimodal therapy against implant-related infections in metabolically compromised hosts, addressing both immediate bactericidal demands and long-term tissue recovery.},

It is utilized to test 273 clinical samples across multiple centers. The validation sets are then analyzed using machine learning, resulting in a precise diagnostic model for ESCC. This model, based on nine diagnostic protein biomarkers identified through mass spectrometry analysis of differentially expressed proteins, achieves an accuracy of 91.0% in external validation, with a 90.8% accuracy in detecting early-stage ESCC. These results significantly surpass the accuracy (only 14.4%) of the currently used biomarker for squamous cell carcinoma. Thus, integrating extracellular vesicles protein analysis with machine learning presents can identify ESCC patients. The developed extracellular vesicles analysis platform offers a promising tool for the clinical application of multi-biomarker detection methods, advancing the early diagnosis of ESCC.},

  abstract     = {Periodontitis in menopausal women tends to exacerbate, potentially resulting in tooth loss and increased risk of systemic diseases. The prior research demonstrates that pro-inflammatory changes in macrophages under estrogen deficiency exacerbate periodontitis. However, the primary environmental factors contributing to the alteration of monocyte-macrophages remain unknown. Recent studies, including animal models and clinical trials, have found a correlation between accumulation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and periodontitis progression in postmenopausal women. In estrogen-deficient mice, macrophages in VAT show a pro-inflammatory state. Removing VAT alleviates periodontitis in OVX mice. DNA methylation sequencing shows increased methylation in macrophages, especially Jazf1 hypermethylation, inhibiting its expression and promoting inflammation. Subsequently, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from pro-inflammatory macrophages further intensify M1-like polarization in resting macrophages, carrying inflammatory microRNAs like miR-30e-5p. Overall, this study proposes a novel perspective: periodontal pathogens act as initial triggers for inflammation, while chronic systemic inflammation, worsened by estrogen deficiency, is the main factor that exacerbates periodontitis. Pro-inflammatory macrophages in VAT release sEVs, which activate resting macrophages into a pro-inflammatory state upon encountering periodontal pathogens, resulting in persistent inflammation. Addressing the root causes of this dysregulation can lead to new therapeutic strategies for periodontitis and systemic inflammatory conditions, particularly in postmenopausal women.},

Here, using genetic variants related to human brain morphometry ( n = 36778) and functional networks ( n = 47276), bidirectional two-sample and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) is performed to systematically investigate causal relationships between 83 brain-wide volumes, 191 resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging phenotypes, and MD to identify core brain region volumes and functional networks associated with MD onset. Unlike other severe psychiatric disorders, reductions in left and right ventral diencephalon and thalamus volumes, together with decreased functional connectivity between the precuneus, cuneus, or cingulate gyri and frontal regions within the triple network (default mode network, central executive network, and salience network) uniquely predict MD onset. Using the identified markers as mediators in two-step MR recommends quitting smoking, moderately increasing alcohol frequency without developing alcohol use disorder, engaging in walking for leisure, and participating in exercises (e.g., swimming, cycling, keep fit, bowling) to positively influence imaging phenotypes and reduce MD risk. These findings enhance the understanding of predictive outcomes in brain imaging and support proactive prevention of severe mental health disorders through behavioral modifications.},

The formation of CNPs follows zero-order kinetics with an induction period dependent on the reactivity of the organic precursor. Experimental evidence suggests a surface-catalyzed photochemical process involving a partial change in C-atom hybridization from sp 2 to sp 3 , with oxygen-based functional groups passivating the surface of the nanostructures. The presence of additional heteroatoms depends on the structure and composition of the precursor. Contingent on the starting compound, the prepared CNPs can be classified as amorphous carbon nanodots (CNDs) or layered curved-graphene quantum dots (c-GQDs), resembling nano-onion fragments. CNDs are obtained from substituted benzenes or heterocyclic compounds, whereas c-GQDs can be synthesized from benzene. Photophysical characterization of the CNPs shows both wavelength-dependent excitation and emission bands, with constant emission quantum yields in the 1–10% range, and wavelength-dependent emission decays displaying several lifetime components in the range 1–20 ns. Triplet exciton lifetimes longer than 5 µs and wavelength-dependent singlet oxygen production quantum yields in the 10–40% range have been measured.},

While historical research has largely focused on the osseous abnormalities associated with DDH, current surgical interventions, though prevalent, often carry significant and unavoidable side effects. To break through these limitations, the study delved into the acetabular labrum, a crucial intra-articular structure that presents abnormalities in DDH patients. Through single-cell combined spatial transcriptomic analysis of the acetabular labrum under diverse conditions, a comprehensive examination of the changes of DDH tissue changes at the single-cell level is pioneered, conclusively linking aberrant fibrocartilage stem/progenitor cell proliferation to disease progression. The subsequent in vivo and in vitro experiments unequivocally identify the MK signaling pathway as a pivotal target for DDH treatment. Localized administration of its specific inhibitor not only substantially alleviates early structural abnormalities in DDH but also lays a robust and promising foundation for the innovation and clinical translation of new therapeutic strategies for DDH. In summary, the findings not only deepen the understanding of DDH pathogenesis but also pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies that prioritize both efficacy and safety.},

Golgi membrane protein 1 (GOLM1) is a Golgi type II transmembrane protein and associates with inflammation and oxidative stress. The present study tries to investigate the role and mechanism of GOLM1 in DN using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. It is found that GOLM1 expression is elevated in diabetic kidneys and high glucose-stimulated podocytes, and positively correlated with renal dysfunction during DN progression. Podocyte-specific GOLM1 ablation prevents, while podocyte-specific GOLM1 overexpression facilitates diabetes-related inflammation, oxidative damage, apoptosis, and renal dysfunction in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistic studies reveal that podocyte-specific GOLM1 ablation attenuated DN through activating adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) pathway, and inhibiting AMPKα pathway completely abolishes the beneficial effects in podocyte-specific GOLM1 knockout ( Golm1 pKO ) mice or podocytes. Further findings imply that podocyte GOLM1 inactivated AMPKα pathway through interacting with epidermal growth factor receptor to inhibit peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ. Moreover, treatment with GOLM1 neutralizing antibody is sufficient to alleviate DN in mice. Overall, the study for the first time identifies a pathogenic role of podocyte GOLM1 in the progression of DN, and inhibiting GOLM1 represents an attractive therapeutic approach to treat DN.},

The investigational new drug, SHetA2, interacts with mortalin releasing its client proteins. In this study, interactions of SHetA2 moieties and mortalin substrate binding domain (SBD) amino acids are demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to occur at low micromolar SHetA2 concentrations that selectively kill cancer cells over noncancerous cells. In both ovarian cancer and noncancerous cells SHetA2 reduces: mitochondria import of mortalin, degradation of mortalin's mitochondrial localization sequence (MLS), mortalin/inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors complexes and oxidative phosphorylation. In cancer cells only, SHetA2 reduces calcium levels, mitochondrial length and fusion proteins, while inducing autophagy and PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/PARKIN-mediated mitophagy. Noncancerous cells exhibit increased mitochondrial branch length in response to SHetA2 and a low level of inducible autophagy that is resistant to SHetA2. Inhibition of autophagosome-lysosome fusion reduces, or increases, SHetA2 cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer or noncancerous cells, respectively. SHetA2 inhibits mortalin and growth, and induces mitophagy in ovarian cancer xenografts and increases survival post-surgical tumor removal. In conclusion, SHetA2 binds directly to mortalin's SBD and causes distinct responses in ovarian cancer and noncancerous cells.},

Here, it is found that the serine/arginine-rich protein kinase 1 (SRPK1)-dependent phosphorylation of API5 at S464 site is essential for priming antiviral immune responses during diverse RNA virus infection. Mechanistically, phosphorylated API5 forms complexes with autophagic receptor p62 and eliminates itself from ubiquitination at K141, thereby reducing p62 aggregations and inhibiting the autophagic degradation of cytosolic RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5 to mobilize RLR-mediated antiviral responses. Taken together, it is unveiled that API5 phosphorylation by SRPK1 is required for the inhibition of ubiquitin-mediated autophagic degradation of RNA sensors, revealing a coordinating nature of virus–host interactions that sustains host antiviral defenses.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) imposes a heavy medical burden worldwide due to the lack of effective treatment. High levels of mtROS and mitochondrial damage in the renal tubules are the initiating and core factors driving the progression of DKD. However, the effectiveness of current antioxidant drugs is greatly limited, mainly due to the difficulty of simultaneously breaching the glomerular barrier and targeting tubular mitochondria, as well as their limited ability to sustain treatment of chronic DKD. Here, this study reports a Se embedded adaptive antioxidant nanodrug (AAN) with negative surface charge and high mitochondrial targeting that can pass through the renal tubules and be highly enriched in the affected renal tubular mitochondria in DKD. AAN can eliminate mtROS to release soluble Se, which is then converted into the key bioactive enzymes -GPX4, effectively inhibiting ferroptosis and protecting mitochondria by exerting adaptive antioxidant effects. In the DKD mouse model, AAN treatment can effectively restore renal function, and the therapeutic effect at a dose of 10 mg kg −1 every 4 days is significantly better than Metformin administered at a dose of 200 mg kg −1 per day. In conclusion, this study provides a promising strategy to enhance the effects of antioxidant therapy to break the pathological barriers in DKD treatment.},

  abstract     = {Bone is the most common site of breast cancer metastasis, yet understanding the intricate mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets remains nascent. Here it is reported that breast cancer establishes a hyperglycemic bone pre-metastatic niche before migrating to bone tissue and further enhances glucose metabolism following metastatic colonization. An intervention strategy is subsequently proposed targeting glucose metabolism utilizing a biomimetic-engineered enzyme-based nanoplatform. This platform's membrane shielding reduces the interaction between engineered glucose oxidase and circulating glucose, while the engineered enzyme specifically targets glucose metabolism, enabling self-amplifying starvation combined with selective chemotherapy. Such precision can precisely inhibit breast cancer bone metastases and block distal tumor dissemination. This study provides novel insights into the role of glucose metabolism in the pre-metastatic niche and presents a proof-of-concept for metabolic-targeted strategies in breast cancer bone metastasis treatment. This approach holds significant promise for improving therapeutic outcomes in metastatic breast cancer by targeting the metabolic vulnerabilities of the bone microenvironment and halting systemic tumor spread.},

  abstract     = {Streptococcus agalactiae is a significant pathogen in both humans and animals, yet the immune cell subtype dynamics during infection remain poorly defined. Leveraging the high susceptibility and tractability of Nile tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus ), 113,356 single immune cells are profiled from head kidney and spleen across multiple infection time points (0, 1, 5, 10, 75 days post-infection and 3 days post-reinfection). This single-cell transcriptomic and flow cytometry analyses revealed distinct activation and transition patterns among neutrophils, macrophages, T cells, and B cells. Neutrophils exhibited early transcriptional remodeling enriched in inflammatory and interferon gamma (IFNγ) signaling pathways. Cross-species integration identified a conserved IFNγ-driven transition toward il8⁺ neutrophils. Furthermore, recombinant interleukin-8 (IL8) enhanced antibacterial responses in tilapia and human neutrophils, while inhibition of STAT1 reduced IL8 expression. IL8 stimulation increased phagocytosis and  reactive oxygen species (ROS） production, supporting its role in neutrophil-mediated bacterial clearance. Together, this findings establish IFNγ-IL8 as a conserved mechanism in vertebrate immunity and a potential target for antibacterial therapies.},

  abstract     = {The genome is folded within the dense cell nucleus in a hierarchical manner, resulting in complex interactions between distinct folding strategies at various length scales. To elucidate how short-range loop domains regulate higher-order structures of the chromatin, such as topologically associating domains (TADs) and compartments, HiCGen is introduced as a hierarchical and cell-type-specific generator based on Swin-transformer architecture. HiCGen predicts genome organization across different spatial scales utilizing DNA sequence and genomic features as inputs. The model enables in silico screening through genetic or epigenetic perturbations on genome architecture, with resolution down to 1 kb. The analysis reveals unexpected linear correlations between loop properties and genome organization at various levels, including insulation degree, compartmentalization, and contact intensity over genomic distances exceeding 10 Mb. Regional or global perturbation conducted by HiCGen provides biological implications for such cross-scale correlations and their genome-function dependence. Notably, perturbation analysis of the human genome in sigmoid colon tissue demonstrates that modest activation of carcinogenesis-associated enhancers is sufficient to hijack nearby promoter, reshape TAD boundaries, and even flip compartment at mega-base scale.},

Engineered Antibody-like proteins (ALPs) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are engineered to address immune dysregulation in COVID-19. In this study, Lectifitin-36 and Lectifitin-41, two such ALPs, are developed using cDNA display technology. These ALPs demonstrate strong binding affinity for the spike protein and effectively inhibit its interaction with ACE2 and several C-type lectins, including MBL, DC-SIGN, and L-SIGN. Both in vitro and in vivo analyses reveal that Lectifitin-36 and Lectifitin-41 suppress complement activation via the lectin pathway, reduce neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and attenuate hyper-inflammatory responses. In mouse models, Lectifitin-36 and Lectifitin-41 significantly mitigate inflammation, NETosis, and lung tissue damage induced by the spike protein. These results suggest that these ALPs hold promise as therapeutic candidates for alleviating SARS-CoV-2-induced immune dysfunction, with the potential to reduce severe COVID-19 outcomes and long-term sequelae.

  abstract     = {Mammalian cloning through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) involves reprogramming terminally differentiated cells into totipotent embryos. Epigenetic barriers inherited from somatic cells impede reprogramming efficiency and lead to low SCNT embryo development rates. Recent studies have identified two primary types of epigenetic barriers in mouse SCNT embryos, defective pre-implantation development due to abnormal gene expression around zygotic genome activation, associated with aberrant H3K9me3, H3K4me3, and histone acetylation, and defective post-implantation development due to loss of H3K27me3-mediated non-canonical imprinting. Despite these findings, effective strategies to overcome these barriers in a single embryo have not been established. Here, Kdm4d and Kdm5b overexpression are combined with TSA treatment to overcome epigenetic barriers in pre-implantation development, while using tetraploid complementation to replace extraembryonic lineage cells, thereby overcoming imprinting defects critical for post-implantation development. This approach resulted in ≈30% full-term development efficiency of reconstructed embryos. The strategy not only represents the highest SCNT efficiency achieved in mammals but also enhances the feasibility of efficient mammal cloning.},

  abstract     = {Progressive cardiac fibrosis post myocardial infarction (MI) drives pathological remodeling and heart failure, yet the role of endoplasmic reticulum-selective autophagy (ER-phagy) in this process remains unclear. Autocrine Motility Factor Receptor (AMFR) is a recently identified ER-phagy regulator, whose function under myocardial pathology remains poorly understood. Here, it is found that FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy activity is elevated in fibrotic mouse heart tissues post-MI and in cardiac fibroblasts stimulated by TGF-β1. AMFR knockout in mice aggravated cardiac fibrosis post-MI and worsened cardiac function, with scRNA-seq analysis demonstrating that AMFR-null cardiac fibroblasts exhibit a myofibroblast phenotype. Simultaneously, AMFR overexpression in cardiac fibroblasts reduces the expression of profibrogenic proteins in response to TGF-β1 stimulation. AMFR regulates ER-phagy flux and turnover of FAM134B, which leads to the suppression of cardiac fibroblasts activation. Mechanistically, AMFR catalyzed K27-linked (predominant) and K33-linked ubiquitination of FAM134B and enhanced ER-phagy flux, thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation of mTORC1 downstream targets such as S6K1 and 4E-BP. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of AMFR-driven ER-phagy in suppressing cardiac fibrosis post-MI.},

However, the impact of long-term cognitive training on this developmental effect remains largely unexplored. The present study investigated this by analyzing behavioral and neuroimaging data from schoolchildren who participated in five years of abacus training. The findings indicate that, compared to the control group, the training group exhibits cognitive dedifferentiation, characterized by stronger correlations between EF and mathematical abilities, accompanied by lower inter-individual variability. These observations are consistent with the discovery of greater overlap in behavior-associated brain connectivity patterns and more uniform connectivity profiles across individuals. Furthermore, the individual-to-group similarity in connectivity pattern is significantly associated with EF and mathematical performance, suggesting a shared cognitive strategy shaped by prolonged training. The findings provide empirical evidence in support of neurocognitive plasticity, highlighting the capacity of targeted cognitive training to functionally reshape brain networks and modulate the developmental trajectory of cognitive traits.},

The previous studies found that lubrication supplementation is closely related to damaged matrix regeneration, but the lubrication structure is prone to disintegration and failure. Here, combining with microfluidic and photopolymerization strategies, a supramolecular lubricating hydrogel microsphere is constructed, which is medicated by dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes as the core, a natural component in body fluids, and complexed with cartilage matrix-binding peptide functionalized methacryloylated hyaluronan acid (WYR-HAMA) as the photoinitiated site. The highly intermolecular ion-dipole interaction between DPPC and WYR-HAMA can form a dynamic supramolecular lubricating layer on the damaged matrix interfaces, where inflammatory factor inhibitors are coupled with DPPC liposomes via hydrophobic interaction to resist inflammatory transmission. Additionally, microspheres can autonomously regulate lubrication structure: in the early and middle stages, they can actively provide microscale lubrication (µ ≈ 0.04); in the late stage, the wear debris induced by endogenous enzymatic decomposition transmitted to provide nanoscale lubrication for the damaged matrix (µ ≈ 0.06). In vivo experiments demonstrate microspheres promoted efficient extracellular matrix synthesis and the autonomous release of lubrication factors at the cellular level. The developed bioplatform allowing cellular lubrication metabolism would provide a promising strategy for regenerating friction-induced matrix damage.},

In response to Salmonella Typhimurium infection, Nr2f6 -deficient mice exhibit improved clinical outcomes, characterized by reduced weight loss, bacterial loads in the spleen and liver, and decreased plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines. Despite unchanged basal iron metabolism in the spleen and liver, iron regulatory proteins and the interleukin (IL)-6-hepcidin axis are altered in Nr2f6- deficient mice during Salmonella infection, reducing hypoferremia. Transcriptomic analysis of splenic red pulp macrophages reveals significant alterations of phagocytosis-related genes, including upregulation of signal-regulatory protein alpha (Sirpa). In vitro, phagocytosis of red blood cells, regulated by the inhibitory CD47-Sirpα axis, and Salmonella Typhimurium phagocytosis are significantly impaired in Nr2f6 -deficient splenic macrophages.

  abstract     = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by β-amyloid plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles, but the ensuing cellular derangements that culminate in neurodegeneration remain elusive. Here, a mechanistic link between two AD pathophysiological hallmarks: energy insufficiency and oxidative stress is revealed. It is demonstrated that mitochondrial function and glutathione (GSH) flux are coupled, impacting neuronal ferroptosis susceptibility. Analysis of proteomic data from the inferior temporal cortex of 625 subjects along a continuum of clinical and pathological changes in AD, reveals a prominent depletion of mitochondrial proteins. Biogenetic insufficiency in AD is reflected by a concurrent loss of GSH, which requires 2 ATP for its synthesis, and genetic and pharmacologic ATP depletion models confirm that ATP is rate-limiting for GSH. Accordingly, an unbiased association analysis uncovers mitochondrial proteins in positive correlation with total GSH (t-GSH) in AD subjects. But mitochondria also consume GSH via the SLC25A39 transporter. It is found that mitochondrial inhibition either increases or decreases ferroptosis susceptibility in cellular models, depending on contextual factors that dictate whether mitochondria act as a net GSH producer or consumer, respectively. Mitochondria therefore control GSH flux, and loss of energy output is consequently demonstrated as a liability for ferroptosis in AD.},

Here, it is reported that BCG-derived outer membrane vesicles (B-OMVs) effectively trigger trained immunity to protect against experimental polymicrobial sepsis. Comprehensive characterization and safety assessments confirmed that B-OMVs exhibited no significant toxicity or pathological effects, positioning them as a promising alternative to conventional BCG vaccines and E. coli -derived outer membrane vesicles (E-OMVs) in terms of both efficacy and safety. Mechanistically, B-OMVs enhanced trained immunity by promoting hematopoietic stem cell expansion and myelopoiesis via toll like receptor 2 (TLR2)-dependent activation of aerobic glycolysis and epigenetic reprogramming. This led to an amplified immune response and enhanced phagocytic activity in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Together, these findings establish B-OMVs as a novel immunomodulatory agent against sepsis-induced immune dysfunction, with translational potential.},

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key mediators of inter-organ communication. Here, EVs and EV-microRNAs (miRNAs) are identified as mediate PDAC-skeletal muscle communication. EVs are isolated from PDAC patients, mouse models, patients-derived organoids, and mouse pancreatic cancer cells. Plasma-derived EVs from PDAC patients or mice are observed to remarkably induced muscle wasting in vitro and in vivo. Depletion of miRNA cargo in these EVs significantly alleviates their detrimental effects on skeletal muscles. Deep RNA sequencing is conducted to profile differentially expressed miRNAs in plasma EVs from patients with or without PDAC. The findings reveal that the expression of miR-223-5p expression in PDAC patients’ plasma EVs is negatively associated with the 3-year overall survival. Mechanistic studies show that miR-223-5p contributes to reduced METTL14 transcription by targeting MAFA, associated with decreased m 6 A methylation in skeletal muscles and muscle wasting. This study highlights the absorption of miRNA in PDAC-derived EVs by skeletal muscles and reveals a previously unrecognized function of PDAC-derived EV-miR-223-5p in tumor-muscle inter-organ communication, offering novel insight into EV-miR-223-5p-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for PDAC patients with sarcopenia upon further validation.},

  abstract     = {Uncontrolled sodium-ion (Na + ) transport, fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers, in and sluggish Na + desolvation using conventional separators drive dendrite growth, posing critical challenges to the development of sodium metal batteries (SMBs). Porous materials with tunable Na + transport pathways offer promise; however, simultaneously enhancing Na + kinetics, promoting NaF-rich SEI formation, and lowering desolvation energy barriers remains a critical challenge. Herein, a trifunctional halogenated covalent organic framework (COF) integrated into a polypropylene (PP) separator (COF-F@PP) is designed to address these issues. The COF-F@PP separator features positively charged sites to anchor PF 6 − anions and facilitate desolvation of NaPF 6 , and in-situ release of fluorine ions from halogenated COF promotes the formation of a robust NaF-rich SEI layer. Additionally, its high-porosity structure enables uniform Na + transport. Theoretical simulation demonstrates that the COF-F@PP separator improves desolvation dynamics, ensures uniform Na + flux distribution, and mitigates local electric field concentration, resulting in smooth and dendrite-free deposition. Consequently, a high Coulombic efficiency (99.2%), excellent ionic conductivity (1.13 mS cm −1 ), and stable cycling for over 1000 h at 3 mA cm −2 are achieved. In Na||NVP full cells, COF-F@PP separator delivers an initial discharge capacity of 83.51 mAh g −1 at 50 C and retains 88.42% of its capacity after 10 000 cycles.},

  abstract     = {Biomaterials can improve cancer immunotherapies by controlling their release and thereby optimizing their time-dependent engagement of the immune system. In this study, an approach is described to control the release of a potent immunostimulant—CpG oligodeoxynucleotide—from a genetically-encoded elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) depot. A CpG-binding ELP containing an oligolysine domain (ELP-Lys 12 ) is synthesized that electrostatically complexes CpG and formulate it with an excipient ELP. The ELP-CpG complex retains the thermally responsive phase behavior of the parent ELP, transitioning into a viscous depot at body temperature. Stepwise addition of excipient ELP predictably changes ELP-CpG transition temperature, depot dissolution kinetics, and retention of CpG within the depot. Mixtures of ELP-Lys 12 , excipient ELP, and CpG undergo microphase separation, forming a porous, sponge-like depot that contains tunable amounts of soluble CpG in the pores. In vivo, the modified formulations exhibit varying degrees of CpG retention over multiple weeks following a single intratumoral injection. Finally, by modifying the release kinetics of CpG, optimized ELP-CpG achieves greater reduction of metastatic disease in a murine metastatic breast cancer model than soluble CpG. These results demonstrate that ELPs can be used to precisely tune the release kinetics of immunotherapies for better outcomes in the treatment of metastatic cancer.},

  abstract     = {Virus infection stimulates proto-oncoprotein PIM1 kinase expression, but its importance and the biological functions of this process are poorly understood. Herein, PIM1 promotes IFNAR1 degradation to attenuate cellular innate immunity during human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection. During virus replication, the double-stranded viral RNA and some viral proteins upregulate PIM1 expression, which phosphorylates E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP1 at Serine 82. The pS82-β-TrCP1 then forms a complex with S535/S539-phosphorylated interferon receptor IFNAR1 (pS535/539-IFNAR1), leading to IFNAR1 ubiquitination and degradation. Both pan-inhibitors (CX-6528, SGI-1776, AZD-1208) and a specific inhibitor of PIM1 kinase (PIM1 inhibitor 2) effectively block this process and potently inhibit viral replication. This studies demonstrate a novel strategy that viruses use to disrupt cellular innate immunity, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for further anti-virus drug development.},

  abstract     = {Wireless radiofrequency (RF) coils based on metasurfaces hold great promise for improving clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) workflows by eliminating the need for cable connections to the patient bed and simplifying coil structures. A fundamental requirement for their clinical adoption is the ability to support parallel imaging, which reduces examination time and improves efficiency. Moreover, the implementation of parallel imaging often comes at the expense of image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Although several wireless RF coils incorporating metamaterials are reported, most do not support parallel imaging and many deliver suboptimal SNR performance. In this work, a novel wireless RF coil architecture is proposed, termed the near-field coupling array (NFCA), which demonstrates both excellent SNR performance and robust parallel imaging capabilities. A general theoretical framework is presented that establishes a foundation for applying metasurface arrays in magnetic resonance RF coil design. The SNR expression for this architecture is derived from two perspectives, and its fundamental principles are validated through case studies. Experimental results show that the NFCA achieves a 66% SNR improvement over a conventional commercial RF coil architecture (i.e., a wired coil) while its average acceleration factor exceeds 94% of that of the commercial coil.},

Applied to neurodegeneration-positive samples, it reveals that neurodegenerative disease presence and severity significantly increase predicted age. By screening 43840 transcriptional profiles of chemical and genetic perturbations, it identifies 453 unique rejuvenating interventions, several of which are known to extend lifespan in animal models.

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive malignancy with high mortality and limited treatment options. While surgical resection removes the primary tumor, it often fails to prevent recurrence or metastasis, and despite the promise of immunotherapy, response to immune checkpoint blockade remains poor. Here, a cryogel-based dendritic cell (DC) immunotherapy is developed incorporating gold nanodot-lipopolysaccharide (AuLPS)-loaded DCs, doxorubicin (Dox), and PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade (aPD-1+Dox+AuLPS@DC) to enhance post-surgical antitumor immunity. The AuLPS nanoparticles (NPs) stabilize LPS assembly, optimizing Th1 adjuvant activity and improving DC immunotherapy efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. The cryogel enables the sustained, localized release of therapeutic agents at the surgical site, preserving DC viability, migration, and functionality within the tumor microenvironment. This strategy enhances DC activation and potentiates robust T-cell activation in both tumor-draining lymph nodes and tumor beds, leading to durable antitumor immunity. When administered at the post-surgical site in an orthotopic TNBC model, the aPD-1+Dox+AuLPS@DC cryogel immunotherapy significantly delays tumor recurrence, reduces distant metastasis, and prolongs survival. These findings highlight cryogel-based DC immunotherapy as a promising post-surgical therapeutic strategy to enhance responses to immune checkpoint blockade and improve outcomes in TNBC.},

  abstract     = {Metabolic reprogramming driven by oncogenes plays a critical role in promoting and sustaining multiple steps of gastric cancer metastasis. However, the key metabolic driver of metastasis that can lead to the development of targeted therapies for preventing and treating metastatic gastric cancer remains elusive. Here, it is identified that the transmembrane guanylate cyclase, natriuretic peptide receptor 1 (NPR1), promoted gastric cancer lymph node metastasis by activating lipid droplet lipolysis and enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Clinical analysis reveals that elevated NPR1 protein level is correlated with increased lymph node metastasis and shorter patient survival. Functionally, NPR1 induced lipolysis of stored lipid droplets, releasing bioavailable fatty acids that are imported into mitochondria to upregulate OXPHOS, thus fueling the energy required for the metastasis of gastric cancer cells. Mechanistically, NPR1 activates protein kinase cGMP-dependent 1 (PRKG1 or PKG), which directly bound to and activated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) by phosphorylation at residues Ser 855 and Ser 951 , thereby increasing lipolysis. Furthermore, targeted delivery of NPR1 siRNA using engineered exosome mimetics effectively suppressed gastric cancer metastasis. Taken together, these findings elucidate the NPR1-driven metabolic mechanism underlying gastric cancer metastasis and suggest NPR1 as a promising therapeutic target for patients with metastatic gastric cancer.},

However, achieving precise morphological control of non-symmetric nanoarchitectonics composed of molecular drugs, without the use of templates and surfactants, remains a significant challenge. In this work, a strategy is presented to construct non-symmetric metal-quinone network (MQN) nanoarchitectonics with controlled morphology and size by manipulating solute and solvent diffusion behaviors during the nanoprecipitation process. The findings reveal that solute diffusion at the liquid-liquid interface of miscible solvent and antisolvent can be confined by self-generated MQNs, which in turn dictates the morphology of the resulting nanoarchitectonics. By regulating interphase solute diffusion kinetics, a variety of MQN nanoarchitectonics are successfully produced with spherical, semifootball-like, and bowl-like morphologies, ranging in sizes from tens to hundred of nanometers. Notably, the non-symmetric MQN nanobowls are further employed to create self-propelled nanodrugs, which indicates enhanced efficacy in tumor therapy. This study underscores the critical role of liquid-liquid interphase solute diffusion in determining the morphology and size of MQN nanoarchitectonics and highlights the potential of nanoprecipitation as a powerful technique for the precise fabrication of non-symmetric nanoarchitectonics.},

Here, a cohort of adult mice is subjected to long-term exposure to 40 Hz light flicker (1 hour daily for 30 days) and observed significant enhancements in hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial learning without any adverse behavioral effects. Specific ablation of hippocampal newborn neurons using DCX DTR mice abolished these effects. Furthermore, the inactivation or elimination of GABAergic parvalbumin (PV) interneurons not only impaired 40 Hz light flicker entrainment but also reduce neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). Long-term flicker exposure increases excitatory input to DG PV interneurons, which enhances PV interneuron excitability, elevated GABA levels, and strengthened inhibitory transmission to newborn neurons, thereby promoting better integration of new neurons into the DG. Blocking GABA A receptors reverse the light flicker-induced increase in neurogenesis and spatial learning. Prolonged flicker exposure do not affect DG regional cerebral blood flow or the activity of excitatory cholinergic, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), or cholecystokinin (CCK) interneurons. These findings suggest that long-term light flicker enhances spatial learning through PV-dependent neurogenesis, with elevated GABAergic activity supporting the development and integration of immature neurons in the adult DG.},

  abstract     = {The miniaturization of domain size via point-defect modification has emerged as an effective strategy for optimizing piezoelectric properties in lead-free ferroelectrics, such as achieving large piezoelectric constants and slim-hysteresis electrostrain through polymorphic nanodomain design. However, this approach is not consistently reliable due to the uncontrollable deceleration of domain wall motion and polarization rotation (i.e., polar dynamics) caused by the random local fields around doping sites. In this work, an innovative strategy is proposed to enhance the polarization and electrostrain responses of nanodomain-patterned ferroelectrics through the design of a strain-enhanced glassy coexistent polar state (SGP), which can be established by incorporating large-radius cation Hf 4+ into (Ba 0.84 Ca 0.16 ) 0.985 Bi 0.01 (Ti 0.9 Zr 0.07 Sn 0.03 )O 3 compositions. The strain-enhanced crossover state between the neighboring glassy tetragonal and orthorhombic domains greatly facilitates overall polar dynamics. This is evidenced by the large dielectric figure of merit ε r /tan δ ≈ 9.9×10 5 with thermal stability up to 23 K, surpassing most of reported lead-free ferroelectric ceramics. Importantly, compared to the initial matrix, significant improvements of 20.8% and 34.2% in maximum polarization and electrostrain amplitude are achieved, while maintaining a minimal polarization/strain hysteresis (≈5%). This work would pave a novel paradigm for designing superior functional ferroics by optimizing the domain dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Cancer immunotherapy that activates the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway to resist tumors has recently attracted considerable attention. However, STING activation can induce opposing interferon functions that contribute to T-cell exhaustion via programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). In particular, effectively using the immune system to combat tumors remains a substantial challenge due to tumor immunosuppressive factors such as SMARCAL1. Here, a glucose-responsive CRISPR nanovaccine is developed for enhancing STING signaling while inhibiting interferon-mediated immunosuppressive feedback. The formulation encapsulates a bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework with glucose oxidase (GOx) and CRISPR-mediated SMARCAL1 gene-editing plasmids. The dual enzyme-driven cascade reactions of peroxidase and GOx generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and gluconic acid, which release and activate the genome-editing system. The silencing of SMARCAL1 enhances STING activity and inhibits PD-L1 expression, resulting in the termination of PD-L1-mediated opposing functions of interferon. Zinc ions and double-stranded DNA formed via ROS further activate the STING pathway, effectively inducing dendritic cell maturation and immune system activation. This is a critical report of in situ CRISPR nanovaccination driven by dual enzymes. The work highlights the potential of glucose-responsive CRISPR nanovaccination in bolstering antitumor immunity and extends the implementation of gene editing in cancer immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) represents a pathological connection between the trachea and esophagus, classified into congenital and acquired categories. Congenital TEF arises from embryological malformations, often coexisting with esophageal atresia (EA), while acquired TEF primarily stems from malignancies, radiotherapy, or trauma. This condition disrupts normal anatomical functions, leading to significant clinical issues, such as aspiration, respiratory infections, and malnutrition. The current review consolidates findings on the etiology, classification, and pathological mechanisms of TEF, emphasizing how genetic, developmental, and external factors shape its occurrence and progression. Diagnostic advancements, including radiological imaging, endoscopic evaluations, and newer monitoring techniques, have refined clinical assessment. Treatment paradigms for TEF vary from minimally invasive endoscopic interventions, to traditional open and innovative surgical approaches. Conservative management, such as nutritional and anti-infective therapies, remains vital, especially for milder cases. Emerging therapies in regenerative medicine—such as tissue-engineered scaffolds and platelet-rich plasmaoffer transformative potential for refractory cases. Future advancements are oriented toward exploring 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and precision medicine. The necessity of multidisciplinary collaboration is underscored in optimizing holistic patient care. While significant progress has improved cure rates and long-term outcomes, continued research on innovative technologies and clinical trials addressing knowledge gaps in long-term efficacy remains crucial.},

Targeted autophagy strategies are promising for the treatment of autophagy dysregulation-related diseases, including Cd poisoning. However, the current understanding of autophagy mechanisms remains limited, hindering the development of effective strategies. Herein, a novel autophagy pathway, transcellular autophagy. Cd triggers this process in hepatocytes, facilitating the transfer of autophagosomes from damaged to healthy cells for degradation. Mechanistically, reactive oxygen species accumulation is a key driver of transcellular autophagy activation, while the disruption of autophagy fusion mechanisms triggers its activation. Notably, Cd-induced transcellular autophagy relies on the tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 2 (TNFAIP2)-tunneling nanotube (TNT) system. Blocking this system prevents autophagosome transfer and exacerbates Cd-induced autophagosome overload and apoptosis. The findings offer a novel perspective on autophagy, and provide new insights for targeted autophagy strategies to treat Cd poisoning and autophagy dysregulation-related diseases.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic encephalopathy (DE) is a severe complication of diabetes characterized by cognitive impairment and synaptic dysfunction, while the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Here, a critical role is identified for death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) in DE pathogenesis using transgenic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse models. Elevated DAPK1 expression in hippocampal excitatory neurons correlates with cognitive deficits, increases neuronal apoptosis, and disrupts synaptic plasticity. Conditional knockout of DAPK1 in CaMKII-positive neurons significantly mitigates these pathological features, improving cognitive performance and synaptic function. Mechanistically, it is demonstrated that reduced hippocampal microRNA (miR)-216a-5p levels in diabetic mice lead to DAPK1 upregulation. Furthermore, DAPK1 suppresses the expression of the neurotrophic factor Netrin-1 (Ntn1) by phosphorylating hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox A (HNF1A), a key transcription factor. Silencing Ntn1 in wild-type mice induces DE-like symptoms, while intranasal administration of recombinant Ntn1 restores cognitive function and synaptic integrity in diabetic mice. These findings establish an miR-216a-5p/DAPK1/Ntn1 signaling axis as a critical driver of diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction and suggest Ntn1 as a promising therapeutic target for DE. Here novel insights into the molecular mechanisms are provided underlying DE, and the therapeutic potential of targeting DAPK1 and Ntn1 is highlighted to alleviate diabetes-associated central nervous system complications.},

  abstract     = {Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening condition with excessive immune activation and dysregulated inflammation. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in immune regulation; however, their exact contribution to ALI pathogenesis remains unclear. This study demonstrates that the upregulation of the glycolytic regulator 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 2 (PFKFB2) by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) enhances glycolysis, drives DC maturation, and exacerbates inflammation, contributing to the pathogenesis of ALI. The findings reveal that HIF-1α directly binds to the PFKFB2 promoter and drives its transcription, leading to increased glycolysis, accelerated DC maturation, and amplified immune activation. In paraquat (PQ)-ALI and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-ALI mouse models, DC-specific PFKFB2 knockout and DC-targeted delivery of HIF-1α inhibitor-loaded nanoparticles each significantly suppressed DC maturation and alleviated ALI severity. Analyses of lung tissues from patients with PQ poisoning, secondary bacterial pneumonia (2°BP), and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as from normal controls, confirmed these findings, showing increased PFKFB2 expression and DC maturation during ALI. These findings highlight the HIF-1α–PFKFB2 signaling pathway as a critical regulator of glycolysis-driven DC maturation and immune activation, offering novel insights into immunometabolic regulation and a promising therapeutic target for ALI.},

  abstract     = {Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) senescence is a pivotal driver of atherosclerosis (AS), but molecular links to ageing-related dysfunction are unclear. It is aimed to identify regulators of VSMC senescence and develop clinical interventions for ageing-related AS. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of human atherosclerotic carotid arteries and immunofluorescence validation, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is identified as central to VSMC senescence. Mechanistic studies employ SMC-specific ATF3 knockout mice, CUT&Tag-seq, RNA/protein interaction assays, and m6A epitranscriptomic analyses. To bridge discovery to therapy, high-throughput virtual screening is performed for ATF3-targeting compounds and functionally validated hits. ATF3 deficiency in VSMCs accelerates ageing-induced AS by promoting senescence. Multi-omics showed ATF3 activates ATG7, triggering autophagy, while cytoplasmic ATG7 enhances ATF3 nuclear translocation, establishing a positive feedback loop. Ageing increases m6A methylation and decreases the stability of Atf3 mRNA. Terazosin (TZ) diminishes the interaction between YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein F2 (YTHDF2) and Atf3 mRNA, helping to preserve Atf3 mRNA stability. TZ is a promising therapeutic strategy for delaying VSMC senescence and preventing AS. ATF3 protects against VSMC senescence and AS by orchestrating autophagy via a novel ATF3-ATG7 amplification loop. Repurposing TZ to stabilize ATF3 offers a translatable approach to combat ageing-driven cardiovascular disease.},

This review explores preventive and therapeutic strategies by examining shared risk factors and intersectional mechanisms. First, as the easiest and most effective way, lifestyle modifications that benefit both CVD and cancer are summarized, including physical activity, diet modification, sleep pattern changes, and a reduction in tobacco and alcohol use. Key mechanistic intersections between CVD and cancer, such as metabolic regulation, immune-inflammation, and gut microbes, are discussed to extrapolate prospective homotherapy. Furthermore, the current status and challenges in various promising homotherapy for heteropathy between CVD and cancer are highlighted, especially emphasizing the use of conventional and newly developed CVD medications that may also confer benefits in cancer prevention or treatments.

  abstract     = {Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, with dysregulated lipid metabolism contributing to tumor progression and therapy resistance. This study identifies the DNA demethylase TET3 as a key regulator of lipogenic metabolism in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). TET3 expression is elevated in the lipogenic PDAC subtype and correlates with poor patient prognosis. Genetic ablation of TET3 disrupts lipid homeostasis, alters the saturated-to-monounsaturated fatty acid ratio, and reduces proliferative capacity. Mechanistically, TET3 represses GATA6 expression through recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) to its promoter, leading to H3K27 deacetylation, independent of its catalytic activity. Loss of TET3 derepresses GATA6 , which in turn suppresses lipogenic enzymes, such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase ( SCD ) and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 3 ( ACSL3 ), and sensitizes cells to ferroptosis. Notably, combined treatment with the HDAC inhibitor SAHA and the ferroptosis inducer Erastin significantly enhances gemcitabine-induced cytotoxicity in lipogenic PDAC cells. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized non-catalytic function of TET3 in sustaining lipid metabolic reprogramming in PDAC. Targeting the TET3/GATA6 axis in combination with ferroptosis and epigenetic modulators offers a promising strategy to overcome therapeutic resistance in aggressive pancreatic cancer.},

SLFN14, a member of SLFN family, is associated with multiple human diseases; however, neither its functions nor its disease mechanisms are fully understood. Herein, human SLFN14 biochemically is characterized, demonstrating that it specifically cleaves RNAs containing short duplex regions, such as hairpin RNAs and tRNAs, but does not have ATPase or helicase activity. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures of SLFN14 apoenzyme (2.84 Å) and SLFN14-hairpin RNA complex (2.88 Å) are determined, revealing that SLFN14 assembles into a ring-like dimer and dimerization is mainly mediated by hydrophobic contacts. Two N-terminal RNase domains of SLFN14 are organized head-to-tail, forming an RNA-binding groove that can accommodate a 12-bp hairpin RNA. The hairpin RNA is recognized mainly through phosphate backbone interactions. Further, SLFN14 is shown to inhibits HIV-1 pseudovirus replication. The anti-HIV-1 activity of SLFN14 is via codon-usage-dependent translational inhibition and impairment of the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting, with an efficiency comparable to that of Shiftless. Using tRNA PCR arrays, SLFN14 and SLFN11 are found to decrease both nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial tRNAs in cells. Together, these results provide novel insights into the function of SLFN14 and its role in HIV-1 restriction.},

Ppy-PCL/Fe 3 O 4 , when combined with a static magnetic field, activates the superparamagnetic properties of the nanoparticles while ensuring conductivity, creating an environment conducive to nerve regeneration. The optimal intensity of the external magnetic field stimulation is assessed in vitro, and its effects on calcium influx and differentiation in rat RSC96 and PC12 cells, respectively, are examined. The superior efficacy of the integrated system in nerve regeneration is confirmed by histological and functional analyses in vivo.

Unlike conventional room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) afterglow, the emergence of OLPL must include a charge separation process in its photophysical mechanism; consequently, the reported OLPL examples are much fewer than conventional afterglow materials. The incorporation of an electron donor or acceptor is conceived to interact with the long-lived excited state in conventional afterglow system, aiming to induce charge separation. Here, the study first builds two-component RTP/TADF afterglow systems composed of difluoroboron β-diketonate (BF 2 bdk) dopants and organic crystalline matrices, and then introduces an electron-donating component into the two-component BF 2 bdk-matrix systems to enable the charge separation processes. The resultant three-component materials exhibit visible-light-excitable OLPL afterglow lasting for several hours under ambient condition. Leveraging the efficient harvesting of singlet/triplet excitons by BF 2 bdk and the protective environment provided by the crystalline matrix, the three-component materials exhibit an estimated OLPL efficiency of ≈10% and display OLPL brightness comparable to inorganic Sr 2 Al 14 O 25 /Eu 2+ , Dy 3+ materials. Furthermore, the obtained OLPL materials show promising applications in afterglow displays and information storage, marking a significant step toward practical implementations of organic afterglow materials.},

A human nervous system-based biohybrid robot-on-a-chip with eye function as a sensing system in addition to brain/motor neuron/muscle functions is proposed for the first time. Eye assembloid is fabricated by a combination of thalamic organoid covered with Au nanomesh and four retinal organoids.

When blue light is used to cause retinal damage or a hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a retinal toxic chemical, is applied to the eye assembloid, they caused a decrease in muscle bundle contraction. These results indicated that electrophysiological signals generated by the eye assembloid are transmitted to the muscle bundle through cerebral organoid and motor neuron spheroids, and thus the proposed system can perform the toxicity screening.

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a frequently lethal disease, with stage II/III CRC accounting for ≈70%. Metabolic reprogramming plays a pivotal role in deciphering cancer heterogeneity and progression. Here, 9 datasets and 83 machine learning algorithm combinations are leveraged‌ to develop the Machine Learning-based Metabolic gene Prognostic Signature (MALMPS) model. The MALMPS model outperformed traditional clinical traits and molecular features in predicting prognosis for stage II/III CRC patients across training and validation datasets. COX7B, a key gene in MALMPS, is shown to promote CRC malignancy through multi-omics analysis and in vitro assays. CRC patients are stratified into high- and low-risk groups based on the median cutoff of MALMPS. Notably, the high-risk subgroup exhibited poor prognosis, activated inflammation, and enriched carbohydrate, glycosaminoglycan, and lipid metabolism, with therapeutic potential for IGF-1R and Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor. In contrast, the low-risk group displayed a TGF-β pathway inactivating mutation and enriched in nucleotides, cofactors, and amino acids metabolism. Metabolite profiling in the in-house SDCRC dataset validated the distinct metabolic alterations between the two groups. These findings indicate that MALMPS is a valuable instrument for predicting the recurrence risk of stage II/III colorectal cancer, particularly for identifying individuals at high risk.},

  abstract     = {T cell effector functions are critical for immune defense, but their dysregulation can cause diseases like immune exhaustion in cancer and loss of tolerance in autoimmunity. Curtailing these functions is essential in therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies or organ transplantation to avoid hyperactivation and rejection. A major challenge in the field is the precise, live measurement of T cell function at the single-cell level, limiting the prediction of immune responses, the development of effective immunotherapies, and optimization of immunosuppressive regimens. Gamma-Glutamyl Cysteine Ligase (GCL), the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione (GSH) synthesis, is essential for T cell function in mice, but its role in human T cells is underexplored. GLed , a novel reversible lanthanide-based GSH sensor is introduced that enables real-time, quantitative measurements of GCL activity at single-cell resolution. The GLed approach distinguishes GSH contributions from GCL and GSR, linking GCL activity directly to human T cell effector functions. Additionally, this reveals previously unknown modulation of GCL activity by immunosuppressive drugs, underscoring GCL as a critical player in T cell function and a potential therapeutic target in immune-related diseases.},

  abstract     = {Fatal jellyfish stings often cause multi-organ failure. Until now, these fatal outcomes are attributed to the direct toxic effects of the venom. Here, a mouse model of delayed jellyfish envenomation syndrome (DJES) is established and showed that venom from Nemopilema nomurai jellyfish can trigger a deadly cytokine storm – a severe inflammatory reaction. Mice injected with the venom displayed acute multi-organ failure and significant upregulation of over 20 pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-6, TNF-α, CXCL2, and CCL4) in the heart, liver, and kidneys. Transcriptomic analyses identified NF-κB p65 subunit activation as central to the cytokine storm induction. Knockdown of p65 in macrophages reduced cytokine production and improved cell viability. Treatment with dexamethasone, an NF-κB inhibitor, effectively suppressed the cytokine storm, mitigated organ damage, and increased survival rates in mice. The findings present new insights to treat fatal jellyfish stings.},

  abstract     = {Topology structure of proteins plays vital roles on their bioactivity and property. However, the understanding of how the biological effect of active targeting groups varies with different spatial positions in the recombinant protein scaffold is poor. Here a three trispecific recombinant heterotrimeric proteins and their drug conjugates are reported with a star and linear topology structure prepared by genetically encoded fusion and SpyTag-SpyCatcher technology, which can simultaneously bind the human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 and 2 as well as integrin α v β 3 on the surface of cancer cells. The biological difference of heterotrimeric proteins with different topologic structures is evaluated. Given the unique topological structure and superior biologic effects, star-shaped trispecific recombinant proteins can specifically deliver the covalently linked payload, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, into HeLa tumor, leading to complete tumor eradication, while linear structural ones can only control tumor growth to some extent. The remarkable antitumor activity of the designed recombinant protein-drug conjugate with star-shaped structure in both small and large tumor models can be attributed not only to the triple targeting against EGFR, HER2, and integrin α v β 3 , but also to the “site effect” of targeting elements in heterotrimeric fusion proteins brought by the unique topological structure. The results suggest that trispecific heterotrimeric recombinant proteins with a star-shaped topological structure is a promising drug conjugate platform.},

  abstract     = {Aortic aneurysm and dissection (AAD) are life-threatening cardiovascular diseases with limited effective medical treatments. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), the most abundant serine/threonine phosphatase in eukaryotes, is pivotal in regulating intracellular signaling. This study investigates the role of PP2A in the pathogenesis of AAD. Analysis of available datasets revealed that PP2Acα is the most significantly downregulated PP2A subunit in human and mouse aneurysm tissues. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)-specific PP2Acα knockout exacerbates β-Aminopropionitrile (BAPN)-induced aortic dissection and elastase-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm in mice. Collagen-based contraction assays, Western blot, and gelatin zymography confirmed that the deficiency of PP2Acα results in decreased contractility, contractile markers, and elevated production of matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) in VSMCs. Furthermore, PP2Acα deficiency promoted VSMC phenotypic switching through stabilizing Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). Mechanistically, PP2Acα binds to and dephosphorylates protein kinase B 1 (AKT1), thereby reducing phosphorylation of the AKT1 substrate KLF4 at Thr398. The deficiency of PP2Acα diminishes KLF4 phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and degradation, leading to the suppression of VSMC contractile gene transcription. The findings underscore a critical role for PP2Acα in regulating VSMC phenotypic switching and AAD progression by controlling KLF4 phosphorylation and ubiquitination, offering novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis underlying AAD.},

  abstract     = {This paper extends our previously published work on the virtual AI teacher (VATE) system, presented at IAAI-25. VATE is designed to autonomously analyze and correct student errors in mathematical problem-solving using advanced large language models (LLMs). By incorporating student draft images as a primary input for reasoning, the system provides fine-grained error cause analysis and supports real-time, multi-round AI—student dialogues. In this extended version, we introduce a new snap-to-solve module for handling low-reasoning tasks using edge-deployed LLMs, enabling faster and partially offline interaction. We also include expanded benchmarking experiments, including human expert evaluations and ablation studies, to assess model performance and learning outcomes. Deployed on the Squirrel AI platform, VATE demonstrates high accuracy (78.3%) in error analysis and improves student learning efficiency, with strong user satisfaction. These results suggest that VATE is a scalable, cost-effective solution with the potential to transform educational practices.},

  abstract     = {According to an industry survey, many people miss opportunities to apply for government subsidy programs because they do not know how to apply. People also need to search manually and check whether these programs are suitable for them. To address this issue, our study developed a new generative recommender system with both users' information and government subsidy documents. Within our recommender system framework, we modify the existing Residual Quantization Variational Auto-Encoder (RQ-VAE) model to capture deep and abstract information from subsidy documents. Using semantic IDs generated for approximately 185,610 user click-stream histories and 240,000 documents, we train our recommender system to predict the semantic IDs of the next subsidy policy documents in which a user might be interested. In 2024, we successfully deployed our generative recommender system in Wello, a Korean Gov-Tech startup. In collaboration with the Korean government, our generative recommender system helped enhance program effectiveness by saving $7.8 million in unused funds and achieved $27.4 million in advertising efficiency gains. Also, Wello observed a 68% improvement in Click-Through-Ratio (CTR), increasing from 41.4% in the third quarter of 2024 to 69.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024. We thus anticipate that our generative recommender system will have a significant impact on both individuals and the government.},

This paper presents a comprehensive framework for monitoring, benchmarking, and continuously improving such complex, multi-component systems under active development by multiple teams. Our approach encompasses three key elements: (1) a hierarchical “severity” framework for incident detection that identifies and categorizes errors while attributing component-specific error rates, facilitating targeted improvements; (2) a scalable and principled methodology for benchmark construction, evaluation, and deployment, designed to accommodate multiple development teams, mitigate overfitting risks, and assess the downstream impact of system modifications; and (3) a continual improvement strategy leveraging multidimensional evaluation, enabling the identification and implementation of diverse enhancement opportunities. By adopting this holistic framework, organizations can systematically enhance the reliability and performance of their AI Assistants, ensuring their efficacy in critical enterprise environments. We conclude by discussing how this multifaceted approach opens avenues for various classes of enhancements, including human-AI collaborative evaluation, paving the way for more robust and trustworthy AI systems.},

My research seeks to directly address this challenge by enabling AI systems to interact with humans to learn aligned and robust behaviors. The way robots and other AI systems behave is often the result of optimizing a reward function. However, manually designing good reward functions is highly challenging and error-prone, even for domain experts. Although reward functions are often difficult to manually specify, human feedback in the form of demonstrations or preferences is often much easier to obtain but can be difficult to interpret due to ambiguity and noise. Thus, it is critical that AI systems take into account epistemic uncertainty over the human's true intent. As part of the AAAI New Faculty Highlight Program, I will give an overview of my research progress along the following fundamental research areas: (1) efficiently quantifying uncertainty over human intent, (2) directly optimizing behavior to be robust to uncertainty over human intent, and (3) actively querying for additional human input to reduce uncertainty over human intent.},

The selection of any one of multiple underway watercraft for patient exchange is complicated by participating aircraft utilization histories and participating watercraft positions and velocities. The selection problem is modeled as a semi-Markov decision process with an action space, including both fixed land and moving watercraft exchange points. Monte Carlo tree search with root parallelization is used to select optimal exchange points and determine aircraft dispatch times. Model parameters are varied in simulation to identify representative scenarios where watercraft exchange points reduce incident response times. We find that an optimal policy with watercraft exchange points outperforms an optimal policy without watercraft exchange points and a greedy policy by 35% and 40%, respectively. In partnership with the United States Army, we deploy for the first time the watercraft exchange point by executing a mock patient transfer with a manikin between two HH-60M medical evacuation helicopters and an underway Army Logistic Support Vessel south of the Hawaiian island of Oahu. Both helicopters were dispatched in accordance with our optimized decision strategy.},

Far from a gradual evolution, its sudden emergence has jolted educational institutions, leaving many academics grappling with a perceived encroachment upon their intellectual domain. This upheaval has sparked intense debates, with concerns ranging from the erosion of academic integrity to the devaluation of scholarly labor. This essay contends that such apprehensions, while understandable, may overlook the transformative potential of AI as a collaborative tool. Drawing parallels to historical disruptions—such as the advent of photography challenging traditional art forms—we explore how AI can augment human creativity rather than supplant it. By examining the dynamics of authorship, originality, and accountability, we argue for a redefinition of these concepts in the context of AI-assisted work. Emphasizing the importance of human oversight in guiding AI outputs, we advocate for a framework that recognizes the symbiotic relationship between human intellect and machine efficiency. Such a perspective not only preserves the essence of academic rigor but also embraces the democratization of knowledge production. Ultimately, this essay calls for a balanced approach that mitigates risks while harnessing the innovative capacities of generative AI in academia.},

Building upon this, this article transcends the traditional binary judgment model and constructs a tiered copyright determination model. Based on the level of human control and contribution in the AI generation process, it introduces dimensions such as technological controllability and density of human intent, classifying generative AI into three tiers: strong protection, weak protection, and non-protection. Regarding the copyrightability of content generated by generative AI, this article argues that the issue should be addressed within the framework of copyright law itself.

  abstract     = {Wave-based mechanisms inspired by traveling wave locomotion in animals have shown great potential use in robots to navigate unstructured environments. Herein, the dual actuator wave-like navigator (DAWN), a multisurface robot employing two actuated helical wave generators to produce continuous traveling waves on flexible link tracks enclosed in elastomer skins, is presented. These skins provide mechanical resilience, enhanced friction, and adaptability on uneven terrain. The robot demonstrates steering and controlled locomotion on flat surfaces, inclines, and declines. To characterize the robot, locomotion tests are performed on plywood, PMMA, and sand, achieving average linear speeds of 16.00, 15.76, and 1.63 mm s −1 , respectively. A key innovation is cyclic pneumatic actuation of the skins with actuation frequencies of 0.5 and 0.9 Hz, improving locomotion performance on sand to 2.22 and 2.70 mm s −1 . DAWN's capability to move on sand, grass, gravel, and wet soil is also demonstrated. Its modular design enables plug-and-play assembly of components including helical wave generators, flexible link tracks, and elastomer skins, allowing for easy maintenance, modification, and replacements. Potential applications include navigation in complex terrains for search and rescue, inspection, and environmental monitoring.},

  abstract     = {The high reliance on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) knowledge and practical skills has led to prolonged training cycles for therapists and a significant talent shortage, posing a severe challenge to the standardization of TCM physiotherapy in rehabilitation. Meanwhile, most physiotherapy robots based on rigid robotics technology suffer from insufficient safety and adaptability, resulting in unsatisfactory treatment effects. This paper presents a novel wearable pneumatic soft physiotherapy device, designed to achieve high-safety and personalized physiotherapy for shoulder and neck acupoint massage. The device integrates four soft massage actuators, four embedded thin-film stress sensors, two miniature airflow sources, and a power supply system, enhancing its portability. Additionally, a hybrid control strategy combining feedforward inverse compensation and PID feedback is proposed to regulate and customize the therapy intensity on human acupoints. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed device can apply therapeutic intensities ranging from 0 to 3.45 N to human acupoints, effectively adapting to the human shoulder and neck region to achieve good wearing comfort, and performing safe acupoint massage with customized physiotherapy intensities. This study explores and realizes the integration of emerging soft robotics technology with TCM, providing a paradigm for the development of more soft physiotherapy devices.},

  abstract     = {Tensegrity robotic joints, inspired by the musculoskeletal systems of vertebrate animals, have gained interest due to their unique interplay of tension and compression forces, offering a high strength-to-weight ratio and inherent adaptability. However, their use in legged and grasping applications remains challenging. A key challenge is striking the right balance between high compliance, which can undermine stability and control, and high stiffness, which can restrict essential movement and demand more powerful actuators. This study presents a tensegrity-inspired spine-like joint that integrates thin McKibben pneumatic artificial muscles and rubber cords directly into its tensile network. The artificial muscles enable active joint bending while also serving as tensile elements. The rubber cords counteract these forces, storing elastic energy to facilitate smooth recovery to the original position. The joint's topology design is primarily influenced by the artificial muscles’ limited 20% contraction. To optimize the balance between range of motion, payload capacity, and structural stability, the joint's geometry is refined through an evolutionary algorithmic form-finding process. Two generated joints are integrated into two functional robotic applications: a crawling robot and a gripper, showcasing their adaptability for diverse robotic applications.},

In this article, a comprehensive framework is introduced for the design and control of modular soft robotic devices. These modules can be combined in various configurations to develop a wide range of haptic devices capable of dynamically modifying their stiffness and shape to accommodate different applications, including providing haptic feedback in virtual environments and assisting individuals with hand rehabilitation needs. The design methodology of these modules is reported and two potential use cases are presented. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that how it is possible to intuitively control the modular soft robotic devices, monitor their state, and use limited sensing capability with machine learning models to enable interpretations of interactions with users and the surrounding environment.},

  abstract     = {Soft robots have garnered significant attention due to their promising applications across various domains. A hallmark of these systems is their bilayer structure, where strain mismatch caused by differential expansion between layers induces complex deformations. Despite progress in theoretical modeling and numerical simulation, accurately capturing their dynamic behavior, especially during environmental interactions, remains challenging. This study presents a novel simulation environment based on the discrete elastic rod (DER) model to address the challenge. By leveraging discrete differential geometry, the DER approach offers superior convergence compared to conventional methods like finite element method, particularly in handling contact interactions—an essential aspect of soft robot dynamics in real-world scenarios. The simulation framework incorporates key features of bilayer structures, including stretching, bending, twisting, and interlayer coupling. This enables the exploration of a wide range of dynamic behaviors for bilayer soft robots, such as gripping, crawling, jumping, and swimming. The insights gained from this work provide a robust foundation for the design and control of advanced bilayer soft robotic systems.},

  abstract     = {Biological organisms excel in dynamically reshaping their bodies to navigate and manipulate ever-changing environments, and some can even tune their mechanical properties for enhanced adaptability. Many existing shape-morphing robots rely on the inherent softness of materials or structures, which sacrifices load-bearing capacity. Despite efforts to achieve both morphing and stiffness tuning in one system, these strategies often rely on separate mechanisms, such as heating liquid metal components to reduce rigidity before employing other mechanisms to change the shape, leading to bulky and complex systems that limit practicality and scalability. Here, a tunable-stiffness architected morphing structure (TSAMS) is introduced, which unifies shape morphing and tunable stiffness in a single, compact platform. By combining 3D-printed tessellated particles with shape memory alloy springs, TSAMS transitions smoothly from soft to rigid states, exhibiting a ≈308 times increase in bending stiffness while concurrently executing intricate shape transformations through electrothermal actuation. This design is demonstrated with the following robotic applications, including rolling robots that can explore diverse terrains by climbing slopes, avoiding obstacles, and carrying loads; compact manipulators that lift objects nearly 50 times heavier than themselves; and snake-inspired robots performing undulation and sidewinding gaits. These results highlight TSAMS's potential to advance next-generation soft robots and bioinspired systems that demand both dynamic shape reconfiguration and robust structural performance in diverse operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in locomoting robotics have demonstrated how shape morphing can enhance efficiency, mobility, and speed during transitions between domains, such as from land to water. However, prior approaches often optimize a robot's propulsor shape, stiffness, and gait to minimize the cost of transport in distinct domains while neglecting the energy required to achieve these shape and stiffness changes at domain interfaces. Additionally, many shape-morphing robots rely on thermally driven materials that couple shape and stiffness changes to environmental temperatures, limiting their applicability in real-world multidomain scenarios. This work introduces the Jamming Amphibious Robotic Turtle (JART), which employs pressure-responsive, topologically altered kirigami laminar jamming to transform its limbs between hydrodynamic flippers and load-bearing legs. Energetic analyses reveal that JART achieves a 98.5% reduction in the energetic cost of morphing compared to thermally driven predecessors. Its pressure-responsive morphing mechanism also enables temperature-independent energy expenditures when morphing, rapid stiffness switching, decoupled control of stiffness and shape, and robust postloading shape recovery. System-level evaluations highlight JART's ability to efficiently transition between domains, demonstrated through a continuous terrestrial–aquatic–terrestrial transition at an ocean inlet. This study provides valuable insights into the design of deployable, multidomain robots, advancing their potential for real-world applications.},

This study presents the design, fabrication, and wing-morphing behavior of 3D-printed magnetic butterflies, focusing on optimal material and design parameters to replicate monarch wing-morphing behavior. Using composite of thermoplastic polyurethane and micron-sized Nd 2 Fe 14 B magnetic powder, 12 unique butterfly designs—varying in size, vein patterns, and stiffness—are fabricated via powder bed fusion (PBF) 3D printing, resulting in 84 specimens. Lightweight and batch-producible with minimal postprocessing, the specimens have weights per unit area of ≈270, 480, and 1045 g m −2 for small, medium, and large sizes, respectively. A permanent magnet induces deformation in the specimens—mimicking monarch butterflies, without embedded electronics. A systematic analysis combining finite element simulations and experiments reveals the effects of size, geometric features, and laser energy scale on wing morphing. Lower laser energy scales result in porous, fast-bending specimens, while higher scales specimen show greater mechanical strength and varied deformation, with vein structures further improving deformation. The results provide a detailed dataset for optimizing wing-morphing designs while highlighting the potential of the PBF process in creating lightweight magnetic bioinspired structures capable of optimal shape morphing.},

  abstract     = {Shape-morphing devices, a crucial branch in soft robotics, hold significant application value in areas like human–machine interfaces, biomimetic robotics, and tools for biological systems. To achieve 3D programmable shape morphing (PSM), the deployment of array-based actuators is essential. However, a critical knowledge gap in 3D PSM is controlling the complex systems formed by these soft actuator arrays to mimic the morphology of the target shapes. This study, for the first time, represents the configuration of shape-morphing devices using point cloud data and employing deep learning to map these configurations to control inputs. Shape Morphing Net (SMNet), a method that realizes the regression from point cloud to high-dimensional control input vectors, is proposed. It has been applied to 3D PSM devices with three different actuator mechanisms, demonstrating its universal applicability to inversely reproduce the target shapes. Further, applied to previous 2D PSM devices, SMNet significantly enhances control precision from 82.23% to 97.68%. In the demonstrations of morphology mimicking, 3D PSM devices successfully replicate arbitrary target shapes obtained either through 3D scanning of physical objects or via 3D modeling software. The results show that within the deformable range of 3D PSM devices, accurate reproduction of the desired shapes is achievable.},

As such they have the potential to revolutionize renewable energy production on Earth. While proven efficiencies have reached 1.1%, further improvements of photocatalyst technology depend on a better understanding of energy loss mechanisms on the individual particle level. Here, we conduct the first in operando photoelectrochemical measurements on individual micrometer-sized Al-doped SrTiO 3 /Rh 2–y Cr y O 3 photocatalyst particles. We find that the photocatalyst particles behave mainly as water oxidation photoanodes reaching up to 0.5 mA cm −2 at 0.8 V versus RHE and a photovoltage of ∼1.00 V under 4.7 mW cm −2 ultraviolet illumination. This proves that charge separation in the unbiased Al:SrTiO 3 /Rh 2–y Cr y O 3 catalyst is driven by a junction at the n-semiconductor-liquid contact. While O 2 is detected symmetrically around photocatalyst particles, uneven H 2 evolution profiles reflect an irregular Rh 2–y Cr y O 3 cocatalyst distribution. Additionally, the H 2 evolution activity varies significantly between different photocatalyst particles. This suggests that performance gains are possible by better controlling catalyst composition on the microscale.},

  abstract     = {Pillar[ n ]arenes are popular macrocycles used in various supramolecular systems and materials due to their unique host–guest properties and ease of synthesis. Their pillar shape originates from the cyclic arrangement of methylene-bridged hydroquinone groups. They usually exist in one of two conformations where all the hydroquinone rings are oriented in the same direction (left or right), which is the source of their planar chirality. However, the controlled formation of pillar[ n ]arenes with intermediate conformations, for example, where only one ring is inverted, remains a challenge. Here we show how mechanical force can be used to reach this elusive conformation via the force-induced flipping of a single hydroquinone ring in a pillar[5]arene-based rotaxane. We show that the flipping motion can be controlled with the shape of the stopper and the axle, as well as with the nature of the pillar[5]arene substituents. This flipping behavior acts as a mechanical damper by slowing the scission of the polymer under tension. These results show how mechanical force can be used to access synthetically challenging supramolecular architectures, and we anticipate that this new dampening mechanism will prove useful in the formation of tougher materials.},

Photocatalytic C─OH direct HDO is a promising but challenging process because of the difficulty in C─O bond activation due to the higher bond energy and strong polarity. A polarity enhancement strategy is proposed and a WO 3- x catalyst possessing Lewis–Brønsted dual acid sites is developed to realize the direct HDO of alcohols under ambient conditions. The C─O bond is first heterolytic cleaved to produce the carbocation intermediate and then the carbocation will combine with a proton and photogenerated electrons to form a new C─H bond. The synergistic effect of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites plays a key role in promoting the C─O bond cleavage. A series of comparative experiments, spectral characterizations and DFT calculations were used to demonstrate this new photocatalytic HDO pathway. Different alcohols, including polyols, can be directly converted into corresponding alkanes over this system. The present work discloses a direct HDO process for the hydroxy groups in alcohols and provides a new horizon for the design of new photocatalytic systems.},

  abstract     = {The development of white circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs) faces a critical challenge in simultaneously achieving high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and large dissymmetry factors ( g ), due to the inherent trade-off between exciton utilization and chirality amplification. Herein, we propose an orthogonal architecture synergizing an achiral blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter with chiral orange assemblies to overcome this limitation. The chiral assemblies, featuring exceptional chiroptical activity (| g abs | = 0.95 and | g lum | = 0.85), are engineered as both photon-selective filters and emitters. When integrated with a blue TADF layer, this dual-layer design enables 100% internal quantum efficiency through TADF-enabled triplet harvesting and chiral amplification via selective absorption of blue photons with a specific polarization direction, generating amplified white circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). The resulting white CP-OLED (CIE: 0.31, 0.34) achieves a record | g EL | of 0.34 alongside an EQE max of 6.3%, demonstrating the unprecedented white CP-OLEDs when considering both EQE and g EL values. By optimizing the TADF doping ratio, a cool-white CP-OLED is realized with an EQE of 14.7% and | g EL | of 0.32. This work establishes a material orthogonal engineering to decouple exciton-chirality interdependencies, opening avenues for fabricating high-performance CPEL devices.},

Herein, we report a yellowish-green-emitting (Me 3 BzN) 3 Sb 2 Cl 9 (Me 3 BzN: trimethylbenzyl ammonium) single crystal, revealing quadruple/triple-mode luminescence switch with rapid response time (<1 s) and excellent recyclability (≥ 100 cycles) when triggered by moderately-polar and strongly-polar solvents. Significantly, the intrinsic solvochromism mechanism is systematically proposed, of which the reversibly multiple-mode luminescence tuning is closely related to solvent polarity, the moderate polarity can lead to luminescence redshift from 560 to 670 nm due to the increase of dipole moment for inorganic polyhedron. Besides, the small molecular solvent with strong polarity can insert into crystal and form “host-guest” system, inducing single crystal-single crystal phase transformation with structural disorder and Sb-Sb distance variation. Owing to the unique multiple-mode luminescence adjustment performance, (Me 3 BzN) 3 Sb 2 Cl 9 displays potential candidate in solvent detection, safety monitoring and information encryption scenarios. These findings highlight the significance of solvent polarity and molecule volume on the dynamic luminescence adjustment and offer guidance for the development of new smart responsive 0D hybrid antimony halides in advanced optical switchable fields.},

However, synthesizing topologically complex architectures, particularly those with topological chirality, remains a significant challenge due to the lack of general methods for controlled entanglement. Herein, we report the stereoselective synthesis of a 24-metal-center topologically chiral [6]catenane featuring 18 crossings ( link), representing one of the most intricate MIMs constructed to date. This complex architecture was achieved in high yield (71%) via one-step coordination-driven self-assembly of 12 chiral semirigid bidentate ligands and 12 conjugated binuclear half-sandwich organometallic clips. Critically, chirality transfer from enantiopure ligands enabled exclusive formation of topological enantiomer pairs ( Rh-1 S / Rh-1 R ), each containing four topologically chiral stereogenic units—three cyclic [3]catenane components and one closed three-link chain component. The self-assembly is synergistically directed by integrated noncovalent interactions (sevenfold π–π stacking, hydrogen bonding, and solvophobic effects), as unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This design strategy, incorporating tailored noncovalent interaction sites in building blocks, provides a viable approach for synthesizing other structurally complex topologically chiral MIMs.},

  abstract     = {The rational design and synthesis of reliable binders is a big challenge to efficiently mitigate the severe volume change of silicon-based anodes for lithium ion batteries. Herein, we report a multidentate molecular anchoring strategy to construct a novel self-adaptive aqueous binder. This binder composes of robust 3D dynamic networks derived from the crosslinking of the freely-rotatable multidentate molecular anchor (2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)butyric acid, BHB) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) via dynamic hydrogen-mediated self-assembly, which effectively imparts the fabrication of high-strength Si/C anodes and achieves high areal capacities (6.13 mAh cm −2 ) under a high mass loading of 13 mg cm −2 . Furthermore, the dynamic and reversible adhesion and the efficient “net-to-point” bonding characteristic contribute to enhance structural and interfacial stability in the NCM811/Si/C full cells. Consequently, the cells demonstrate superior cyclability and electrochemical performance. Notably, this multidentate molecular anchoring strategy can be further extended to develop other BHB-derived self-adaptive binders (i.e., BHB/PVA and BHB/CMC) for the purpose of dynamic structure regulation. This work provides valuable insights into the judicious modulation of aqueous binders from the perspective of molecular chemistry and product engineering, paving the pathway for the design of auqeous binders for ultra-high-energy Si-based lithium-ion batteries.},

The R 3 Sn- moiety is faithfully delivered to the terminal C-atom, unless a propargylic or homo-propargylic ─OH or ─NH 2 group is present in the substrate, which (partly or fully) inverts the regiochemical course; this steering effect, however, can be switched off upon protection of the protic site. The trans -addition likely starts by insertion of the [Cp*FeCl] fragment into the R 3 Sn─H bond, followed by a migratory insertion of the ligated alkyne into the Fe─Sn unit of the Fe(IV) species thus formed. This “modified Chalk–Harrod” mechanism is manifested in a stannylative cyclization of 1,6-enyne derivatives, which has hardly any precedent either; a pathway via iron vinylidene intermediates can be excluded on the basis of deuterium labeling experiments.},

  abstract     = {Modulating surface-active hydrogen (*H) supply represents a critical strategy to boost the electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (ECRR), yet the mechanistic interplay between *H dynamics and catalytic behavior remains ambiguous. Herein, we construct tandem catalysts (M 4 /Ni 1 NC, M = Fe, Co, Cu, or Mn) by coupling tetranuclear metal clusters (M 4 ) with single-atom Ni sites on N-doped carbon (Ni 1 NC) to regulate *H supply. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the *H supply is governed by both thermodynamics and kinetic factors. The M 4 clusters provide the thermodynamic feasibility for *H supply for CO 2 activation. The *H supply rate in kinetic perspective is tuned by the K + -H 2 O ratio of interfacial water, determined by work function of the decorated M 4 clusters. The increased K + -H 2 O ratio can promote water dissociation to maintain optimal *H coverage for intermediate hydrogenation, whereas excessive *H accumulation triggers competitive hydrogen evolution. Therefore, a volcanic relationship was observed between the K + -H 2 O ratio and ECRR performance. Among these samples, Cu 4 /Ni 1 NC with moderate *H supply rate in kinetic exhibits exceptional ECRR performance, achieving >95% Faradaic efficiency for CO across a 0.8 V potential range (−0.2 to −1.0 V versus RHE) and industrial-relevant current densities (∼385 mA cm −2 at −1.0 V) in a flow cell.},

  abstract     = {Due to their exceptional nodal flexibility, anionocages are promising host molecules capable of mimicking the dynamic self-assembly and host–guest chemistry of proteins. However, their application has been limited by the challenges in constructing large internal cavities. Here, we present an effective strategy to overcome this limitation by enhancing node flexibility to improve both structural adaptability and guest encapsulation versatility. Specifically, anion coordination between a C 3 -symmetric tris-urea ligand ( L ) and an organophosphate, PhPO 4 2− ( A ), generates highly flexible nodes that enable adaptive self-assembly and the encapsulation of guests of unprecedented size. Crystal structures revealed that the same ligand and anion can form three geometrically distinct anionocages ( A 4 L 4 tetrahedron 1 , A 6 L 6 trigonal antiprism 2 , and A 6 L 8 octahedron 3 ), with cavity sizes ranging from 0.208 to 1.320 nm 3 . In solution, controlled interconversions among the three anionocages can be achieved by modulating the guest template, A / L ratio, and concentration. These nanoscale cavities successfully encapsulate the luminescent metal complex, [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2 ⁺ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine), resulting in a ∼5-fold increase in quantum yield, and a ∼2-fold increase in lifetime. Moreover, circularly polarized luminescence of racemic [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2 ⁺ is induced via chirality transfer using a chiral-anion-directed octahedral cage ( 4 ) as the host.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid copper(I) halides have emerged as a new class of optoelectronic materials due to their tunable structure and photophysical properties. However, systematically correlating inorganic polyhedra configurations with emission characteristics remains challenging. Herein, we address this by synthesizing a homologous series of copper(I) iodides templated solely by the [C 13 H 24 N] + cation. Precise control reaction conditions yielded distinct inorganic polyhedral configurations, monomeric [CuI 3 ] 2− ( 1 ), dimeric [Cu 2 I 4 ] 2− ( 2 ), trimeric [Cu 3 I 6 ] 3− ( 3 ), and tetrameric [Cu 4 I 6 ] 2− ( 4 ). We establish a direct correlation where increasing inorganic aggregation systematically reduces the bandgap and dictates the luminescence color across a near-full visible spectrum, from blue ( 1 ) to cyan ( 2 ), red ( 3 ), and yellow ( 4 ). Detailed spectroscopic and theoretical analyses reveal the self-trapped excitons emission mechanism dependent on the Cu-I configuration, in which the closed [Cu 4 I 6 ] 2− configuration is more resistant to excited lattice deformation, thereby resulting in a lowest Stokes shift energy. Furthermore, stimuli-responsive sequential phase transitions between these well-defined structures were demonstrated, offering insights into their structural dynamics. This work provides critical fundamental understanding of how inorganic framework engineering within a fixed organic host precisely controls both electronic structure and excited-state relaxation pathways in hybrid copper(I) halides, paving the way for rational design of materials with tailored optical properties.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous Mg-ion batteries (AMIBs) have attracted increasing interest due to their safety, fast kinetics, and sustainability. However, the development of AMIBs is hindered by the narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) of electrolytes and electrode degradation. Here, a synergistic strategy, regulating both electrolyte and electrode structures, is proposed to enable high-performance AMIBs. Incorporating a polyethylene glycol crowding agent into Mg(ClO 4 ) 2 /H 2 O electrolyte regulates the solvation structure, which suppresses hydrogen evolution, and expands the ESW beyond 3.1 V. Meanwhile, an ammonium vanadate (NHVO) material with enlarged interlayer spacing is synthesized, and a freestanding NHVO/graphene oxide/carbon nanotube (NHVO/GO/CNT) electrode is constructed to enhance Mg 2+ diffusion and mitigate vanadium dissolution. Under the synergistic regulation, NHVO/GO/CNT exhibits a high capacity of 284.0 mAh g −1 and the longest cycling lifespan (16 000 cycles with 95.6% capacity retention). The solvation structure of electrolytes and interfacial stabilization mechanisms are elucidated through theory calculations. The Mg-storage mechanism of NHVO based on a single-phase insertion/extraction reaction with NH 4 + /Mg 2+ displacement phenomenon is revealed. The constructed multilayer Mg-ion pouch cell achieves a record-high capacity of 103.7 mAh. The integrated solar cell-pouch cell device demonstrates the feasibility of photo-charging AMIBs for the first time. This work offers a viable strategy toward practical, high-performance multivalent-ion batteries.},

  abstract     = {The performance of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is intrinsically determined by the interplay between the kinetic and thermodynamic processes, which jointly govern the polarization dynamics across multiple scales. Extensive efforts have been directed toward alleviating kinetic limitations, but the essential role of thermodynamic factors, particularly under extreme operating conditions, has been largely overlooked. This oversight has impeded the development of comprehensive design principle for optimizing LIBs. In this study, we systematically investigate the coupled effects between thermodynamics and kinetics using advanced multiphysics simulations. We identify the slope of the equilibrium potential profile as a pivotal thermodynamic parameter. Steeper slopes have been demonstrated to induce stronger negative feedback, thereby effectively mitigating polarization heterogeneity and realizing the consistent electrode utilization. Based on this insight, we propose a design strategy centered on steepening the equilibrium potential to enhance thermodynamic feedback. This approach achieves a remarkable 80% reduction in polarization heterogeneity, significantly improving operational stability. Our work establishes a theoretical framework for polarization dynamics and offers actionable thermodynamic design principles, paves the way for the development of LIBs capable of extreme operating conditions.},

However, the poor film formation, the tendency of orientation and aggregation, and contact in the interface of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ)/CILs/electrode increase the dark current, leading to a limitation of light detection. In this study, we designed and synthesized a nonfused conjugated small molecule (FNA) with dioctyl fluorene (F) as the π-bridge and N -dimethylaminopropyl-1,8-naphthalimide (NA) as terminal groups. As the CIL, it significantly modifies the interfaces of BHJ/CILs/electrode and minimizes dark current density ( J d ). Using PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F as the BHJ, FNA-based OPDs achieve a remarkably low J d of 1.12 × 10 −8 A cm −2 (at −0.5 V) and a peak specific detectivity of 8.23 × 10 12 Jones (940 nm), outperforming conventional devices with PDINN as CIL. These improvements are attributed to lower J d by modified interfacial contact and increased photoresponse by reducing depletion region width in FNA-based photodiodes. Furthermore, uniform photoresponse in 5 × 5 OPD pixel arrays further validates its potential for imaging applications.},

Herein, we present the first organocatalytic enantioselective [4 + 4] cycloaddition of furan ortho -quinodimethanes, activated by dearomatization of the heteroaromatic compound, which thereby allows for the cycloaddition with dienes. The [4 + 4] cycloaddition is catalyzed by a quinine-derived primary amine in combination with a chiral phosphoric acid and a carboxylic acid affording cyclooctanoids isolated as a single diastereoisomer in good yields and with up to 94% ee . This reaction concept allows for the formation of cyclooctanoids without benzofusion, as demonstrated by oxidative opening of the furan ring. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism for the [4 + 4] cycloaddition point to a stepwise process. Surprisingly, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction is attributed to protonation of the two organocatalyst-bound cyclooctanoid intermediates leading to a preferred set-up for catalyst elimination to account for the absolute configuration of the cyclooctanoid.},

However, the development of single-layer membranes with well-defined pore structures remains elusive, which makes the realization of efficient molecular sieving and interpretation of molecular transport a difficult task. Herein, we report the fabrication of single-layer nanoporous hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) membranes that uniquely contain triangular nanopores with a high density (around 10 12 pores per cm 2 ). The hBN membranes exhibit a H 2 permeance of 5.43 × 10 −6 mol m −2 s −1 Pa − 1 with a H 2 /CH 4 selectivity of 14.7; they also show a CO 2 permeance of 1.37 × 10 −6 mol m −2 s −1 Pa −1 , with a CO 2 /N 2 selectivity of 12.3. Importantly, we show that straightforward mathematical modeling can predict and describe the gas transport properties of the hBN, providing new insights into the molecular transport across atomically thin nanopores. The results gained from this study could significantly advance our understanding of molecular transport across hBN nanopores and may promote the development of hBN membranes to address critical separation issues.},

  abstract     = {The synthesis of nonalternant graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)—carbon-based nanostructures featuring fused pentagonal or heptagonal rings that disrupt hexagonal symmetry—has remained a significant challenge despite their unique electronic properties, such as tunable bandgaps and topological states. Unlike conventional alternant hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene-derived systems), nonalternant architectures exhibit distinct electron confinement effects, making them promising for nanoscale optoelectronics and quantum materials. However, achieving precise control over their length, solubility, and structural regularity has had limited progress. Herein, we report a versatile solution-phase synthesis of a novel family of structurally precise N -doped nonalternant nanoribbons ( NRs : NR-11 to NR-29 ) through pentagon annulation of pyrazino[2,3- g ]quinoxaline and naphthalene subunits terminated with triptycene end-caps. The longest one comprises 29 linearly fused rings (particularly including 10 pentagonal rings), setting a new length record of 7.18 nm among the soluble nonalternant NRs reported to date. Strategic incorporation of triptycene end-caps and alkoxyphenyl substituents into their molecular backbones confers high solubility and a unique 3D configuration, enabling comprehensive solution-phase structural characterization and systematic investigation of length-dependent optoelectronic properties. Employing terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, we infer high intrinsic charge carrier mobilities in nonalternant nanoribbons, reaching up to ∼2000 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , highlighting this novel family of nanoribbons as promising candidates for future nanoelectronic applications.},

However, this widely adopted approach overlooks a key electronic feature: Spin frustration in the triangular -O) nodes. Using flip-spin, broken-symmetry DFT, we identify the true ground state as an antiferromagnetic state that standard DFT fails to capture. We demonstrate that neglecting spin frustration in MIL-101(Fe) leads to structural distortions, incorrect energetics, and misleading predictions of stability and reactivity. By explicitly accounting for spin frustration, we recover the correct structure and rationalize the temperature-dependent and CO binding. Spin frustration enhances fixation at room temperature, while its loss upon partial reduction suppresses this activity but promotes CO adsorption via -backbonding. These findings challenge current computational conventions and highlight spin frustration as a critical electronic feature in these frameworks.},

  abstract     = {The properties of metal-centred species in metal halide perovskite precursor solutions substantially influence the formation and evolution of colloidal particles, which in turn dictate the crystallisation process and the film quality. In this work, we assess the “hard” and “soft” Lewis acid characteristics of Sn 2+ and Pb 2+ cations as a strategy to modulate the chemical environment of these metal-containing species in mixed-metal tin–lead perovskite precursor solutions. We observe enhanced simultaneous access to both metal centres upon adding compounds with functional groups suggested by the hard–soft acid–base principle. Theoretical calculations suggest that the hard base carboxyl group preferentially interacts with Sn 2+ -based species, while the softer base thiol group also targets Pb 2+ -based species. By effectively accessing and manipulating possible classes of inorganic species and their colloidal particle properties in the precursor solutions, we achieve 1.26 eV perovskite polycrystalline films exhibiting enhanced structural and optoelectronic quality, giving the best quasi-Fermi level splitting values of up to 0.95 eV. As a result, the solar cell devices demonstrate efficiency values of up to 23.3% with an extended operational lifetime, retaining 80% of their initial efficiency after over 280 and 180 h of maximum power point tracking under simulated AM1.5G illumination at 25 and 65 °C, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into value-added chemicals represents a sustainable route for plastic valorization. However, previous studies have solely focused on generating oxygenated compounds through intramolecular C─O bond transformations. Achieving heteroatom-containing important chemicals via intermolecular coupling reactions is still challenging. Herein, we report the first example of the direct photocatalytic C─N coupling of PET-derived ethylene glycol (EG) with ammonia to produce formamide (FA) and H 2 over a Pt 1 Au/TiO 2 catalyst. Pt 1 Au/TiO 2 delivers a FA yield rate of ∼7.1 mmol g cat −1 h −1 , as well as H 2 evolution (∼22.8 mmol g cat −1 h −1 ). Photoelectrochemical analyses, including time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), reveal that monatomic Pt sites can effectively trap electrons, while Au nanoparticles act as hole sinks, thereby synergistically enhancing charge separation efficiency. Mechanistic investigations via in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) elucidate the reaction pathway: EG undergoes hole-mediated oxidation to yield an aldehyde intermediate, which is subsequently attacked nucleophilically by hole-derived •NH 2 , inducing sequential C─C bond cleavage and C─N bond formation. This work provides critical mechanistic insights for the sustainable synthesis of high-value heteroatom-containing chemicals from plastic waste.},

Here, we engineer the lattices from distorted to strain-graded in LnNCs by CaF 2 deposition on vacancy-controlled β-Na x GdF 3+x :Yb,A (A = Tm/Er, x = 0.5, 0.75, 1) NCs. We demonstrate that strain-graded lattices with high phonon energy enhance the multi-phonon orbit-lattice relaxation (MPR) in the downconversion process more effectively than distorted lattices, which helps to extend the near-infrared-IIb (NIR-IIb, 1500–1700 nm) lifetime of Er 3+ /Tm 3+ by 2∼4 times. Subsequent epitaxial CaF 2 growth further attenuates surface phonon coupling, enabling exponential tunability of NIR-IIb lifetime (Tm 3+ : 0.74∼6.28 ms; Er 3+ : 0.055∼9.2 ms). Finally, we showcase the potential of these LnNCs in time-resolved multiplexed bioimaging.},

  abstract     = {Immunotherapy is a groundbreaking approach for clinically treating tumors, but its effectiveness is hindered by the tumor's immunosuppressive environment and lack of immune cell infiltration, enabling tumors to evade the immune system. Although the activation of both innate and adaptive immunities is a promising strategy to counteract this bottleneck, their synergy remains challenging. Therefore, we developed Bio-Cy , an unprecedented organic unimolecular photosensitive immunostimulant, which stimulates self-amplifying pyroptosis and cGAS-STING pathways by disrupting pyroptosis checkpoints to enhance adaptive and innate immunity activation. Mechanistic studies have shown that Bio-Cy can target cancer cells and be transported to lysosomes via endocytosis, generating reactive oxygen species through a Type I photodynamic mechanism to destroy cancer cells, even under hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, this lysosomal disruption not only activates the caspase-3/GSDME-dependent pyroptosis of adaptive immunity through mitochondrial damage by releasing Ca 2+ , but also enhances the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway by releasing mitochondrial DNA. More importantly, the initial lysosomal damage impairs protective cellular autophagy, destroying the pyroptosis checkpoint and thus preventing the clearance of damaged mitochondria and amplifying immune responses, ultimately boosting immunotherapy. This strategy effectively treats primary tumors and inhibits metastatic growth, offering a new paradigm for photoimmunotherapy.},

The decoration of bioactive molecules with 2,2-disubstituted BCP exhibits superior antitumor activity compared to the anticancer drug Sonidegib, rendering this method highly practical and appealing.

  abstract     = {Water-soluble nanozymes have the potential to overcome the limitations of low catalytic efficiency of most heterogeneous nanozymes in aqueous solutions and further expand their applications in the biomedical field, but with significant synthetic challenges. Here we report an oxidase-mimicking water-soluble nanozyme based on zinc porphyrin-based covalent organic framework nanohydrogel (Zn-COF-NHG) for photocatalytic antibacterial. The in situ atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) on scaffold of Zn-COF results in the exfoliation of crystalline COF nanosheets and assembly into nanohydrogels in aqueous solution. The obtained Zn-COF-NHG can effectively mimic photoresponsive oxidase-like activity for the chromogenic catalysis of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by facilitating homogeneous behavior to enhance catalytic efficiency, while also exhibiting intelligent temperature-response regulation of catalytic oxidation activity. Moreover, the high photodynamic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reinforcement of binding to the exterior of bacteria through noncovalent interactions concurrently boost its bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) and Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) by amplifying oxidative stress. In vivo study on S. aureus -infected murine model further substantiates the superior wound disinfection and healing effect of Zn-COF-NHG.

  abstract     = {Traditional strategies for developing small-molecule inhibitors of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) are time-consuming and often yield low success rates due to the flat and dynamic interfaces of PPIs. To enable the rapid design of highly potent PPI inhibitors, we proposed a novel strategy named “Fulcrum Occupancy–Leverage Perturbation (FOLP)”. In this strategy, high-affinity fragments serve as the “Fulcrum” by binding to the orthosteric pocket, while suitable moieties extend into allosteric sites near the PPI interface as “Leverage” to modulate the protein–protein interaction. As a proof of concept, the potent CDK2–Cyclin A2 PPI inhibitor LC-K2CAin-3, which fits the “FOLP” paradigm, was discovered with an IC 50 of 32.1 nM for inhibiting the interaction. Molecular dynamics simulations and cryptic pocket identification were employed, revealing the activation loop (A-loop) of CDK2 was flexible and targetable. X-ray crystallography and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis showed that LC-K2CAin-3 indeed bound to and stabilized the A-loop. LC-K2CAin-3 effectively inhibited the CDK2–Cyclin A2 interaction in CDK2 highly expressed melanoma cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and inhibition of CDK2 mediated signaling. In conclusion, the “FOLP” strategy offers a novel approach for PPI inhibitor discovery and could accelerate the development of PPI inhibitors.},

By regulating the solvation abilities of polymer and solvent, this work explores the relationships between GPE composition, Li + coordination structures, Li + transference number, and interphase chemistry. The GPE combining weakly coordinated solvents with strongly coordinating polymer results in strong Li + -polymer attachment, leading to sluggish ion transport. Employing strongly chelating solvents causes complete Li + -polymer detachment, forming micelle structures that obstruct ion transport. The GPE with both weakly coordinated solvent fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and polymer 1 H ,1 H ,2 H ,2 H -tridecafluoro- n -octyl acrylate (TFOA) enables optimal interactions between Li + and polymer/solvent, facilitating partial Li + -polymer detachment and aggregates (AGGs) generation, avoiding micelle formation. This promotes efficient Li + transport and anion-derived SEI generation. The resulting GPE achieves 99.2% Coulombic efficiency (CE) in Cu||Li cells and enables 4.5 V LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 ||Li to demonstrate 81% capacity retention after 140 cycles.

Both thermodynamic equilibrium and dynamics VOC vapor adsorption studies reveal that optimal flexibility enables guest-adaptive structural transformation, allowing pore expansion to accommodate additional VOC molecules after initial pore filling. Moreover, polar and aromatic VOCs induce greater framework expansion than nonpolar analogues, which can also enhance the VOC uptake capacity in FPAFs. This work establishes flexibility engineering as a design principle for next-generation adsorbents, improving the efficiency of VOC adsorption.},

However, the challenge of developing long-term acidic Zn–Mn batteries still remains due to Zn anode instability in acidic media arising from the inevitable proton corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report self-assembled homogeneous heterobimetallic-oxide interfaces on the Zn anode surface via a multi-cation (Cu 2+ , In 3+ , and Sn 4+ ) synergistic regulation strategy to achieve >85.5% depth of discharge with over 1000 h of cycling in strongly acidic medium (pH = 0.9). The design ingeniously blends the SnCl 4 hydrolysis and In 3+ and Cu 2+ ions replacement with Zn metal to spontaneously generate heterobimetallic In–CuZn 5 and SnO 2 oxide. Heterobimetallic-oxide interfaces could synergistically inhibit proton corrosion and HER while inducing Zn-ordered plating/stripping benefiting from the excellent acid resistance of SnO 2 and the abundant nucleation sites of heterobimetallic. Crucially, the in situ hydrolysis of SnCl 4 establishes a self-regulated acidic environment without additional acidic medium. Consequently, Zn–Mn pouch battery within this acidic environment delivers a high capacity of 1.39 mAh cm −2 and retains 84.9% of initial capacity after 200 cycles at 1 mA cm −2 . This direct multi-cation synergistic modulated self-assembly interface strategy holds significant potential for expediting the advancement of high-safety, large-scale energy storage technology.},

  abstract     = {The construction of well-defined 3D charge-transfer (CT) co-crystals using new macrocyclic hosts to enable programmable functionality remains challenging due to the dimensional constraints imposed by conventional assembly strategies. Herein, we address this limitation using a new synthetic macrocycle named box[6]arene ( B[6]A ) with a flexible skeleton, which adopts two distinct conformations ( B[6]Aα and B[6]Aβ ). Crucially, the self-complementary and exo-wall CT co-assembly of B[6]A facilitates the construction of 3D macrocycle-based co-crystals (MCCs) with planar electron-deficient guests, including 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene ( TCNB ), tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile ( TFTN ), and tetrachloroterephthalonitrile ( TClTN ). These MCCs exhibit tunable fluorescence with emission maxima at 690, 594, and 592 nm, respectively. Notably, activated B[6]A-TCNB demonstrates selective vapochromic behaviors toward picoline isomers via a dual response mechanism. This study provides new insights into the design of functional macrocyclic arenes and 3D MCCs, paving the way for the development of color-tunable crystalline luminescent materials and advanced vapochromic systems.},

However, the exploitation of mechanophores for fundamental investigations of deformation processes and the prediction of failure in technologically critical applications has been constrained by their responsivity to other stimuli, laborious synthesis, and limited control of their photophysical and mechanical properties. Here, we report a cyclobutane-based mechanophore that activates a fluorescent coumarin dye through the application of mechanical stress in solution and in the solid state. We demonstrate the preparation of the mechanophore in two synthetic steps, its incorporation into linear and crosslinked polymers, and its thermal and photochemical stability, establishing the basis for a new class of mechanophores with tunable spectral and mechanical characteristics.},

However, such tunable lifetimes are limited to short ranges (0.01−1 ms). Herein, we describe a method that extends the emission lifetime using dynamic molecular triplet excitons in aggregation systems composed of lanthanide complexes. To demonstrate the conceptual method, molecular crystals comprising lutetium (Lu 3+ ) and luminescent lanthanide (europium: Eu 3+ or terbium: Tb 3+ ) complexes with two organic ligands (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate and 2,7-bis(diphenylphosphoryl)phenanthrene) were prepared. These molecular crystals exhibited persistent emission via slow triplet exciton migration between the phenanthrene units. The extended degree of the lifetime could be controlled between 1 and 152 ms by ligand modifications. This proposed lifetime-tuning method should significantly expand the encoding capacity of lanthanide complexes.},

Inspired by the durable, deformable nature of rubber tires, we report the design and preparation of a self-adaptive solid-state elastomeric electrolyte containing a deep eutectic electrolyte, termed PMEC, which integrates molecular-level plasticizer dispersion, mechanical flexibility, and interfacial adaptivity. The PMEC membrane exhibits high ionic conductivity (2.37 mS cm −1 at 30 °C), a high Li⁺ transference number (0.64), excellent elasticity, and robust interfacial adhesion (36.34 J m −2 ). Structural characterizations confirm its amorphous and homogeneously mixed nature, while micro-Raman and XPS/TOF-SIMS analyses reveal uniform component distribution and the formation of an organic–inorganic gradient SEI layer on lithium. These features enable exceptional electrochemical performance in both symmetric and full batteries, including over 2000 h of stable cycling and >800 cycles at 0.5 C in LFP|PMEC|Li batteries with >88% capacity retention. Moreover, PMEC-based pouch batteries maintain functionality under severe mechanical abuse. This tire-inspired electrolyte design offers a generalizable platform for high-safety and high-performance solid-state lithium batteries.},

There are only a handful of metal organic cages produced by metalation of a pre-synthesised organic cage. In this work, we show that hexa-cationic hydrazone cages coordinate a range of transition metal ions upon deprotonation to give cage complexes with metal ions oriented towards the cage cavity. Remarkably, a cage with ethyl solubilising groups gives the expected three-fold symmetric metallocage, cages with alkoxy solubilising groups give low-symmetry zinc metallocages, and a cage without a solubilising group switches between high and low symmetry conformations depending on solvent. These low symmetry arrangements persist on the NMR timescale at temperatures as high as 360 K and in the presence of a wide range of anions.},

The phase transition also generated a confined rigid environment for Cell-Lig, activating thickness- and temperature-dependent green RTP emission from the incorporated lignin. Furthermore, red afterglow emission using an energy transfer mechanism was realized by incorporating rhodamine B (RhB). The inherent photothermal activity of lignin endowed Cell-Lig with easy recyclability using light-controlled phase transitions. Under irradiation, photothermal evaporation of residual ethanol triggered liquefaction (solid-to-liquid transition), while ethanol reintroduction facilitated instantaneous hardening. Remarkably, the initial RTP performance was maintained over six recycling cycles. Capitalizing on these attributes, Cell-Lig was successfully used for advanced coating and security applications.},

  abstract     = {Chiral macrocycles have attracted considerable attention because of their fascinating circular chiral topologies, circularly distributed electronic structures, and excellent chiroptical features. However, the challenging synthesis and limited cases hinder the understanding, improvement, and regulation of their optoelectronic properties. To avoid this dilemma, we employed cyclic Suzuki–Miyaura coupling between dithienylethene (DTE) and [6]helicene to firstly synthesize donor–acceptor (D–A)-type π-conjugated chiral macrocycles, including m -[1 + 1] , m -[2 + 2] , and m -[3 + 3] , where these compounds displayed photocontrollable ring sizes and chiroptical properties. More importantly, continuous amplification in chirality can be achieved via distinctive multiple chiral-centers-bonding in series within helical rings, giving high | g abs | and | g lum | of up to 0.023 and 0.013, respectively. The macrocycles were endowed with a photoswitchable function that is absent in previously documented π-conjugated chiral macrocycles. Both the cavity sizes and chiroptical properties could be photoregulated. As typical examples, the cavity dimension of m -[3 + 3] - PPP was photoadjusted from 25.8 × 19.8 to 22.6 × 18.3 Å, accompanied by reversible photoswitched | g abs | between 0.023 and 0.014 and remarkable CPL ON/OFF behavior. Moreover, a size-photoswitching correlation was revealed innovatively, i.e., the photoswitching ability increased with increasing ring size. Our study provides a new guidance for developing high-performance chiral systems and novel stimuli-responsive chiral macrocycles and provides ideal platforms for understanding chiral structure–functionality relationships.},

These quasi-1D chains are composed of polar MnBr 4 2− tetrahedra and halogen-substituted pyridine ligands. Of particular interest is the mixed-polyhedral compound [3-IPy] 3 [MnBr 3 ][MnBr 4 ]. It exhibits dominant antiparallel alignment of dipole moment between quasi-1D chains, while 1D [(MnBr 3 ) − ] ∞ chains display zero dipole moment. The highly-distorted MnBr 4 2− tetrahedra owing to strong hydrogen bonding with halopyridine introduces large inherent structural anisotropy. Under X-ray excitation, it gives rise to a pronounced and fascinating polarization-sensitive emission. These findings underscore the promising potential of mixed-polyhedral Mn(II) halide hybrids in polarized photonic applications and provide valuable insights for the rational design of polarization-sensitive functional materials.},

Herein, we disclose our recent observations on a novel three-component asymmetric Tsuji–Trost reaction enabled by cooperative palladium/Lewis acid (LA) catalysis. This ‘ 1C + 2C + NuH’ approach starts from fundamental organic feedstocks, i.e., aldehyde, allylboronate, and a nucleophile with the in situ formation of a C═C double bond. Diverse nucleophiles have been demonstrated to be applicable in this three-component AAS reaction, including malonates, acetylacetone, acetoacetate, phosphine oxides, sulfonyl hydrazides etc. The protocol successfully offers a novel platform to integrate two distinct bioactive molecular scaffolds to access diverse array of hybrids. Mechanistic studies suggest that the three-component AAS approach proceeds via a reaction sequence of LA-catalyzed allylation of aldehyde, olefin shift under palladium catalysis, and Pd/LA-cocatalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution.},

This spin state transition of Fe center is able to not only influence the orbital orientation but also modulate the electronic coupling between active sites and the adsorbates, thereby enhancing the kinetic process of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Besides, the spin polarization induced by this unique structure could also improve the utilization efficiency of the carriers by facilitating the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers and prolonging their lifetime.

Although elemental doping is a general method to improve stability, it inadvertently induces oxygen vacancies (V O s), which are randomly distributed in the nanocatalyst. Notably, the impact of V O distribution on the stability of Ru-based catalysts remains unresolved. Herein, we synthesized the Se-doped Ru oxide via annealing the mixture of ruthenium (III) chloride and selenium (Se) in the air (Ur-Se-RuO x ) with the presence of urea, showing the V O s distributed away from Se dopants, which is significantly different from the Se-doped Ru oxide synthesized without urea (Se-RuO x ), showing V O s distributed relatively close to the Se dopants. The Ur-Se-RuO x demonstrates superior oxygen evolution reaction performance over Se-RuO x . Particularly, Ur-Se-RuO x delivers a low working voltage (1.62 V@1 A cm −2 ) and excellent durability (>1000 h@200 mA cm −2 ) in PEMWE tests. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that V O s engage in long-range cooperation with spatially decoupled Se dopants in Ur-Se-RuO x , synergistically enhancing reaction kinetics via an intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism, while inhibiting the lattice oxygen mechanism and suppressing Ru dissolution, which demonstrates a new strategy to break the activity–stability trade-off in promising Ru-based catalysts.},

In this work, the dienoic-acid coupling effect is innovatively proposed to in-situ construct a hierarchical SEI layer (HSL) through the structural screening of a series of organic-acid molecules. Strong electron-withdrawing ability of dual carboxyl and metastable double bond can strengthen the self-decomposition tendency of trace electrolyte additive to form HSL via chemical and electrochemical reaction. HSL can effectively regulate interfacial H 2 O environment via hydrogen-bond anchoring to reduce thermodynamically active H 2 O, facilitate desolvation kinetics, and uniform Zn 2+ diffusion, thus significantly suppressing HER and dendrite growth. As a result, Zn anode with HSL can achieve high average coulombic efficiency of 99.8% over 2400 cycles, long-term cycling stability of 3800 h, and good reversibility under 50 mA cm −2 . Zn–I 2 full battery with HSL displays a long cycling life of 15 000 cycles and successfully powers the portable and wearable instruments.

  abstract     = {The structural design and facile synthesis of ligands are crucial for the development of innovative catalysts. Advances have enabled the iterative design of benchmark α-diimine nickel catalysts for the synthesis of polyolefins, which represent the largest class of polymers. In this work, a versatile post-synthetic modification (PSM) strategy is introduced for the synthesis of a new family of α-diimine nickel catalysts, deviating from the conventional methods. Based on the commercial butanedione ligand backbone that is found in α-diimine nickel catalysts, target groups were introduced into the backbone via a one-pot substitution reaction. This simple and efficient approach enabled the large-scale production of the target systems without purification. Using this protocol, 20 new ligands (50 g-level) and 20 new nickel catalysts were easily and rapidly synthesized. The catalysts demonstrated significant enhancements in their catalytic activities (4.4 × 10 8 g mol −1 h −1 ), thermostabilities (from 90 to 150 °C), and polymer molecular weights (8.3-fold those of polyethylenes produced by the unmodified catalyst) during ethylene polymerization. These improvements are comparable to those achieved through complicated and tedious aniline modifications in pioneering reports, thereby facilitating the kg-scale synthesis of polyethylenes, varying from semi-crystalline plastics to thermoplastic elastomers and ultimately to wax-like and oil-like products.},

  abstract     = {Zirconium-based MOFs (Zr-MOFs) with high hydrolytic stability are promising materials for water-adsorption-related applications. However, besides hydrolytic stability, cycling stability is also a crucial feature that renders a MOF a good candidate for water adsorption. Through a series of Zr-MOFs with one-dimensional (1D) channels showing high water cycling stability, a principle of confining the accessibility of Zr 6 nodes aligning along channel direction in Zr-MOFs was unveiled. According to this principle, several topologies that regulates Zr 6 nodes with chelating formate aligning in a same plane with a distance less than 5.4 Å can successfully hinder the introduction of in-plane water molecules, thus significantly improve the cycling stability of Zr-MOFs for water adsorption. Along with this principle, we illustrated a linker designing strategy by horizontal extending the core of organic linkers toward the synthesis of Zr-MOFs with similar node alignment. By either intentionally shortening or elongating the core horizontally, both MOFs shows high water-vapor cycling stability. Among them, NJTech-5 (NJTech for Nanjing Tech University) with scu -topology, presents a water uptake capacity of 0.93 g g −1 and working capacity of 0.82 g g −1 , making it among the top stable MOFs with high water uptake capacity and a promising candidate for indoor humidity control.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic plastics sourced from petroleum have gained widespread use since the 1950s. Polystyrene (PS) is one of the most extensively used plastics, as it is colorless, has high mechanical strength, and exhibits excellent chemical and thermal stability; however, it is also one of the least recycled plastics because of the high cost and low profit in recycling. Herein, we demonstrate a mechanochemical recycling approach that allows PS to be efficiently degraded into benzene when it is ground in a ball mill with AlCl 3 . For example, when 165 kDa PS pellets are milled with AlCl 3 , the extent of degradation reaches 90% at 15 min. Isotope labeling experiments indicate that both ambient water and the polymer backbone can be proton sources for the formation of benzene. The benzene generated in the mechanochemical degradation can be used to synthesize styrene, which can be repolymerized to produce polystyrene, allowing for the closed-loop recycling of PS. In addition, a mechanochemical Friedel–Crafts acylation between the generated benzene and the subsequently added benzoic anhydride produces benzophenone in 40%–50% yield. The mechanochemical degradation process demonstrated here is solvent-free, cost-effective, and energy-efficient, providing a promising route for the chemical recycling and upcycling of PS.},

However, it remains a significant challenge to precisely control over interlayer stacking configurations in 2D COFs, which critically influence charge carrier transport and consequently determine catalytic efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate a solvent-driven strategy to precisely regulate the interlayer stacking configurations of metal-incorporated 2D COFs, successfully achieving both AA eclipsed (COF-TD-AA) and ABC staggered (COF-TD-ABC) configurations. Notably, by modulating the coordination interactions between solvent 1-butanol and Zn 2+ (within the COFs), the interactions between the Zn 2+ and nitrogen atoms (from imine bonds, pyridine, and triazine units) can be precisely tuned, which leads to the formation of AA or ABC stacked 2D COFs. Interestingly, the ABC-stacked COF-TD-ABC exhibited an extended light absorption and superior charge migration/separation efficiency than those of COF-TD-AA. As a result, when coupled with Pt co-catalysts, COF-TD-ABC achieved a high hydrogen evolution rate up to 10.92 mmol g −1 h −1 , representing a ∼3.5-fold enhancement over COF-TD-AA (3.12 mmol g −1 h −1 ). This work provides a fundamental insight into the stacking-dependent structure-property relationships in COFs, paving the way for the rational design of high-performance COF-based photocatalysts.},

Herein, we developed a general design strategy—introducing a positive charge into the fluorophore skeleton—for the construction of FAPα-activated fluorescent probe with enhanced sensitivity. Molecular docking simulations and fluorescence spectra revealed that the FAPα-activated fluorescent probe with positive charges displayed an improved affinity and sensitivity toward FAPα. As demonstration, FQCy7 , featuring two positive charges, NIR fluorescence emission, and large Stokes shift, exhibited a satisfactory sensitivity toward FAPα and was used for the relationship study between FAPα and carcinoma cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that FQCy7 is highly useful in distinguishing invasive tumor from benign lesions and evaluating the precise resection of tumor tissues.

However, the development of efficient electrocatalysts for both HER and HOR in acidic media remains challenging, as conventional platinum-based catalysts face intrinsic limitations in simultaneously achieving high activity and long-term stability under harsh operating conditions. Herein, we introduce a bidirectional hydrogen spillover strategy to enable synergistic bifunctional HER/HOR catalysts for hydrogen batteries. We demonstrate a Ru–WO 3 catalyst grown on Cu foam (Ru–WO 3 @CF), where the interaction between Ru and WO 3 enables dynamic shuttling of adsorbed hydrogen species under alternating potentials. The Ru–WO 3 @CF electrode demonstrates exceptional HER/HOR bifunctionality in acidic media (0.5 M H 2 SO 4 ), achieving an ultralow HER overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and an HOR current density of 21.5 mA cm −2 at 50 mV — both significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C benchmarks. The hydrogen battery fabricated with Ru–WO 3 @CF demonstrates exceptional performance across a wide range of temperatures. This work aims to explore the feasibility of bidirectional hydrogen spillover in enhancing the bifunctional catalytic activities toward HER/HOR, providing new insights for high-performance hydrogen batteries.},

  abstract     = {The water molecule is regarded as a double-edged sword in organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs), particularly for n-type semiconductors. On the one hand, hydration facilitates ion transport within OMIECs; on the other hand, water acts as an electron trap, capturing electrons in n-type materials. Excessive hydration may disrupt the continuity of OMIECs crystalline domains, leading to device degradation. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative strategy by incorporating perfluoroalkyl hybridized ethylene glycol (fag) side chains into the polymer. The strong hydrophobicity of fluoroalkyl segments effectively repels water from polymer backbone, thereby reducing electron trapping. Meanwhile, the ethylene glycol components facilitate efficient ion transport. These findings are confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM-D). Additionally, the electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, which in turn enhances stability in aqueous environments. We also discovered that the incorporation of fag side chains also promotes polymer self-assembly and improves crystallinity. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) reveals a face-on/edge-on mixed orientation in fag-based polymers, facilitating efficient ion-electron transport. Consequently, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) fabricated from fag-based OMIECs demonstrate state-of-the-art n-type performance, achieving a µC* figure of merit of 189.78 F cm −1 V −1 s −1 . Furthermore, they exhibit excellent stability, retaining 68% of their initial performance after 50 000 switching cycles in aqueous electrolyte. This study demonstrates that a rational approach to molecular design can effectively alleviate the detrimental effects of water, providing a novel strategy for the development of high-performance and stable n-type OMIECs.},

Recently, we synthesized two ferrocene-doped cycloarylenes, (CpFe) 3 -1 and (CpFe) 4 -2 . However, the {FeCp} moieties in these architectures limited their optical properties. In this work, we report a reductive Fe─Cp bond cleavage approach that enables the removal of {FeCp} moieties efficiently, yielding two anionic cycloarylenes, 1 3– and 2 4– . Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals different structure deformation between two charged species including molecular symmetry and π-conjugation. Comprehensive spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations demonstrate that both 1 3– and 2 4– exhibit steady emission at 560 and 587 nm, respectively, with noticeable high quantum yields (59.70% and 84.99%). 1 3– violates Kasha's rule via a rare mixed emission from S 2 →S 0 and S 1 '→S 0 , whereas 2 4– adheres to the conventional S 1 '→S 0 decay. Furthermore, both compounds exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) as the first example observed in cycloarylenes, with lifetimes reaching the millisecond scale.

However, they typically face irreversible deactivation above 0.2 V vs. RHE due to synergistic Ru oxidation/OH ad over-adsorption. We propose a Taichi-inspired TiN-TiO 2 heterophase-segregated electron-relay mechanism that dynamically balances bidirectional electron flow (Ru→TiN electron donation and TiO 2 →Ru electron replenishment), achieving complete activity retention (100%) even under 1.1 V operation. This potential-adaptive regulation can significantly inhibit electron redistribution and band compression under the high potential induced electric field, and effectively alleviate the d- band upshift and OH adsorption energy surge. Spatially decoupled Ti(TiN)-Ru bridge sites simultaneously adsorb OH ad (E ads = -1.40 eV) and decouple H ad /OH ad adsorption domains, eliminating competitive binding. This configuration delivers triple synergies: 1) geometric isolation of reactive intermediates adsorption, 2) potential-responsive Ru 0 stabilization, and 3) accelerated Volmer kinetics via interfacial hydroxyl migration. The Ru/TiN-TiO 2 catalyst achieves 100% activity retention at 1.1 V vs. RHE (vs. >60% loss for Ru/TiN) with 73.23% metallic Ru 0 preserved after 10 h operation.

In this study, we have introduced a d-d electron complementation strategy to fine-tune the electronic features of a VOFe-PBA precatalyst. Spectroscopic studies revealed the altered coordination and electronic features of the VOFe-PBA precatalyst compared to the FeFe-PBA counterpart. The electrochemical activation of the VOFe-PBA precatalyst led to the formation of a strained V-Fe(O)OH active catalyst. Notably, V-Fe(O)OH demonstrated exceptional performance, requiring a potential of only 1.56 V versus RHE for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 1.42 V versus RHE for iodide oxidation reaction (IOR) at a current density of 100 mA cm −2 , significantly outperforming the Fe(O)OH. When employed in IOR-assisted water splitting, V-Fe(O)OH achieved an energy efficiency of 60% compared to overall water splitting. In-situ Raman studies reflected the potential dependent generation of active reaction intermediates, which participated in IOR to produce iodate. Mechanistic investigations suggested the involvement of a lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) facilitated by a proton-decoupled electron transfer (PDET) pathway.},

  abstract     = {Freezing hydrogels at subzero temperatures severely compromises mechanical flexibility, ionic conductivity, and structural integrity, thereby limiting their application in low-temperature environments. Hydrogel freezing involves both ice nucleation and ice growth; however, simultaneously inhibiting these two processes remains a significant challenge. In nature, freeze-tolerant organisms do not rely on completely preventing ice formation to survive freezing conditions. Instead, they utilize bacterial membrane-anchored ice nucleating protein (BMIP) to promote ice nucleation and ice binding protein (IBP) to regulate ice growth, thereby achieving freeze protection through precise ice management. Inspired by this biological strategy of “selective nucleation of small ice crystals with restricted growth,” we developed anti-freezing hydrogels by incorporating both BMIP and IBP. The anti-freezing hydrogels exhibit enhanced mechanical and electrical performance at low temperatures, with a non-freezing matrix stable down to −30°C and excellent structural integrity over multiple freeze-thaw cycles. When employed as a functional component of a robotic hand designed for low-temperature operation and integrated with machine learning algorithms, the anti-freezing hydrogels enable precise recognition of object stiffness and size under ultra-low temperature conditions. This bioinspired approach provides a promising strategy for the development of next-generation anti-freezing hydrogels capable of supporting stable human-robot-environment interactions in harsh, low-temperature environments.},

  abstract     = {The direct integration of renewable energy into H 2 O 2 electrosynthesis systems offers a promising strategy to minimize energy losses and costs. Due to the intermittency of renewable energy, the dual-site catalysts must efficiently enable both the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e − ORR) and water oxidation reaction (2e − WOR). The Kirkendall effect was employed to engineer interfaces and construct a NiZnO x ─C catalyst with exposed (100) facets. The hetero-cluster NiO x induces oxygen vacancies and built-in electric fields, which facilitate water activation and subsequent formation of hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals, thereby enabling a single catalyst to rapidly electrosynthesize H 2 O 2 at both the anode and cathode. Notably, 2e − ORR on the cathode enabled rapid synthesis of high-concentration H 2 O 2 (33987 mg L −1 , 33.18 mol g catalyst −1 h −1 ). NiZnO x ─C achieves stable 2e − ORR/WOR coupling in a continuous-flow reactor, operating reliably for 4 h under simulated alternating current (AC) and peaking at a total Faradaic efficiency of 150.9% under amperage-level direct currents. This work provides insights into interface engineering based on the Kirkendall effect, demonstrating the feasibility of directly integrating intermittent renewable energy into H 2 O 2 electrosynthesis systems.},

Herein, inspired by the early flowering of damaged plants, we designed a catalyst rich in oxygen vacancies (O vac ) and proved that O vac can accelerate the formation of Ni 3+ and further oxidize it to Ni 4+ , which we named as the “ripening” mechanism of O vac . O vac reduces the hydrogen proton desorption energy by regulating local charge redistribution, thus realizing the rapid transformation of Ni 2+ →Ni 3+ →Ni 4+ . Meanwhile, the hard Lewis acid Ni 4+ has strong selectivity to OH − , avoiding the competitiveness and corrosiveness of chloride ions in seawater. This work provides an effective strategy for the simple and rapid construction of self-rebuilding high-valence Ni 4+ electrocatalysts, and is expected to provide guidance for the development of seawater electrolysis.},

  abstract     = {Ether based electrolytes are promising for the realization of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs). However, the oxidation chemistry of these electrolytes stemming from the disruption to solvent coordination by interfacial electric-field remains unresolved and challenging. Herein, we demonstrated that reinforcing the interactions between solvent and diluent to decouple solvation dynamics from interfacial electric fields could maintain Li⁺-solvent coordination integrity and drastically diminish uncoordinated solvents, thereby increasing electrolyte anodic stability. To realize this concept, we identify a class of solvophilic diluents (SPDs, whose interaction energies with solvent>3.3 kcal mol −1 ) to strongly anchor diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) solvent at electrified interfaces via mutually reinforcing H (DEGDME) ···F/O (SPD) and H (SPD) ···O (DEGDME) interactions and effectively decrease dipole moment of DEGDME (< 2.47 D), creating an electric field-insensitive solvation environment wherein the O─H/C─H bond polarization of DEGDME is dramatically impeded. Remarkably, our designed SPD-assisted electrolyte mediated by electric field-insensitive methyl nonafluorobutyl ether exhibits outstanding anodic stability, endowing 4.7 V-class 30 µm Li||2.1 mAh cm −2 LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 cell with 80% capacity retention after 168 cycles-an improvement over the 90 cycles achieved with a Li friendly electrolyte.

  abstract     = {CRISPR/Cas systems have transformed genome editing, yet achieving precise temporal and conditional control remains challenging. Traditional strategies involving linear guide RNAs (gRNAs) modified with multiple chemical groups throughout their strands often face limitations such as heterogeneous reaction outcomes, irreversibility, and variable editing efficiencies. To overcome these issues, topology-engineered guide RNAs (TE-gRNAs) have emerged, featuring defined structural architectures including polymeric, circular, and dendrimer-like topologies that enable precise spatial control, reversibility, and programmable activation of CRISPR activity. By selectively incorporating physical or chemically responsive linkers and stimuli-sensitive groups at specific sites, TE-gRNAs facilitate dynamic and conditional genome editing that can be activated or deactivated with external triggers such as light or chemical signals. These engineered RNA structures significantly improve synthesis feasibility, stability, reduce off-target effects, and provide unprecedented control over gene editing processes. Recent advancements in TE-gRNAs demonstrate their broad applicability in synthetic biology, functional genomics, and therapeutic interventions, highlighting their potential to achieve precise spatiotemporal modulation of CRISPR systems. This review summarizes the current strategies, benefits, and challenges associated with TE-gRNAs, and discusses future directions for enhancing their performance and utility in complex genome editing applications.},

  abstract     = {In the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the exploration of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts is essential for the environmentally friendly production of hydrogen. Although RuO 2 exhibits high catalytic activity, its solubility and corrosion in acidic environments are of concern. In this study, high-melting-point metal oxides were multi-step rationally screened as protective layers for RuO 2 to identify their roles in the acidic OER process. Among them, Ta-related oxide was selected as the best candidate. To demonstrate the theoretical predictions, RuO 2 @TaO x with a core-shell structure was deployed, which exhibited low overpotentials of 163 and 232 mV at 10  and 100 mA cm −2 , respectively. In fact, the dense amorphous TaO x layer effectively prevented the dissolution of RuO 2 and optimized the charge transfer through interfacial synergy, significantly improving both the activity and durability of OER. Meanwhile, the operando quick X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Quick-XAS) confirmed that Ru served as the active site during OER, while Ta inhibited the over-oxidation of Ru, correlating with theoretical considerations. This study provides a new paradigm using targeted computational screening to guide the design of advanced catalysts, and serves as a proof-of-concept for the deployment of high-melting-point metal oxides as a protective layer for RuO 2 in the acidic OER.},

  abstract     = {Capture agents that selectively bind to biological targets are indispensable tools in diagnostics, therapeutics, and biomedical research. However, discovering such capture agents, particularly for structurally conserved or challenging targets, remains a challenge. Here, we describe a protein-templated in situ click strategy enabled by a nanoparticle-based DNA-encoded library (nanoDEL) platform. The nanoDEL enables the construction and screening of vastly large, chemically diverse combinatorial libraries with high redundancy, far exceeding the scale and throughput of conventional approaches, such as one-bead-one-compound and solution-phase in situ click methods. Thus, this enables the rapid and efficient identification of high-affinity, high-selectivity ligands in a single selection round, eliminating the need for iterative screening. To demonstrate the utility of this strategy, we performed an in situ click screening of a 27-million-member nanoDEL of azido-functionalized peptoids, in the presence of a weak and promiscuous alkyne-bearing anchor ligand. This yielded bidentate inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, a challenging target due to its highly conserved active site. These inhibitors exhibited nanomolar potency and exceptional selectivity over closely related phosphatases. This work represents a broadly applicable strategy for discovering high-performance capture agents, particularly for selectively targeting closely related protein families or isoforms where achieving selectivity remains a critical challenge.},

HerTAC L 2,5 P showed potent antitumor activity and low systemic toxicity in HER2 + breast cancer animal models. The HerTAC strategy was further extended to other clinically relevant inaccessible membrane and extracellular targets (i.e., V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation [VISTA] and macrophage migration inhibitory factor [MIF]), highlighting its generality and broad applicability.

Herein, we report the synthesis of three pairs of enantiopure, redox-active, conjugated macrocycles, termed corral[ n ]bicarbazole, employing axially chiral 4,4′-bicarbazole units.

  abstract     = {The selective modification of carbohydrates to achieve structural complexity has emerged as a crucial strategy in carbohydrate-based drug development. However, the intricate stereochemistry and densely packed functional groups of carbohydrates pose significant challenges for precise stereoselectivity and regioselectivity control. Herein, we report a palladium-catalyzed, stereospecific, and ligand-controlled regiodivergent glycosyl Suzuki–Miyaura coupling of 3-boryl-glycals, establishing a robust platform for glycoside diversification with versatile C1 and C3 modification. Notably, stable 3-boryl-glycals with 1,1,2,2-tetraethylethylene glycol protection were first synthesized and fully characterized. Operating under mild conditions, this reaction enables the efficient synthesis of diverse 2,3-unsaturated aryl/alkenyl C -glycosides with exceptional regio- and stereoselectivity. Importantly, this ligand-controlled regiodivergent C -glycosylation offers a concise and efficient strategy for accessing 3- C -glycals (C3-arylated/alkenylated glycals), circumventing time-consuming and labor-intensive multi-step sequences. To elucidate the origins of regioselectivity control, we employ a data-driven approach integrating DFT-assisted multivariate regression analysis, identifying key ligand parameters that govern regioselectivity. Leveraging this predictive model, we pursued rational ligand design to enhance C3-glycosylation selectivity and yield. Additionally, density functional theory calculations (DFT) provide critical insights into the fundamental principles dictating regioselectivity and tunability. These findings establish a solid foundation for advancing ligand-controlled regiodivergent glycosylation reactions and significantly expand the synthetic toolkit for glycochemical synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Charge transport and nonradiative recombination loss at the buried interface are important factors, which limit the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we screen a series of diphosphate Lewis-base molecules, where N,N-bis(diphenylphosphino)amine (N-DPPM) with appropriate alkyl chains and multiple active sites not only can efficiently facilitate carrier transport but also coordinate with undercoordinated Pb 2+ and interact with FA + through N⋯H bond. These features prompt the formation of high-quality perovskite films along (100)/(200) crystal facets. Interestingly, these oriented low-Miller-index crystal facets have approximately a twice-increase in heterointerface energy and twice-decrease in grain-boundary energy, flattening grain-boundary grooves, thereby reducing nanoscale physical voids and releasing residual stress. Consequently, the champion inverted PSCs exhibit impressive power conversion efficiencies of 26.80%, 26.18%, and 20.59% for narrow-bandgap (1.55 eV), large-area (0.5 cm 2 ), and wide-bandgap (1.73 eV) devices, respectively. Meanwhile, the unencapsulated devices exhibit excellent stability after long-term storage, thermal-aging, or light-soaking.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) mesoporous metal oxide crystals that integrate atomic-level single crystallinity with ordered mesoporosity represent a promising but rarely realized class of materials, particularly in multicomponent systems. Here, we report a universal strategy for synthesizing freestanding 2D mesoporous spinel supracrystals with tunable compositions, spanning from unary to multinary spinel oxide systems. This approach decouples crystalline framework formation from mesopore generation, combining emulsion-mediated, on-surface crystallization of 2D nanocrystal superlattices with thermally-induced collective nanocrystal reorientation and facet-selective epitaxial fusion. Concurrent surface reconstruction exposes {110} facets along nanocrystal edges, which define the internal surfaces of vertically aligned mesopores. As a proof of concept, 2D mesoporous FeMnCoO supracrystals are employed as functional interlayers in lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. These interlayers demonstrate strong polysulfide adsorption, accelerated redox kinetics, and enhanced Li + ion transport, enabled by their multimetal-induced electronic modulation, facet-specific catalytic activity, and 2D mesoporous architecture. As a result, Li–S cells equipped with FeMnCoO-modified separators deliver exceptional electrochemical performance, even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions. This work addresses a longstanding challenge in reconciling ordered mesoporosity with crystallographic coherence in mesoporous materials, establishing a molecularly modular approach for synthesizing 2D mesoporous spinel crystals with programmable compositions and facet-engineered functionality.},

  abstract     = {The pronounced efficiency disparity between ambient-air-fabricated organic solar cells (OSCs) and nitrogen-glovebox-processed devices poses a major obstacle to industrial-scale manufacturing. The instability of the organic electron transport layer (ETL) materials in air undoubtedly affects the carrier transport properties, which significantly reduces the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices. Here, based on the antioxidant strategy, the stability of PDINN in air is enhanced by doping PDINN with the antioxidant C 60 -OH, thereby successfully achieving the all-air preparation of OSCs. Eventually, the PCE of the air-prepared green OSCs based on PM6:BTP-eC9 and PM6:PTQ10:BTP-eC9 (o-xylene) achieves 19.35% and 20.22%, respectively, after being optimized by the antioxidant strategy. Moreover, C 60 -OH remarkably improves the operational stability of the device in air with a T 80 lifetime of over 1060 h, which is higher than that of undoped device (416 h). Furthermore, the PCE of large-area (25 cm 2 ) modules based on PDINN:C 60 -OH attains 16.47%. This study highlights the potential of the antioxidant strategy to fabricate high-efficiency and stable organic photovoltaics in air, significantly promoting the development of OSCs.},

Precise modulation of the hydrophobic characteristics of PCC linkers enables fine-tuning of π-stacking strength, thereby controlling the length of the nanotubes, ranging from the nano- to micro-scale. With exceptionally high drug-loading efficiencies (43.9% to 52.3%) and stimulus-responsive release properties, the optimized PCC nanotubes exhibit tumor-selective cytotoxicity of 20- to 50-fold greater potency against tumor cells compared to normal cells. Furthermore, PCC nanotubes of intermediate length (0.3–0.5 µm) display prolonged circulation times than conventional liposomes, resulting in enhanced tumor-targeting and therapeutic efficacy.},

To date, the scarce reported YTHDF1 inhibitors suffer from poor selectivity and limited potency, primarily due to the high homology of the YTH domain within the YTHDF family, which poses significant challenges for the discovery of subtype-selective inhibitors. Here, we report SKLB-Y13 , the first small-molecule inhibitor achieving exclusive targeting of the YTHDF1 m 6 A-binding pocket (IC 50 = 0.76 µM), via structural optimization of a novel 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[2,3- c ]pyridine scaffold. Uniquely, SKLB-Y13 interacts with YTHDF1-specific residues Tyr397 and Trp470, as confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis, and demonstrates improved selectivity for YTHDF1 over YTH family proteins. Cellular and in vivo studies reveal that SKLB-Y13 disrupts YTHDF1- PRPF6 mRNA interaction in an m 6 A-dependent manner, thereby impairing the translation of PRPF6 and inhibiting BC proliferation while promoting apoptosis. Chemical proteomics profiling confirms its good target specificity, while pharmacokinetic analysis shows favorable in vivo properties. This study introduces the first selective YTHDF1 inhibitor, serving as a novel chemical probe to elucidate m 6 A-dependent oncogenesis and a promising starting point for developing precision therapies against YTHDF1-overexpressing BC.},

  abstract     = {Lithium metal chlorides are promising superionic conductors for all-solid-state batteries (SSBs) due to their favorable mechanical properties, high ionic conductivity, and good oxidative stability (up to >4.2 V versus Li/Li + ). Nonetheless, chloride solid electrolytes (SEs) still undergo electrochemical degradation when paired with high-voltage cathodes such as LiNi 0.85 Co 0.1 Mn 0.05 O 2 . A viable strategy to enhance the intrinsic electrochemical stability of chloride electrolytes is to partially substitute Cl with F. By leveraging complementary insights from neutron and X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), and electrochemical studies, we investigate the interplay between ionic and electronic conductivity, voltage stability, and overall battery performance of a family of new dual-halogen SEs—Li 2 HfCl 6−x F x . All-solid-state cells utilizing Li 2 HfCl 5.5 F 0.5 as the electrolyte demonstrate much-enhanced battery performance compared to Li 2 HfCl 6 . This improvement is mainly attributed to the formation of a kinetically stable LiF-rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), which inhibits detrimental reactions between the cathode and the SE, as revealed by ToF-SIMS studies. The findings from this study are applicable to other dual-halogen solid ionic conductors, offering valuable insights into the relationship between intrinsic electrochemical window (IEW), electronic and ionic conductivity, and battery performance in dual-halogen solid-state electrolytes.},

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was proposed to measure neuromelanin in the substantia nigra or locus coeruleus , potentially providing a marker of Parkinson's disease. Here, synthetic neuromelanin analogues were prepared with iron and copper and used for characterization of metal binding and impact on proton relaxation, a prerequisite for optimizing neuromelanin-sensitive MRI. The results confirm the presence of paramagnetic mononuclear Fe(III) and antiferromagnetically coupled clusters, which enhance relaxation to variable degrees. Further complexity arises from Cu(II), which can compete for binding to mononuclear sites, aggregate in mixed-metal clusters, or bind to proteins associated with the melanin moiety. Unlike the strong relaxant Fe(III), Cu(II) only indirectly impacts relaxation by replacing iron. Overall, MRI primarily provides measures of average neuromelanin concentrations. Information on the distribution of neuromelanins with different metal compositions might be obtained with multiparametric MRI.},

Herein, we report Ca-doped Cu 2 O co-modified by oxalate (Ca─Cu 2 O─OA) as a novel and high-performance NitRR electrocatalyst. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the Ca dopant with strong hydration effect facilitates the hydrogenation steps of adsorbed NO 3 − on the adjacent Cu active sites. The hydrogen-bonding interaction between OA and adsorbed NH 3 promotes the product desorption. Together with the strong NO 3 − adsorption capability and inhibited hydrogen evolution as a side reaction, excellent NitRR performance with a high Faraday efficiency (FE) of 97.49% and a high NH 3 yield of 15.02 mg h −1 cm −2 is achieved in neutral condition, outperforming most reported electrocatalysts.

The protocol can be readily extended to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and deuterated analogues with excellent yields and deuterium rates. Moreover, the amine products are easily separated by extraction, and the recovered aqueous phase could be directly used and recycled.

For expanding the applicability of virus-based materials, spatiotemporally controlled immobilization and dispersion of viruses with retained activity should be useful, though control of the dynamic nature of viruses hybridized with commonly used polymers has been difficult due to their strong interactions. Here, we report a self-assembling peptide (A2Az) enabling photo control of adhesion and dispersion of M13 bacteriophage virus (M13 phage) and successfully demonstrate patterning of localization and infection of the virus. A2Az is a cationic peptide with amphiphilicity that consists of eight amino acid residues containing a photo-responsive azobenzene group at the second position and self-assembles into a helical supramolecular fiber to form a hydrogel. The helical fibrillar morphology of A2Az exhibits strong interaction with M13 phage, allowing for immobilization not only on a two-dimensional surface but also in a three-dimensional hydrogel with suppression of infectivity. The A2Az fiber undergoes a light-triggered fiber-to-particle transition and releases the immobilized M13 phage with retained infectivity for the photo-controlled patterning of localization and infection. This approach has potential applicability to various virus-based biomaterials, such as structural materials and materials for photo-selective gene transfection to cells.},

  abstract     = {Efficient capture and recovery of sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) from SF 6 /N 2 mixtures is critical for mitigating greenhouse effects and promoting gas recycling in the electronics industry. Herein, we report a novel ultra-microporous three-dimensional covalent organic framework (COF), termed CPOF-12, enriched with tert -butyl groups. CPOF-12 exhibits a Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) surface area of 1,140 m 2 g −1 , a pore volume of 0.66 cm 3 g −1 , and a uniform pore size of 0.59 nm, which closely matches the kinetic diameter of SF 6 (0.52 nm). Gas adsorption measurements reveal a high SF 6 uptake of 2.20 mmol g −1 at 298 K and 1 bar, along with an exceptional SF 6 /N 2 selectivity of 149.4, calculated using ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). This study highlights the effectiveness of pore surface engineering in COFs for high-performance separation of greenhouse gases.},

  abstract     = {Lophine, the first chemiluminescent compound discovered in history, has rarely been applied for in vivo imaging since its discovery in 1877. In this report, we demonstrate that lophine's chemiluminescence emission could be significantly enhanced by caging the imidazole moiety via molecular afterglow mechanism. Notably, our study revealed a rare superoxide anion-mediated luminescence. Our novel probes JIMI-11 and JIMI-12 could be used for in vivo mouse imaging. Compared to its uncaged form JIMI-6, JIMI-11 exhibited a significant enhancement (126-fold) in vitro and a 190-fold higher emission signal in vivo. JIMI-11 selectively accumulates in white adipose tissues (WAT) and can be used to monitor changes in WAT mass in a mouse model of type-1 diabetes. Additionally, it can assess the therapeutic effects of Semaglutide in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Lastly, we designed JIMI-12 with a reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) responsive moiety as the caging group and demonstrated its utility for in vivo imaging of ROS in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory mouse model. Our studies suggest that re-designing lophine-based probes could unlock their potential for both in vitro and in vivo applications. The ability to switch from chemiluminescence to molecular afterglow introduces a novel approach to designing imaging probes.},

Although super-resolution microscopy enables the imaging of cellular forces in the lateral dimension with sub-10-nm resolution, achieving comparable resolution along the axial dimension remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce metal-induced energy transfer (MIET)-based tension probe microscopy (MIET-TPM), a technique for mapping cellular mechanical forces with nanometer precision in the axial direction. This approach combines the nanometer spatial resolution of MIET imaging with the piconewton sensitivity of DNA-hairpin-based molecular tension probes (MTPs), enabling the simultaneous observation of both the plasma membrane and force-exerting molecules in the axial dimension. Using MIET-TPM, we mapped axial integrin tension within focal adhesions and podosomes, alongside their corresponding plasma membrane height profiles, offering detailed insights into the nanoscale structures and mechanisms involved in force transmission. Notably, MIET-TPM can be implemented on any fluorescence microscopy setup without hardware modifications, making it a versatile and accessible tool that promises to become an integral part of future cellular mechanobiology analysis.},

Despite the recent advances in photoelectrode optimization for the practical application, the corresponding interfacial reaction mechanism has not been elucidated owing to a lack of suitable measurements at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, the key factor for an interfacial reaction in a model system (WO 3 photoanode coated with amorphous TiO 2 overlayers) is elucidated using operando spectroelectrochemistry. The thin TiO 2 overlayers are shown to enhance n-type semiconductor characteristics and heal the excessive oxygen vacancies on the WO 3 photoanode surface, which suggests reduced bulk and surface charge carrier recombination and 1.5-fold increase in Faradaic efficiency. Operando transient absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal that the overlayers accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the electrode to the external circuit and increase the population of trapped holes by promoting band bending, which reveals that the kinetic connection between ultrafast phenomena and real water oxidation reaction. Thus, our work elucidates band bending in the space-charge region as a key factor and provides a major strategy for designing surface-modified PEC devices.},

However, addressing both measurement error and misclassification simultaneously in a single analysis is challenged and less actively studied, especially in regression model for survival data with censoring. The approximate maximum likelihood estimation (AMLE) has been proved to be an effective method to correct both measurement error and misclassification simultaneously in a logistic regression model. However, its impact on survival analysis models has not been studied. In this paper, we study biases caused by both measurement error and misclassification in covariates from a Weibull accelerated failure time model, and explore the use of AMLE and its asymptotic properties to correct these biases. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the resulting estimator. The proposed method is then applied to deal with measurement error and misclassification in some nutrients of interest from the EPIC-InterAct Study.},

  abstract     = {Decreasing costs and new technologies have led to an increase in the amount of data available to plant breeding programs. High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) platforms routinely generate high-dimensional datasets of secondary features that may be used to improve genomic prediction accuracy. However, integration of these data comes with challenges such as multicollinearity, parameter estimation in settings, and the computational complexity of many standard approaches. Several methods have emerged to analyze such data, but interpretation of model parameters often remains challenging. We propose genetic latent factor best linear unbiased prediction (glfBLUP), a prediction pipeline that reduces the dimensionality of the original secondary HTP data using generative factor analysis. In short, glfBLUP uses redundancy filtered and regularized genetic and residual correlation matrices to fit a maximum likelihood factor model and estimate genetic latent factor scores. These latent factors are subsequently used in multitrait genomic prediction. Our approach performs better than alternatives in extensive simulations and a real-world application, while producing easily interpretable and biologically relevant parameters. We discuss several possible extensions and highlight glfBLUP as the basis for a flexible and modular multitrait genomic prediction framework.},

  abstract     = {Upholding data privacy, especially in medical research, has become tantamount to facing difficulties in accessing individual-level patient data. Estimating mixed effects binary logistic regression models involving data from multiple data providers, like hospitals, thus becomes more challenging. Federated learning has emerged as an option to preserve the privacy of individual observations while still estimating a global model that can be interpreted on the individual level, but it usually involves iterative communication between the data providers and the data analyst. In this paper, we present a strategy to estimate a mixed effects binary logistic regression model that requires data providers to share summary statistics only once. It involves generating pseudo-data whose summary statistics match those of the actual data and using these in the model estimation process instead of the actual unavailable data. Our strategy is able to include multiple predictors, which can be a combination of continuous and categorical variables. Through simulation, we show that our approach estimates the true model at least as good as the one that requires the pooled individual observations. An illustrative example using real data is provided. Unlike typical federated learning algorithms, our approach eliminates infrastructure requirements and security issues while being communication efficient and while accounting for heterogeneity.},

In this paper, we introduce a new model that incorporates subject-specific and serially correlated time-specific distribution-free random effects on the unit interval into logistic regression multiplicatively with fixed effects. This new multiplicative model facilitates the interpretation of random effects on the unit interval as risk modifiers. This multiplicative model setup also eases the model derivation and random effects prediction. A quasi-likelihood approach has been developed in the estimation of our model.

The existing online literature mainly considered large-scale studies and constructed powerful but rigid algorithms for these. However, smaller studies, such as platform trials, require high flexibility and easy interpretability to take study objectives into account and facilitate the communication. Another challenge in platform trials is that due to the shared control arm some of the -values are dependent and significance levels need to be prespecified before the decisions for all the past treatments are available. We propose adaptive-discarding-Graphs (ADDIS-Graphs) with FWER control that due to their graphical structure perfectly adapt to such settings and provably uniformly improve the state-of-the-art method.

  abstract     = {Accelerated failure time (AFT) models offer an attractive alternative to Cox proportional hazards models. AFT models are collapsible and, unlike hazard ratios in proportional hazards models, the acceleration factor—a key effect measure in AFT models—is collapsible, meaning its value remains unchanged when adjusting for additional covariates. In addition, AFT models provide an intuitive interpretation directly on the survival time scale. From the recent development of smooth parametric AFT models, we identify potential issues with their applications and note several desired extensions that have not yet been implemented. To enrich this tool and its application in clinical research, we improve the AFT models within a flexible parametric framework in several ways: we adopt monotone natural splines to constrain the log cumulative hazard to be a monotonic function across its support; allow for time-varying acceleration factors, possibly include cure and accommodating more than one time-varying effect; and implement both mixture and nonmixture cure models. We implement all of these extensions in the rstpm2 package, which is publicly available on CRAN. Simulations highlight a varying success in estimating cure fractions. However, in terms of covariate-effect estimation, flexible AFT models appear to be more robust than the Cox model even when there is a high proportion of cured individuals in the data, regardless of whether cure is reached within the observed data.

  abstract     = {Phase I dose escalation trials in oncology generally aim to find the maximum tolerated dose. However, with the advent of molecular-targeted therapies and antibody drug conjugates, dose-limiting toxicities are less frequently observed, giving rise to the concept of optimal biological dose (OBD), which considers both efficacy and toxicity. The estimand framework presented in the addendum of the ICH E9(R1) guidelines strengthens the dialogue between different stakeholders by bringing in greater clarity in the clinical trial objectives and by providing alignment between the targeted estimand under consideration and the statistical analysis methods. However, there is a lack of clarity in implementing this framework in early-phase dose optimization studies. This paper aims to discuss the estimand framework for dose optimization trials in oncology, considering efficacy and toxicity through utility functions. Such trials should include pharmacokinetics data, toxicity data, and efficacy data. Based on these data, the analysis methods used to identify the optimized dose/s are also described. Focusing on optimizing the utility function to estimate the OBD, the population-level summary measure should reflect only the properties used for estimating this utility function. A detailed strategy recommendation for intercurrent events has been provided using a real-life oncology case study. Key recommendations regarding the estimand attributes include that in a seamless phase I/II dose optimization trial, the treatment attribute should start when the subject receives the first dose. We argue that such a framework brings in additional clarity to dose optimization trial objectives and strengthens the understanding of the drug under consideration, which would enable the correct dose to move to phase II of clinical development.},

The models are robust and asymptotically distribution-free for testing the causal null hypothesis. In this research, we investigate methods for estimating the partially linear models with data missing at random in all the variables, including the response, the treatment, and the confounding variables. We develop a general estimation method for inference in partially linear models with nonmonotone missing at random data. It proposes using partially linear working models to improve the estimation efficiency of the standard complete case method. It can be shown that the new estimator is consistent, which does not depend on the correctness of the working models. In addition, we recommend bootstrap estimates for the asymptotic variances and semiparametric models for the missing data probabilities. It is computationally simple and can be directly implemented in standard software. Simulation studies are provided to examine its performance. A real data example with sparsely observed missingness patterns is used to illustrate the method.},

Recent works have shown that taking advantage of relatedness between these subtasks can be beneficial. This paper proposes a unified neural framework to address these subtasks simultaneously. Apart from the sequence tagging paradigm, the proposed method tackles the multitask lexical analysis via two-stage sequence span classification. Firstly, the model detects the word and named entity boundaries by multi-label classification over character spans in a sentence. Then, the authors assign POS labels and entity labels for words and named entities by multi-class classification, respectively. Furthermore, a Gated Task Transformation (GTT) is proposed to encourage the model to share valuable features between tasks. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated on Chinese and Thai public datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear transforms have significantly advanced learned image compression (LIC), particularly using residual blocks. This transform enhances the nonlinear expression ability and obtain compact feature representation by enlarging the receptive field, which indicates how the convolution process extracts features in a high dimensional feature space. However, its functionality is restricted to the spatial dimension and network depth, limiting further improvements in network performance due to insufficient information interaction and representation. Crucially, the potential of high dimensional feature space in the channel dimension and the exploration of network width/resolution remain largely untapped. In this paper, we consider nonlinear transforms from the perspective of feature space, defining high-dimensional feature spaces in different dimensions and investigating the specific effects. Firstly, we introduce the dimension increasing and decreasing transforms in both channel and spatial dimensions to obtain high dimensional feature space and achieve better feature extraction. Secondly, we design a channel-spatial fusion residual transform (CSR), which incorporates multi-dimensional transforms for a more effective representation. Furthermore, we simplify the proposed fusion transform to obtain a slim architecture (CSR-sm), balancing network complexity and compression performance. Finally, we build the overall network with stacked CSR transforms to achieve better compression and reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion performance compared to the existing LIC methods and traditional codecs. Specifically, our proposed method achieves 9.38% BD-rate reduction over VVC on Kodak dataset.},

The energy consumption model and the simulation model have been implemented for the efficient selection of VM. The proposed model CSOA-VM not only lessens the violations at the service level agreement (SLA) level but also minimises the VM migrations. The proposed model also saves energy and the performance analysis shows that energy consumption obtained is 1.35 kWh, SLA violation is 9.2 and VM migration is about 268. Thus, there is an improvement in energy consumption of about 1.8% and a 2.1% improvement (reduction) in violations of SLA in comparison to existing techniques.},

However, physiological recordings often exhibit irregular and unordered patterns, posing a significant challenge in conceptualising them as matrices. As a result, GNNs which comprise interactive nodes connected by edges whose weights are defined by anatomical junctions or temporal relationships have received a lot of consideration by leveraging implicit data that exists in a biological system. Additionally, our study incorporates a structural GNN to effectively differentiate between different degrees of infection in both the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Subsequently, demographic data are included, and a multi-task learning architecture is devised, integrating classification and regression tasks. The trials used an authentic dataset, including 800 brain x-ray pictures, consisting of 560 instances classified as moderate cases and 240 instances classified as severe cases. Based on empirical evidence, our methodology demonstrates superior performance in classification, surpassing other comparison methods with a notable achievement of 92.27% in terms of area under the curve as well as a correlation coefficient of 0.62.},

In order to tackle these challenges, the present study incorporates a range of optimization components into the Bat algorithm, thereby proposing a variant called PKEBA. A projection screening strategy is implemented to mitigate its sensitivity to initial solutions, thereby enhancing the quality of the initial solution set. A kinetic adaptation strategy reforms exploration patterns, while an elite communication strategy enhances group interaction, to avoid algorithm from local optima. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the proposed PKEBA is rigorously evaluated. Testing encompasses 30 benchmark functions from IEEE CEC2014, featuring ablation experiments and comparative assessments against classical algorithms and their variants. Moreover, real-world engineering problems are employed as further validation. The results conclusively demonstrate that PKEBA exhibits superior convergence and precision compared to existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Tibetan medical named entity recognition (Tibetan MNER) involves extracting specific types of medical entities from unstructured Tibetan medical texts. Tibetan MNER provide important data support for the work related to Tibetan medicine. However, existing Tibetan MNER methods often struggle to comprehensively capture multi-level semantic information, failing to sufficiently extract multi-granularity features and effectively filter out irrelevant information, which ultimately impacts the accuracy of entity recognition. This paper proposes an improved embedding representation method called syllable–word–sentence embedding. By leveraging features at different granularities and using un-scaled dot-product attention to focus on key features for feature fusion, the syllable–word–sentence embedding is integrated into the transformer, enhancing the specificity and diversity of feature representations. The model leverages multi-level and multi-granularity semantic information, thereby improving the performance of Tibetan MNER. We evaluate our proposed model on datasets from various domains. The results indicate that the model effectively identified three types of entities in the Tibetan news dataset we constructed, achieving an F1 score of 93.59%, which represents an improvement of 1.24% compared to the vanilla FLAT. Additionally, results from the Tibetan medical dataset we developed show that it is effective in identifying five kinds of medical entities, with an F1 score of 71.39%, which is a 1.34% improvement over the vanilla FLAT.},

Traditional PID controller optimisation methods often struggle to handle nonlinearities and meet robustness requirements across diverse operational scenarios. This paper introduces an enhanced strategy using a multi-objective optimisation framework and a modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (SNSGA). The proposed model optimises the PID controller by minimising key performance metrics: integration time squared error (ITSE), integration time absolute error (ITAE), and rate of change of deviation (J). This approach balances convergence rate, overshoot, and oscillation dynamics effectively. A fuzzy-based method is employed to select the most suitable solution from the Pareto set. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the SNSGA-based approach offers superior tuning capabilities over traditional NSGA-II and other advanced control methods. In a two-area thermal power system without reheat, the SNSGA significantly reduces settling times for frequency deviations: 2.94s for and 4.98s for , marking improvements of 31.6% and 13.4% over NSGA-II, respectively.},

In this paper an age prediction approach to work out multivariate regression problems using DNA methylation data is developed. In this research study a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model optimised by the genetic algorithm (GA) is addressed. This paper contributes to enhancing age prediction as a regression problem using a union of two CNNs and exchanging knowledge between them. This specifically re-starts the training process from a possibly higher-quality point in different iterations and, consequently, causes potentially yeilds better results at each iteration. The method proposed, which is called cooperative deep neural network (Co-DeepNet), is tested on two types of age prediction problems. Sixteen datasets containing 1899 healthy blood samples and nine datasets containing 2395 diseased blood samples are employed to examine the method's efficiency. As a result, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) is 1.49 and 3.61 years for training and testing data, respectively, when the healthy data is tested. The diseased blood data show MAD results of 3.81 and 5.43 years for training and testing data, respectively. The results of the Co-DeepNet are compared with six other methods proposed in previous studies and a single CNN using four prediction accuracy measurements ( R 2 , MAD, MSE and RMSE).

  abstract     = {Neural machine translation (NMT) has advanced with deep learning and large-scale multilingual models, yet translating low-resource languages often lacks sufficient training data and leads to hallucinations. This often results in translated content that diverges significantly from the source text. This research proposes a refined Contrastive Decoding (CD) algorithm that dynamically adjusts weights of log probabilities from strong expert and weak amateur models to mitigate hallucinations in low-resource NMT and improve translation quality. Advanced large language NMT models, including ChatGLM and LLaMA, are fine-tuned and implemented for their superior contextual understanding and cross-lingual capabilities. The refined CD algorithm evaluates multiple candidate translations using BLEU score, semantic similarity, and Named Entity Recognition accuracy. Extensive experimental results show substantial improvements in translation quality and a significant reduction in hallucination rates. Fine-tuned models achieve higher evaluation metrics compared to baseline models and state-of-the-art models. An ablation study confirms the contributions of each methodological component and highlights the effectiveness of the refined CD algorithm and advanced models in mitigating hallucinations. Notably, the refined methodology increased the BLEU score by approximately 30% compared to baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Cross-domain graph anomaly detection (CD-GAD) is a promising task that leverages knowledge from a labelled source graph to guide anomaly detection on an unlabelled target graph. CD-GAD classifies anomalies as unique or common based on their presence in both the source and target graphs. However, existing models often fail to fully explore domain-unique knowledge of the target graph for detecting unique anomalies. Additionally, they tend to focus solely on node-level differences, overlooking structural-level differences that provide complementary information for common anomaly detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, Synthetic Graph Anomaly Detection via Graph Transfer and Graph Decouple (GTGD), which effectively detects common and unique anomalies in the target graph. Specifically, our approach ensures deeper learning of domain-unique knowledge by decoupling the reconstruction graphs of common and unique features. Moreover, we simultaneously consider node-level and structural-level differences by transferring node and edge information from the source graph to the target graph, enabling comprehensive domain-common knowledge representation. Anomalies are detected using both common and unique features, with their synthetic score serving as the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving an average performance by 12.6 on the AUC-PR compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Selecting appropriate tourist attractions to visit in real time is an important problem for travellers. Since recommenders proactively suggest items based on user preference, they are a promising solution for this problem. Travellers visit tourist attractions sequentially by considering multiple attributes at the same time. Therefore, it is desirable to consider this when developing recommenders for tourist attractions. Using GRU4REC, we proposed RNN-based sequence-aware recommenders (RNN-SARs) that use multiple sequence datasets for training the recommended model, named multi-RNN-SARs. We proposed two types of multi-RNN-SARs—concatenate-RNN-SARs and parallel-RNN-SARs. In order to evaluate multi-RNN-SARs, we compared hit rate (HR) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of the item-based collaborative filtering recommender (item-CFR), RNN-SAR with the single-sequence dataset (basic-RNN-SAR), multi-RNN-SARs and the state-of-the-art SARs using a real-world travel dataset. Our research shows that multi-RNN-SARs have significantly higher performances compared to item-CFR. Not all multi-RNN-SARs outperform basic-RNN-SAR but the best multi-RNN-SAR achieves comparable performance to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms. These results highlight the importance of using multiple sequence datasets in RNN-SARs and the importance of choosing appropriate sequence datasets and learning methods for implementing multi-RNN-SARs in practice.},

  abstract     = {Urban traffic prediction with high precision is always the unremitting pursuit of intelligent transportation systems and is instrumental in bringing smart cities into reality. The fundamental challenges for traffic prediction lie in the accurate modelling of spatial and temporal traffic dynamics. Existing approaches mainly focus on modelling the traffic data itself, but do not explore the traffic correlations implicit in origin-destination (OD) data. In this paper, we propose STOD-Net, a dynamic spatial-temporal OD feature-enhanced deep network, to simultaneously predict the in-traffic and out-traffic for each and every region of a city. We model the OD data as dynamic graphs and adopt graph neural networks in STOD-Net to learn a low-dimensional representation for each region. As per the region feature, we design a gating mechanism and operate it on the traffic feature learning to explicitly capture spatial correlations. To further capture the complicated spatial and temporal dependencies among different regions, we propose a novel joint feature, learning block in STOD-Net and transfer the hybrid OD features to each block to make the learning process spatiotemporal-aware. We evaluate the effectiveness of STOD-Net on two benchmark datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art by approximately 5% in terms of prediction accuracy and considerably improves prediction stability up to 80% in terms of standard deviation.},

  abstract     = {Referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to locate a specific region in an image described by a natural language. Existing two-stage methods generate multiple candidate proposals in the first stage, followed by selecting one of these proposals as the grounding result in the second stage. Nevertheless, the number of candidate proposals generated in the first stage significantly exceeds ground truth and the recall of critical objects is inadequate, thereby enormously limiting the overall network performance. To address the above issues, the authors propose an innovative method termed Separate Non-Maximum Suppression (Sep-NMS) for two-stage REC. Particularly, Sep-NMS models information from the two stages independently and collaboratively, ultimately achieving an overall improvement in comprehension and identification of the target objects. Specifically, the authors propose a Ref-Relatedness module for filtering referent proposals rigorously, decreasing the redundancy of referent proposals. A Relatedness module based on robust multimodal pre-trained encoders is built to precisely assess the relevance between language and proposals to improve the recall of critical objects. It is worth mentioning that the authors are the pioneers in utilising a multimodal pre-training model for proposal filtering in the first stage. Moreover, an Information Fusion module is designed to effectively amalgamate the multimodal information across two stages, ensuring maximum utilisation of the available information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the approach achieves competitive performance with previous state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Although the image dehazing problem has received considerable attention over recent years, the existing models often prioritise performance at the expense of complexity, making them unsuitable for real-world applications, which require algorithms to be deployed on resource constrained-devices. To address this challenge, we propose WaveLiteDehaze-Network (WLD-Net), an end-to-end dehazing model that delivers performance comparable to complex models while operating in real time and using significantly fewer parameters. This approach capitalises on the insight that haze predominantly affects low-frequency information. By exclusively processing the image in the frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), we segregate the image into high and low frequencies and process them separately. This allows us to preserve high-frequency details and recover low-frequency components affected by haze, distinguishing our method from existing approaches that use spatial domain processing as the backbone, with DWT serving as an auxiliary component. DWT is applied at multiple levels for better information retention while also accelerating computation by downsampling feature maps. Subsequently, a learning-based fusion mechanism reintegrates the processed frequencies to reconstruct the dehazed image. Experiments show that WLD-Net outperforms other low-parameter models on real-world hazy images and rivals much larger models, achieving the highest PSNR and SSIM scores on the O-Haze dataset. Qualitatively, the proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in handling a diverse range of haze types, delivering visually pleasing results and robust performance, while also generalising well across different scenarios. With only 0.385 million parameters (more than 100 times smaller than comparable dehazing methods), WLD-Net processes 1024 × 1024 images in just 0.045 s, highlighting its applicability across various real-world scenarios.

  abstract     = {Early exiting has shown significant potential in accelerating the inference of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by allowing easy samples to exit from shallow layers. However, existing early exiting methods primarily rely on local information from individual samples to estimate prediction uncertainty for making exiting decisions, overlooking the global information provided by the sample population. This impacts the estimation of prediction uncertainty, compromising the reliability of exiting decisions. To remedy this, inspired by principal component analysis (PCA), the authors define a residual score to capture the deviation of features from the principal space of the sample population, providing a global perspective for estimating prediction uncertainty. Building on this, a two-stage exiting strategy is proposed that integrates global information from residual scores with local information from energy scores at both the decision and feature levels. This strategy incorporates three-way decisions to enable more reliable exiting decisions for boundary region samples by delaying judgement. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark validate that the method achieves an average speed-up ratio of 2.17× across all tasks with minimal performance degradation. Additionally, it surpasses the state-of-the-art E-LANG by in model acceleration, along with a performance improvement of 0.6 points, demonstrating a better performance-efficiency trade-off.},

Numerous methods use a partial-to-complete framework, directly predicting missing components via global characteristics extracted from incomplete inputs. However, this makes detail recovery challenging, as global characteristics fail to provide complete missing component specifics. A new point cloud completion method named Point-PC is proposed. A memory network and a causal inference model are separately designed to introduce shape priors and select absent shape information as supplementary geometric factors for aiding completion. Concretely, a memory mechanism is proposed to store complete shape features and their associated shapes in a key-value format. The authors design a pre-training strategy that uses contrastive learning to map incomplete shape features into the complete shape feature domain, enabling retrieval of analogous shapes from incomplete inputs. In addition, the authors employ backdoor adjustment to eliminate confounders, which are shape prior components sharing identical semantic structures with incomplete inputs. Experiments conducted on three datasets show that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Analysing patient data within clinical settings reveals a pronounced focus on refining diagnostic accuracy, personalising treatment plans, and optimising resource allocation to enhance clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, this domain faces unique challenges, such as irregular data collection, inconsistent data quality, and patient-specific structural variations. This paper proposed a novel hybrid approach that integrates heuristic and stochastic methods for anomaly detection in patient clinical data to address these challenges. The strategy combines HPO-based optimal Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise for clustering patient exercise data, facilitating efficient anomaly identification. Subsequently, a stochastic method based on the Interquartile Range filters unreliable data points, ensuring that medical tools and professionals receive only the most pertinent and accurate information. The primary objective of this study is to equip healthcare professionals and researchers with a robust tool for managing extensive, high-dimensional clinical datasets, enabling effective isolation and removal of aberrant data points. Furthermore, a sophisticated regression model has been developed using Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to assess the impact of the ensemble abnormal pattern detection approach. Various statistical error estimation techniques validate the efficacy of the hybrid approach alongside AutoML. Experimental results show that implementing this innovative hybrid model on patient rehabilitation data leads to a notable enhancement in AutoML performance, with an average improvement of 0.041 in the score, surpassing the effectiveness of traditional regression models.},

In this context, this paper proposes a right decoupled composite manifold for visual-inertial sliding-window iterative optimization compared with other manifolds including chained translation and rotation , special Euclidean group , and extended pose concerning the orientation, position, and velocity estimation. Furthermore, the inertial measurement unit (IMU) dynamics is propagated through extended pose with half rotation to maintain the accuracy of IMU preintegration. Moreover, to enhance robustness, a robustified Cauchy loss function is employed. The proposed method is evaluated with simulation and experiments on static and more challenging dynamic environments, considering its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Additionally, all necessary Jacobians for visual reprojection residuals and IMU preintegration residuals are provided in analytical form with numerical verification.},

  abstract     = {There is a growing need for accurate and swift diagnostic tools for lung disease diagnosis in healthcare. This work presents a Stacking Ensemble-based Deep Learning Framework for Enhanced Lung Disease Diagnosis (SEDLF-LDD). The stacking is a widely used ensemble learning technique that enhances the model's performance by combining the predictions from multiple base-learners using a meta-learner. The proposed framework selects the five best-performing pre-trained models, namely, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, VGG16, VGG19, and DenseNet201, as the base-learners and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) as a meta-learner. To ensure broader applicability, we curated a dataset of chest X-ray images of Lung Disease. Initially, we choose the ten transfer learning models, fine-tune them to extract features relevant to respiratory diseases on the dataset, and select Top-5 best-performing models as base-learners. The effectiveness of the framework is determined by analysis of precision, recall, F1-score, or the area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve. The experimental results show an effective result with 97.65% accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Despite high predictive performance, machine learning models can be unfair towards specific demographic subgroups characterized by sensitive attributes such as gender or race. This paper presents a novel approach using Computational Profile Likelihood (CPL) to assess potential bias in neural network decisions with respect to sensitive attributes. CPL estimates the conditional probability of a network's internal neuron excitation levels during predictions. To assess the impact of sensitive attributes on predictions, the CPL distribution of individuals sharing a particular value of a sensitive attribute and a specific outcome (e.g., “women” and “high income”) is compared to a subgroup sharing another value of the sensitive attribute but with the same outcome (e.g., “men” and “high income”). The resulting disparities between distributions can be used to quantify the bias with respect to the sensitive attribute and the outcome class. We also assess the efficacy of bias reduction techniques through their influence on the resulting disparities. Experimental results on three widely used datasets indicate that the CPL of the trained models can be used to characterize significant differences between multiple protected groups, highlighting that these models display quantifiable biases. Furthermore, after applying bias mitigation methods, the gaps in CPL distributions are reduced, indicating a more similar internal representation for profiles of different protected groups.},

We introduce a taxonomy of embedding techniques, categorizing them based on their theoretical foundations and application contexts. Our work provides a quantitative evaluation of representative methods from each category by assessing their performance on downstream classification tasks across diverse real-world datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that the performance of embedding methods varies significantly depending on the dataset and classification algorithm used, highlighting the importance of careful model selection and extensive experimentation for specific applications. This study contributes to the field by offering a systematic comparison of time series embedding techniques, guiding practitioners in selecting appropriate methods for their specific applications, and providing a foundation for future advancements in time series analysis.

Expanding on this approach, we incorporate sentiment analysis to provide deeper insights into public perceptions and emotions related to fire events.

We propose DeepBispec, the first framework to integrate deep bispectral image analysis with affect dynamics (AD) for speech-based EC recognition. Bispectrum representations capture nonlinear and non-Gaussian speech characteristics, while AD descriptors model temporal emotion fluctuations. Evaluated on K-EmoCon, IEMOCAP and SEWA datasets, DeepBispec consistently improved EC classification performance. For example, on K-EmoCon, arousal accuracy increased from 79.0% (bispectrum only) to 81.4% (with AD), while valence accuracy improved from 76.8% to 77.5%; similar trends were observed for IEMOCAP and SEWA. DeepBispec outperformed strong CNN, LSTM, and Transformer baselines, demonstrating robust cross-lingual performance across seven languages. These findings highlight its potential for real-world applications such as mental health monitoring, affect-aware learning platforms and empathetic dialogue systems.},

However, a critical limitation of FL arises in the presence of Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data, which is common in real-world scenarios. Traditional FL algorithms, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), tend to underperform when faced with data heterogeneity across participating clients. To address this challenge, we propose CalibSNN, a method that combines calibration re-sampling with Soft Nearest Neighbour (SNN) loss to mitigate the bias and variance introduced by uneven data distributions. Calibration aligns local data distributions with global statistics, while SNN loss improves feature representations across heterogeneous clients. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and non-IID conditions, we demonstrate that CalibSNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a robust solution to the challenges of non-IID data in FL.},

  abstract     = {Time-series forecasting is essential for predicting events in the future and for tracking objects. The conventional recurrent neural network model needs to pad the target with zeros when handling long inputs, resulting in a loss in accuracy. Recently, it was proposed to divide a time series input into patches and merge the learned weights. However, such a model is difficult to interpret. In this article, we consider a mixture of continuous and discrete Markov states to model long-range time dependencies. For example, in a vehicle, each gear level can be a discrete state and the throttle input is continuously controlled to maximise the efficiency of the engine. Data collected from the sensor is prone to noise due to component faults or external disturbances. Hence, we apply a stability constraint to select samples for training. We validate our algorithm on three datasets: (1) Apple Watch, (2) Car engine and (3) Election tweets. On all datasets, we achieve an improvement in the range of 5%–20% in the F-measure. Furthermore, the features learned are easy to explain in terms of real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In various fields, including environmental monitoring, communication, surveillance, and disaster response, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly essential. Autonomous multi-UAV wireless networks (MUWNs), where multiple UAVs work together, offer powerful solutions in these fields. However, making these networks fully autonomous is challenging, especially concerning real-time decision-making, coordination, and resource management. In the field of literature, there is a demand for a comprehensive survey of recent developments in Q-learning (QL) and deep Q-learning (DQL) within MUWNs. To address this gap, we provide a thorough evaluation of QL and DQL approaches, focusing on their application in autonomous MUWNs. We highlight their roles in route planning, communication relays, and network optimization, discussing advantages and limitations. The survey also explores key challenges, including scalability, energy efficiency, and real-time adaptability, and reviews how QL/DQL enhancements address them. In particular, this paper provides an overview of some QL and DQL applications in MUWNs, such as data retrieval, monitoring, aggregation, resource allocation, and task scheduling to support wireless connectivity, UAV-assisted autonomous trajectory planning, navigation, security, and jamming avoidance. The use of these technologies enables the effective use of UAVs in smart cities, monitoring of industrial complexes, agricultural surveys, and border security. Additionally, using the knowledge gathered from our review, we identify and discuss several open challenges.},

  abstract     = {Deep Image Prior (DIP) has been recently introduced as a method to exploit the structural priors inherent to neural networks. In the field of image processing, DIP effectively addresses various problems such as denoising, inpainting, image restoration and super-resolution. Unlike supervised neural networks, which require large amounts of labelled data, DIP operates as a single-image method, where prior knowledge is derived directly from the architecture of the neural network. In this work, we focus on the single-image super-resolution problem using DIP. Through extensive experiments for image super-resolution, we show that the original formulation of DIP can be improved by properly modelling fidelity with multiple down-sampling operators. Our experimental results systematically explore combinations of regularisation and fidelity terms across both hyperspectral and natural RGB image datasets, offering new guidelines for developing effective DIP-based approaches.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce Traversal Learning (TL), a novel approach designed to address the problem of decreased quality encountered in popular distributed learning (DL) paradigms such as Federated Learning (FL), Split Learning (SL) and SplitFed Learning (SFL). Traditional FL often suffers an accuracy drop during aggregation due to its averaging function, while SL and SFL face increased loss due to the independent gradient updates on each split network. TL adopts a unique strategy where the model traverses the nodes during forward propagation (FP) and performs backward propagation (BP) at the orchestrator, effectively implementing centralised learning (CL) principles within a distributed environment. The orchestrator is tasked with generating virtual batches and planning the model's sequential node visits during FP, aligning them with the ordered index of the data within these batches. We conducted experiments on six datasets representing diverse characteristics across various domains. Our evaluation demonstrates that TL is on par with classic CL approaches in terms of accurate inference, thereby offering a viable and robust solution for DL tasks. TL outperformed other DL methods and improved accuracy by 7.85% for independent and identically distributed (IID) datasets, macro F1-score by 1.06% for non-IID datasets, accuracy by 2.05% for text classification and AUC by 1.41% and 2.82% for medical and financial datasets, respectively. By effectively preserving data privacy while maintaining performance, TL represents a significant advancement in DL methodologies.},

A key focus of this review is the need for novel datasets that better capture the unique nature of memes, particularly those that blend text and images with cultural and emotional nuances. Existing benchmark datasets often fall short in representing the diversity of meme formats and regional variations, highlighting the necessity for more comprehensive datasets. Looking forward, we anticipate advancements in analytical methodologies and the development of such specialised datasets, which would significantly enhance the accuracy and depth of sentiment analysis models.

However, existing active DA methods often struggle in real-world scenarios where, due to data privacy concerns, only a pre-trained source model is available, rather than the source samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called the structure-based uncertainty estimation model (SUEM) for source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA). To be specific, we introduce an innovative active sample selection strategy that combines both uncertainty and diversity sampling to identify the most informative samples. We assess the uncertainty in target samples using structure-wise probabilities and implement a diversity selection method to minimise redundancy. For the selected samples, we not only apply standard-supervised loss but also conduct interpolation consistency training to further explore the structural information of the target domain. Extensive experiments across four widely used datasets demonstrate that our method is comparable to or outperforms current UDA and active DA methods.},

  abstract     = {Skeleton-based action recognition using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) has achieved remarkable performance, but recognising ambiguous actions, such as ‘waving’ and ‘saluting’, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on a serial combination of GCNs and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), where spatial and temporal features are extracted independently, leading to an unbalanced spatial-temporal information, which hinders accurate action recognition. Moreover, existing methods for ambiguous actions often overemphasise local details, resulting in the loss of crucial global context, which further complicates the task of differentiating ambiguous actions. To address these challenges, the authors propose a lightweight plug-and-play module called Synchronised and Fine-grained Head (SF-Head), inserted between GCN and TCN layers. SF-Head first conducts Synchronised Spatial-Temporal Extraction (SSTE) with a Feature Redundancy Loss (F-RL), ensuring a balanced interaction between the two types of features. It then performs Adaptive Cross-dimensional Feature Aggregation (AC-FA), with a Feature Consistency Loss (F-CL), which aligns the aggregated feature with their original spatial-temporal feature. This aggregation step effectively combines both global context and local details, enhancing the model's ability to classify ambiguous actions. Experimental results on NTU RGB + D 60, NTU RGB + D 120, NW-UCLA and PKU-MMD I datasets demonstrate significant improvements in distinguishing ambiguous actions.

  abstract     = {In the field of oncology, lung cancer is a leading contributor to cancer-related mortality, highlighting the need for early detection of lung nodules for effective intervention. However, accurate segmentation of lung nodules in Computed Tomography (CT) images remains a significant challenge due to issues such as heterogeneous nodule dimensions, low contrast, and their visual similarity with surrounding tissues. To address these challenges, this study proposes the Edge-Enhanced Feature Pyramid SwinUNet (EE-FPS-UNet), an advanced segmentation model that integrates a modified Swin Transformer with a feature pyramid network (FPN). The research objective is to enhance boundary delineation and multi-scale feature aggregation for improved segmentation performance. The proposed model uses the Swin Transformer to capture long-range dependencies and integrates an FPN for robust multi-scale feature aggregation. Its window-based self-attention mechanism also reduces computational complexity, making it well-suited for high-resolution CT images. Additionally, an edge detection module enhances segmentation by providing edge-related features to the decoder, improving boundary precision. A comparative analysis evaluates the EE-FPS-UNet against leading models, including PSPNet, U-Net, Attention U-Net, and DeepLabV3. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms these models, achieving a Dice Similarity of 0.91 and a sensitivity of 0.89, establishing its efficacy for lung nodule segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Accurate point correspondences is critical for rigid point cloud registration in correspondence-based methods. Many previous learning-based methods employ encoder-decoder backbone for point feature extraction, while applying attention mechanism for sparse superpoints to deal with the partial overlap situation. However, few of these methods focus on the intermediate layers yet mainly pay attention on the top-most patch features, thus neglecting multi-faceted feature perspectives leading to potential overlap areas estimation inaccuracy. Meanwhile, obtaining correct correspondences is usually interfered with the one-to-many case and outliers. To address these issues, we propose a multi-level features extraction network with integrating linear dual attention mechanism into skip-connection stage of encoder-decoder backbone, both efficiently suppressing irrelevant information and guiding residual features to learn the common regions on which the network should focus to tackle the overlap estimation inaccuracy issue, combined with a parallel-structured decoder forming distinguishable features and potential overlapping regions. Additionally, a two-stage correspondences pruning process is designed to tackle the mismatch issue, which mainly depends on the rigid geometric constraint. Extensive experiments conducted on indoor and outdoor scene datasets demonstrate our method's accuracy and stability, by outperforming state-of-the-art methods on registration recall.},

  abstract     = {Medical images often exhibit low and blurred contrast between lesions and surrounding tissues, with considerable variation in lesion edges and shapes even within the same disease, leading to significant challenges in segmentation. Therefore, precise segmentation of lesions has become an essential prerequisite for patient condition assessment and formulation of treatment plans. Significant achievements have been made in research related to the U-Net model in recent years. It improves segmentation performance and is extensively applied in the semantic segmentation of medical images to offer technical support for consistent quantitative lesion analysis methods. First, this paper classifies medical image datasets on the basis of their imaging modalities and then examines U-Net and its various improvement models from the perspective of structural modifications. The research objectives, innovative designs, and limitations of each approach are discussed in detail. Second, we summarise the four central improvement mechanisms of the U-Net and U-Net variant algorithms: the jump-connection mechanism, the residual-connection mechanism, 3D-UNet, and the transformer mechanism. Finally, we examine the relationships among the four core enhancement mechanisms and commonly utilized medical datasets and propose potential avenues and strategies for future advancements. This paper provides a systematic summary and reference for researchers in related fields, and we look forward to designing more efficient and stable medical image segmentation network models based on the U-Net network.},

  abstract     = {The extensive coverage of satellite constellations has rendered the satellite–terrestrial integrated network (STIN) a pivotal solution for communication and computation services in internet of vehicles (IoVs) rescuing in remote or disaster areas with limited terrestrial networks. To optimise network resource utilisation and service quality, the integration of the service function chain (SFC) into STIN-enabled IoV rescuing systems has become essential. However, traditional SFC-based STIN systems encounter challenges in flow scheduling flexibility, stemming from the sequential execution of subtasks on satellites equipped with virtual network functions (VNFs). This leads to a trade-off between data volume reduction and the additional communication and computation energy costs incurred in the orbit. To address this issue, this paper introduces a space ground collaborative SFC (SGC-SFC) flow scheduling strategy. This strategy enables the execution of subtasks on either VNF-equipped satellites or the ground vehicle formation, contingent on network conditions. Firstly, we carry out a computation–space–time graph (CSTG) model specifically for the STIN-enabled IoV rescuing system with SFC. This model integrates the computational layer into the space–time graph (STG), accurately capturing the data volume reduction characteristics and sequential execution constraints of SFC in the STIN-enabled IoV rescuing system. Secondly, a SGC-SFC flow scheduling algorithm is designed to identify a set of feasible paths with minimal energy cost and maximum processable data volume. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed SGC-SFC under diverse conditions.},

The DSA process is primarily modulated through strategies such as external physical fields, substrate interfacial engineering, and geometric confinement, all of which are fundamentally described by Ohta–Kawasaki energy functionals. To preserve the intrinsic energy dissipation property of the corresponding gradient flow equations, we develop implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEXRK) schemes of up to third order and approximately fourth order, ensuring energy stability for any time step size. Under the uniform boundedness assumption of solutions, a novel criterion to justify the energy stability is established by rewriting the IMEXRK schemes in a unified matrix-vector framework. To address the time delay effect in stabilization schemes, an optimized, time-step-dependent selection of stabilization parameters is proposed, which shows significant accuracy improvement compared to a constant stabilization parameter. Numerical experiments validate the superior accuracy and stability, while simulations of directed self-assembly of diblock copolymer melts under different situations demonstrate the universality and broad applicability of the proposed schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the conventional smoothed particle hydrodynamics is enhanced by coupling it with an unstructured finite-volume scheme for solving flows near the moving boundary, particularly in wall-bounded turbulence, capable of both robustly capturing free surface flows and accurately resolving flows near the wall. A mesh domain is deployed encompassing the moving object, and the corresponding flow field is resolved using an unstructured arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian finite-volume scheme. Beyond the mesh domain, the flows are resolved using the particle-based smoothed particle hydrodynamics scheme. Under the turbulence circumstance, the large-eddy simulation model is incorporated into the governing equations, and the wall-modeled large-eddy simulation based on the reduced-order wall model is adopted when the flows near the wall boundary are under-resolved. Regarding the coupling between finite-volume and smoothed particle hydrodynamics domains, the smoothed particle hydrodynamics particles are divided into activated and non-activated particles, and the field values of non-activated particles are interpolated from the finite-volume domain; for the finite-volume domain, the interface points, serving as flux inputs into the finite-volume domain, are deployed on the finite-volume domain boundary, where the field values of the interface points are interpolated from the activated smoothed particle hydrodynamics particles. A set of two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases with low and high Reynolds numbers is simulated using the present method, which presents good accuracy and efficiency and is particularly suitable for simulating turbulent flows. Overall, the proposed method can serve as a remarkable enhancement to the conventional smoothed particle hydrodynamics scheme to reliably predict low-speed wall-bounded flows with moving boundaries.},

The original 3D governing equation is split into a collection of 2D forms by the dimensional splitting method (DSM), and the discrete equation of the 2D problem is derived via the ICVEFG method. The splitting direction is then treated by using the finite element method (FEM), while the time-dependent term in the governing equation is handled by the finite difference method (FDM). Finally, the numerical solution formula is obtained. To verify the accuracy of the CVDCM, the ratio of the L 2 norm to the true value is used as the relative error. The convergence of the proposed method is demonstrated by increasing the number of nodes and meshes. Five numerical examples of transient inhomogeneous heat conduction problems with spatially varying material properties (density, specific heat capacity, and thermal conductivity) are solved using the CVDCM; the results show that the proposed method achieves good convergence and achieves higher accuracy compared to the dimension coupling method (DCM) and the improved element-free Galerkin (IEFG) method in five examples.},

Common topology optimization methods, such as density-based methods and level set methods, focus on global variable optimization. These global optimization approaches often consume substantial computational resources and are not suitable for parallel optimization. In contrast, structures in nature evolve from a combination of numerous local optimization problems, where each cell unit adjusts on the basis of its perception of the surrounding environment, leading to the formation of biological structures. This paper proposes a novel heuristic topology optimization method, the biomimetic moving-mesh (BMM) method, inspired by biological cell growth and evolution. The BMM method uses the positions of mesh nodes as variables to simulate cellular expansion and contraction, thereby creating a new optimization approach. Compared with traditional topology optimization methods, the BMM method offers smoother meshes and is more suitable for handling large-scale parallel optimization problems.},

Conventional constitutive models, while accurate, require extensive parameter calibration and may lack generalization capability under varied loading conditions. In this study, a physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) constitutive framework is proposed that integrates the governing physical laws with the flexibility of neural networks. The model employs long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to capture path-dependent behaviors and utilizes scalar invariants consistent with transverse isotropy to ensure thermodynamic consistency, objectivity, and material symmetry. The neural network is trained using synthetic data generated from a validated continuum-mechanical model for SFRPs, including elasto-plastic behavior and anisotropy. To validate the PIDL model, an open-hole tensile (OHT) test is simulated, and the predicted stresses are compared against those obtained from the classical constitutive model. While the initial PIDL model showed limitations under complex multiaxial stress states, a retraining strategy using randomly generated loading paths significantly improved its predictive accuracy. This study demonstrates the potential of physics-informed machine learning for developing generalizable and efficient data-driven constitutive models for complex composite materials.},

  abstract     = {Given the high costs and practical limitations of experimental testing, computational models have emerged as powerful alternatives to analyze and predict structural failures caused by fracture initiation and propagation. Many materials, such as concrete, rock, clay, certain ceramics, and various composites, exhibit quasi-brittle or ductile cracking. Unlike brittle fractures, where the load capacity of the solid drops abruptly, the failure response of these materials is more involved and exhibits a gradual deterioration of structural integrity accompanied by plastic deformation. In these materials, depending on the loading conditions, fracturing begins with the formation of microcracks, which subsequently coalesce to form larger macroscopic ones. Additionally, under confined compression, localized zones of large inelastic deformations with dimensions linked to the material's microstructure can emerge. As a result, the fracture response of these materials is significantly influenced by their inherent microstructure, affecting both crack initiation and propagation. Therefore, a fracture model that explicitly accounts for the effects of microstructure on the macroscopic ductile fracture response of a body is essential. In this contribution, a thermodynamically consistent phase field fracture model for elastoplastic solids in micropolar continua is presented. We begin by reviewing the kinematical descriptions in which the effects of microstructure and microdeformation are incorporated through an independent microrotation field. Using a purely geometric approach, the evolution of fracture is linked to a constitutive crack driving functional. The governing equations alongside their finite element implementations are presented, and the constitutive relations for a solid with a general non-associative plasticity formulation are detailed. A realization of the proposed framework specific to concrete is also introduced. We present a new degradation function alongside a crack driving force capturing the complex fracture response of concrete, including its pressure-dependent strength and asymmetric response under tension and compression. Finally, the proposed framework is validated by comparing computational simulation results with existing experimental data across a range of loading conditions, from tension-dominated to shear-driven and compression-induced failure scenarios. Comparison of load-displacement curves and crack propagation paths with corresponding experimental observations demonstrates the capabilities of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {The classical material point method (MPM) is particularly suitable for large deformation problems with surface contact, but its capability to capture size effects remains relatively limited. In order to capture the size effect widely observed in solid materials as well as to eliminate mesh dependency, we present an F-bar B-spline MPM for solving finite strain-gradient plasticity in the micromorphic approach. A multiplicative finite strain thermoplasticity model is first regularized in a micromorphic approach, where a global internal variable is introduced to take into account the size effect. An implicit B-spline MPM is developed to solve the coupled problem in a monolithic manner with consistent linearization. This implementation provides a general framework to incorporate phenomenological elasto-plasticity models while preserving the prescribed size effect in the MPM. Although B-spline basis function is effective in suppressing the volumetric-locking deformation pattern when volume-preserving plasticity model is used, severe stress oscillation may manifest when the deformation mode approaches the incompressible limit. Therefore, we propose an F-bar method for the implicit B-spline MPM to suppress the spurious stress oscillation. The exact linearization of the F-bar method and its coupling with the balance equation of micromorphic momentum are derived in closed form. Three representative numerical examples are presented to validate our implementation and demonstrate the advantages of our method. Results show that the proposed method is effective in capturing the size effect at extreme conditions with large distortion and contact, and the F-bar method suppresses the spurious stress oscillations associated with volume-preserving plastic flow. One limitation is that the convergence behavior is less satisfactory when strain-softening model is used due to the inherent limitation of the implicit MPM.},

  abstract     = {Modeling the incompressible fluid flow in porous media has long been a challenging task in the Material Point Method (MPM). Although widely used, conventional Updated Lagrangian MPM (ULMPM) often suffers from numerical stability and computational efficiency issues in the hydromechanical analysis of saturated porous media. To address these issues, we herein present a novel semi-implicit Total Lagrangian MPM (TLMPM). The proposed TLMPM leverages the fractional step method to decouple pore pressure from kinematic fields and employs the semi-implicit scheme to bypass the small time step constraint imposed by permeability and fluid compressibility. Unlike its UL counterpart, the TLMPM evaluates weighting functions and their gradients only once in the reference configuration, eliminating material point tracking and inherently resolving cell-crossing instabilities. Given the consistent set of active degrees of freedom throughout simulations, the proposed method greatly reduces computational costs associated with system matrix assembly for both kinematics and pore pressure and with free-surface node detection. Furthermore, this feature also facilitates the efficient Cholesky factorization, resulting in a substantial acceleration of the solver performance. The proposed approach has been validated against various benchmark tests, and our results have highlighted the remarkable performance of TLMPM, which can achieve up to 63 times speedup over conventional methods, scaling favorably with problem size, and retaining numerical stability even with low-order basis functions. These advancements position the TLMPM as a transformative tool for poroelastic analysis, with broader applicability to large-deformation problems in geomechanics, energy systems, and environmental engineering.},

  abstract     = {Focusing on the homogenization of periodic composite materials, this study investigates computational methods based on volume integral equations. Such formulations are revisited from the standpoint of the preconditioning of the original cell problem by the introduction of a comparison material. This allows for to recovery of simple convergence criteria for iterative steepest-descent and fixed-point schemes for composites with general non-linear behaviour. In the case of linear materials, the preconditioned volume integral formulation coincides with the well-known Lippmann–Schwinger equation. The spectral properties of the featured linear integral operator, which is bounded and self-adjoint, are investigated to shed light on the behaviour of conventional computational homogenization methods. The so-called Lippmann–Schwinger spectrum is analyzed, with its bounds governing the convergence rate of iterative solution methods. The associated eigenvectors, which constitute the eigenstates of the composite material considered, are also described in detail to understand their role in constructing the solution to the cell problem and ultimately in computing the effective properties. Formulated in the continuous setting, this analysis is followed by the investigation of a discrete representation of the integral operator considered. A number of examples on synthetic microstructures are finally considered in the conductivity setting to illustrate the obtained theoretical results and highlight the role of the spectral properties in the operation of computational homogenization methods. This paves the way for the development of reduced models and more efficient computations.},

  abstract     = {A Truncated Weighted Singular Value Decomposition (TWSVD) based approach is proposed for the Tikhonov regularized solution of the ill-posed softening type nonlocal plasticity model. Tikhonov regularization provides a stable, smooth, and mesh-independent solution of integral-type nonlocal plasticity, but is computationally expensive for large-scale problems, particularly in three-dimensional models. The proposed solution technique offers an efficient method for the solution of the large-scale Euler equation resulting from the Tikhonov regularization, which is significant for practical applications of softening problems. The TWSVD approach modifies the truncated SVD method to apply to the numerical integration method commonly used in finite element (FE) models. The mathematical formulation of the proposed approach is presented with a linear isotropic plasticity model, and a stress-update algorithm is developed for the FE application of the approach. The solution algorithm is implemented in a three-dimensional model with isoparametric brick elements. The solution approach is validated with a benchmark shear-band softening problem. Results show that the TWSVD method can significantly reduce the computational time compared to conventional Tikhonov-regularized solutions, without sacrificing accuracy, making it a practical and efficient solution tool for large-scale systems in nonlocal plasticity models with softening behavior.},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization problems are usually nonconvex, and different optimization paths often lead to different local optima. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in dynamic situations, where it typically causes grayscale. The occurrence of grayscale is greatly dependent on material parameters such as stiffness and density. In particular, under finite deformation conditions, the effect of inertia becomes more significant, and the nonconvexity becomes more pronounced, making it difficult to achieve a clear topology with conventional interpolation functions. To address this issue, the present study proposes two novel interpolation functions for density in dynamic topology optimization considering finite deformation. The proposed interpolation functions can adjust their shape during optimization, effectively reducing the grayscale by driving the design variable towards a binary state (0 or 1). Firstly, we investigate the conditions under which grayscale is likely to occur by performing many optimization calculations using various material parameters and load frequencies, and then use the findings obtained to develop new interpolation functions. The proposed methods leverage a gradient-based method, and the accuracy of sensitivity is verified. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through several numerical examples, highlighting their ability to achieve clear topologies while maintaining robustness in challenging dynamic scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The co-rotational (CR) approach is a widely adopted and efficient strategy for geometrically nonlinear analysis. The Classic Formalism , which derives full variations from local element to global coordinates, has been refined over the years and is generally regarded as theoretically sound. This study presents an insight into CR planar solid elements. To isolate these issues from element-specific effects, we focus on the simplest planar solid elements: four-node quadrilaterals and three-node triangles. A comprehensive investigation is conducted to provide a unified overview and systematic comparison of commonly used local element frame construction methods. The findings indicate that the Classic Formalism may exacerbate unrealistic asymmetric responses in symmetric problems, particularly when the local element frame lacks precision. To address this, we propose a direct force correction formalism that introduces a correction term to directly enforce spin equilibrium. On the one hand, the derivation process eliminates the need for a second variation in computing the tangent stiffness matrix; on the other hand, the corrected equal weights act on each node of elements and are directly related to the rotation matrix, rather than a variant of the rotation matrix. As a result, this formalism may reduce the asymmetry in symmetrical cases better than Classic Formalism . Importantly, the proposed formalism is broadly applicable across various element types and frame construction methods.},

The depth allows introducing rankings and orderings to data living in multivariate, or function spaces. Though widely applied and with much experimental success, little theoretical progress has been made in analysing functional depths. This article highlights how the common h -depth and related depths from functional data analysis can be viewed as a kernel mean embedding, widely used in statistical machine learning. This facilitates answers to several open questions regarding the statistical properties of functional depths. We show that (i) h -depth has the interpretation of a kernel-based method; (ii) several h -depths possess explicit expressions, without the need to estimate them using Monte Carlo procedures; (iii) under minimal assumptions, -depths and their maximisers are uniformly strongly consistent and asymptotically Gaussian (also in infinite-dimensional spaces and for imperfectly observed functional data); and (iv) several -depths uniquely characterise probability distributions in separable Hilbert spaces. In addition, we also provide a link between the depth and empirical characteristic function based procedures for functional data. Finally, the unveiled connections enable to design an extension of the -depth towards regression problems.},

It shows that the emerging best practice relies heavily on the approach and tools created by the original authors of the causal forest such as their grf package and the approaches given by them in examples. Generally, researchers use the causal forest on a relatively low-dimensional dataset relying on observed controls or in some cases experiments to identify effects. There are several common ways to then communicate results–by mapping out the univariate distribution of individual-level treatment effect estimates, displaying variable importance results for the forest and graphing the distribution of treatment effects across covariates that are important either for theoretical reasons or because they have high variable importance. Some deviations from this common practice are interesting and deserve further development and use. Others are unnecessary or even harmful. The paper concludes by reflecting on the emerging best practice for causal forest use and paths for future research.},

In theory, we establish the sure screening property under less restrictive assumptions on data types. The proposed procedure does not require model specification, gives a more effective geometric measure to compare the discrepancy between distributions and avoids introducing biases caused by the choice of slicing rules for continuous data. Numerical comparison indicates that the proposed Wasserstein-SIS method performs better than existing methods in various models.

To address this gap, we review a family of chance-corrected IRA statistics for two-rater dichotomous-response cases, a fundamental setting that not only serves as the theoretical foundation for categorical-response or multirater IRA methods but is also practically dominant in most empirical studies, and we propose a novel data-generating framework to simulate correlated decision processes between raters. Subsequently, a new estimand, which calibrates the ‘true’ chance-corrected IRA, is introduced while accounting for the potential ‘probabilistic certainty’. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the reviewed IRA methods under various practical scenarios and were summarised by an agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis. Finally, we provide recommendations for selecting appropriate IRA statistics based on outcome prevalence and rater characteristics and highlight the need for further advancements in IRA estimation methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogenase enzymes play a crucial role in generating energy for microorganisms by catalyzing the reversible oxidation of molecular hydrogen to protons. This catalytic mechanism has been well studied using computational models of varying complexity, ranging from smaller QM-cluster models of the enzyme active site to QM/MM models that capture the full enzyme structure. However, differences among studies have produced conflicting predictions for the energetics of certain reaction steps. This work focuses on characterizing one step—a cysteine–histidine proton transfer of Desulfovibrio fructosovorans [Ni, Fe]-hydrogenase—using a series of QM-cluster models to explore how model design influences predicted reaction thermodynamics. The Residue Interaction Network-based ResidUe Selector (RINRUS) toolkit was used to systematically create QM-cluster models based on either inter-residue distances or contact metrics from the active site [Ni, Fe] cluster. It is shown that QM-cluster models can achieve reaction energy predictions comparable to QM/MM and “big-QM” models when active site models are designed based on inter-residue contact interactions and with careful consideration of charged residues. Distance-based residue selection, a common strategy for QM-cluster model design, is not as effective compared to the RINRUS rules-based residue ranking approach from inter-residue contact counts. Large differences between previously reported QM and QM/MM reaction energies are resolved with RINRUS-based models, even at a modest level of electronic structure theory (B3LYP with modified LANL2DZ(d) basis sets/effective core potentials on metal atoms and 6-31G(d′)/6-31G on nonmetal atoms). Overall, this [Ni, Fe]-hydrogenase case study underscores the need for careful model design when studying complex biological systems and demonstrates how RINRUS can provide a framework towards addressing this challenge.},

We study misinformation diffusion between the decentralized and the centralized platforms and identify three decentralized governance mechanisms to mitigate the spread of misinformation in decentralized networks: user flagging, user article ratings, and user reputation. Our empirical experiments using agent-based simulations leveraging real-world data from two platforms reveal two findings. First, comparing misinformation diffusion between the decentralized Steemit and the centralized Pokec platforms suggests that in the absence of any mitigation mechanisms, misinformation in decentralized platforms affects more users, at faster rates, and reaches shorter distance from the misinformation initiating user. Second, within the decentralized platforms, misinformation affects fewer users, at slower rates, and reaches shorter distance from the misinformation initiating user in the presence of mitigating mechanisms than in their absence. We discuss the implications of these results both for the understanding of misinformation diffusion and for the governance of decentralized social network platforms.},

Prior studies offer little insight into the impact of vampire attack strategy because of its uniqueness in platform cloning, tokenized incentives, and targeted attacks. We implement a quasi-experimental design by leveraging the first and most famous vampire attack launched by SushiSwap (the attacker) against Uniswap (the incumbent). We examine both the deposit-side and exchange-side impacts of the vampire attack on the operational performance of the liquidity pools on Uniswap. Surprisingly, we find that the vampire attack has no significant effect on the liquidity provision on the deposit side. Even more surprisingly, the vampire attack significantly increases the incumbent's trading volume on the exchange side. We further uncover the underlying mechanisms contributing to these intriguing results. We also demonstrate the efficacy of the novel tokenized incentives strategy. We show the generalizability of our findings by examining an alternative vampire attack event in the context of non-fungible token marketplaces.

This study examines the impact of “lazy minting,” a new NFT production method introduced by major NFT marketplaces to lower minting costs by deferring blockchain certification until the first sale. In response to the call for further research on emerging technologies in operations management, we explore how this policy affects the net sales performance of existing sellers in the NFT marketplaces. Based on transaction cost economics (TCE) and the literature about different IP protection methods, we distinguish between lazy- and regular-minted NFTs by their differential transaction costs and utilize the staggered difference-in-differences (DID) method to conduct our analysis. We find that lazy minting adoption significantly boosts the net sales performance of existing sellers. This is attributed to their cost-adaptive IP protection behavior. Specifically, they achieve this by minting more NFTs with a larger proportion of style-consistent NFTs through lazy minting, while strategically employing regular minting for style-breaking NFTs, which is contingent upon their reputation. Our study has important theoretical and practical implications for operations management under the emerging technological revolution.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain technologies have catalyzed the rise of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which operate in an incentive network fueled by crypto tokens. In essence, these tokens are imbued with either payment rights (i.e., transactional tokens) or ownership rights (i.e., governance tokens). The decentralized organizational paradigm dismantles the traditional management structure and bring new research opportunities to Operations Management (OM). While the performance of DAOs has been largely examined in current OM literature, the effectiveness of their internal incentive mechanisms—specifically the one that uses ownership as rewards to promote user contributions—remains unclear. Focusing on DAO-enabled virtual communities, we seek to examine whether decentralized ownership provides stronger incentives for user behaviors, such as creation and curation, in comparison to traditional monetary rewards through the lens of psychological ownership theory. We obtained data from Steemit that captures the reward, creation, curation and transaction behaviors of 98,000 users from May 2017 to April 2019. By leveraging the “power-up” action as a shock that increases user ownership shares, we established a quasi-experimental setting. Employing the PSM-DID model, we found that the use of governance tokens is associated with enhanced creation and curation efforts but declined creation novelty, compared to the use of transactional tokens. Our additional analyses further reveal that the incentive effects of governance tokens diminish over time. However, upon the recurrence of the intended choice, these effects become reinforced. Notably, we find that governance token ownership is more strongly associated with curation efforts for users with weaker social ties. Conversely, for users with high reputation scores, their content creation behaviors are less strongly associated with governance token ownership. This study contributes to the burgeoning discourse on blockchain and cryptocurrency from an operational perspective, providing valuable insights for the design of incentive mechanisms in DAOs and advancing our understanding of operational efficiencies and stakeholder engagement in decentralized structures within Operations Management.},

In developing the theory, I highlight that blockchain represents a distinct organizational form for coordinating operations under a highly decentralized structure, in which the essential tasks of system infrastructure maintenance are assigned to third-party crowd workers through the unique governance mechanism of consensus protocol. I specifically focus on two widely adopted consensus protocols in the context of cryptocurrency, namely, proof-of-work (PoW), which assigns tasks that sustain the blockchain system operation based on workers' investments in computing power, and proof-of-stake (PoS), which assigns these tasks based on workers' investments in the native cryptocurrency as stakes. I argue that compared with PoW, PoS increases worker participation and task decentralization because the investment requirement of task participation in the form of blockchain native assets reduces workers' transaction costs in task contracting and their tendencies for hyper-competition. My empirical analysis leverages a natural experiment on Ethereum, namely, the “Merge” event on September 15, 2022, in which the blockchain changed the assignment rules by switching the consensus protocol from PoW to PoS. The results under a difference-in-differences research design confirm my arguments.},

However, it is still unclear how smart contracts may affect firms' operational efficiency. We address this issue empirically by conducting a quasi-natural experiment in the United States in which certain states have enacted relevant laws that increase in-state firms' propensity to adopt and use smart contracts. Our difference-in-differences estimation suggests that compared with out-of-state control firms, in-state treatment firms' operational efficiency increases significantly after the enactment of smart contract laws. Our post hoc analysis further suggests that state-level smart contract laws help increase in-state firms' actual smart contract activities, which in turn lead to operational efficiency improvement. We also find that the operational efficiency improvement varies across firms with different supply chain complexities. While firms with a large number of supply chain partners (i.e., high horizontal complexity) gain more operational efficiency improvement, the improvement becomes less pronounced if firms' supply chain partners are distributed across different countries (i.e., high spatial complexity). Overall, our research not only demonstrates smart contracts' ability to improve operational efficiency but also reveals the critical role of supply chain complexity in affecting the operational efficiency improvement.},

However, their decentralized architecture may conflict with the centralized control exercised by platform sponsors, giving rise to a centralization–decentralization paradox. This study explores how this paradox unfolds in a large, blockchain-based logistics platform that was ultimately discontinued. Through an in-depth, longitudinal case study, we identify three interrelated governance contradictions—regarding ownership, trust, and growth—that triggered destabilizing oscillations between centralized and decentralized governance modes. We introduce the concept of semirigid limits to capture the bounded flexibility within which governance can be made and adapted under such paradoxical conditions. Our findings show that the centralization–decentralization paradox is especially difficult to navigate when strategic boundary conditions—here, industry competition, fragmented coordination, and high interdependencies—are present. Our study contributes to the paradox and governance literature by theorizing how governance contradictions emerge and persist and by identifying the mechanisms that constrain alignment and adaptation. We also offer guidance for managers in regard to addressing the competing demands of centralization and decentralization in interorganizational platforms.},

In our inductive case study of five technology providers offering blockchain services for operations and supply chains, we examine how founders' power (i.e., expert, prestige, and ownership) shapes management behaviors that build blockchain perceptions and influence stakeholders toward strategic adoption. Our findings reveal that high-performing cases actively seek inspiration beyond the blockchain ecosystem for service designs and adopt a centralized decision-making approach where key strategic decisions are made internally. In contrast, low-performing cases struggle due to within-blockchain exploration and decentralized decision-making, leading to slower implementation and limited scalability. Furthermore, we find that founders' behaviors in blockchain adoption are embraced by firm members through performance evaluation and interactions, shaping organizational practices and culture, ultimately determining the success or failure of blockchain technology providers. This study extends previous research at the intersection of founders' power and blockchain literature by developing propositions about how different sources of founders' power lead to distinct management behaviors, influencing the success or failure of blockchain adoption outcomes.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the field of identifying financial asset price bubbles, particularly through the development of time-series unit-root tests featuring fractionally integrated errors and panel unit-root tests. This study introduces an innovative approach for assessing the sign of the persistence parameter ( α ) within a panel fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, based on the least squares estimator of α . This method incorporates three distinct test statistics based on the Hurst parameter ( H ), which can take values in the range of ( 1 / 2 , 1 ) , be equal to 1 / 2 , or fall within the interval of ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) . The null hypothesis corresponds to α = 0 . Based on a panel of continuous records of observations, the null asymptotic distributions are obtained when the time span ( T ) is fixed and the number of cross sections ( N ) goes to infinity. The power function of the tests is obtained under the local alternative where α is close to zero in the order of 1 / ( T ⁢ N ) . This alternative covers the departure from the unit root hypothesis from the explosive side, enabling the calculation of lower power in bubble tests. The hypothesis testing problem and the local power function are also considered when a panel of discrete-sampled observations is available under a sequential limit, that is, the sampling interval shrinks to zero followed by the N goes to infinity.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we develop two families of sequential monitoring procedure to (timely) detect changes in the parameters of a GARCH(1,1) model. Our statistics can be applied irrespective of whether the historical sample is stationary or not, and indeed without previous knowledge of the regime of the observations before and after the break. In particular, we construct our detectors as the CUSUM process of the quasi-Fisher scores of the log likelihood function. To ensure timely detection, we then construct our boundary function (exceeding which would indicate a break) by including a weighting sequence which is designed to shorten the detection delay in the presence of a changepoint. We consider two types of weights: a lighter set of weights, which ensures timely detection in the presence of changes occurring “early, but not too early” after the end of the historical sample; and a heavier set of weights, called “Rényi weights” which is designed to ensure timely detection in the presence of changepoints occurring very early in the monitoring horizon. In both cases, we derive the limiting distribution of the detection delays, indicating the expected delay for each set of weights. Our methodologies can be applied for a general analysis of changepoints in GARCH(1,1) sequences; however, they can also be applied to detect changes from stationarity to explosivity or vice versa, thus allowing to check for “volatility bubbles”, upon applying tests for stationarity before and after the identified break. Our theoretical results are validated via a comprehensive set of simulations, and an empirical application to daily returns of individual stocks.},

We propose a test for the presence of speculative bubbles in the context of mixed causal-noncausal autoregressive processes. The test exploits the fact that bubbles are anticipative, that is, they are generated by an extreme shock in the forward-looking dynamics. In particular, the test uses both path-level deviations and growth rates to assess the presence of a bubble of a given duration and size, at any moment in time. We show that the distribution of the test statistic can be either analytically determined or numerically approximated, depending on the error distribution. Size and power properties of the test are analyzed in controlled Monte Carlo experiments. An empirical application is presented for a monthly oil price index. It demonstrates the ability of the test to detect bubbles and to provide valuable insights in terms of risk assessments in the spirit of Value-at-Risk.},

This article explores the usefulness of quantile regression (QR) technique in detecting and surveilling financial bubbles, encompassing both global testing and real-time monitoring. We demonstrate that the QR-based quantile unit root test, coupled with an optimal quantile selection technique, serves as an effective tool for a global bubble test without necessitating additional recursive techniques. Moreover, we propose two QR-based bubble monitoring techniques. We show that the monitoring statistics follow a random variate under the null hypothesis of no bubbles but diverge to positive infinity in the presence of a mildly explosive bubble, and hence consistently date the origination of a bubble. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that compared with their LS counterparts, in the presence of skewed distributions, the QR-based global test delivers substantially greater power, while the QR-based monitoring procedures offer higher bubble detection rate and more accurate dating of the bubble origination. As an illustration, we conduct a pseudo real-time monitoring exercise with the S&P 500 composite index.},

In this article, I show that unit root quantile autoregressive models can approximate such dynamics by allowing the largest autoregressive root to take values below unity at low quantiles, which correspond to price crashes, and above unity at upper quantiles, that correspond to bubble expansions. On this basis, I employ two unit root tests based on quantile autoregressions to detect bubbles. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the two tests have good size and power properties, and can outperform recursive least-squares-based tests. The merits of the two tests are further illustrated in three empirical applications that examine Bitcoin, US equity and US housing markets. In the empirical applications, special attention is given to the issue of controlling for economic fundamentals. The estimation results indicate the presence of asymmetric dynamics that closely match those of the simulated bubble processes.},

We first consider a data generating process that entails a switch from a unit root regime to an explosive regime followed by a collapse and subsequent return to unit root behavior. We demonstrate analytically that the standard OLS estimates are inconsistent and date both the origination and implosion points with a delay in large samples. A simple modification that involves omitting the residual corresponding to the implosion date is shown to yield consistent estimates. We also develop an efficient dating algorithm that can accommodate a framework with multiple bubbles. The algorithm exploits the explicit form of the unit root restrictions to directly embed them into the recursive optimization problem which obviates the need to rely on an iterative scheme that requires initial values. Extensive simulation experiments indicate that our proposed procedure typically delivers estimates with lower bias and root mean squared error relative to competing alternatives.

This modification, based on the approach developed in Beare (2018) in the context of conventional unit root testing, is achieved by purging the impact of unconditional heteroskedasticity from the data using a kernel estimate of volatility before the application of the bubble detection methods proposed in Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015) (PSY). The modified statistic is shown to achieve the same limiting null distribution as the corresponding (heteroskedasticity-uncorrected) statistic from PSY would obtain under homoskedasticity, such that the usual critical values provided in PSY may still be used. Versions of the test based on regressions including either no intercept or a (redundant) intercept are considered. Representations for asymptotic local power against a single bubble model are also derived. Monte Carlo simulation results highlight that neither one of these tests dominates the other across different bubble locations and magnitudes, and across different models of time-varying volatility. Accordingly, we also propose a test based on a union of rejections between the with- and without-intercept variants of the modified PSY test. The union procedure is shown to perform almost as well as the better of the constituent tests for a given DGP, and also performs very well compared to existing heteroskedasticity-robust tests across a large range of simulation DGPs.},

Further refinements, such as the point-optimal linear test, approach the power envelope remarkably closely.

These developments have fueled an unprecedented frenzy in the Nasdaq, with AI-focused companies experiencing soaring stock prices that raise concerns about speculative bubbles and real-economy consequences. Against this background, this study investigates the formation of speculative bubbles in the Nasdaq stock market with a specific focus on the so-called Magnificent Seven (Mag-7) individual stocks during the AI boom, spanning the period from January 2017 to January 2025. We apply the real-time PSY bubble detection methodology of Phillips et al. (2015a, 2015b) while controlling for market and industry factors for individual stocks. Confidence intervals to assess the degree of speculative behavior in asset price dynamics are calculated using the near-unit root approach of Phillips (2023). The findings reveal the presence of speculative bubbles in the Nasdaq stock market and across all Mag-7 stocks. Nvidia and Microsoft experience the longest speculative periods over January 2017–December 2021, while Nvidia and Tesla show the fastest rates of explosive behavior. Speculative bubbles persist in the market and in six of the seven stocks (excluding Apple) from December 2022 to January 2025. Near-unit-root inference indicates mildly explosive dynamics for Nvidia and Tesla (2017–2021) and local-to-unity near explosive behavior for all assets in both periods.},

  abstract     = {The etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains elusive. From a pathological point of view, several complex hypotheses, such as impaired neurotransmission, oxidative stress, and aggregation of amyloid- (A ), are considered crucial contributors to the pathophysiology of AD. Recent studies have primarily focused on AD treatment strategies targeting drugs that intervene in cerebral deposition of aggregated amyloid- (A ) polymers, often found in the form of amyloid plaques. In this paper, we present intuitive mathematical models that clarify the treatment of AD in the presence of inhibitory drugs. These models elucidate the intricate kinetics involved in A formation and the interaction of drugs with these processes. We discuss two categories of drugs: first, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which act as monomer inhibitors of A aggregation, and second, drugs that directly interact with A aggregated polymers. We initially analyze each drug independently and then assess their combined effects. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the first type of drug reduces the equilibrium state value of aggregated filaments, whereas the second model of drug exhibits even greater efficacy in reducing the equilibrium state value of aggregated filaments. Furthermore, we conduct simulations of the simultaneous application of both drugs. The results are compared with the experimental data.},

It affects millions of people globally, with the greatest impact in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we develop a deterministic mathematical model that integrates multiple control measures, including sterile insect technique (SIT), mechanical control, chemical control, public health education, and ivermectin treatment, to manage the transmission of onchocerciasis. We employ the next-generation matrix method to calculate the blackfly offspring reproduction number and the basic reproduction number . Sensitivity analysis, conducted using the normalized forward sensitivity index, highlights the biting rate as the most positive influence on driving onchocerciasis dynamics, while the mortality rate of female blackflies has a significant negative impact on disease containment. To identify the optimal control strategy for onchocerciasis infections, we apply optimal control theory, considering five time-dependent controls which are public health education, treatment, mechanical control, SIT, and chemical control. Using Pontryagin's maximum principle, we derive the optimality system for controlling onchocerciasis. By implementing forward-backward Runge–Kutta method in Matlab, we identify the most optimal strategy for controlling, preventing, and treating onchocerciasis in both human and blackfly populations. The results suggest that a combined strategy focusing on public health education, treatment, and chemical control offers the most effective approach for combating onchocerciasis.},

The study examines equilibrium points, with a specific focus on the tumor-free and high-tumor state, to evaluate local stability. The fixed-point theorem is applied to confirm the existence and uniqueness of solutions, and global stability is established through the Hyers–Ulam–Rassias method. Numerical simulations, carried out using the zwo-step Adams-Bashforth method across various fractional orders, unveil the system's complex behaviors. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of pancreatic cancer dynamics and provide meaningful insights into its underlying mechanisms.},

In order to prevent and mitigate this degradation, a better understanding of its causes is urgently needed. In this endeavor, mathematical models of ecosystem structure and function are useful tools. An ecological model is presented here that is both global and applicable to terrestrial and marine environments. An interaction between plant–herbivore–carnivore–omnivore is examined in this study. To determine sensitive parameters, a global sensitivity analysis was performed. The equilibria and stability of the system have been analyzed analytically as well as numerically. Additionally, different kinds of bifurcation are discussed (transcritical, saddle-node, and Hopf). A bistable behavior was observed in the system. A very low herbivore consumption rate will cause carnivores and herbivores to become extinct, while a slightly high value will cause all populations to survive. In population models, stochasticity enhances accuracy, realism, and utility. Consequently, we extend the proposed model from its deterministic version to its stochastic version. An important feature of the noise-induced perturbed system is the occurrence of noise-induced transitions.},

  abstract     = {Discrete orthogonal moments, such as the dual-Hahn moments, often exhibit limitations in accurately reconstructing signals, which reduces their effectiveness in applications that require precise recovery, particularly for 1D signals and color images. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel transform called the quaternionic integer reversible dual-Hahn transform (QIRDHT). This innovative approach enables simultaneous and lossless processing of 1D signals and color images, while being particularly well suited for resource-constrained environments. Furthermore, chaotic systems play a crucial role in cryptography, especially for secure key generation. However, the classical Hénon system has several drawbacks, including a restricted range of control parameters, limited sensitivity to initial conditions, and a tendency to generate periodic sequences. To overcome these limitations, we propose an enhanced hyperchaotic system that combines the dynamics of the Hénon system and logistic maps. This new hyperchaotic system exhibits richer dynamic behavior and a broader range of control parameters, significantly improving the security of encryption schemes. By integrating QIRDHT with this hyperchaotic map, we develop an efficient scheme for generating and extracting multiple zero-watermarks. The robustness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated against various geometric and common signal processing attacks using different medical images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of PSNR, BER, and NC, ensuring enhanced protection of medical images.},

First, we establish by exploiting the semigroup theory that the system is well-posed. Through the construction of an appropriate Lyapunov functional, we establish the exponential stability result for the solutions of the system. The exponential stability of the system's solutions is established under a pertinent assumption regarding the weight of the delay. This assumption posits that the damping effect through heat conduction is sufficiently potent to stabilize the system, even when a time delay is introduced. Importantly, the robustness of our result is noteworthy, as it does not hinge on any specific relationships among system parameters.},

The constraint set is defined as the solution set for a fixed-point problem with demicontractive mappings. The proposed methodologies center on a subgradient extragradient approach that combines an inertial technique, a self-adaptive procedure, and a viscosity approximation scheme. These algorithms use variable step sizes that are dynamically updated in accordance with previous iteration outcomes. A key advantage of the proposed methods is their ability to function eliminating the need for prior knowledge of Lipschitz constants or line search techniques. Instead, the step sizes are determined through simple calculations at each iteration. The convergence analysis is established under relaxed assumptions. Furthermore, we present a numerical study that compares the effectiveness of the proposed techniques to existing approaches.},

The nonlocal term is introduced in the intraspecific competition among the predator species. A density-dependent cross-diffusion is considered to model the movement behavior of species. First, the temporal system is examined, where the existence, boundedness, and stability of the equilibrium points are ascertained. Bifurcation analysis also reveals the presence of saddle-node, transcritical, Hopf bifurcations, and codimension-2 bifurcation such as the Bogdano–Takens bifurcation. The behavior of the system is inspected both in the presence and absence of nonlocal interaction. It is observed that the nonlocal interaction tends to destabilize the coexisting equilibrium. For lower values of diffusion coefficient, spatially nonhomogeneous solutions are detected. For higher values of diffusion coefficient, domain-induced Turing instability switching is observed. Moreover, when the domain size is small, the coexisting equilibrium is stable irrespective of the value of the diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, the stabilizing effect of harvesting effort is also seen. The formulated system is numerically solved using the operator splitting method. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate all the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript provides a comprehensive investigation of the Zabolotskaya–Khokhlov (Z-K) equation, a nonlinear partial differential equation essential for modeling wave propagation in acoustics. The main goal is to formulate and assess a hybrid numerical approach that combines finite difference and differential quadrature techniques, utilizing both Fourier and Lagrange basis functions to improve accuracy and efficiency. The problem formulation commences with defining the parameters and physical meaning of the Z-K equation, succeeded by its discretization in both temporal and spatial domains utilizing the proposed hybrid methodology. We systematically investigate the application of the differential quadrature method for approximating spatial derivatives while utilizing the finite difference method for temporal discretization. The paper introduces a quasi-linearization technique based on Taylor expansion of the nonlinear temporal terms. This dual methodology facilitates a versatile and resilient handling of the nonlinear features of the Z-K equation. A comprehensive error analysis is performed, establishing limits on both temporal and spatial errors related to the numerical solutions. The results indicate that the hybrid approach markedly enhances accuracy relative to conventional methods, with error barriers determined through meticulous mathematical derivation and corroborated by numerical simulations. The proposed scheme provides an error estimate of orders for both Lagrange and Fourier bases, respectively. The results indicate the method's effectiveness in capturing the complex behavior of wave propagation, rendering it a viable instrument for applications in acoustics and related domains. This study enhances the numerical solutions of the Z-K equation and offers insights into the wider use of hybrid approaches for solving nonlinear wave equations.},

The equation is significant for modeling complex physical systems in fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and nonlinear optics. We employ both the Kumar–Malik method and the polynomial expansion technique to construct exact soliton solutions in various functional forms, including Jacobi elliptic, hyperbolic, exponential, and trigonometric types. The combination of these two analytical methods provides a novel framework for investigating nonlinear wave structures in stochastic environments. To complement the analytical results, numerical simulations are conducted using Maple (or Mathematica) software, which confirm the accuracy and dynamic consistency of the solutions. These simulations also offer deeper insight into the behavior and evolution of the solutions under random influences. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the applied methods, making them suitable for a wider class of nonlinear partial differential equations. This work contributes to a better theoretical and computational understanding of stochastic wave phenomena and lays the groundwork for further exploration in related physical contexts.},

It is possible to model many objects, human figures, and living creatures in nature in a suitable way by means of superquadrics. On the other hand, quaternions are useful in mathematics, especially for computations involving three-dimensional rotations, such as in robotics, computer vision, magnetic resonance imaging, three-dimensional computer graphics, and texture analysis in crystallography. In addition, considering that nature is built according to a rotation principle, a structure combining superquadrics and quaternion algebra can be a very useful and usable structure in the mentioned areas and many others. For this purpose, in this study, a new kinematic structure is defined, called a superquadric motion in Lorentz 3-space. For this purpose, first, an inner product and a vector product compatible with superquadrics and superquadric space are defined via the Gielis superformula. Then, the new algebraic structure, called superquadric quaternions, and their properties are given. In this study, the defined superquadric motion and the hyperbolic split quaternion perform a superquadric rotation motion on the superquadric hyperboloids in 3D Lorentz space. Finally, some examples are visualized by mathematical programs to show the applicability of these constructions.},

The proposed model is studied in the presence of a fear effect induced by the predator's presence, which can lead to significant reductions in the prey's reproduction rate. The system is assumed to exist in a patchy environment consisting of two distinct patches (patch ). The prey migrates between these patches in search of food, while the predator moves between patches in pursuit of prey. The movement of both prey and predator is assumed to be fast compared to their growth and interactions. To capture the system's dynamics, slow and fast time scales are introduced. An aggregated model for the prey and predator populations is derived. The positive invariance and boundedness of all feasible solutions in the aggregated system are established. The necessary conditions for the feasibility and stability of various fixed points in the aggregated model are determined. Furthermore, the existence of periodic solutions is numerically verified through Hopf bifurcation and Hopf-Hopf (double-Hopf) bifurcation around coexistence points. The existence of a branch point (transcritical bifurcation) is also analyzed by satisfying all the conditions of Sotomayor's theorem. Additionally, a two-parameter bifurcation analysis is conducted, including generalized Hopf bifurcation and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. Several numerical simulations, performed using MATLAB and MATCONT, illustrate and validate the analytical results.},

The prey's reproduction rate is modeled as a decreasing function of predator density and fear intensity, while predator dynamics follow a modified Holling type II functional response. Analytical investigations establish conditions for the existence and stability of equilibria, as well as persistence and bifurcations, including transcritical and Hopf types. Numerical simulations reveal that higher fear intensity or intraspecific competition stabilizes dynamics by suppressing oscillations, whereas their reduction leads to limit cycles via supercritical or subcritical Hopf bifurcations. Two-parameter bifurcation analysis uncovers generalized Hopf bifurcations and bistability. Stochastic simulations with Gaussian white noise indicate that low-intensity fluctuations preserve coexistence, while stronger noise destabilizes the system. Global sensitivity analysis identifies the most influential parameters affecting population dynamics. A brief comparative discussion shows that excluding mechanisms such as noise simplifies the system and reduces its dynamical complexity.},

Under very general assumptions, the existence of weak solutions is proven by considering regularized systems, deriving uniform bounds, and using fixed point arguments. Assuming additional structural assumptions we also prove the uniqueness of solutions. Global-in-time well-posedness is established for Dirichlet and mixed boundary conditions, whereas, only local well-posedness can be shown for homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Using a suitable barrier function and comparison theorems, we formulate sufficient conditions for finite-time blow-up or uniform boundedness of solutions. Finally, we show that solutions of the degenerate parabolic equation inherit additional global spatial regularity if the diffusion coefficient has a power-law growth.},

Additionally, the study investigates the impact of transaction costs and conducts a sensitivity analysis on key parameters. The proposed methodology can be easily extended to price other option types in a multifactor stochastic volatility or stochastic interest rate setting with transaction costs.},

Among them, how to estimate learning rates for various learning problems remains a fundamental theoretical problem. By far, most of the existing research only focuses on single-output learning. To strengthen the theoretical support of multioutput learning, we study the learning rates of multioutput regression with kernel methods and -regularization. We obtain an explicit learning rate, which reveals the quantitative dependency on both the output dimensions and the sample size. Our results cover a broader scope than previous works and improve upon them in certain special cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide learning rate estimates for this scheme.},

  abstract     = {The growing trend of automation in engineering significantly increases the complexity of engineering systems and necessitates a deeper understanding of the coupling of physical and cyber components interacting within the systems. A typical example of such a highly coupled system is an autonomous construction site, where robotic systems aim to enhance the efficiency of the construction process. To adequately address, define, and model the structure of such engineering systems, it is essential to use the tools of abstract mathematics, which provide a sufficient level of abstraction to describe entire systems as well as interactions between their components. Moreover, the use of abstract mathematics enables conceptual modelling at different levels of details and abstraction, and, thus, providing possibilities to work not only on a meta-level, but also on the meta-meta-level. In this context, a meta-metamodelling approach to the formal description of engineering systems via the coupling of categorical ontology logs and abstract definitions for individual components has been proposed in recent years. The goal of this paper is to further develop the meta-metamodelling approach, emphasizing its practical applicability for engineering systems by considering practical problems on autonomous construction sites. In particular, a connection between the meta-meta-level and the meta-level is discussed as well as the advantages of using the tools of abstract mathematics are underlined.},

The Qdenga vaccine was introduced in 2022 to prevent dengue infection. Building on this, we develop a threshold-based dynamical model of the dengue fever epidemic that incorporates vaccination, vaccine inefficacy, and asymptomatic carriers. We first formulate the arithmetic expression for the control reproduction number and then use properties of complex modulus and proof by contradiction to establish the local asymptotic stability of both dengue-free equilibrium and dengue-infected equilibrium of the model. Furthermore, by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions and applying the generalized Lyapunov-LaSalle theorem, we obtain the global dynamic properties of the two equilibria. In particular, we confirm weak persistence for to achieve the global attractivity of the dengue-infected equilibrium. Notably, we conduct numerical simulations and analyze the transmission dynamics of the disease in conjunction with official data from Brazil and the results of parameter estimation. These numerical findings are consistent with our theoretical results. Additionally, sensitivity analysis using MATLAB is carried out to identify parameters with significant impact on our model. Our numerical simulation results suggest that taking into account vaccination and potential vaccine inefficacy can lead to more accurate simulations of real-world scenarios. This consideration also plays a significant role in devising feasible epidemic control strategies and enhancing targeted vaccine development. Specifically, Qdenga received approval for use in Brazil in March 2023. Relevant authorities in Brazil are encouraged to actively promote vaccination campaigns in order to reduce the infection rate.},

Furthermore, we implement a robust approximation scheme based on a sequential substitution rule and investigate its convergence. The last step is to design a stabilizing backstepping controller to eliminate undesired chaotic behaviors. We then show that the closed-loop system is globally asymptotically stable, as stated in Theorem 5.1, and use experiments to confirm that it works.},

The switching control property occurs whenever the set of instants at which the trajectory intersects some specified submanifolds is of null measure. In the multivalued feedback framework, asymptotic stability and asymptotic output stability are obtained from LaSalle invariance principle.

This essentially reduces the solution of the direct scattering problem to the computation of the coefficients and location of zeros of an analytic function inside of the unit disk. The solution of the inverse scattering problem reduces to the solution of a system of linear algebraic equations for the power series coefficients, while the potential is recovered from the first coefficient.

Cluster analysis has been widely applied to identify cell types, capturing the essential patterns of the original data in a much more concise form. One challenge in the cluster analysis of cells is matching clusters extracted from datasets of different origins or conditions. Many existing algorithms cannot recognize new cell types present in only one of the two samples when establishing a correspondence between clusters obtained from two samples. Additionally, when there are more than two samples, it is advantageous to align clusters across all samples simultaneously rather than performing pairwise alignment. Our approach aims to construct a taxonomy for cell clusters across all samples to better annotate these clusters and effectively extract features for downstream analysis. A new system for constructing cell-type taxonomy has been developed by combining the technique of optimal transport with relaxed marginal constraints (OT-RMC) and the simultaneous alignment of clusters across multiple samples. OT-RMC allows us to address challenges that arise when the proportions of clusters vary substantially between samples or when some clusters do not appear in all the samples. Experiments on more than 20 datasets demonstrate that the taxonomy constructed by this new system can yield highly accurate annotation of cell types. Additionally, sample-level features extracted based on the taxonomy result in accurate classification of samples.},

  abstract = {Data streams, characterized by high velocity and volume, pose significant challenges for real-time data analysis. Online learning methods have become increasingly prominent for handling these challenges efficiently. In this paper, we consider an online renewable algorithm for composite quantile regression, which only needs to retain the key information in the historical data and update the summary statistics with the currently accessible data to obtain a renewable estimator. The proposed method is theoretically proven to be asymptotically equivalent to the oracle estimator derived from the entire dataset, offering advantages in computational and memory efficiency. Unlike previous approaches that impose constraints on batch numbers or data variance, our method is unconstrained by these factors. Meanwhile, numerical simulations and experiments on real data sets demonstrate that our estimator not only surpasses existing methods in handling both homogeneous and heterogeneous data but also performs better than traditional Quantile Regression in various scenarios. These findings highlight the suitability of our approach for real-world streaming data applications.},

This paper proposes an adaptive weighted regularized quantile regression gated recurrent unit (AWR-QRGRU) algorithm. The gated recurrent unit (GRU) is employed to capture long-term dependencies in the sequence and generate predictions for multiple quantiles through a fully connected layer, thereby enabling both point forecasts and interval forecasts with varying confidence levels. In the proposed prediction algorithm, the loss function incorporates coverage loss, median loss, interval width loss, and regularization loss. An adaptive weight adjustment mechanism was implemented to dynamically optimize the weights of these different loss terms, enhancing the accuracy and stability of the predictions when dealing with multidimensional explanatory variables. Subsequently, we conducted Monte Carlo experiments to validate the algorithm's effectiveness in both point and interval predictions. Ultimately, the algorithm was applied to predict Amazon's and NVIDIA's stock prices, showcasing its potential applications in complex financial market environments.},

Unlike traditional time-series clustering methods that yield static membership parameters, our approach allows each time series to dynamically change cluster memberships over time. Thus, each time series has a dynamic posterior probability of belonging to each cluster. The proposed mixture model is flexible, assuming a Dirichlet evolution for the mixture weights that enables smooth membership transitions over time. This approach accounts for correlations between weights, thereby avoiding abrupt membership changes caused by outlying observations in the series. Posterior estimates of model parameters and membership probabilities are obtained via Gibbs sampling. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient alternative method based on stochastic expectation maximization and gradient descent to obtain point estimates. We illustrate the proposed method using a tri-variate panel dataset combining Gapminder and World Bank indicators—life expectancy, GDP per capita, and crude birth rate—for 78 European and African countries from 1960 to 2007. The selected regions provide strong socioeconomic and demographic contrasts, allowing the model to effectively capture temporal and structural changes in cluster membership.},

  abstract = {Random binnings generated via recursive binary splits are introduced as a way to detect, measure the strength of, and to display the pattern of association between any two variates, whether one or both are continuous or categorical. This provides a single approach to ordering large numbers of variate pairs by their measure of dependence and then to examine any pattern of dependence via a common display, the departure display (coloring bins by a standardized Pearson residual). Continuous variates are first ranked and their rank pairs binned. The Pearson's goodness of fit statistic is applicable but the classic approximation to its null distribution is not. Theoretical and empirical investigations motivate several approximations, including a simple approximation with real-valued, yet intuitive, degrees of freedom. Alternatively, applying an inverse probability transform from the ranks before binning returns a simple Pearson statistic with the classic degrees of freedom. Recursive random binning with different approximations is compared to recent grid-based methods on a variety of non-null dependence patterns; the method with any of these approximations is found to be well-calibrated and relatively powerful against common test alternatives. Method and displays are illustrated by applying the screening methodology to a publicly available data set having several continuous and categorical measurements of each of 6497 Portuguese wines.

In addition to selection bias, non-probability samples may also suffer from missingness in practice, even nonignorable nonresponse with unknown response probabilities. Superpopulation model methods have been discussed for reducing selection biases from non-probability samples, but not for dealing with nonignorable missingness for non-probability samples yet. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear superpopulation model inference approach for non-probability samples with nonignorable missingness. We develop rigorous procedures for estimating the response probabilities for units in the non-probability sample and the nonlinear superpopulation model parameters, and construct the finite population mean estimator based on the nonlinear superpopulation model, response probabilities, and inclusion probabilities. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and variance estimation are also discussed under the proposed framework. In a simulation study, we compare the proposed method with some existing methods.

  abstract     = {An optimally designed experiment reaches results quicker, at a lower cost, or with fewer observations and is therefore crucial in maximizing resource efficiency in research. In immunization studies, the primary goal is often to characterize antibody kinetics—the change in antibody concentration over time. However, nonlinear models for antibody kinetics present substantial challenges for study design, particularly the need to provide information on the parameters of interest. We propose a novel framework to facilitate the design of immunization studies using simple, understandable information. We assume that the mean antibody concentration follows the structural form of the beta density until reaching a plateau. Using the time and height of the maximum and the time and height of the plateau, we can uniquely determine the antibody kinetics curve. Optimal sampling schedules are determined using D-optimality, with D-efficiency used to compare designs. In a robustness analysis across 12 scenarios, we analyzed the framework's sensitivity to misspecification in the initial information. When misspecifying one parameter at a time, the median D-efficiencies exceeded 0.95 and the first quartiles were greater than or equal to 0.9 for all parameters, highlighting the robustness of the framework. Misspecification in the height of the plateau and time of the maximum affected the D-efficiency the most. The great advantage of the framework is that we only need intuitive information from the medical professionals to design an immunization study, in which determining the antibody kinetics is the main goal.},

For diseases caused by enteric pathogens, off-the-shelf statistical model-based approaches do not consider the biological mechanisms through which infection occurs and thus can only be used to make comparatively weak statements about the association between risk factors and incidence. Building off of established work in quantitative microbiological risk assessment, we propose a new approach to determining the association between risk factors and dose accrual rates. Our more mechanistic approach achieves a higher degree of biological plausibility, incorporates currently ignored sources of variability, and provides regression parameters that are easily interpretable as the dose accrual rate ratio due to changes in the risk factors under study. We also describe a method for leveraging information across multiple pathogens. The proposed methods are available as an R package at https://github.com/dksewell/dare . Our simulation study shows unacceptable coverage rates from generalized linear models, while the proposed approach empirically maintains the nominal rate even when the model is misspecified. Finally, we demonstrated our proposed approach by applying our method to infant data obtained through the PATHOME study ( https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10227256 ), discovering the impact of various environmental factors on infant enteric infections.},

To do so, we build a propensity for race to properly adjust for other social determinants while characterizing the controlled effect of race on telomere length. Propensity score methods are broadly employed with observational data as a tool to achieve covariate balance, but how to implement them in complex surveys is less studied—in particular, when the survey weights depend on the group variable under comparison (as the NHANES sampling scheme depends on self-reported race). We propose identification formulas to properly estimate the ACD in outcomes between Black and White individuals, with appropriate weighting for both covariate imbalance across the two racial groups and generalizability . Via extensive simulation, we show that our proposed methods outperform traditional analytic approaches in terms of bias, mean squared error, and coverage when estimating the ACD for our setting of interest. In our data, we find that evidence of racial differences in telomere length between Black and White individuals attenuates after accounting for confounding by socioeconomic factors and utilizing appropriate propensity score and survey weighting techniques.

In typical applications, temporal trends are described using a basis expansion, with basis coefficients treated as random effects varying by subject. Additional random effects can describe variation between mixture components or other known sources of variation in complex designs. A key advantage of these models is that they provide a natural mechanism for clustering. Current versions of mixtures of linear mixed models are not specifically designed for the case where there are many observations per subject and complex temporal trends, which require a large number of basis functions to capture. In this case, the subject-specific basis coefficients are a high-dimensional random effects vector, for which the covariance matrix is hard to specify and estimate, especially if it varies between mixture components. To address this issue, we consider the use of deep mixture of factor analyzers models as a prior for the random effects. The resulting deep mixture of linear mixed models is well suited for high-dimensional settings, and we describe an efficient variational inference approach to posterior computation.

Here, we discuss how to estimate a counterfactual prediction model, how to assess the model's performance, and how to perform model and tuning parameter selection. We provide identification and estimation results for counterfactual prediction models and for multiple measures of counterfactual model performance, including loss-based measures, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the calibration curve. Importantly, our results allow valid estimates of model performance under counterfactual intervention even if the candidate prediction model is misspecified, permitting a wider array of use cases.

Further, including last-observed-before-time covariates is critical for a repeatedly observed outcome. We also develop some novel metrics for judging the adequacy of sensitivity analyses.

  abstract     = {Misclassification between causes of death can produce bias in estimated cumulative incidence functions. When estimating causal quantities, such as comparing the cumulative incidence of death due to specific causes under interventions, such bias can lead to suboptimal decision making. Here, a consistent semiparametric estimator of the cumulative incidence function under interventions in settings with misclassification between two event types is presented. The measurement parameters for this estimator can be informed by validation data or expert knowledge. Moreover, a modified bootstrap approach to variance estimation is proposed for confidence interval construction. The proposed estimator was applied to estimate the cumulative incidence of AIDS-related mortality in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study under single- versus combination-drug antiretroviral therapy regimens that may be subject to confounding. The proposed estimator is shown to be consistent and performed well in finite samples via a series of simulation experiments.},

At an early stage, the goal is not to precisely define the target population, but to not miss an efficacy signal that might be limited to a biomarker subgroup. In this work, we propose a one-arm two-stage early phase biomarker-guided design in the setting of an oncology trial where at the time of the interim analysis, several decisions can be made regarding stopping the entire trial early or continuing to recruit patients from the full or a selected patient population. Via simulations, we show that, although the sample size is limited, the proposed design leads to better decision-making compared to a classical design that does not consider an enrichment expansion.},

  abstract     = {Comparison studies in methodological research are intended to compare methods in an evidence-based manner to help data analysts select a suitable method for their application. To provide trustworthy evidence, they must be carefully designed, implemented, and reported, especially given the many decisions made in planning and running. A common challenge in comparison studies is to handle the “failure” of one or more methods to produce a result for some (real or simulated) data sets, such that their performances cannot be measured in those instances. Despite an increasing emphasis on this topic in recent literature (focusing on non-convergence as a common manifestation), there is little guidance on proper handling and interpretation, and reporting of the chosen approach is often neglected. This paper aims to fill this gap and offers practical guidance on handling method failure in comparison studies. After exploring common handlings across various published comparison studies from classical statistics and predictive modeling, we show that the popular approaches of discarding data sets yielding failure (either for all or the failing methods only) and imputing are inappropriate in most cases. We then recommend a different perspective on method failure—viewing it as the result of a complex interplay of several factors rather than just its manifestation. Building on this, we provide recommendations on more adequate handling of method failure derived from realistic considerations. In particular, we propose considering fallback strategies that directly reflect the behavior of real-world users. Finally, we illustrate our recommendations and the dangers of inadequate handling of method failure through two exemplary comparison studies.},

To estimate treatment effects, DiD relies on a “parallel trends assumption” that treatment and comparison groups would have had parallel trajectories on average in the absence of an intervention. Recent years have seen both growing use of DiD in health policy and medicine and rapid advancements in DiD methods. To support DiD implementation in these fields, this paper reviews and synthesizes best practices and recent innovations. We provide recommendations to practitioners in four areas: (1) assessing causal assumptions; (2) adjusting for covariates and other approaches to relax causal assumptions; (3) accounting for staggered treatment timing; and (4) conducting robust inference, especially when normal-based clustered standard errors are inappropriate. For each, we explain challenges and common pitfalls in traditional DiD and recommend methods to address these. We explore current treatment of these topics through a focused literature review of medical DiD studies.},

Most existing approaches only address one of these two complications and can lead to substantial bias and erroneous inference when dealing with both simultaneously. There is very limited research that addresses both these problems at the same time. These approaches are exclusively based on likelihood and require distribution assumptions on the underlying true covariates, as well as restricted independence assumptions on the censoring time. We propose a novel corrected score approach that relieves such stringent assumptions and is simpler in computation. The estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. The finite sample performance of the proposed estimator is assessed through simulation studies and illustrated by application to data from an AIDS clinical trial. The approach can be used in the case of replicate data or instrumental data. It can also be extended to more general models and outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Clinical trials are an integral component of medical research. Trials require careful design to, for example, maintain the safety of participants and to use resources efficiently. Adaptive clinical trials are often more efficient and ethical than standard or non-adaptive trials because they can require fewer participants, target more promising treatments, and stop early with sufficient evidence of effectiveness or harm. The design of adaptive trials is usually undertaken via simulation, which requires assumptions about the data-generating process to be specified a priori. Unfortunately, if such assumptions are misspecified, then the resulting trial design may not perform as expected, leading to, for example, reduced statistical power or an increased Type I error. Motivated by a clinical trial of a vaccine to protect against gastroenteritis in infants, we propose an approach to design adaptive clinical trials with time-to-event outcomes without needing to explicitly define the data-generating process. To facilitate this, we consider trial design within a general Bayesian framework where inference about the treatment effect is based on the partial likelihood. As a result, inference is robust to the form of the baseline hazard function, and we exploit this property to undertake trial design when the data-generating process is only implicitly defined. The benefits of this approach are demonstrated via an illustrative example and via redesigning our motivating clinical trial.},

Estimating the positive conditional tail index of a heavy-tailed conditional distribution is a crucial step for statistical inference, but the task becomes increasingly challenging as the covariate dimension increases. In this work, we assume the existence of a lower-dimensional linear subspace such that the conditional tail index depends on the covariate only through its projection onto this subspace. We propose a method to estimate this dimension reduction subspace and establish its consistency. Additionally, we introduce an estimator of the conditional tail index that leverages this dimension reduction and prove its consistency.

However, existing Fréchet regression literature focuses on the classical setting where the predictor dimension is fixed, and the sample size goes to infinity. This paper proposes sparse Fréchet sufficient dimension reduction with graphical structure among high-dimensional Euclidean predictors. In particular, we propose a convex optimization problem that leverages the graphical information among predictors and avoids inverting the high-dimensional covariance matrix. We also provide the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Theoretically, the proposed method achieves subspace estimation and variable selection consistency under suitable conditions. Extensive simulations and a real data analysis are carried out to illustrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method.},

The challenge in this setting is that the models usually induce a joint distribution which is intractable. Resorting to instead sampling from the joint distribution by means of a Monte Carlo approach is also challenging. For example, a naive rejection sampler does not work when the probability mass of the constraint is zero. A typical example of such constrained problems is to learn energy consumption for a higher resolution level based on data at a lower resolution, for example, to decompose a daily reading into readings at a finer level. We introduce a novel Monte Carlo sampling algorithm based on Langevin diffusions and rejection sampling to solve the problem of sampling from equality-constrained models. Our method has the advantage of being exact for linear constraints and naturally deals with multimodal distributions on arbitrary constraints. We test our method on statistical disaggregation problems for electricity consumption datasets, and our approach provides better uncertainty estimation and accuracy in data imputation compared with other naive/unconstrained methods.},

The related theory justifies Lancaster's mid-p and mean-value chi-squared statistics for Fisher's combination as special cases. To counter the conservative nature of Lancaster's testing procedures, we propose an updated null-approximating distribution. It is achieved by further minimizing the Wasserstein distance to the adjusted statistics within an appropriate distribution family. Specifically, in the context of Fisher's combination, we propose an optimal gamma distribution as a substitute for the traditionally used chi-squared distribution. This new approach yields an asymptotically consistent test that significantly improves Type I error control and enhances statistical power.},

  abstract     = {Factor models are indispensable tools in economics and finance, providing valuable insights into the latent structures underlying complex datasets. Nevertheless, the prevalence of heavy-tailed macroeconomic and financial data, often characterized by extreme values and greater skewness than that found in a normal distribution, presents significant analytical challenges. This article introduces mode-adaptive factor models (MAFM) for robust factor analysis in high-dimensional panel data, inspired by the equivalence between conventional principal component analysis and the constrained least squares method in factor models. Unlike traditional factor models that concentrate on mean estimation, MAFM leverage the mode to capture central tendencies more effectively, particularly in the presence of skewed and heavy-tailed distributions. To facilitate MAFM for factor analysis, we develop an iterative mode regression algorithm that integrates the expectation-maximization procedure, ensuring convergence to a stationary solution. We establish the theoretical properties of the MAFM estimators without imposing moment constraints on idiosyncratic errors and propose a mode information criterion for consistent factor number selection. We also suggest a data-dependent bandwidth selection procedure to enhance the flexibility of MAFM. The simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of MAFM across diverse distributional settings. An empirical application to macroeconomic forecasting further highlights the practical advantages of MAFM, showcasing their robustness and efficacy in real-world analyses.},

  abstract     = {INAR (integer-valued autoregressive) and INGARCH (integer-valued GARCH) models are among the most commonly employed approaches for count time series modeling, but have been studied in largely distinct strands of literature. In this paper, a new class of generalized integer-valued ARMA (GINARMA) models is introduced which unifies a large number of compound Poisson INAR and INGARCH processes. Its stochastic properties, including stationarity and geometric ergodicity, are studied. Particular attention is given to a generalization of the INAR( p ) model which parallels the extension of the INARCH( p ) to the INGARCH( p , q ) model. For inference, we consider maximum likelihood, Gaussian quasi-likelihood, and moment-based approaches, along with likelihood ratio tests to distinguish between selected instances of our class. Models from the proposed class have a natural interpretation as stochastic epidemic processes, which throughout the article is used to illustrate our arguments. In a case study, different instances, including both established and newly introduced models, are applied to weekly case numbers of measles and mumps in Bavaria, Germany.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental functional in nonparametric statistics is the Mann-Whitney functional θ = P ⁡ ( X < Y ) , which constitutes the basis for the most popular nonparametric procedures. The functional θ measures a location or stochastic tendency effect between two distributions. A limitation of is its inability to capture scale differences. If differences of this nature are to be detected, specific tests for scale or omnibus tests need to be employed. However, the latter often suffer from low power, and they do not yield interpretable effect measures. In this article, we extend by additionally incorporating the recently introduced distribution overlap index (nonparametric dispersion measure) that can be expressed in terms of the quantile process. We derive the joint asymptotic distribution of the respective estimators of and and construct confidence regions. Extending the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test, we introduce a new test based on the joint use of these functionals. It results in much larger consistency regions while maintaining competitive power to the rank sum test for situations in which alone would suffice. Compared with classical omnibus tests, the simulated power is much improved. Additionally, the newly proposed inference method yields effect measures whose interpretation is surprisingly straightforward.},

  abstract     = {Intensity estimation through kernel smoothing is a popular non-parametric method of describing the characteristics of an underlying spatial point process. Key to the accuracy of this estimate is the choice of bandwidth. Too large or small a bandwidth can lead to features in the intensity being lost or to the introduction of artefacts. There are many available methods of bandwidth selection for spatial point patterns, but no consensus on the best option. Popular methods and software default options lead to very different intensity estimates and contrasting conclusions about the data that can be difficult to reconcile. In response, we propose new bandwidth selectors with more stable and consistent performance. These are adapted from popular plug-in and cross-validation techniques developed for general multivariate density estimation. The theoretical and practical performance of these proposed methods is explored and compared with other available methods in both simulated and real-data scenarios. We find that our proposed methods perform consistently well across a range of different intensity patterns. We end with a discussion on the implications of edge effects when applying these methods, given the constrained windows in which spatial point patterns are often observed.},
