  abstract     = {In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the field of identifying financial asset price bubbles, particularly through the development of time-series unit-root tests featuring fractionally integrated errors and panel unit-root tests. This study introduces an innovative approach for assessing the sign of the persistence parameter ( α ) within a panel fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, based on the least squares estimator of α . This method incorporates three distinct test statistics based on the Hurst parameter ( H ), which can take values in the range of ( 1 / 2 , 1 ) , be equal to 1 / 2 , or fall within the interval of ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) . The null hypothesis corresponds to α = 0 . Based on a panel of continuous records of observations, the null asymptotic distributions are obtained when the time span ( T ) is fixed and the number of cross sections ( N ) goes to infinity. The power function of the tests is obtained under the local alternative where α is close to zero in the order of 1 / ( T ⁢ N ) . This alternative covers the departure from the unit root hypothesis from the explosive side, enabling the calculation of lower power in bubble tests. The hypothesis testing problem and the local power function are also considered when a panel of discrete-sampled observations is available under a sequential limit, that is, the sampling interval shrinks to zero followed by the N goes to infinity.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we develop two families of sequential monitoring procedure to (timely) detect changes in the parameters of a GARCH(1,1) model. Our statistics can be applied irrespective of whether the historical sample is stationary or not, and indeed without previous knowledge of the regime of the observations before and after the break. In particular, we construct our detectors as the CUSUM process of the quasi-Fisher scores of the log likelihood function. To ensure timely detection, we then construct our boundary function (exceeding which would indicate a break) by including a weighting sequence which is designed to shorten the detection delay in the presence of a changepoint. We consider two types of weights: a lighter set of weights, which ensures timely detection in the presence of changes occurring “early, but not too early” after the end of the historical sample; and a heavier set of weights, called “Rényi weights” which is designed to ensure timely detection in the presence of changepoints occurring very early in the monitoring horizon. In both cases, we derive the limiting distribution of the detection delays, indicating the expected delay for each set of weights. Our methodologies can be applied for a general analysis of changepoints in GARCH(1,1) sequences; however, they can also be applied to detect changes from stationarity to explosivity or vice versa, thus allowing to check for “volatility bubbles”, upon applying tests for stationarity before and after the identified break. Our theoretical results are validated via a comprehensive set of simulations, and an empirical application to daily returns of individual stocks.},

  abstract     = {In economics and finance, speculative bubbles take the form of locally explosive dynamics that eventually collapse. We propose a test for the presence of speculative bubbles in the context of mixed causal-noncausal autoregressive processes. The test exploits the fact that bubbles are anticipative, that is, they are generated by an extreme shock in the forward-looking dynamics. In particular, the test uses both path-level deviations and growth rates to assess the presence of a bubble of a given duration and size, at any moment in time. We show that the distribution of the test statistic can be either analytically determined or numerically approximated, depending on the error distribution. Size and power properties of the test are analyzed in controlled Monte Carlo experiments. An empirical application is presented for a monthly oil price index. It demonstrates the ability of the test to detect bubbles and to provide valuable insights in terms of risk assessments in the spirit of Value-at-Risk.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and monitoring financial bubbles is critical, as they can lead to market instability, asset price crashes, and economic downturns with widespread consequences. This article explores the usefulness of quantile regression (QR) technique in detecting and surveilling financial bubbles, encompassing both global testing and real-time monitoring. We demonstrate that the QR-based quantile unit root test, coupled with an optimal quantile selection technique, serves as an effective tool for a global bubble test without necessitating additional recursive techniques. Moreover, we propose two QR-based bubble monitoring techniques. We show that the monitoring statistics follow a random variate under the null hypothesis of no bubbles but diverge to positive infinity in the presence of a mildly explosive bubble, and hence consistently date the origination of a bubble. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that compared with their LS counterparts, in the presence of skewed distributions, the QR-based global test delivers substantially greater power, while the QR-based monitoring procedures offer higher bubble detection rate and more accurate dating of the bubble origination. As an illustration, we conduct a pseudo real-time monitoring exercise with the S&P 500 composite index.},

  abstract     = {Periodically collapsing bubbles, if they exist, induce asymmetric dynamics in asset prices. In this article, I show that unit root quantile autoregressive models can approximate such dynamics by allowing the largest autoregressive root to take values below unity at low quantiles, which correspond to price crashes, and above unity at upper quantiles, that correspond to bubble expansions. On this basis, I employ two unit root tests based on quantile autoregressions to detect bubbles. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the two tests have good size and power properties, and can outperform recursive least-squares-based tests. The merits of the two tests are further illustrated in three empirical applications that examine Bitcoin, US equity and US housing markets. In the empirical applications, special attention is given to the issue of controlling for economic fundamentals. The estimation results indicate the presence of asymmetric dynamics that closely match those of the simulated bubble processes.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a new ordinary least squares (OLS)-based procedure for retrospectively dating the emergence and collapse of bubbles. We first consider a data generating process that entails a switch from a unit root regime to an explosive regime followed by a collapse and subsequent return to unit root behavior. We demonstrate analytically that the standard OLS estimates are inconsistent and date both the origination and implosion points with a delay in large samples. A simple modification that involves omitting the residual corresponding to the implosion date is shown to yield consistent estimates. We also develop an efficient dating algorithm that can accommodate a framework with multiple bubbles. The algorithm exploits the explicit form of the unit root restrictions to directly embed them into the recursive optimization problem which obviates the need to rely on an iterative scheme that requires initial values. Extensive simulation experiments indicate that our proposed procedure typically delivers estimates with lower bias and root mean squared error relative to competing alternatives. An empirical illustration is included.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new class of modified regression-based tests for detecting asset price bubbles designed to be robust to the presence of general forms of both conditional and unconditional heteroskedasticity in the price series. This modification, based on the approach developed in Beare (2018) in the context of conventional unit root testing, is achieved by purging the impact of unconditional heteroskedasticity from the data using a kernel estimate of volatility before the application of the bubble detection methods proposed in Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015) (PSY). The modified statistic is shown to achieve the same limiting null distribution as the corresponding (heteroskedasticity-uncorrected) statistic from PSY would obtain under homoskedasticity, such that the usual critical values provided in PSY may still be used. Versions of the test based on regressions including either no intercept or a (redundant) intercept are considered. Representations for asymptotic local power against a single bubble model are also derived. Monte Carlo simulation results highlight that neither one of these tests dominates the other across different bubble locations and magnitudes, and across different models of time-varying volatility. Accordingly, we also propose a test based on a union of rejections between the with- and without-intercept variants of the modified PSY test. The union procedure is shown to perform almost as well as the better of the constituent tests for a given DGP, and also performs very well compared to existing heteroskedasticity-robust tests across a large range of simulation DGPs.},

Further refinements, such as the point-optimal linear test, approach the power envelope remarkably closely.

These developments have fueled an unprecedented frenzy in the Nasdaq, with AI-focused companies experiencing soaring stock prices that raise concerns about speculative bubbles and real-economy consequences. Against this background, this study investigates the formation of speculative bubbles in the Nasdaq stock market with a specific focus on the so-called Magnificent Seven (Mag-7) individual stocks during the AI boom, spanning the period from January 2017 to January 2025. We apply the real-time PSY bubble detection methodology of Phillips et al. (2015a, 2015b) while controlling for market and industry factors for individual stocks. Confidence intervals to assess the degree of speculative behavior in asset price dynamics are calculated using the near-unit root approach of Phillips (2023). The findings reveal the presence of speculative bubbles in the Nasdaq stock market and across all Mag-7 stocks. Nvidia and Microsoft experience the longest speculative periods over January 2017–December 2021, while Nvidia and Tesla show the fastest rates of explosive behavior. Speculative bubbles persist in the market and in six of the seven stocks (excluding Apple) from December 2022 to January 2025. Near-unit-root inference indicates mildly explosive dynamics for Nvidia and Tesla (2017–2021) and local-to-unity near explosive behavior for all assets in both periods.},
