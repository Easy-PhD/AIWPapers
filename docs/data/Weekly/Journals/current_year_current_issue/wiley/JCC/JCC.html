  abstract     = {Despite the widespread success of the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) method in molecular simulations, its high computational cost due to dense molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) sampling limits its application in large-scale systems. Here we present DF-RESP, which combines the density fitting MEP (DF-MEP) method with RESP charge derivation to dramatically accelerate calculations while maintaining accuracy. Compared to conventional RESP calculations, DF-RESP achieves excellent accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) in charges below 0.003 e for the S22 benchmark and electrostatic interaction energy deviations under 0.1 kcal/mol. For androgen receptor–ligand complexes, DF-RESP achieves an MAE of less than 0.06 kcal/mol. Notably, DF-RESP precisely captures conformational energy variations in Ser-Ala-Gly tripeptide dynamics through charge analysis and achieves a 14-fold speedup for the 1493-atom protein 1h59 while maintaining comparable accuracy. These results demonstrate that DF-RESP is a computationally efficient and reliable approach for RESP charge calculations in large-scale biomolecular simulations.},

  abstract     = {Small titanium dioxide clusters (with = 1–10) are promising photocatalysts for conversion; however, their size-dependent stability and reactivity are not fully characterized. This study uses density functional theory (M06/def2-TZVP) and global and local reactivity descriptors to identify “magic number” clusters that exhibit high stability. The stability function ( ), reveals = 2, 4, and 8 as magic numbers. Electrophilicity analysis ( ) shows moderate electrophilicity for = 1–5 and strong electrophilicity for = 7–10, while the magic numbers display reduced reactivity. Fukui functions and fractional occupation number-weighted density ( ) highlight localized reactivity. Notably, they reveal = 6 to be highly electrophilic, with distinct “hot” electron sites. interaction energies inversely correlate with cluster stability: unstable clusters ( = 3, 5, and 9) strongly bind (up to 0.72 eV), while magic numbers weakly physisorb it (e.g., 0.45 eV for = 8). Non-covalent interaction (NCI) analysis confirms Ti–OCO attraction and C-repulsive sites. Together, these results establish design principles for cluster catalysts that balance stability with tailored reactivity for activation.},

  abstract     = {Calcium bismuth chloride (Ca 3 BiCl 3 ), an accessible and nontoxic chemical, exhibits considerable promise as a photovoltaic absorber material. This research investigates the structural, optical, and electrical properties of Ca 3 BiCl 3 utilizing the CASTEP module in the context of density functional theory (DFT). To enhance the photovoltaic efficacy of Ca 3 BiCl 3 -based solar cells (SCs), two hole transport layers (HTLs), Spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT, and two electron transport layers (ETLs), C 60 and WS 2 , were investigated. The Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D) was utilized to undertake a comprehensive numerical analysis of Ca 3 BiCl 3 SCs, employing essential semiconductor equations such as Poisson's equation, the carrier continuity equations, and the drift-diffusion model. A comprehensive parameter analysis was performed, including factors such as layer thickness, doping density, temperature, carrier production and recombination rates, defect densities at the interfaces and the bulk material, quantum efficiency, and series vs. shunt resistance. After optimizing the ETL and HTL settings, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 27.54% was attained using WS 2 as the ETL and P3HT as the HTL. This arrangement produced a short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 23.393 mA/cm 2 , an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.313 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 89.64%. The results highlight the significant potential of Ca 3 BiCl 3 as an effective absorber material, especially in conjunction with WS 2 and P3HT, for the progression of high-efficiency perovskite heterostructure SCs.},

  abstract     = {Frontier molecular orbitals play a crucial role in determining the magnetic behavior and exchange interactions in organic radicals. In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanism influencing the need for orbital planarity and the role of frontier orbital overlap in magnetic exchange interactions. To study this, we designed a series of 12 polyacene-coupled triarylmethyl diradicals, systematically increasing in length of polyacene. We have used nine different DFT functionals for the calculation of the magnetic exchange coupling constant ( J ). The calculation of magnetic exchange coupling reveals that the GGA functionals define a more accurate spin state, hence more correct magnetic behavior than the meta-GGA and hybrid functionals. We have studied the effect of orbital orientation and their energy gap to understand the high magnetic exchange coupling in the higher polyacene-coupled diradicals. Our calculations revealed that the planarity and overlap of the frontier molecular orbitals are one of the key factors in influencing the strength and behavior of the magnetic exchange interactions in diradicals. Specifically, the overlap between SOMOs and LUMO influences the strength of the magnetic exchange interaction.},

  abstract     = {Molecules that have been suggested to violate the Hund's rule, having a first excited singlet state ( ) energetically below the triplet state ( ), are rare. Yet, they hold the promise to be efficient light emitters. Their high-throughput identification demands exceptionally accurate excited-state modeling to minimize qualitatively wrong predictions. We benchmark twelve energy gaps to find that the local-correlated versions of ADC(2) and CC2 excited state methods deliver excellent accuracy and speed for screening medium-sized molecules. Notably, we find that double-hybrid DFT approximations (e.g., B2GP-PLYP and PBE-QIDH) exhibit high mean absolute errors ( ) despite very low standard deviations ( ). Exploring their parameter space reveals that a configuration with 75% exchange and 55% correlation, which reduces the mean absolute error to below 5 meV, but with an increased variance. Using this low-bias parameterization as an internal reference, we correct the systematic error while maintaining low variance, effectively combining the strengths of both low-bias and low-variance DFT parameterizations to enhance overall accuracy. Our findings suggest that low-variance DFT methods, often overlooked due to their high bias, can serve as reliable tools for predictive modeling in first-principles molecular design. The bias-correction data-fitting procedure can be applied to any general problem where two flavors of a method, one with low bias and another with low variance, have been identified a priori.},
