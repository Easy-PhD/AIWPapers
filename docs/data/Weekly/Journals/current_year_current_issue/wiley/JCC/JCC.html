  abstract     = {Understanding the structure of metal-ligand complexes is essential for catalyst design, materials development, and biochemical modeling. Metal carbonyls are especially relevant due to their diverse structures and electronic features. Here, we benchmarked seventeen density functionals (B3LYP, BP86, CAM–B3LYP, M06, M06L, PBE, PBE0, r 2 SCAN, r 2 SCAN–3c, revPBE, revTPSS, RPBE, TPSS, TPSS0, TPSSh, B97, and B97X) combined with three dispersion schemes (D3zero, D3BJ, D4) and also tested calculations without dispersion correction, totaling fifty-four approaches. Their ability to reproduce geometries, structural parameters, and CO stretching frequencies was assessed for thirty-four Mn(I) and Re(I) carbonyls obtained from the CCDC. Relative electronic energies were further compared using DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations, alongside evaluation of computational cost. Our results highlight that hybrid meta-GGA and meta-GGA functionals, particularly TPSSh(D3zero) and r 2 SCAN(D3BJ, D4), offer the best balance between accuracy and efficiency, providing reliable structures, vibration properties, and energetics consistent with high-level DLPNO-CCSD(T) references.},

  abstract     = {We optimize a Stillinger–Weber (SW) interatomic potential for ZnS monolayers to enable reliable large-scale molecular dynamics across planar, disordered, and curved morphologies. Using force matching algorithm (POTFIT) incorporating referenced density-functional-theory (SIESTA/PBE) forces gathered from diverse finite-temperature trajectories of monolayer ZnS, we refit the parameters due to by Zhou et al.

For the monolayer, the phonon dispersion closely tracks DFT, notably correcting the optical branches. Moreover, the curvature-law fit ) to nanotube data extrapolates to negligible strain in the flat limit ( ), reinforcing the reliability of the optimized parameters for planar geometries. The optimized SW parameters demonstrate transferability, yielding an improved bonding network in 2D disordered geometries and thermally stable single-walled ZnS tubes. Quantitatively, curved-structure tests then yield an effective bending modulus and thermal shape fluctuations scaling as , indicating a practical stability threshold near 40 Å. Collectively, our optimized SW potential is a computationally efficient model that produces better vibrational, mechanical, and curvature energetics of various flat and curved geometries without sacrificing baseline thermodynamics. The model carries limitations due to the absence of explicit long-range electrostatics (and polarization).},

A combined theoretical and computational approach has been applied to focus on roto-vibrational features in dielectric spectra of as well as the origin of ferroelectric behavior in . The centrifugal stabilization of JT-active excited states in and strong PJT coupling in clusters of are crucial for exploring observed spectral and structural phenomena. The construction of diabatic Hamiltonians from ab initio adiabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs) and non-adiabatic coupling terms (NACTs) enables accurate quantum dynamics on both systems. We highlight the effectiveness of model and ab initio Hamiltonians in capturing spectral features and spontaneous polarization, and thereby, establish a framework for understanding vibronic interactions in complex oxides.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogenase enzymes play a crucial role in generating energy for microorganisms by catalyzing the reversible oxidation of molecular hydrogen to protons. This catalytic mechanism has been well studied using computational models of varying complexity, ranging from smaller QM-cluster models of the enzyme active site to QM/MM models that capture the full enzyme structure. However, differences among studies have produced conflicting predictions for the energetics of certain reaction steps. This work focuses on characterizing one step—a cysteine–histidine proton transfer of Desulfovibrio fructosovorans [Ni, Fe]-hydrogenase—using a series of QM-cluster models to explore how model design influences predicted reaction thermodynamics. The Residue Interaction Network-based ResidUe Selector (RINRUS) toolkit was used to systematically create QM-cluster models based on either inter-residue distances or contact metrics from the active site [Ni, Fe] cluster. It is shown that QM-cluster models can achieve reaction energy predictions comparable to QM/MM and “big-QM” models when active site models are designed based on inter-residue contact interactions and with careful consideration of charged residues. Distance-based residue selection, a common strategy for QM-cluster model design, is not as effective compared to the RINRUS rules-based residue ranking approach from inter-residue contact counts. Large differences between previously reported QM and QM/MM reaction energies are resolved with RINRUS-based models, even at a modest level of electronic structure theory (B3LYP with modified LANL2DZ(d) basis sets/effective core potentials on metal atoms and 6-31G(d′)/6-31G on nonmetal atoms). Overall, this [Ni, Fe]-hydrogenase case study underscores the need for careful model design when studying complex biological systems and demonstrates how RINRUS can provide a framework towards addressing this challenge.},
