  abstract     = {Phenalenyl is known for its highly delocalized radical structure, making it a fundamental building block in the construction of polyradical compounds. This study explores how different connection topologies between phenalenyl units via acetylenic bridges modulate the polyradical character, as well as the electronic and magnetic properties of the resulting systems. The connection type depends on the atom occupation pattern of the phenalenyl singly occupied orbital (SOMO). Three types of connections are defined that induce different π conjugation strength. Linear di- and tetra-phenalenyl chains and cyclic tri- and tetra-phenalenyl aggregates have been investigated. High-level multireference averaged coupled cluster (MR-AQCC) calculations were performed to describe the electronic structures of these compounds. The polyradical character of the oligomers is assessed using descriptors such as singlet-triplet splitting, effectively unpaired electrons ( N U ). Additionally, the harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA), multicenter index (MCI), fluctuation index (FLU), nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICS (1)), and the anisotropy of the current-induced density (ACID) analysis are employed to characterize the influence of the phenalenyl linkages on aromaticity. Results indicate that bridges enabling stronger interaction between the SOMOs of phenalenyl units lead to a reduction in polyradical character. Aromaticity analysis corroborates these findings, revealing decreased aromaticity in rings where electron interaction occurs through the bridge. On the contrary, choosing bridging types of weak interaction leads to strong open shell character providing candidates for molecular magnetism. A comparison with the predictions of Ovchinnikov's rule is carried out both to rationalize the outcomes of the quantum chemical calculations and to highlight limitations of the rule, particularly in the treatment of quasi-degenerate states.},

  abstract     = {Despite the widespread success of the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) method in molecular simulations, its high computational cost due to dense molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) sampling limits its application in large-scale systems. Here we present DF-RESP, which combines the density fitting MEP (DF-MEP) method with RESP charge derivation to dramatically accelerate calculations while maintaining accuracy. Compared to conventional RESP calculations, DF-RESP achieves excellent accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) in charges below 0.003 e for the S22 benchmark and electrostatic interaction energy deviations under 0.1 kcal/mol. For androgen receptor–ligand complexes, DF-RESP achieves an MAE of less than 0.06 kcal/mol. Notably, DF-RESP precisely captures conformational energy variations in Ser-Ala-Gly tripeptide dynamics through charge analysis and achieves a 14-fold speedup for the 1493-atom protein 1h59 while maintaining comparable accuracy. These results demonstrate that DF-RESP is a computationally efficient and reliable approach for RESP charge calculations in large-scale biomolecular simulations.},

This research investigates the structural, optical, and electrical properties of Ca 3 BiCl 3 utilizing the CASTEP module in the context of density functional theory (DFT). To enhance the photovoltaic efficacy of Ca 3 BiCl 3 -based solar cells (SCs), two hole transport layers (HTLs), Spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT, and two electron transport layers (ETLs), C 60 and WS 2 , were investigated. The Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D) was utilized to undertake a comprehensive numerical analysis of Ca 3 BiCl 3 SCs, employing essential semiconductor equations such as Poisson's equation, the carrier continuity equations, and the drift-diffusion model. A comprehensive parameter analysis was performed, including factors such as layer thickness, doping density, temperature, carrier production and recombination rates, defect densities at the interfaces and the bulk material, quantum efficiency, and series vs. shunt resistance. After optimizing the ETL and HTL settings, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 27.54% was attained using WS 2 as the ETL and P3HT as the HTL. This arrangement produced a short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 23.393 mA/cm 2 , an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.313 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 89.64%. The results highlight the significant potential of Ca 3 BiCl 3 as an effective absorber material, especially in conjunction with WS 2 and P3HT, for the progression of high-efficiency perovskite heterostructure SCs.},

  abstract     = {Frontier molecular orbitals play a crucial role in determining the magnetic behavior and exchange interactions in organic radicals. In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanism influencing the need for orbital planarity and the role of frontier orbital overlap in magnetic exchange interactions. To study this, we designed a series of 12 polyacene-coupled triarylmethyl diradicals, systematically increasing in length of polyacene. We have used nine different DFT functionals for the calculation of the magnetic exchange coupling constant ( J ). The calculation of magnetic exchange coupling reveals that the GGA functionals define a more accurate spin state, hence more correct magnetic behavior than the meta-GGA and hybrid functionals. We have studied the effect of orbital orientation and their energy gap to understand the high magnetic exchange coupling in the higher polyacene-coupled diradicals. Our calculations revealed that the planarity and overlap of the frontier molecular orbitals are one of the key factors in influencing the strength and behavior of the magnetic exchange interactions in diradicals. Specifically, the overlap between SOMOs and LUMO influences the strength of the magnetic exchange interaction.},

Yet, they hold the promise to be efficient light emitters. Their high-throughput identification demands exceptionally accurate excited-state modeling to minimize qualitatively wrong predictions. We benchmark twelve energy gaps to find that the local-correlated versions of ADC(2) and CC2 excited state methods deliver excellent accuracy and speed for screening medium-sized molecules. Notably, we find that double-hybrid DFT approximations (e.g., B2GP-PLYP and PBE-QIDH) exhibit high mean absolute errors ( ) despite very low standard deviations ( ). Exploring their parameter space reveals that a configuration with 75% exchange and 55% correlation, which reduces the mean absolute error to below 5 meV, but with an increased variance. Using this low-bias parameterization as an internal reference, we correct the systematic error while maintaining low variance, effectively combining the strengths of both low-bias and low-variance DFT parameterizations to enhance overall accuracy. Our findings suggest that low-variance DFT methods, often overlooked due to their high bias, can serve as reliable tools for predictive modeling in first-principles molecular design. The bias-correction data-fitting procedure can be applied to any general problem where two flavors of a method, one with low bias and another with low variance, have been identified a priori.},

This paper provides a thorough examination of the structural, electronic, elastic, mechanical, optical, and thermodynamic features of K 2 AlInZ 6 (Z = F, Cl, Br) double perovskites by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The structural characteristics, encompassing lattice parameters and formation energies, validate the stability of these materials, which exhibit a cubic configuration with the Fm-3m space group. The electronic band structure calculations with the modified Becke-Johnson exchange potential indicate indirect band gaps for K 2 AlInZ 6 (Z = F, Cl, Br), with band gaps of 3.73, 2.88, and 2.41 eV for K 2 AlInF 6 , K 2 AlInCl 6 , and K 2 AlInBr 6 , respectively, rendering them viable candidates for optoelectronic applications. The estimated elastic constants, bulk modulus, and shear modulus demonstrate mechanical stability, indicating their suitability for durable and flexible devices. The optical characteristics, including dielectric functions and absorption spectra, exhibit considerable absorption in the ultraviolet range, indicating their potential use in photovoltaic systems. Furthermore, the thermodynamic characteristics are examined by assessing formation energy and Debye temperature. The negative formation energies of these materials signify their strong thermodynamic stability, whereas the Debye temperature analysis elucidates their lattice vibrations and heat capacity, further substantiating their stability and applicability in diverse energy technologies. At 800 K, K 2 AlInF 6 , K 2 AlInCl 6 , and K 2 AlInBr 6 show Seebeck coefficients of ~150, ~160, and ~135 μV/K, respectively, with κ e / τ rising to ~4.0–4.75 × 10 14 W/mKs.

  abstract     = {Electric dipole moments are widely employed in structural biology and computational chemistry as global descriptors of macromolecular charge distribution, contributing to the understanding of protein interactions, solvation, and orientation in external fields. However, for systems bearing a nonzero net charge, the dipole moment becomes explicitly dependent on the choice of coordinates origin, a consequence grounded in classical electrostatics and sometimes overlooked in structural analyses. This origin-dependence is particularly relevant in biological systems, as proteins are typically charged at physiological pH which differs from their isoelectric points (pI's). Moreover, coordinate manipulations such as centering and alignment are routinely performed during molecular dynamics simulations, docking, and structural comparisons, potentially altering the calculated dipole moment of charged systems. This study reviews the theory of the changes in the dipole moment of charged macromolecules accompanying displacements of the origin of the coordinates system. The theory is illustrated by numerical examples on representative proteins. Using the classical expression , we demonstrate that displacements of the order of a protein's radius of gyration or larger can induce dipoles several hundreds to thousands of debyes. We examine this effect across a range of proteins with varying sizes and identify trends correlating the extent of origin-induced changes with molecular size. These examples highlight the need for standardization in defining coordinate systems in dipole-related analyses. The quantum mechanical status of the dipole moment operator is discussed clarifying that only neutral systems satisfy Dirac's criteria for a true “observable”. Altogether, theory, numerical benchmarks, practical guidelines, and pedagogical insights are presented for reliably calculating and interpreting dipole moments of charged biological macromolecules.},
