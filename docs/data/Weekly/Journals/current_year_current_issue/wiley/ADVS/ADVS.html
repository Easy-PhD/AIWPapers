  abstract     = {Cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRGlc) systematically decreases with advancing age. We sought to identify correlates of decreased CMRGlc in the spectral properties of fMRI signals imaged in the task-free state. Lifespan resting-state fMRI data acquired in 455 healthy adults (ages 18–87 years) and cerebral metabolic data acquired in a separate cohort of 94 healthy adults (ages 25–45 years, 65–85 years) were analyzed. The spectral properties of the fMRI data were characterized in terms of the relative predominance of slow versus fast activity using the spectral slope (SS) measure. We found that the relative proportion of fast activity increases with advancing age (SS flattening) across most cortical regions. The regional distribution of spectral slope was topographically correlated with CMRGlc in young adults. Notably, whereas most older adults maintain a youthful pattern of SS topography, a distinct subset of older adults significantly diverged from the youthful pattern. This subset of older adults also diverged from the youthful pattern of CMRGlc metabolism. This divergent pattern was associated with T2-weighted signal changes in frontal lobe white matter, an independent marker of small vessel disease. These findings suggest that BOLD signal spectral slope flattening may represent a biomarker of age-associated neurometabolic pathology.},

  abstract     = {Vacancy engineering is widely considered an effective approach to modulate the internal electronic structure of electrode materials, enhancing charge-transfer processes/reactions and leading to excellent energy storage properties. Nevertheless, several current techniques of vacancy engineering, such as controlled solvent thermal growth, plasma bombardment, and chemical etching, suffer from high energy inputs and uncontrollable processing kinetics. Herein, a facile and energy-efficient technique of metal ion-assisted shear exfoliation is proposed to synthesize 2D MoS 2 with edge S-vacancies as an anode for sodium ion batteries. Thanks to the implementation of this vacancy technique, few-layer MoS 2 anode with sulfur defects at the edge presents remarkable rate performance (399.91 mAh g −1 at a current density of 5 A g −1 ) and demonstrates high average capacity with exceptional stability (460.71 mAh g −1 at 1 A g −1 after 100 cycles) when utilized in sodium-ion batteries. The superior electrochemical performance of this elaborate anode can be ascribed to the enhanced electrochemical kinetics and reaction reversibility resulting from the presence of a vacancy defect architecture. This study is expected to provide an effective avenue to develop vacancy defect electrodes for advanced batteries.},

  abstract     = {The performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is crucially affected by the anodic stability of Li-metal and cathodic conversion kinetics of sulfur-carbon (S/C) composites. Herein, a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) with moderate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) solubility, consisting of 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) in non-fluorinated solvent of cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) additive, is employed in Li-S batteries to simultaneously achieve high anodic stability and appropriate cathodic kinetics. This WSE exhibits a good capability of suppressing LiPSs shuttling by forming an anions-dominated Li + solvation structure, effectively inducing a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to guarantee anodic stability of the Li-metal anode. Additionally, the DOL additive in the WSE aids in forming a thin organic-inorganic hybrid cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the surface of S/Li 2 S particles, which maintains good conversion kinetics and suppresses dead S/Li 2 S growth in the S/C cathode. Consequently, Li-S batteries with the WSE deliver a high initial capacity (≈1208 mAh g −1 ), a high average Coulombic efficiency (≈98.6%), and a high capacity retention rate (≈82.4%) over 200 cycles. Stable cycling performance over 100 cycles is also observed in the Li-S pouch cell with the WSE even under harsh conditions.},

  abstract     = {CD47 inhibitors have emerged as promising candidates in cancer immunotherapy by activating macrophage phagocytosis through CD47/SIRPα signal blockade and enhancing dendritic cell antigen presentation. However, their clinical efficacy remains limited and is accompanied by severe side effects, including anemia and hemagglutination. To address these limitations, a localized delivery strategy is developed using lipid nanoparticles to encapsulate mRNA encoding a secreted CD47 inhibitor. This mRNA-derived CD47 inhibitor effectively activated macrophages against cancer cells in vitro. To improve its modest tumor-suppressive effects in vivo, a combination therapy is formulated by co-delivering mRNAs encoding the CD47 inhibitor and a cytokine cocktail (interleukins 12, 15, and 21), achieving synergistic antitumor effects. Notably, this strategy induces robust systemic antitumor immunity and long-lasting immunological memory, effectively suppressing metastatic tumor progression following localized treatment of the primary tumor. Mechanistically, the mRNA-derived CD47 inhibitor promoted the differentiation of conventional type 1 dendritic cells, facilitating T cell cross-priming and activating cytotoxic T cells. Additionally, the cytokine cocktail further augmented the antitumor activity of these cytotoxic T cells. These findings present a promising strategy for advancing clinical cancer treatment, addressing key challenges associated with current CD47 inhibitor therapies.},

Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-exos) hold promise for treating immune-related diseases, while their clinical application is hindered by the limited production and non-specific organ distribution. In this study, a combined engineering strategy is developed for MSC-exo via aggregation culture and genetic editing, achieving a substantial increase in both exosome yield and therapeutic specificity in SLE. First, MSCs produce a high yield of engineered exosomes through an aggregation culture engineering strategy (Agg-exo), demonstrating immune organ targeting and promoting Tregs via the Foxp1/STAT5/Foxp3 axis. Then, MSCs are engineered by overexpressing Foxp1 in order to acquire Foxp1 high Agg-exo with enhanced immunomodulatory properties, which showes superior therapeutic effect for SLE. Taken together, a newly dual-engineering strategy is developed to produce high-yield, Foxp1 high Agg-exo, which solved the limitation of low-yield production and non-specific organ distribution of MSC-exos. This innovative strategy holds great potential for the development of exosome-based therapies in autoimmune diseases.},

However, the limited availability of animal and cellular models that accurately replicate early DLB pathogenesis hampers the understanding of how Aβ plaques influence α-synuclein (αSyn) pathologies. This study addresses this gap by co-culturing primary neurons with adult hippocampal brain slices from either wild-type or Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice containing abundant Aβ plaques and cytokines. Neurons exposed to AD slices showed impaired dynein-dependent organelle trafficking, reducing endosome–lysosome fusion and causing defective degradation of amyloidogenic αSyn fibrils, thus increasing αSyn inclusions. Notably, an abnormal pre-accumulation of dynein in AD mice suggests that dysfunctional dynein may serve as a nucleation site for αSyn aggregation upon exposure to pathogenic fibrils. Furthermore, Rab7 activation successfully restored endo-lysosomal degradation of αSyn fibrils and reduced inclusion formation in mouse models presenting with both Lewy body and Aβ pathologies. These results highlight the dynein-dependent endo-lysosomal pathway as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating αSyn-related pathologies in co-existing Aβ burden, characteristic of many DLB cases.},

Endothelial cell dysfunction is the primary inducer of cardiovascular events, and it is associated with hypoglycemia-triggered cytokine release and inflammatory programmed cell death. A comprehensive understanding of lineage-specific variations in pathological vascular changes is essential to mitigate cardiovascular events and ensure therapeutic efficacy. Herein, unbiased clustering analyses and single-nucleus RNA sequencing are performed on cells of the thoracic aorta in db/db and insulin-induced hypoglycemic db/db mice. Comparative analyses show changes in lineage-specific genes, subpopulation composition, intercellular communication, and molecular biology in hypoglycemic diabetic mice. The analyses also revealed the changes of different cells, particularly endothelial cell PANoptosis, macrophage inflammatory polarization, and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) fibrosis. Pseudo-time sequencing, differential expression, and regulation network analyses revealed the association of potential hub genes Klf2 , ETS2 , Elavl1 , C3 , and Nr4a1 with the mentioned pathological processes. It is demonstrated that hypoglycemia induces VSMC fibrosis in vivo, whereas Angptl4 knockdown can attenuate VSMC fibrosis in vitro. These findings demonstrate the hypoglycemic macroangiopathy mechanism and provide important references for future disease intervention and treatment.},

  abstract     = {Since the properties of electron transfer and orbital interactions in oxygen electrocatalysts are highly spin-dependent, reaction kinetics and thermodynamics are very sensitive to the spin configuration. However, understanding the spin-related origin of catalytic activity in heterogeneous molecular electrocatalysts still remains challenging. Herein, a molecular-atomic coupled catalyst is constructed by integrating iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules with Fe-N 4 atomic sites anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (FePc-Fe-NCNT). The strong electronic coupling between FePc and the Fe-N 4 -containing carbon substrate triggers a transition of the Fe sites from a low-spin state to an intermediate-spin state. Additionally, the formation of σ* bonds between the electron-injected perpendicular d z2 orbitals of intermediate-spin Fe and the 2p orbitals of adsorbed oxygen species suppresses site blocking and accelerates OH* desorption, thereby enhancing the reaction kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The resulting catalyst exhibits exceptional ORR activity in alkaline media, reaching a half-wave potential of 0.89 V and negligible degradation after 10,000 cycles. Remarkably, the quasi-solid-state Zinc-air battery based on this prepared catalyst operates stably from −40 to 70 °C with minimal performance loss. This work reveals a spin-state manipulation strategy for the development of advanced molecular catalysts and provides new insights into the regulation of electronic structure for energy conversion technologies.},

  abstract     = {Historically, directly injecting therapeutics into tumors has been deemed suboptimal and less favorable in clinical settings compared to systemic administration due to the inability to eradicate circulating/metastatic tumor cells until the emergence of the concept of in situ vaccine. In situ vaccine leverages patients’ own tumors as a pool of antigens to elicit systemic antitumor immunity (also known as “abscopal effect”) that aims to eliminate both primary and distal/metastatic tumors. One typical example of an approved product is Talimogene laherparepvec, an oncolytic virus approved in 2015 for treating advanced melanoma. To improve the effectiveness and the biosafety of in situ vaccines, various approaches have emerged, including new generations of oncolytic viruses, engineered bacteria, cytokine treatment, immune adjuvants, nanotechnology-enabled formulations, and photo/radio-therapies, showing remarkable promise in preclinical and clinical settings. These conceptual advances offer tailored solutions to challenges such as low antigen availability, limited immune activation, and side effects. In this review, we explore the current landscape of in situ cancer vaccines, categorizing them based on their functional formulations and highlighting their conceptual innovation in cancer immunotherapy.

  abstract     = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is regarded as green cancer that seriously endangers human quality of life. Orally administered probiotic treatment has been regarded as a promising strategy for the adjunctive treatment of IBD. However, its efficacy is greatly inhibited due to the harsh gut microenvironment and low targeted delivery volume. Herein, carbon dots are applied to modify Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (C dots@LGG) to enhance the anti-inflammatory and injury healing effects of probiotics. The C-dots coating bestowed probiotics with a remarkable antioxidant capability, thereby mitigating inflammation and safeguarding LGG from the rigors of gastrointestinal circumstances and oxidative harm within the inflamed colon, as well as facilitating its adhesion and colonization. Conjointly, C dots@LGG reconstructs the intestinal barrier by spurring the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells, especially goblet cells, and enhancing the intercellular tight junction (TJ). Moreover, C dots@LGG with enhanced metabolic capacity regulated the gut microbiota by enriching its diversity, suppressing the multiplication of harmful bacteria, and fostering that of beneficial bacteria. Collectively, these combined effects endow C dots@LGG to effectively attenuate mice colitis and promote injury healing in vivo. Given its simple synthesis protocol, it is anticipated that C dots@LGG can provide an effective approach for the collaborative non-immunosuppressive therapy for IBD.},

  abstract     = {The growing threat of fungal infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, is exacerbated by the limited number of antifungal drug classes, increasing resistance rates, and complex hostpathogen interactions. In response to this public health concern, the World Health Organization published its first list of fungal priority pathogens, including C. auris, A. fumigatus, C. neoformans, and C. albicans. These species exhibit multidrug resistance, virulence plasticity, and enhanced biofilm-forming capacity, which contributes to antifungal tolerance and complicates treatment outcomes. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as promising alternatives due to their broad-spectrum activity, rapid membrane-disrupting mechanisms, and low propensity to induce resistance. This review provides an in-depth analysis of AMP-based antifungal strategies, integrating insights from structureactivity relationships, molecular engineering, and targeted delivery systems. Strategies such as peptide hybridization, cyclization, PEGylation, and nanoparticle conjugation are examined to enhance stability, specificity, and pharmacokinetics. Opportunities for rational AMP design are also discussed, leveraging computational toolsincluding machine learning and deep learning approachesalongside immunoproteomic targeting. Together, these multidisciplinary advances underscore the potential of AMPs as next-generation therapeutics against critical fungal pathogens. Nonetheless, clinical translation remains challenging, requiring continued investment in formulation science, regulatory alignment, and translational development pipelines.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous zinc-manganese oxide (Zn-MNO) batteries represent a compelling solution for grid-scale energy storage due to their inherent safety, cost-effectiveness and ecological compatibility. However, the commercialization of this technology faces critical challenges including insufficient electrode durability, limited areal capacity output, and fundamentally ambiguous charge storage principles, which collectively hinder practical implementation. Through systematic mechanistic investigation, a previously overlooked phase evolution paradigm is revealed. It involves that Mn 3 O 4 cathode undergoes a partially in situ phase transition to MnO 2 during the initial charging process, forming a hybrid Mn 3 O 4 /MnO 2 cathode. This self-optimized heterostructure synergistically combines structural reinforcement frameworks with enhanced ion-transport networks, enabling exceptional cycling stability over 4,500 cycles while maintaining record-high areal capacity (10 mAh cm −2 ). The clarified dual-ion (H + /Zn 2+ ) coordination mechanism and stabilized Mn 2+ /MnO 2 redox chemistry establish new design principles for manganese-based cathodes. More importantly, unprecedented scalability is demonstrated through constructing pouch cells (200 mAh) with 1000-cycle durability, achieving a practical energy density of 54 Wh kg −1 . The integrated solar-powered battery system exhibits remarkable operational safety under extreme conditions (piercing, cutting), representing one of the most practically viable Zn-MNO batteries reported to date. This work bridges fundamental mechanistic understanding with industrial-grade device engineering, charting a concrete pathway toward terawatt-hour scale renewable energy storage.},

Ion-pair interactions between PA and quaternary ammonium (QA) groups can effectively mitigate PA loss. Herein, polyphenylene-based quaternized membranes (BAF-QAF and C7-QAF) comprising distinct hydrophobic moieties [BAF = (perfluoropropane-2,2-diyl)dibenzene and C7 = 1,1-diphenylcycloheptane] and fluorenyl groups with pendant QA head groups are designed and used as PA-doped PEMs with low or no fluorine contents to realize high-temperature and low-humidity operability. The resulting membranes exhibited excellent PA retention, maintaining >85% of their initial proton conductivities at 90% relative humidity after 10 humidity cycles. PA-doped membranes PA-C7-QAF and PA-BAF-QAF exhibit superior proton conductivities of 60.3 and 58.4 mS cm −1 at 160 °C, respectively. PA-C7-QAF and PA-BAF-QAF fuel cells deliver peak power densities of 0.579 and 0.537 W cm −2 at 140 °C and 0.706 and 0.640 W cm −2 at 160 °C, respectively, under dehumidified conditions. The PA-C7-QAF cell also exhibits impressive durability with an average voltage decay of 30 µV h −1 (140 °C, 0.15 A cm −2 ) after an initial voltage drop.

Here, the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the drosophila GABA B receptor in both antagonist-bound inactive state and GABA-bound active state in complex with G i protein are reported. The drosophila GABA B receptor exhibits an asymmetric activation, mirroring its human homolog. However, a larger inactive interface prevents drosophila GABA B receptor constitutive activity. Four key residues, which are not conserved in drosophila GABA B receptor, are responsible for the activity of the positive allosteric modulator in its human homolog. Whereas the intracellular loop 2 of drosophila GB2 (dGB2) is less involved, the ordered C terminus of dGB2 and its corresponding region in its human homolog are required for G protein coupling. These evolutionary variations provide a complete understanding of the activation mechanism of the GABA B receptor and new insights for future development of allosteric modulators for medication and insecticides.},

This work reports a multifunctional material constructed via a double-network ionic hydrogel strategy, enabling the integrated realization of efficient electromagnetic shielding and self-powered physiological monitoring. An interpenetrating network skeleton is formed through physical crosslinking of sodium alginate (SA) with Ca 2 ⁺ and in situ polymerization of acrylamide (AM). By regulating the specific coordination of ions to induce directional channels and synergistically regulating salt concentration with hydration, an absorption-dominated shielding mechanism centered on ion polarization-interface relaxation is established. The optimized h -CA-PAM-Li⁺-1.0 hydrogel exhibits an electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (SE T ) of 63.75 dB in the X-band, with absorption loss accounting for over 93%. Leveraging the excellent ionic conductivity of the hydrogel, a self-powered sensor encapsulated in PDMS films and integrated with wireless modules is fabricated, capable of real-time capture of physiological signals such as heartbeat while maintaining high sensitivity and anti-interference capability in dynamic environments. Free of traditional conductive fillers, this material combines biocompatibility, low cost, and designability, providing a material-device-system integrated solution for electromagnetic protection and intelligent monitoring of implantable electronic devices and opening a new research paradigm for multifunctional shielding materials.},

Herein, photoactive 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid (HAC) is integrated into a binuclear dysprosium(III) complex, ( 1 ), which simultaneously exhibits dual light-responsive behaviors of both SMMs and macroscopic mechanical motion. The 365 nm light irradiation induces [4+4] photocycloaddition of anthracene units in 1 , driving a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation to a 1D coordination polymer [Dy₂(HAC)₂(DMF)₂(AC)₆]n ( 1A ). This structural reorganization boosts axial magnetic anisotropy, unlocking SMM behavior with a butterfly-shaped hysteresis loop, whereas thermal annealing regenerates the pristine structure and quenches magnetic bistability. Notably, anisotropic lattice strain from cycloaddition induces macroscopic photomechanical motions, triggering macroscopic torsional dynamics in bulk crystals and pronounced flexural deformations in thin film architectures.

SiC nanofibers, with their moderate dielectric constant and chemical inertness, are ideal multifunctional coating fillers. However, their single-component nature limits microwave attenuation, resulting in low efficiency and narrow bandwidth. Incorporating corrosion-resistant components and employing heterointerface engineering offers a promising strategy to enhance polarization loss and synergistically improve CR. In this study, SiC nanofibers synthesized via chemical vapor deposition are used as precursors; SiO 2 interlayers and nitrogen-doped carbon shells are sequentially introduced to form multilayered core–shell nanofibers. Abundant heterointerfaces and defects effectively regulate impedance matching and introduce multiple loss mechanisms, including conduction, interfacial, and defect-induced dipole polarization. The prepared SiC@SiO 2 @C (SSC) nanofibers achieve a minimum reflection loss of −52.40 dB, a maximum effective absorption bandwidth of 7.68 GHz, and a maximum radar cross-section reduction of 38.42 dB m 2 , demonstrating excellent MA properties. Moreover, SSC/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composite coatings exhibit superior CR performance, with significantly enhanced corrosion potential and reduced current density compared to pure metal and PVDF coatings. This study underscores the synergistic effect of heterointerface engineering in enhancing both MA and CR for harsh environments.},

  abstract     = {The optically pumped atomic magnetometer (OPAM) has emerged as an advanced instrument for magnetic field detection. However, the performance of conventional OPAMs is constrained by factors such as non-uniform atomic polarization and insufficient precision in system polarization control. In this study, a bidirectional-pump OPAM based on spin-decoupled metasurface is presented and experimentally demonstrated. By designing a metasurface structure with a predefined phase distribution, the system generates two circularly polarized (CP) lights with distinct chirality and one linearly polarized (LP) light. Two beams of the CP light are directed in opposite directions along both sides of the cell, which effectively mitigates the polarization gradient within the cell and enhances the stability of the system. Additionally, the use of zero-order LP light as the probe light for the system enhances energy utilization efficiency while simplifying the system architecture. The experimental results demonstrate that the OPAM based on metasurface successfully realizes precise control of atomic spin polarization. The proposed OPAM is capable of performing high-precision magnetic field measurements, and the sensitivity has been improved to 1.85 pT/Hz 1/2 . This research not only advances the application of metasurfaces in quantum precision measurement but also offers a novel approach for enhancing the performance of atomic magnetometers.},

  abstract     = {Nonequilibrium among phonon branches critically influences nanoscale heat transport yet remains largely unexplored in one-dimensional (1D) systems, particularly at cryogenic temperatures. This work reports the first experimental quantification of optical–acoustic phonon coupling factor ( G OA ) in single-walled carbon nanotubes using the frequency-domain energy transport state-resolved Raman technique at cryogenic and room temperatures. Remarkably, a strong suppression of G OA is observed at low temperatures that exceeds the suppression of the coupling of interfacial phonon modes. As temperature increases, G OA is found to increase monotonically, consistent with enhanced anharmonic decay processes of optical phonons. At 93 K, the optical–acoustic phonon temperature difference exceeds 75% of the acoustic phonon temperature rise, which is reduced to about 33% at room temperature. The critical role of laser heating size on phonon nonequilibrium is elucidated, where it gets amplified for a more confined heating size. By utilizing the recently developed equivalent interfacial medium model, the intrinsic temperature-dependent interfacial thermal conductance based on acoustic phonon temperature is obtained. The results show that neglecting the nonequilibrium among phonon branches overestimates the interfacial conductance by ≈30% at room temperature. This research provides fundamental insights into phonon nonequilibrium in 1D nanoscale materials that strongly impact next-generation nanoelectronics and solid-state energy converters.},

In this context, Na 3 Sc 2 (PO 4 ) 3 :Eu 3+ as a function of temperature and dopant ion concentration. As demonstrated, Na 3 Sc 2 (PO 4 ) 3 :Eu 3+ was investigated as a potential candidate. This material undergoes a reversible phase transition from a monoclinic to a trigonal structure, leading to significant changes in both the emission spectra and the luminescence decay of Eu 3+ ions. These effects enable the development of both ratiometric and lifetime-based luminescent thermometers, achieving maximum relative sensitivities of 3.4% K −1 and 1.0% K − 1, respectively. Furthermore, the thermal operating range can be tuned by adjusting the Eu 3+ concentration. Importantly, this study demonstrates, for the first time, temperature imaging using only Eu 3+ -doped phosphor via a digital camera without the use of optical filters. These results position Na 3 Sc 2 (PO 4 ) 3 :Eu 3+ as a promising multifunctional material for advanced applications in contactless temperature sensing and thermal imaging.},

  abstract     = {Characterizing the cell type-specific transcriptome is crucial for understanding the cellular and molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution and complex phenotypes. Here, single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq) is used to construct a cell transcriptomic atlas of 397,011 cells, representing 57 cell types, from 12 tissues in river and swamp buffalo, which exhibit significant divergence in milk production. Differential expression analyses identify metabolic and secretory tissues (i.e., liver, mammary gland, and pituitary) and cell types (e.g., hepatocytes, luminal cells, somatotropes, and lactotropes) that mediate the divergence of milk production. Lactotrope-specific downregulation of TRHDE in river buffalo is associated with high milk production. Integrative analyses of sc/snRNA-seq data with genomic data in buffalo and cattle reveal key cell types (e.g., luminal cells and excitatory neurons) and genes (e.g., RPL13 and LALBA ) associated with milk production. Ultimately, the Buffalo Cell Atlas (http://bovomicshub.com) will serve as a valuable resource for advancing buffalo genetics and genomics research, enabling cross-species comparative transcriptome studies and providing deeper insights into the regulation of milk synthesis and secretion.},

  abstract     = {Relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) remains the leading cause of MM mortality. FOXM1 is strongly associated with RRMM, making it a compelling therapeutic target. Through three low-throughput screenings, we have identified nine FDA-approved drugs, including the BH3 mimetic Venetoclax, that synergize with FOXM1 inhibitor NB73 in killing MM cells. Venetoclax has shown effects in 6% of non-t(11;14) and 27% of t(11;14) MM cases. The NB73-Venetoclax combination barely induces acute toxicity in vivo and represses MM cells in vivo and ex vivo. NB73 enhances the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of FOXM1, an effect further amplified by Venetoclax. The NB73-Venetoclax combination abolishes FOXM1's binding to promoters of key MYC pathway genes, such as PLK1, leading to significant downregulation of their expression. Furthermore, the PLK1-specific inhibitor GSK461364 synergizes with NB73 to inhibit MM cell growth. Interestingly, NB73 does not sensitize U266 cells, a Venetoclax-resistant t(11;14) MM cell line expressing high FOXM1, to Venetoclax treatment, which is corrected by a new-generation BH3 mimetic Sonrotoclax and ALK inhibitor Ceritinib. Collectively, targeting FOXM1 demonstrates significant potential for enhancing the efficacy of FDA-approved drugs in RRMM. These findings shed new light on the discouraging outcomes of the Phase-III CANOVA study centering Venetoclax with an encouraging molecular clue.},

Traditional AR displays struggle to simultaneously achieve large depth-of-field (DOF), large viewing eyebox, and wide field-of-view (FOV), which limits their practical applicability. Here, a novel AR near-eye display scheme is proposed that addresses these limitations, providing a large DOF, expansive eyebox, and wide FOV. The DOF is largely extended at each viewpoint on the eye pupil plane by directly projecting light rays onto the retina. Meanwhile, numerous viewpoints are generated in space to significantly expand the viewing eyebox, with each viewpoint independently controllable to dynamically track eye movements in real time without the need for mechanical steering parts. Freeform and holographic optics are deeply cooperated in the proposed off-axis display for achieving high performance over the full FOV, eyebox and DOF range, as well as compact form factor. A display system prototype is built, and the display results, featuring a DOF from 0.25 to 10 m, a 50° wide FOV, and a 10 mm×10 mm viewing eyebox, along with good optical see-through viewing, demonstrate the effectiveness and advancement of the proposed scheme, offering valuable insights for the future design of AR displays.},

  abstract     = {Herein, humidity-responsive 1D photonic crystal (PC) films are developed that are capable of generating higher-order photonic stop bands (PSBs). As a critical factor for achieving 2 nd - and 3 rd -order PSBs, the layer thickness is modulated to achieve multi-wavelength reflectivity within a single film. The films are fabricated using alternating layer deposition of photo-crosslinkable poly(2-vinylnaphthalene- co -benzophenone acrylate) (p(2VN- co -BPA)) and 52%-quaternized poly(4-vinylpyridine- co -benzophenone acrylate) (P4QP-52%). Upon increasing the relative humidity (RH), the films exhibit 1 st -, 2 nd -, and 3 rd -order PSBs with visible color transitions across the spectrum. This behavior becomes evident as the thickness of the P4QP-52% layer increases. Notably, for those films with relatively thick P4QP-52% layers, the shift in the 2 nd - and 3 rd -order PSBs is substantial enough to create composite colors, such as magenta, through the superposition of red from the 2 nd -order PSB and blue from the 3 rd -order PSB. This mechanism represents a significant advancement in PC technology and opens up new possibilities for colorimetric sensing and tunable optical materials. For practical applications, these films are further explored in anti-counterfeiting applications, where their color transitions and hidden patterning are demonstrated. The films showed vivid color changes and distinct patterning in response to high humidity, offering potential for use in security and authentication applications.},

However, dendrites and side reactions at the zinc anode severely deteriorate their cycle stability. Herein, to mitigate these issues, a molecular tolerance mechanism, inspired by cell membranes in extreme plants, is employed to engineer the zinc anode surface. The molecular layer enhances both the desolvation process and transport rate of zinc ions, thereby suppressing the dendrite formation. The interfacial side reactions caused by excessive water molecules in solvated ions are practically minimized as well, thus the zinc anode turns more durable and robust under high-rate conditions. Specifically, at a moderate current density of 1 mA cm −2 @1 mAh cm −2 , the cycle stability of the zinc anode is improved to 8800 h, and up to 1100 h at a high current density of 10 mA cm −2 @5 mAh cm −2 .

A topological structure is represented using a neural network (referred to as “neural topology”), which is optimized by employing pre-trained neural operators combined with a fine-tuning strategy with active data augmentation. The optimization is performed targeting two objectives: maximization of mass transfer efficiency and minimization of energy consumption, for the possible considerations of compromise between the two in real-world designs. The developed neural operator with active learning is data efficient in network training and demonstrates superior computational efficiency compared with traditional methods in obtaining optimal structures across a large design space. The optimization results are experimentally validated, proving that the optimized channel improves concentration uniformity by 37% compared to the original channel. The variation of the optimal structures with changes in inlet velocity conditions is also demonstrated, offering insights for designing turbulent mass transfer devices under various operating conditions.},

However, their fabrication remains extremely challenging because they are thermodynamically unstable. Current methods are limited to element-specific binding sites or confinement of metals between layers, with no universal strategy achieved to date. Here, a general approach is presented that uses vacancy defects as universal binding sites to fabricate single-layer metal clusters (SLMC). It is demonstrated that the density of these vacancies governs metal atom diffusion and bonding to the surface, overriding the metal's physicochemical properties. Crucially, the reactivity of vacancy sites must be preserved prior to metal deposition to enable SLMC formation. This strategy is demonstrated across 21 elements and their mixtures, yielding SLMC with areal densities up to 4.3 atoms∙nm⁻ 2 , without heteroatom doping, while maintaining high thermal, environmental, and electrochemical stability. These findings provide a universal strategy for stabilizing SLMC, eliminating the need for element-specific synthesis and metal confinement protocols and offering a strategy for efficiently utilizing metals.},

  abstract     = {Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the second-leading cause of cancer-associated mortality. Neutrophil extracellular trap formation (i.e., NETosis) is a crucial process in forming VTE in cancer patients. Nevertheless, how cancer cells contribute to NETosis remains unclear. This study investigated the potential activation effects of cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles (CC-EVs) on neutrophils. Both small and large EVs (sEVs and lEVs) released from cancer cells are found to significantly induce NETosis in neutrophil-like HL-60 (dHL-60) cells. Following an in-depth exploration of EV-induced NETosis, the specific molecular pathways involved in this biological process are elucidated. CYBA enriched in CC-lEVs is delivered to dHL-60, leading to a rapid increase in intracellular ROS levels and upregulation of citH3 expression. This cascade resulted in decondensed chromatin release and subsequent NETosis along with elevated MPO-DNA levels. Injection of CC-lEVs into mice caused more pronounced VTE, which is accompanied by increased peripheral blood levels of the MPO-DNA and thrombin-antithrombin complex. Inhibiting CYBA expression or ROS generation prevented NETosis in vitro and significantly reduced VTE in vivo. In conclusion, CC-lEVs induce NETosis through the CYBA-ROS-citH3 pathway and increase VTE risk. Targeting CYBA expression or ROS production can provide novel strategies for preventing and treating VTE in high-risk cancer patients.},

However, the underlying mechanism of Seipin-regulated liver lipid metabolism remains mysterious. Here, experiments show that over-expression of Seipin down-regulates HFD-induced liver triglyceride (TG) accumulation and promotes zebrafish growth. Real-time PCR and immunoblotting suggest that Seipin interacts with Plin2 through its second transmembrane domain to inhibit the expression of Plin2 by promoting Plin2 ubiquitination, thereby ameliorating lipid accumulation. Co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) experiments and Biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis reveal a close interaction between Seipin and phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis enzyme CCTα and CHPT in zebrafish and mice. Thus, Seipin may participate in PC synthesis and increase cellular PC levels. Elevated PC levels subsequently suppress Plin2 expression. Meanwhile, CCTα, the rate-limiting enzyme of the PC synthesis pathway, exhibited a unique regulatory role on Plin2 expression as a potential transcription factor. It is proposed that Seipin balances TG homeostasis, PC synthesis, and Plin2 expression to alleviate hepatic steatosis, providing a promising target for fatty liver disease.},

Herein, a hydroxyl-rich Mg 0.55 Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) support is developed via aqueous miscible organic solvent treatment, circumventing energy-intensive calcination while engineering mesopores for efficient polyethyleneimine (PEI) loading. The optimized 60 wt.% PEI modified Mg 0.55 Al-CO 3 AMO-LDH achieves a CO 2 uptake of 3.92 mmol g −1 under simulated wet air at 25 °C and retains 90.8% capacity over 20 cycles. Crucially, the abundant surface hydroxyls of uncalcined LDH, validated by 1 H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and in situ X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, form hydrogen bonds with PEI, suppressing oxidative degradation. After 3 h at 120 °C in simulated air, PEI-LDH retains a CO 2 capacity of 1.06 mmol g −1 , significantly outperforming PEI/mixed metal oxide and conventional silica-based adsorbents. In situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy further reveals that hydroxyl-mediated amine anchoring minimizes water co-adsorption.

  abstract     = {Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) secrete exosomes, and their cargo represents a new means of cellular communication in cardiovascular diseases, including atrial fibrillation (AF). We aimed to explore the contribution of atial CFs (ACFs)-derived exosomes to AF development. Cultured primary human ACFs (hACFs) and rat ACFs are treated with angiotensin II, and the secreted exosomes are transferred to rats. Action potential duration and L-type calcium current ( I Ca ) are tested. Global microRNA-224-5p knock-in and fibroblast-specific microRNA-224-5p knock-in ( FMKI ) mice underwent an inducible AF test. Transferred exosomes of Ang II-induced hACFs and primary adult rat ACFs increased AF incidence and prolonged AF duration. The inhibitor of exosomes and knockdown of Dicer rescued the AF phenotype. MicroRNA array suggested upregulated microRNA-224-5p level in both primary adult rat ACFs and ACFs-secreted exosomes. microRNA-224-5p agonist shortened atrial effective refractory period (AERP) and promoted AF. Mechanistically, microRNA-224-5p bound to CACNA1C and inhibited its transcription. Moreover, global microRNA-224-5p knock-in and FMKI mice exhibited increased inducible AF incidence, accompanied by diminished I Ca current in ACMs. Exosome microRNA-224-5p is enhanced in ACFs isolated from atria and plasma of AF patients, and positively correlated with recurrence after radiofrequency ablation. In summary, ACFs-derived exosome microRNA-224-5p contributes to AF by inhibiting CACNA1C to drive atrial electrical remodeling.},

However, existing systems face three critical limitations: conventional strain sensors degrade with cyclic large strain due to uncontrolled crack propagation; thermal therapy lacks real-time adaptive control without feedback; and systems lack user-interactive monitoring-therapy integration. Here, iStretch, a mechano-visual-thermo adaptive e-skin is introduced that integrates durable strain sensing, dynamic heat therapy, and intuitive visual feedback via a multiphasic and bilayer architecture. The strain-sensing bottom layer utilises constrained microcrack propagation in graphene-liquid metal nanocomposites, achieving high sensitivity (GF = 281), broad sensing range (300%), and exceptional durability (10,000 cycles). Simultaneously, the thermoresponsive top layer provides dynamic visual feedback and heat modulation in response to strain. Its multifunctions are demonstrated for convolutional neural network-powered omnidirectional motion and gesture recognition, strain magnitude-adjusted thermotherapy, intuitive thermochromic overheating alerts, and quantitative cervical spine monitoring via wireless sensor arrays.},

  abstract     = {The convergence of inorganic electrides and topological quantum phenomena has ushered in novel paradigms for designing advanced quantum materials. While low-dimensional (0–2D) topological inorganic electrides have garnered considerable attention, their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts—featuring intricate interstitial electron networks—remain entirely uncharted territory. Herein, the identification of twelve 3D inorganic electrides within the rare-earth hydride family is reported, nine of which are previously unreported. First-principles calculations reveal a diverse magnetic landscape: two systems exhibit ferromagnetic ordering, while seven demonstrate antiferromagnetic configurations. Strikingly, these materials host rich topological states, encompassing nodal points, nodal lines, and associated surface signatures such as Fermi arcs and drumhead-like states. When spin-orbit coupling is introduced, the magnetic ordering breaks time-reversal symmetry, thereby generating substantial Berry curvature and resulting in a relatively large anomalous Hall conductivity (939 S cm −1 ). Furthermore, these inorganic electrides exhibit ultralow work functions (2.6–3.9 eV) on rare-earth-terminated surfaces. Under external electric fields, the 3D interstitial electrons migrate to the surface, forming a quasi-2D electron gas. Significantly, such low work functions can effectively activate N 2 , enhancing catalytic NH 3 synthesis. These findings establish an ideal platform to explore 3D inorganic electrides, along with their topological features, anomalous transport phenomena, low work functions, and NH 3 synthesis.},

Dual electro-optic frequency comb ranging systems traditionally rely on acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) to shift the local oscillator frequency, mitigating frequency degeneracy but restricting tuning flexibility, response speed, and power efficiency. Here, an AOM-free dual electro-optic frequency comb ranging system is introduced, employing a serrodyne-modulated electro-optic modulator (EOM) for frequency shifting, achieving superior phase coherence and high-precision distance measurement. Experimental validation confirms nanometric ranging precision, with Allan deviation below 0.1 nm at 1 ms integration. The system effectively tracks high-frequency vibrations (up to 100 kHz) from a piezoelectric transducer and enables dynamic 3D surface imaging. Moreover, it detects nanoscale water surface vibrations through precise laser-ranging analysis. Notably, the system maintains high measurement precision across a wide spatial scale—from meter-level free-space ranging to nanometer-scale vibration sensing—demonstrating exceptional versatility. Compared to conventional AOM-based approaches, the method provides enhanced flexibility, reduced RF power consumption, and improved photonic integration compatibility, thus offering substantial benefits for precision metrology and high-resolution sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {The primary scientific challenge in advancing aqueous aluminum-ion batteries (AAIBs) is achieving reversible plating/stripping of the Al metal anode, limited by its low deposition potential (−1.667 V vs SHE) and surface passivation in the aqueous electrolyte. To address this issue, polypyrrole (PPy) decorated topological quantum insulator (Bi 2 Te 3 @PPy) is introduced as a novel anode in AAIBs. Benefiting from the interconnected PPy network and the gap-free metallic surface state of Bi 2 Te 3 , the Bi 2 Te 3 @PPy anode enables a remarkable discharge capacity of 438 mAh g −1 at a current rate of 0.5 A g −1 . It also maintains a strong discharging plateau even at a higher current rate of 10 A g −1 , outperforming most electrode materials reported so far for AAIBs. The role of the topological surface states of Bi 2 Te 3 in enhancing the ion migration rate is validated by comparing its performance across various morphologies. Ex situ studies and computational analysis reveal that in aqueous systems, Al 3+ is not the sole species responsible for charge storage. Instead, hydronium ions (H 3 O + ) significantly contribute to storing the charges through intercalation into the crystal lattice. Overall, this study pioneers a new approach for developing advanced Al metal-free AAIBs and provides deeper insights into the charge storage mechanisms in aqueous electrolytes.},

Current 2D models lack spatial epithelial-immune cell interactions, including dendritic cell (DC) migration and DC–T cell crosstalk. Intestine-on-a-chip (IoC) models are used for infections and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but are not yet widely used in food allergy research. Here, a 3D immunocompetent IoC model is presented using extrusion-based bioprinting and melt electrowriting (MEW). The system integrates human intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) seeded on half-pipe-shaped MEW scaffolds and co-cultured with hydrogel-embedded monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) inside the printed device. Subsequent moDC–T cell interactions are studied separately in a hydrogel-embedded system. IoCs exhibited leak-tight epithelial barriers comparable to transwell-like systems, while demonstrating higher metabolic and brush border enzyme activity, and lower LDH leakage. After food allergens (peanut, milk, and egg), non-allergen (Rubisco) or pro-inflammatory stimuli (toxin A and LPS) exposure, distinguishable effects on epithelial barrier integrity and moDC driven Th1/Th2 immune responses are observed. The IoC model presents a significant step toward 3D in vitro systems that mimic the intestinal mucosa's compartments to study food allergen sensitization and inflammatory diseases.},

Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify radioresistance genes and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms using patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Transcriptome analyses are performed on radio-resistant and -sensitive PDOs, CRC cells, and xenograft tissues to screen for radioresistant genes. Additionally, the genetic homology between PDOs and clinical tissues is verified using whole-exome sequencing. Functional experiments are performed to validate the roles of the candidate genes using cellular, organoid, and animal models. Forkhead box P4 (FOXP4) is identified as a differentially expressed genes between the radio-sensitive and -resistant groups that is linked to radioresistance. Further experiments show that FOXP4 promoted radioresistance by suppressing ferroptosis. Mechanistically, FOXP4 regulated GPX4 transcription by binding to the promoter region of GPX4 via the forkhead domain to inhibit the onset of ferroptosis. Doxorubicin (DOX) inhibited FOXP4 expression by promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, eventually increasing radiosensitivity. Notably, DOX combined with irradiation attenuated the compensatory increase in FOXP4 expression and increased radiotherapy efficacy. Conclusively, the combination therapy provides a new strategy for enhancing therapeutic efficacy in CRC.},

  abstract     = {Resolving the severe issues such as electric field distortion, dendritic zinc growth, and uneven zinc deposition under high depths of discharge (DOD) has become a significant hurdle of the aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). To address these challenges, an interfacial regulation strategy is proposed based on the molecular damping effect, in which a trace amount of weakly adsorbing additive is employed to stabilize the Zn anode interface by mitigating energy shocks and ionic disturbances induced by electric field fluctuations. Trace perfluorinated PSVE (erfluoro-3,6-dioxa-4-methyloct-7-enesulphonyl fluoride) is introduced to the traditional ZnSO 4 electrolyte to optimize Zn deposition behavior on the zinc anode. Thus, the Zn//Zn symmetric batteries exhibit a prolonged cycling lifespan of over 200 h, even when operated at a high DOD of 85.5%. Additionally, the NVO (Na 2 V 6 O 16 ) cathodes coupled with Zn anodes and modified electrolyte present a more stable capacity retention, maintaining a capacity of 141.98 mAh g −1 after 1000 cycles. Similarly, the full batteries assembled with the same electrodes in a ZnSO 4 electrolyte retain only 51.49 mAh g −1 capacity after the same conditions. This work highlights the potential of the molecular damping effect as a promising solution for improving high DOD performance in ZIBs.},

However, supercooled systems are susceptible to stochastic ice nucleation, which can cause fatal damage to the organs. In this study, an organogel interface composed of nanoscale polydimethylsiloxane and dimethyl-silicone oil is proposed, which presents a significant energy barrier for ice nucleation, comparable to that of homogeneous nucleation. The organogel effectively eliminates primary ice nucleation sites, enabling a quasi-homogeneous supercooling preservation system that does not rely on cryoprotectant agents or machine perfusion. Through a series of statistical experiments, this approach is demonstrated to be able to maintain stable supercooling and preserve mouse hearts at −4 °C for up to 72 h. A comprehensive assessment conducted at multiple scales indicates that the 36-h supercooling preservation at −4 °C significantly mitigates cardiac injury by regulating mitochondrial structure and reducing metabolic rates. Utilizing a heart transplantation model with prognostic evaluations extending up to 3 months post-transplantation, supercooling preservation within the quasi-homogeneous system is confirmed, which can double the storage duration compared to clinically applied hypothermic preservation methods.},

Here, the septuple atomic layered SnBi 2 Te 4 is successfully synthesized and its thermoelectric performance significantly enhanced through isovalent elements alloying.

The incorporation of Sb and Se into p -type SnBi 2 Te 4 system significantly improves thermoelectric performance through three synergistic mechanisms: 1) enhance the electrical conductivity via effective mass enlarging, 2) suppress the bipolar thermal diffusion through bandgap widening, and 3) reduce the lattice thermal conductivity by point defect scattering.

TGFβ1 represents a critical therapeutic target as a key cytokine involved in immune suppression and tumor progression. Here, a DNA origami-based framework functionalized with anti-TGFβ1 aptamers is developed to act as a captor for efficient TGFβ1 sequestration and fast clearance, thereby improving anti-tumor immunity. By engineering the geometric shapes and pore sizes of three DNA framework captors (DFCs), the superior efficacy of a barrel-shaped captor (DBC) in regulating TGFβ1 levels is demonstrated. In cell culture, DBCs significantly enhance T cell-mediated tumor cytotoxicity, while systemic administration effectively inhibits tumor growth in the mouse model. Moreover, DBCs demonstrate a synergistic effect with PD-L1 antibody to enhance anti-tumor efficacy. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) further confirmes the DBC-mediated reduction of TGFβ in tumor tissue and its biodistribution fate. These findings underscore the importance of cytokine regulation in cancer immunotherapy and provide valuable insights for the rational design and application of structural DNA nano-devices as a transformative tool for precise immunomodulation.},

However, the CRISPR-based assays typically require the combination with an additional pre-amplification step based on isothermal nucleic acid amplification to meet the requirements of clinical diagnosis, which brings issues including complicated operation and the risk of aerosol contamination. To address these challenges, one-pot CRISPR platforms are emerging as an attractive solution to streamline workflows, enabling rapid, cost-effective, and high-sensitivity diagnostics. This review outlines the current status, challenges, and three key strategies to realize highly efficient one-pot CRISPR-based detection. In addition, further perspectives are outlined that will inspire new exploration and promote one-pot CRISPR/Cas detection as the next generation of diagnostic tools.},

  abstract     = {As a major component of the cytoskeleton, intermediate filaments are generally considered to play a supporting role in mitotic cells. They also take part in the regulation of cell motility, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, their specific functions during meiosis are largely unknown. Here, a unique role of an intermediate filament protein beaded filament structural protein 2 (BFSP2) is reported, which is predominantly expressed in lens fiber epithelial cells, as a spindle formation controller in oocyte meiosis. BFSP2 is constantly expressed during oocyte meiotic maturation, and specifically distributed on the spindle apparatus at metaphase I (MI) and metaphase II (MII) stages. Depletion of BFSP2 resulted in the meiotic arrest at MI stage due to the aberrant spindle assembly-induced spindle assembly checkpoint activation. Depletion of BFSP2 also led to incorrect kinetochore-microtubule attachments and the occurrence of aneuploidy in oocytes. Mechanistically, immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry analysis identified clathrin heavy chain 1 (CLTC) as the downstream mediator of BFSP2 during meiotic spindle assembly. It is further determined that BFSP2 recruited the molecular chaperone heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) to the spindle apparatus for stabilizing CLTC, and thus driving the spindle formation. In summary, these findings uncover a noncanonical function of the intermediate filament protein BFSP2 as a spindle assembly controller in oocyte meiosis.},

  abstract     = {Implant-associated infections in diabetic patients pose critical challenges due to immune-metabolic dysregulation that exacerbates biofilm persistence and tissue damage. This study introduces a “dimensional rise” strategy integrating 3D-printed porous titanium frameworks with micro-nano hierarchical structures to establish a mechanically robust, high-capacity drug reservoir, surpassing the limitations of conventional 2D surface modifications. Copper-doped carbon quantum dots, synthesized from luteolin, synergize with polydopamine-mediated photothermal activation to disrupt bacterial copper homeostasis, inducing tricarboxylic acid cycle collapse and cuproptosis-like death via reactive oxygen species bursts and lipoylated protein aggregation. Concurrently, glucose oxidase depletes local glucose to activate adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in host cells, restoring mitochondrial integrity and metabolic homeostasis through deacetylation. This dual-action system achieves differential regulation—targeting bacteria while protecting host tissues—and ensures therapeutic coverage across acute infection and chronic healing phases. Validated in three animal models, including Beagles with clinical-grade implants, the strategy demonstrates potent anti-biofilm efficacy, prevention of secondary infections, and accelerated diabetic osseogenesis. By upgrading surface engineering to 3D volumetric drug reservoirs, this work establishes a paradigm for differentiated multimodal therapy against implant-related infections in metabolically compromised hosts, addressing both immediate bactericidal demands and long-term tissue recovery.},

Despite serving as the founder species for sheep breeding in China, the genetic mechanisms underlying these desirable traits and the breed's origin have remained unresolved. To address the longstanding challenges in understanding their adaptations and origins, comprehensive analyses utilizing genetic data is conducted from over 300 Hu sheep and ≈200 other Chinese native sheep. The study unveils the migration history of sheep and the formation of the Hu sheep in eastern China. By employing multiple screening methods, this study identifies that the BMPR1B , UNC5C , and GRID2 synergistically contribute to the high fecundity trait in Hu sheep. The coexistence of beneficial genotypes in these genes increase the likelihood of multiple births. Notably, the results suggest a potential coevolution between environmental adaptation and reproductive traits in this breed.

The key component is a novel polarization decoupling multi-port beam-splitting (PD-MPBS) metasurface that relies on both propagation phase and geometric phase. The fabricated samples exhibit high beam-splitting power uniformity (within 4.4%) and polarization purities (91.3–93.2%). By leveraging such a beam-splitting device as well as a reflective beam-expanding meta-device, an integrated six-beam delivery system for miniaturized MOT application is implemented. The experimental results indicate that six expanded beams have been successfully delivered with uniform power (within 9.5%), the desired CP configuration, and a large overlapping volume (76.2 mm 3 ). It is believed that a miniaturized MOT with the proposed beam delivery system is very promising for portable application of cold atom technology in precision measurement, atomic clock, quantum simulation, and computing, etc.},

Herein, a donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) structured NIR-II absorbing Boron Difluoride Formazanate (BDF) dye FBDFDPA is developed through a donor engineering strategy for 1060 nm laser-excited photoacoustic imaging (PAI)-guided photothermal therapy (PTT). By replacing the donor unit from alkoxy-substituted triphenylamine with alkoxy-substituted diphenylamine, the planarity of the molecular conjugated skeleton is enhanced, thus promoting the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect, leading to a 138 nm redshift in absorption and extending it into the NIR-II region. FBDFDPA NPs show excellent molar extinction coefficient (ε = 7.66 × 10 3 M −1 cm −1 ) at 1060 nm and significant photothermal conversion efficiency ( η = 54.4%), enabling effective NIR-II PTT for tumor ablation under the guidance of NIR-II PAI.

The biochip captures small extracellular vesicles (EVs) from serum, lyses them in situ, and quantifies multiple proteins, including membrane and internal proteins of EVs. It is utilized to test 273 clinical samples across multiple centers. The validation sets are then analyzed using machine learning, resulting in a precise diagnostic model for ESCC. This model, based on nine diagnostic protein biomarkers identified through mass spectrometry analysis of differentially expressed proteins, achieves an accuracy of 91.0% in external validation, with a 90.8% accuracy in detecting early-stage ESCC. These results significantly surpass the accuracy (only 14.4%) of the currently used biomarker for squamous cell carcinoma. Thus, integrating extracellular vesicles protein analysis with machine learning presents can identify ESCC patients.

  abstract     = {Periodontitis in menopausal women tends to exacerbate, potentially resulting in tooth loss and increased risk of systemic diseases. The prior research demonstrates that pro-inflammatory changes in macrophages under estrogen deficiency exacerbate periodontitis. However, the primary environmental factors contributing to the alteration of monocyte-macrophages remain unknown. Recent studies, including animal models and clinical trials, have found a correlation between accumulation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and periodontitis progression in postmenopausal women. In estrogen-deficient mice, macrophages in VAT show a pro-inflammatory state. Removing VAT alleviates periodontitis in OVX mice. DNA methylation sequencing shows increased methylation in macrophages, especially Jazf1 hypermethylation, inhibiting its expression and promoting inflammation. Subsequently, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from pro-inflammatory macrophages further intensify M1-like polarization in resting macrophages, carrying inflammatory microRNAs like miR-30e-5p. Overall, this study proposes a novel perspective: periodontal pathogens act as initial triggers for inflammation, while chronic systemic inflammation, worsened by estrogen deficiency, is the main factor that exacerbates periodontitis. Pro-inflammatory macrophages in VAT release sEVs, which activate resting macrophages into a pro-inflammatory state upon encountering periodontal pathogens, resulting in persistent inflammation. Addressing the root causes of this dysregulation can lead to new therapeutic strategies for periodontitis and systemic inflammatory conditions, particularly in postmenopausal women.},

The formation of CNPs follows zero-order kinetics with an induction period dependent on the reactivity of the organic precursor. Experimental evidence suggests a surface-catalyzed photochemical process involving a partial change in C-atom hybridization from sp 2 to sp 3 , with oxygen-based functional groups passivating the surface of the nanostructures. The presence of additional heteroatoms depends on the structure and composition of the precursor. Contingent on the starting compound, the prepared CNPs can be classified as amorphous carbon nanodots (CNDs) or layered curved-graphene quantum dots (c-GQDs), resembling nano-onion fragments. CNDs are obtained from substituted benzenes or heterocyclic compounds, whereas c-GQDs can be synthesized from benzene. Photophysical characterization of the CNPs shows both wavelength-dependent excitation and emission bands, with constant emission quantum yields in the 1–10% range, and wavelength-dependent emission decays displaying several lifetime components in the range 1–20 ns.

While historical research has largely focused on the osseous abnormalities associated with DDH, current surgical interventions, though prevalent, often carry significant and unavoidable side effects. To break through these limitations, the study delved into the acetabular labrum, a crucial intra-articular structure that presents abnormalities in DDH patients. Through single-cell combined spatial transcriptomic analysis of the acetabular labrum under diverse conditions, a comprehensive examination of the changes of DDH tissue changes at the single-cell level is pioneered, conclusively linking aberrant fibrocartilage stem/progenitor cell proliferation to disease progression. The subsequent in vivo and in vitro experiments unequivocally identify the MK signaling pathway as a pivotal target for DDH treatment. Localized administration of its specific inhibitor not only substantially alleviates early structural abnormalities in DDH but also lays a robust and promising foundation for the innovation and clinical translation of new therapeutic strategies for DDH. In summary, the findings not only deepen the understanding of DDH pathogenesis but also pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies that prioritize both efficacy and safety.},

  abstract     = {Inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to diabetic nephrology (DN) progression. Golgi membrane protein 1 (GOLM1) is a Golgi type II transmembrane protein and associates with inflammation and oxidative stress. The present study tries to investigate the role and mechanism of GOLM1 in DN using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. It is found that GOLM1 expression is elevated in diabetic kidneys and high glucose-stimulated podocytes, and positively correlated with renal dysfunction during DN progression. Podocyte-specific GOLM1 ablation prevents, while podocyte-specific GOLM1 overexpression facilitates diabetes-related inflammation, oxidative damage, apoptosis, and renal dysfunction in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistic studies reveal that podocyte-specific GOLM1 ablation attenuated DN through activating adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) pathway, and inhibiting AMPKα pathway completely abolishes the beneficial effects in podocyte-specific GOLM1 knockout ( Golm1 pKO ) mice or podocytes. Further findings imply that podocyte GOLM1 inactivated AMPKα pathway through interacting with epidermal growth factor receptor to inhibit peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ. Moreover, treatment with GOLM1 neutralizing antibody is sufficient to alleviate DN in mice. Overall, the study for the first time identifies a pathogenic role of podocyte GOLM1 in the progression of DN, and inhibiting GOLM1 represents an attractive therapeutic approach to treat DN.},

  abstract     = {Mortalin is an essential chaperone for the import of nuclear-encoded proteins into mitochondria and is elevated in ovarian cancer in association with poor patient prognosis. The investigational new drug, SHetA2, interacts with mortalin releasing its client proteins. In this study, interactions of SHetA2 moieties and mortalin substrate binding domain (SBD) amino acids are demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to occur at low micromolar SHetA2 concentrations that selectively kill cancer cells over noncancerous cells. In both ovarian cancer and noncancerous cells SHetA2 reduces: mitochondria import of mortalin, degradation of mortalin's mitochondrial localization sequence (MLS), mortalin/inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors complexes and oxidative phosphorylation. In cancer cells only, SHetA2 reduces calcium levels, mitochondrial length and fusion proteins, while inducing autophagy and PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/PARKIN-mediated mitophagy. Noncancerous cells exhibit increased mitochondrial branch length in response to SHetA2 and a low level of inducible autophagy that is resistant to SHetA2. Inhibition of autophagosome-lysosome fusion reduces, or increases, SHetA2 cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer or noncancerous cells, respectively. SHetA2 inhibits mortalin and growth, and induces mitophagy in ovarian cancer xenografts and increases survival post-surgical tumor removal. In conclusion, SHetA2 binds directly to mortalin's SBD and causes distinct responses in ovarian cancer and noncancerous cells.},

However, the role of apoptosis inhibitor 5 (API5), in governing both ubiquitin-mediated autophagy and antiviral immunity, are poorly defined. Here, it is found that the serine/arginine-rich protein kinase 1 (SRPK1)-dependent phosphorylation of API5 at S464 site is essential for priming antiviral immune responses during diverse RNA virus infection. Mechanistically, phosphorylated API5 forms complexes with autophagic receptor p62 and eliminates itself from ubiquitination at K141, thereby reducing p62 aggregations and inhibiting the autophagic degradation of cytosolic RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5 to mobilize RLR-mediated antiviral responses. Taken together, it is unveiled that API5 phosphorylation by SRPK1 is required for the inhibition of ubiquitin-mediated autophagic degradation of RNA sensors, revealing a coordinating nature of virus–host interactions that sustains host antiviral defenses.},

Through MRC, the study can quickly discover and validate new proteins or structural domains capable of forming condensates and can also integrate PPIs to study condensates. Furthermore, the versatility of MRC is demonstrated in phase-separated condensates research: programming phase separation sites to study the interactions and behaviors between different condensates, recruiting target proteins into programmable condensates, obtaining the properties of diverse engineered condensates, and probing the physical properties of condensates within live cells.

The above encapsulation enhances the stability of perovskites against environmental stressors, such as humidity, temperature, and light, leading to improved performance characteristics. This paper provides a comprehensive review of perovskite–metal–organic framework composites (PeMOFs) and their applications in photoelectric conversion. It explores the various preparation methods for PeMOFs and highlights recent advancements in the field. The review examines the specific functions of MOFs within these composite materials and summarizes recent progress in a range of applications, including photocatalysis, sensing, light-emitting diodes, perovskite solar cells, luminescent anti-counterfeiting, information security, and detection.

Here, it was found that radiation disrupted the gut virome, altered the distribution of phages and their bacterial host. Fecal virome transplantation (FVT) from healthy donors ameliorated radiation-induced intestinal damage and promoted stem cell proliferation by enriching phages targeting Salmonella . Conversely, decreased virome load exacerbated intestinal damage, reduced proliferating stem cells, and impaired secretory lineage differentiation. Mechanistically, exacerbated intestinal injury was associated with hyperactivation of RIG-I and Notch signaling in intestinal stem cells, which was absent in RIG-I-deficient mice. Organoids from RIG-I-deficient mice displayed decreased Notch signals and increased regenerative capacity post radiation.

High levels of mtROS and mitochondrial damage in the renal tubules are the initiating and core factors driving the progression of DKD. However, the effectiveness of current antioxidant drugs is greatly limited, mainly due to the difficulty of simultaneously breaching the glomerular barrier and targeting tubular mitochondria, as well as their limited ability to sustain treatment of chronic DKD. Here, this study reports a Se embedded adaptive antioxidant nanodrug (AAN) with negative surface charge and high mitochondrial targeting that can pass through the renal tubules and be highly enriched in the affected renal tubular mitochondria in DKD. AAN can eliminate mtROS to release soluble Se, which is then converted into the key bioactive enzymes -GPX4, effectively inhibiting ferroptosis and protecting mitochondria by exerting adaptive antioxidant effects. In the DKD mouse model, AAN treatment can effectively restore renal function, and the therapeutic effect at a dose of 10 mg kg −1 every 4 days is significantly better than Metformin administered at a dose of 200 mg kg −1 per day. In conclusion, this study provides a promising strategy to enhance the effects of antioxidant therapy to break the pathological barriers in DKD treatment.},

Here it is reported that breast cancer establishes a hyperglycemic bone pre-metastatic niche before migrating to bone tissue and further enhances glucose metabolism following metastatic colonization. An intervention strategy is subsequently proposed targeting glucose metabolism utilizing a biomimetic-engineered enzyme-based nanoplatform. This platform's membrane shielding reduces the interaction between engineered glucose oxidase and circulating glucose, while the engineered enzyme specifically targets glucose metabolism, enabling self-amplifying starvation combined with selective chemotherapy. Such precision can precisely inhibit breast cancer bone metastases and block distal tumor dissemination. This study provides novel insights into the role of glucose metabolism in the pre-metastatic niche and presents a proof-of-concept for metabolic-targeted strategies in breast cancer bone metastasis treatment. This approach holds significant promise for improving therapeutic outcomes in metastatic breast cancer by targeting the metabolic vulnerabilities of the bone microenvironment and halting systemic tumor spread.},

HiCGen predicts genome organization across different spatial scales utilizing DNA sequence and genomic features as inputs. The model enables in silico screening through genetic or epigenetic perturbations on genome architecture, with resolution down to 1 kb. The analysis reveals unexpected linear correlations between loop properties and genome organization at various levels, including insulation degree, compartmentalization, and contact intensity over genomic distances exceeding 10 Mb. Regional or global perturbation conducted by HiCGen provides biological implications for such cross-scale correlations and their genome-function dependence. Notably, perturbation analysis of the human genome in sigmoid colon tissue demonstrates that modest activation of carcinogenesis-associated enhancers is sufficient to hijack nearby promoter, reshape TAD boundaries, and even flip compartment at mega-base scale.},

  abstract     = {Mammalian cloning through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) involves reprogramming terminally differentiated cells into totipotent embryos. Epigenetic barriers inherited from somatic cells impede reprogramming efficiency and lead to low SCNT embryo development rates. Recent studies have identified two primary types of epigenetic barriers in mouse SCNT embryos, defective pre-implantation development due to abnormal gene expression around zygotic genome activation, associated with aberrant H3K9me3, H3K4me3, and histone acetylation, and defective post-implantation development due to loss of H3K27me3-mediated non-canonical imprinting. Despite these findings, effective strategies to overcome these barriers in a single embryo have not been established. Here, Kdm4d and Kdm5b overexpression are combined with TSA treatment to overcome epigenetic barriers in pre-implantation development, while using tetraploid complementation to replace extraembryonic lineage cells, thereby overcoming imprinting defects critical for post-implantation development. This approach resulted in ≈30% full-term development efficiency of reconstructed embryos. The strategy not only represents the highest SCNT efficiency achieved in mammals but also enhances the feasibility of efficient mammal cloning.},

Here, it is found that FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy activity is elevated in fibrotic mouse heart tissues post-MI and in cardiac fibroblasts stimulated by TGF-β1. AMFR knockout in mice aggravated cardiac fibrosis post-MI and worsened cardiac function, with scRNA-seq analysis demonstrating that AMFR-null cardiac fibroblasts exhibit a myofibroblast phenotype. Simultaneously, AMFR overexpression in cardiac fibroblasts reduces the expression of profibrogenic proteins in response to TGF-β1 stimulation. AMFR regulates ER-phagy flux and turnover of FAM134B, which leads to the suppression of cardiac fibroblasts activation. Mechanistically, AMFR catalyzed K27-linked (predominant) and K33-linked ubiquitination of FAM134B and enhanced ER-phagy flux, thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation of mTORC1 downstream targets such as S6K1 and 4E-BP. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of AMFR-driven ER-phagy in suppressing cardiac fibrosis post-MI.},

  abstract     = {The cognitive differentiation of executive function (EF) and mathematical ability during child development, characterized by their decreasing correlation, is well established. However, the impact of long-term cognitive training on this developmental effect remains largely unexplored. The present study investigated this by analyzing behavioral and neuroimaging data from schoolchildren who participated in five years of abacus training. The findings indicate that, compared to the control group, the training group exhibits cognitive dedifferentiation, characterized by stronger correlations between EF and mathematical abilities, accompanied by lower inter-individual variability. These observations are consistent with the discovery of greater overlap in behavior-associated brain connectivity patterns and more uniform connectivity profiles across individuals. Furthermore, the individual-to-group similarity in connectivity pattern is significantly associated with EF and mathematical performance, suggesting a shared cognitive strategy shaped by prolonged training. The findings provide empirical evidence in support of neurocognitive plasticity, highlighting the capacity of targeted cognitive training to functionally reshape brain networks and modulate the developmental trajectory of cognitive traits.},

The previous studies found that lubrication supplementation is closely related to damaged matrix regeneration, but the lubrication structure is prone to disintegration and failure. Here, combining with microfluidic and photopolymerization strategies, a supramolecular lubricating hydrogel microsphere is constructed, which is medicated by dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes as the core, a natural component in body fluids, and complexed with cartilage matrix-binding peptide functionalized methacryloylated hyaluronan acid (WYR-HAMA) as the photoinitiated site. The highly intermolecular ion-dipole interaction between DPPC and WYR-HAMA can form a dynamic supramolecular lubricating layer on the damaged matrix interfaces, where inflammatory factor inhibitors are coupled with DPPC liposomes via hydrophobic interaction to resist inflammatory transmission. Additionally, microspheres can autonomously regulate lubrication structure: in the early and middle stages, they can actively provide microscale lubrication (µ ≈ 0.04); in the late stage, the wear debris induced by endogenous enzymatic decomposition transmitted to provide nanoscale lubrication for the damaged matrix (µ ≈ 0.06). In vivo experiments demonstrate microspheres promoted efficient extracellular matrix synthesis and the autonomous release of lubrication factors at the cellular level. The developed bioplatform allowing cellular lubrication metabolism would provide a promising strategy for regenerating friction-induced matrix damage.},

In healthy mice, the loss of the nuclear orphan receptor NR2F6 alters tissue-resident macrophage populations in the liver, lung, and spleen. In response to Salmonella Typhimurium infection, Nr2f6 -deficient mice exhibit improved clinical outcomes, characterized by reduced weight loss, bacterial loads in the spleen and liver, and decreased plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines. Despite unchanged basal iron metabolism in the spleen and liver, iron regulatory proteins and the interleukin (IL)-6-hepcidin axis are altered in Nr2f6- deficient mice during Salmonella infection, reducing hypoferremia. Transcriptomic analysis of splenic red pulp macrophages reveals significant alterations of phagocytosis-related genes, including upregulation of signal-regulatory protein alpha (Sirpa). In vitro, phagocytosis of red blood cells, regulated by the inhibitory CD47-Sirpα axis, and Salmonella Typhimurium phagocytosis are significantly impaired in Nr2f6 -deficient splenic macrophages. Blocking Sirpα in vitro restores the phagocytic activity of Nr2f6 -deficient macrophages to wild-type levels. In vivo , Salmonella Typhimurium loads are partially increased post-infection in anti-Sirpα treated Nr2f6 -deficient mice.

  abstract     = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by β-amyloid plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles, but the ensuing cellular derangements that culminate in neurodegeneration remain elusive. Here, a mechanistic link between two AD pathophysiological hallmarks: energy insufficiency and oxidative stress is revealed. It is demonstrated that mitochondrial function and glutathione (GSH) flux are coupled, impacting neuronal ferroptosis susceptibility. Analysis of proteomic data from the inferior temporal cortex of 625 subjects along a continuum of clinical and pathological changes in AD, reveals a prominent depletion of mitochondrial proteins. Biogenetic insufficiency in AD is reflected by a concurrent loss of GSH, which requires 2 ATP for its synthesis, and genetic and pharmacologic ATP depletion models confirm that ATP is rate-limiting for GSH. Accordingly, an unbiased association analysis uncovers mitochondrial proteins in positive correlation with total GSH (t-GSH) in AD subjects. But mitochondria also consume GSH via the SLC25A39 transporter. It is found that mitochondrial inhibition either increases or decreases ferroptosis susceptibility in cellular models, depending on contextual factors that dictate whether mitochondria act as a net GSH producer or consumer, respectively. Mitochondria therefore control GSH flux, and loss of energy output is consequently demonstrated as a liability for ferroptosis in AD.},

While Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) is the most widely used vaccine for tuberculosis prevention, its broader use as an inducer of trained immunity is limited by adverse reactions. Here, it is reported that BCG-derived outer membrane vesicles (B-OMVs) effectively trigger trained immunity to protect against experimental polymicrobial sepsis. Comprehensive characterization and safety assessments confirmed that B-OMVs exhibited no significant toxicity or pathological effects, positioning them as a promising alternative to conventional BCG vaccines and E. coli -derived outer membrane vesicles (E-OMVs) in terms of both efficacy and safety. Mechanistically, B-OMVs enhanced trained immunity by promoting hematopoietic stem cell expansion and myelopoiesis via toll like receptor 2 (TLR2)-dependent activation of aerobic glycolysis and epigenetic reprogramming. This led to an amplified immune response and enhanced phagocytic activity in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Together, these findings establish B-OMVs as a novel immunomodulatory agent against sepsis-induced immune dysfunction, with translational potential.},

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key mediators of inter-organ communication. Here, EVs and EV-microRNAs (miRNAs) are identified as mediate PDAC-skeletal muscle communication. EVs are isolated from PDAC patients, mouse models, patients-derived organoids, and mouse pancreatic cancer cells. Plasma-derived EVs from PDAC patients or mice are observed to remarkably induced muscle wasting in vitro and in vivo. Depletion of miRNA cargo in these EVs significantly alleviates their detrimental effects on skeletal muscles. Deep RNA sequencing is conducted to profile differentially expressed miRNAs in plasma EVs from patients with or without PDAC. The findings reveal that the expression of miR-223-5p expression in PDAC patients’ plasma EVs is negatively associated with the 3-year overall survival. Mechanistic studies show that miR-223-5p contributes to reduced METTL14 transcription by targeting MAFA, associated with decreased m 6 A methylation in skeletal muscles and muscle wasting. This study highlights the absorption of miRNA in PDAC-derived EVs by skeletal muscles and reveals a previously unrecognized function of PDAC-derived EV-miR-223-5p in tumor-muscle inter-organ communication, offering novel insight into EV-miR-223-5p-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for PDAC patients with sarcopenia upon further validation.},

  abstract     = {Uncontrolled sodium-ion (Na + ) transport, fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers, in and sluggish Na + desolvation using conventional separators drive dendrite growth, posing critical challenges to the development of sodium metal batteries (SMBs). Porous materials with tunable Na + transport pathways offer promise; however, simultaneously enhancing Na + kinetics, promoting NaF-rich SEI formation, and lowering desolvation energy barriers remains a critical challenge. Herein, a trifunctional halogenated covalent organic framework (COF) integrated into a polypropylene (PP) separator (COF-F@PP) is designed to address these issues. The COF-F@PP separator features positively charged sites to anchor PF 6 − anions and facilitate desolvation of NaPF 6 , and in-situ release of fluorine ions from halogenated COF promotes the formation of a robust NaF-rich SEI layer. Additionally, its high-porosity structure enables uniform Na + transport. Theoretical simulation demonstrates that the COF-F@PP separator improves desolvation dynamics, ensures uniform Na + flux distribution, and mitigates local electric field concentration, resulting in smooth and dendrite-free deposition. Consequently, a high Coulombic efficiency (99.2%), excellent ionic conductivity (1.13 mS cm −1 ), and stable cycling for over 1000 h at 3 mA cm −2 are achieved. In Na||NVP full cells, COF-F@PP separator delivers an initial discharge capacity of 83.51 mAh g −1 at 50 C and retains 88.42% of its capacity after 10 000 cycles.},

  abstract     = {Biomaterials can improve cancer immunotherapies by controlling their release and thereby optimizing their time-dependent engagement of the immune system. In this study, an approach is described to control the release of a potent immunostimulant—CpG oligodeoxynucleotide—from a genetically-encoded elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) depot. A CpG-binding ELP containing an oligolysine domain (ELP-Lys 12 ) is synthesized that electrostatically complexes CpG and formulate it with an excipient ELP. The ELP-CpG complex retains the thermally responsive phase behavior of the parent ELP, transitioning into a viscous depot at body temperature. Stepwise addition of excipient ELP predictably changes ELP-CpG transition temperature, depot dissolution kinetics, and retention of CpG within the depot. Mixtures of ELP-Lys 12 , excipient ELP, and CpG undergo microphase separation, forming a porous, sponge-like depot that contains tunable amounts of soluble CpG in the pores. In vivo, the modified formulations exhibit varying degrees of CpG retention over multiple weeks following a single intratumoral injection. Finally, by modifying the release kinetics of CpG, optimized ELP-CpG achieves greater reduction of metastatic disease in a murine metastatic breast cancer model than soluble CpG. These results demonstrate that ELPs can be used to precisely tune the release kinetics of immunotherapies for better outcomes in the treatment of metastatic cancer.},

During virus replication, the double-stranded viral RNA and some viral proteins upregulate PIM1 expression, which phosphorylates E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP1 at Serine 82. The pS82-β-TrCP1 then forms a complex with S535/S539-phosphorylated interferon receptor IFNAR1 (pS535/539-IFNAR1), leading to IFNAR1 ubiquitination and degradation. Both pan-inhibitors (CX-6528, SGI-1776, AZD-1208) and a specific inhibitor of PIM1 kinase (PIM1 inhibitor 2) effectively block this process and potently inhibit viral replication.

  abstract     = {Wireless radiofrequency (RF) coils based on metasurfaces hold great promise for improving clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) workflows by eliminating the need for cable connections to the patient bed and simplifying coil structures. A fundamental requirement for their clinical adoption is the ability to support parallel imaging, which reduces examination time and improves efficiency. Moreover, the implementation of parallel imaging often comes at the expense of image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Although several wireless RF coils incorporating metamaterials are reported, most do not support parallel imaging and many deliver suboptimal SNR performance. In this work, a novel wireless RF coil architecture is proposed, termed the near-field coupling array (NFCA), which demonstrates both excellent SNR performance and robust parallel imaging capabilities. A general theoretical framework is presented that establishes a foundation for applying metasurface arrays in magnetic resonance RF coil design. The SNR expression for this architecture is derived from two perspectives, and its fundamental principles are validated through case studies. Experimental results show that the NFCA achieves a 66% SNR improvement over a conventional commercial RF coil architecture (i.e., a wired coil) while its average acceleration factor exceeds 94% of that of the commercial coil.},

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive malignancy with high mortality and limited treatment options. While surgical resection removes the primary tumor, it often fails to prevent recurrence or metastasis, and despite the promise of immunotherapy, response to immune checkpoint blockade remains poor. Here, a cryogel-based dendritic cell (DC) immunotherapy is developed incorporating gold nanodot-lipopolysaccharide (AuLPS)-loaded DCs, doxorubicin (Dox), and PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade (aPD-1+Dox+AuLPS@DC) to enhance post-surgical antitumor immunity. The AuLPS nanoparticles (NPs) stabilize LPS assembly, optimizing Th1 adjuvant activity and improving DC immunotherapy efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. The cryogel enables the sustained, localized release of therapeutic agents at the surgical site, preserving DC viability, migration, and functionality within the tumor microenvironment. This strategy enhances DC activation and potentiates robust T-cell activation in both tumor-draining lymph nodes and tumor beds, leading to durable antitumor immunity. When administered at the post-surgical site in an orthotopic TNBC model, the aPD-1+Dox+AuLPS@DC cryogel immunotherapy significantly delays tumor recurrence, reduces distant metastasis, and prolongs survival. These findings highlight cryogel-based DC immunotherapy as a promising post-surgical therapeutic strategy to enhance responses to immune checkpoint blockade and improve outcomes in TNBC.},

  abstract     = {Metabolic reprogramming driven by oncogenes plays a critical role in promoting and sustaining multiple steps of gastric cancer metastasis. However, the key metabolic driver of metastasis that can lead to the development of targeted therapies for preventing and treating metastatic gastric cancer remains elusive. Here, it is identified that the transmembrane guanylate cyclase, natriuretic peptide receptor 1 (NPR1), promoted gastric cancer lymph node metastasis by activating lipid droplet lipolysis and enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Clinical analysis reveals that elevated NPR1 protein level is correlated with increased lymph node metastasis and shorter patient survival. Functionally, NPR1 induced lipolysis of stored lipid droplets, releasing bioavailable fatty acids that are imported into mitochondria to upregulate OXPHOS, thus fueling the energy required for the metastasis of gastric cancer cells. Mechanistically, NPR1 activates protein kinase cGMP-dependent 1 (PRKG1 or PKG), which directly bound to and activated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) by phosphorylation at residues Ser 855 and Ser 951 , thereby increasing lipolysis. Furthermore, targeted delivery of NPR1 siRNA using engineered exosome mimetics effectively suppressed gastric cancer metastasis. Taken together, these findings elucidate the NPR1-driven metabolic mechanism underlying gastric cancer metastasis and suggest NPR1 as a promising therapeutic target for patients with metastatic gastric cancer.},

  abstract     = {Non-symmetric nanoarchitectonics have demonstrated superior performance in nanotherapeutics compared to their symmetric counterparts, particularly in the design of self-propelled nanodrug delivery systems. However, achieving precise morphological control of non-symmetric nanoarchitectonics composed of molecular drugs, without the use of templates and surfactants, remains a significant challenge. In this work, a strategy is presented to construct non-symmetric metal-quinone network (MQN) nanoarchitectonics with controlled morphology and size by manipulating solute and solvent diffusion behaviors during the nanoprecipitation process. The findings reveal that solute diffusion at the liquid-liquid interface of miscible solvent and antisolvent can be confined by self-generated MQNs, which in turn dictates the morphology of the resulting nanoarchitectonics. By regulating interphase solute diffusion kinetics, a variety of MQN nanoarchitectonics are successfully produced with spherical, semifootball-like, and bowl-like morphologies, ranging in sizes from tens to hundred of nanometers. Notably, the non-symmetric MQN nanobowls are further employed to create self-propelled nanodrugs, which indicates enhanced efficacy in tumor therapy. This study underscores the critical role of liquid-liquid interphase solute diffusion in determining the morphology and size of MQN nanoarchitectonics and highlights the potential of nanoprecipitation as a powerful technique for the precise fabrication of non-symmetric nanoarchitectonics.},

  abstract     = {The approach to dealing with chronic wounds is still challenging in clinic. Multitarget drugs have the advantages of superior therapeutic effect and minimal adverse reactions. The aim of the present study is to develop a multitarget treatment strategy for skin wound healing. It is showed here that topical application of ZLY032, a dual free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFA1)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARδ) agonist, accelerates the healing of full-thickness skin wounds in both normal mice and rabbits, even in the diabetic mice and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infected mice. At the eukaryotic cell level, ZLY032 shows the ability to accelerate angiogenesis and inhibit inflammation via targeting PPARδ and FFA1. At the prokaryotic cell level, ZLY032 exhibits antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA via targeting argininosuccinate lyase (ASAL, argH ). At the application level, ZLY032-loaded microneedles demonstrate a therapeutic effect on wound healing in rabbits with an improved dosing frequency. In this work, ZLY032 application is verified as a potential multitarget strategy for wound healing with good safety and efficacy. Furthermore, the discovery of the antimicrobial target of ZLY032 provides a theoretical basis for the development of novel antibiotics against drug-resistant strains.},

  abstract     = {Rhythmic light flicker alleviates cognitive impairments in various animal models of neurological diseases. However, its long-term effects and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, a cohort of adult mice is subjected to long-term exposure to 40 Hz light flicker (1 hour daily for 30 days) and observed significant enhancements in hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial learning without any adverse behavioral effects. Specific ablation of hippocampal newborn neurons using DCX DTR mice abolished these effects. Furthermore, the inactivation or elimination of GABAergic parvalbumin (PV) interneurons not only impaired 40 Hz light flicker entrainment but also reduce neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). Long-term flicker exposure increases excitatory input to DG PV interneurons, which enhances PV interneuron excitability, elevated GABA levels, and strengthened inhibitory transmission to newborn neurons, thereby promoting better integration of new neurons into the DG. Blocking GABA A receptors reverse the light flicker-induced increase in neurogenesis and spatial learning. Prolonged flicker exposure do not affect DG regional cerebral blood flow or the activity of excitatory cholinergic, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), or cholecystokinin (CCK) interneurons. These findings suggest that long-term light flicker enhances spatial learning through PV-dependent neurogenesis, with elevated GABAergic activity supporting the development and integration of immature neurons in the adult DG.},

  abstract     = {The miniaturization of domain size via point-defect modification has emerged as an effective strategy for optimizing piezoelectric properties in lead-free ferroelectrics, such as achieving large piezoelectric constants and slim-hysteresis electrostrain through polymorphic nanodomain design. However, this approach is not consistently reliable due to the uncontrollable deceleration of domain wall motion and polarization rotation (i.e., polar dynamics) caused by the random local fields around doping sites. In this work, an innovative strategy is proposed to enhance the polarization and electrostrain responses of nanodomain-patterned ferroelectrics through the design of a strain-enhanced glassy coexistent polar state (SGP), which can be established by incorporating large-radius cation Hf 4+ into (Ba 0.84 Ca 0.16 ) 0.985 Bi 0.01 (Ti 0.9 Zr 0.07 Sn 0.03 )O 3 compositions. The strain-enhanced crossover state between the neighboring glassy tetragonal and orthorhombic domains greatly facilitates overall polar dynamics. This is evidenced by the large dielectric figure of merit ε r /tan δ ≈ 9.9×10 5 with thermal stability up to 23 K, surpassing most of reported lead-free ferroelectric ceramics. Importantly, compared to the initial matrix, significant improvements of 20.8% and 34.2% in maximum polarization and electrostrain amplitude are achieved, while maintaining a minimal polarization/strain hysteresis (≈5%). This work would pave a novel paradigm for designing superior functional ferroics by optimizing the domain dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Cancer immunotherapy that activates the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway to resist tumors has recently attracted considerable attention. However, STING activation can induce opposing interferon functions that contribute to T-cell exhaustion via programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). In particular, effectively using the immune system to combat tumors remains a substantial challenge due to tumor immunosuppressive factors such as SMARCAL1. Here, a glucose-responsive CRISPR nanovaccine is developed for enhancing STING signaling while inhibiting interferon-mediated immunosuppressive feedback. The formulation encapsulates a bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework with glucose oxidase (GOx) and CRISPR-mediated SMARCAL1 gene-editing plasmids. The dual enzyme-driven cascade reactions of peroxidase and GOx generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and gluconic acid, which release and activate the genome-editing system. The silencing of SMARCAL1 enhances STING activity and inhibits PD-L1 expression, resulting in the termination of PD-L1-mediated opposing functions of interferon. Zinc ions and double-stranded DNA formed via ROS further activate the STING pathway, effectively inducing dendritic cell maturation and immune system activation. This is a critical report of in situ CRISPR nanovaccination driven by dual enzymes. The work highlights the potential of glucose-responsive CRISPR nanovaccination in bolstering antitumor immunity and extends the implementation of gene editing in cancer immunotherapy.},

Congenital TEF arises from embryological malformations, often coexisting with esophageal atresia (EA), while acquired TEF primarily stems from malignancies, radiotherapy, or trauma. This condition disrupts normal anatomical functions, leading to significant clinical issues, such as aspiration, respiratory infections, and malnutrition. The current review consolidates findings on the etiology, classification, and pathological mechanisms of TEF, emphasizing how genetic, developmental, and external factors shape its occurrence and progression. Diagnostic advancements, including radiological imaging, endoscopic evaluations, and newer monitoring techniques, have refined clinical assessment. Treatment paradigms for TEF vary from minimally invasive endoscopic interventions, to traditional open and innovative surgical approaches. Conservative management, such as nutritional and anti-infective therapies, remains vital, especially for milder cases. Emerging therapies in regenerative medicine—such as tissue-engineered scaffolds and platelet-rich plasmaoffer transformative potential for refractory cases. Future advancements are oriented toward exploring 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and precision medicine. The necessity of multidisciplinary collaboration is underscored in optimizing holistic patient care. While significant progress has improved cure rates and long-term outcomes, continued research on innovative technologies and clinical trials addressing knowledge gaps in long-term efficacy remains crucial.},

Cd triggers this process in hepatocytes, facilitating the transfer of autophagosomes from damaged to healthy cells for degradation.

Here, a critical role is identified for death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) in DE pathogenesis using transgenic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse models. Elevated DAPK1 expression in hippocampal excitatory neurons correlates with cognitive deficits, increases neuronal apoptosis, and disrupts synaptic plasticity. Conditional knockout of DAPK1 in CaMKII-positive neurons significantly mitigates these pathological features, improving cognitive performance and synaptic function. Mechanistically, it is demonstrated that reduced hippocampal microRNA (miR)-216a-5p levels in diabetic mice lead to DAPK1 upregulation. Furthermore, DAPK1 suppresses the expression of the neurotrophic factor Netrin-1 (Ntn1) by phosphorylating hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox A (HNF1A), a key transcription factor. Silencing Ntn1 in wild-type mice induces DE-like symptoms, while intranasal administration of recombinant Ntn1 restores cognitive function and synaptic integrity in diabetic mice. These findings establish an miR-216a-5p/DAPK1/Ntn1 signaling axis as a critical driver of diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction and suggest Ntn1 as a promising therapeutic target for DE.

Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in immune regulation; however, their exact contribution to ALI pathogenesis remains unclear. This study demonstrates that the upregulation of the glycolytic regulator 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 2 (PFKFB2) by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) enhances glycolysis, drives DC maturation, and exacerbates inflammation, contributing to the pathogenesis of ALI. The findings reveal that HIF-1α directly binds to the PFKFB2 promoter and drives its transcription, leading to increased glycolysis, accelerated DC maturation, and amplified immune activation. In paraquat (PQ)-ALI and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-ALI mouse models, DC-specific PFKFB2 knockout and DC-targeted delivery of HIF-1α inhibitor-loaded nanoparticles each significantly suppressed DC maturation and alleviated ALI severity. Analyses of lung tissues from patients with PQ poisoning, secondary bacterial pneumonia (2°BP), and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as from normal controls, confirmed these findings, showing increased PFKFB2 expression and DC maturation during ALI. These findings highlight the HIF-1α–PFKFB2 signaling pathway as a critical regulator of glycolysis-driven DC maturation and immune activation, offering novel insights into immunometabolic regulation and a promising therapeutic target for ALI.},

It is aimed to identify regulators of VSMC senescence and develop clinical interventions for ageing-related AS. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of human atherosclerotic carotid arteries and immunofluorescence validation, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is identified as central to VSMC senescence. Mechanistic studies employ SMC-specific ATF3 knockout mice, CUT&Tag-seq, RNA/protein interaction assays, and m6A epitranscriptomic analyses. To bridge discovery to therapy, high-throughput virtual screening is performed for ATF3-targeting compounds and functionally validated hits. ATF3 deficiency in VSMCs accelerates ageing-induced AS by promoting senescence. Multi-omics showed ATF3 activates ATG7, triggering autophagy, while cytoplasmic ATG7 enhances ATF3 nuclear translocation, establishing a positive feedback loop. Ageing increases m6A methylation and decreases the stability of Atf3 mRNA. Terazosin (TZ) diminishes the interaction between YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein F2 (YTHDF2) and Atf3 mRNA, helping to preserve Atf3 mRNA stability. TZ is a promising therapeutic strategy for delaying VSMC senescence and preventing AS. ATF3 protects against VSMC senescence and AS by orchestrating autophagy via a novel ATF3-ATG7 amplification loop. Repurposing TZ to stabilize ATF3 offers a translatable approach to combat ageing-driven cardiovascular disease.},

  abstract     = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer currently rank among the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Epidemiological studies reveal considerable overlap between CVD and cancer populations, posing challenges in the development of common clinical interventions. This review integrates global perspectives on the shared burden of CVD and cancer, with a focused analysis of regional and demographic disparities within China, as well as significant geographic and lifestyle diversity. This review explores preventive and therapeutic strategies by examining shared risk factors and intersectional mechanisms. First, as the easiest and most effective way, lifestyle modifications that benefit both CVD and cancer are summarized, including physical activity, diet modification, sleep pattern changes, and a reduction in tobacco and alcohol use. Key mechanistic intersections between CVD and cancer, such as metabolic regulation, immune-inflammation, and gut microbes, are discussed to extrapolate prospective homotherapy. Furthermore, the current status and challenges in various promising homotherapy for heteropathy between CVD and cancer are highlighted, especially emphasizing the use of conventional and newly developed CVD medications that may also confer benefits in cancer prevention or treatments. By bridging global trends with China-specific insights, this review aims to advance more precise and equitable prevention and treatments, ultimately reducing the combined burden of these two interconnected diseases.},

  abstract     = {Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, with dysregulated lipid metabolism contributing to tumor progression and therapy resistance. This study identifies the DNA demethylase TET3 as a key regulator of lipogenic metabolism in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). TET3 expression is elevated in the lipogenic PDAC subtype and correlates with poor patient prognosis. Genetic ablation of TET3 disrupts lipid homeostasis, alters the saturated-to-monounsaturated fatty acid ratio, and reduces proliferative capacity. Mechanistically, TET3 represses GATA6 expression through recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) to its promoter, leading to H3K27 deacetylation, independent of its catalytic activity. Loss of TET3 derepresses GATA6 , which in turn suppresses lipogenic enzymes, such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase ( SCD ) and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 3 ( ACSL3 ), and sensitizes cells to ferroptosis. Notably, combined treatment with the HDAC inhibitor SAHA and the ferroptosis inducer Erastin significantly enhances gemcitabine-induced cytotoxicity in lipogenic PDAC cells. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized non-catalytic function of TET3 in sustaining lipid metabolic reprogramming in PDAC. Targeting the TET3/GATA6 axis in combination with ferroptosis and epigenetic modulators offers a promising strategy to overcome therapeutic resistance in aggressive pancreatic cancer.},

SLFN14, a member of SLFN family, is associated with multiple human diseases; however, neither its functions nor its disease mechanisms are fully understood. Herein, human SLFN14 biochemically is characterized, demonstrating that it specifically cleaves RNAs containing short duplex regions, such as hairpin RNAs and tRNAs, but does not have ATPase or helicase activity. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures of SLFN14 apoenzyme (2.84 Å) and SLFN14-hairpin RNA complex (2.88 Å) are determined, revealing that SLFN14 assembles into a ring-like dimer and dimerization is mainly mediated by hydrophobic contacts. Two N-terminal RNase domains of SLFN14 are organized head-to-tail, forming an RNA-binding groove that can accommodate a 12-bp hairpin RNA. The hairpin RNA is recognized mainly through phosphate backbone interactions. Further, SLFN14 is shown to inhibits HIV-1 pseudovirus replication. The anti-HIV-1 activity of SLFN14 is via codon-usage-dependent translational inhibition and impairment of the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting, with an efficiency comparable to that of Shiftless. Using tRNA PCR arrays, SLFN14 and SLFN11 are found to decrease both nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial tRNAs in cells. Together, these results provide novel insights into the function of SLFN14 and its role in HIV-1 restriction.},

Ppy-PCL/Fe 3 O 4 , when combined with a static magnetic field, activates the superparamagnetic properties of the nanoparticles while ensuring conductivity, creating an environment conducive to nerve regeneration. The optimal intensity of the external magnetic field stimulation is assessed in vitro, and its effects on calcium influx and differentiation in rat RSC96 and PC12 cells, respectively, are examined. The superior efficacy of the integrated system in nerve regeneration is confirmed by histological and functional analyses in vivo. Exploration of the underlying molecular pathways using transcriptome sequencing shows that the regenerative system promotes the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and reduces the production of reactive oxygen species. This comprehensive approach not only demonstrates the efficacy of the system in promoting peripheral nerve regeneration but also lays the groundwork for elucidating the underlying mechanistic pathways involved.},

Unlike conventional room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) afterglow, the emergence of OLPL must include a charge separation process in its photophysical mechanism; consequently, the reported OLPL examples are much fewer than conventional afterglow materials. The incorporation of an electron donor or acceptor is conceived to interact with the long-lived excited state in conventional afterglow system, aiming to induce charge separation. Here, the study first builds two-component RTP/TADF afterglow systems composed of difluoroboron β-diketonate (BF 2 bdk) dopants and organic crystalline matrices, and then introduces an electron-donating component into the two-component BF 2 bdk-matrix systems to enable the charge separation processes. The resultant three-component materials exhibit visible-light-excitable OLPL afterglow lasting for several hours under ambient condition. Leveraging the efficient harvesting of singlet/triplet excitons by BF 2 bdk and the protective environment provided by the crystalline matrix, the three-component materials exhibit an estimated OLPL efficiency of ≈10% and display OLPL brightness comparable to inorganic Sr 2 Al 14 O 25 /Eu 2+ , Dy 3+ materials. Furthermore, the obtained OLPL materials show promising applications in afterglow displays and information storage, marking a significant step toward practical implementations of organic afterglow materials.},

A sensing system is needed to evaluate the response to external stimulation, but until now, only the human motor system-based biohybrid robot-on-a-chip with neuromuscular system has been developed without a sensing system. A human nervous system-based biohybrid robot-on-a-chip with eye function as a sensing system in addition to brain/motor neuron/muscle functions is proposed for the first time. Eye assembloid is fabricated by a combination of thalamic organoid covered with Au nanomesh and four retinal organoids. By a combination of eye assembloid, cerebral organoid, motor neuron spheroid, and muscle bundle on polymer substrate, a human nervous system-based biohybrid robot-on-a-chip is made. When blue light is used to cause retinal damage or a hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a retinal toxic chemical, is applied to the eye assembloid, they caused a decrease in muscle bundle contraction. These results indicated that electrophysiological signals generated by the eye assembloid are transmitted to the muscle bundle through cerebral organoid and motor neuron spheroids, and thus the proposed system can perform the toxicity screening. Human nervous system-based biohybrid robot-on-a-chip can be applied to drug screening of neurodegenerative diseases and toxicity screening for the complement of animal experiments in the future.},

Metabolic reprogramming plays a pivotal role in deciphering cancer heterogeneity and progression. Here, 9 datasets and 83 machine learning algorithm combinations are leveraged‌ to develop the Machine Learning-based Metabolic gene Prognostic Signature (MALMPS) model. The MALMPS model outperformed traditional clinical traits and molecular features in predicting prognosis for stage II/III CRC patients across training and validation datasets. COX7B, a key gene in MALMPS, is shown to promote CRC malignancy through multi-omics analysis and in vitro assays. CRC patients are stratified into high- and low-risk groups based on the median cutoff of MALMPS. Notably, the high-risk subgroup exhibited poor prognosis, activated inflammation, and enriched carbohydrate, glycosaminoglycan, and lipid metabolism, with therapeutic potential for IGF-1R and Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor. In contrast, the low-risk group displayed a TGF-β pathway inactivating mutation and enriched in nucleotides, cofactors, and amino acids metabolism. Metabolite profiling in the in-house SDCRC dataset validated the distinct metabolic alterations between the two groups. These findings indicate that MALMPS is a valuable instrument for predicting the recurrence risk of stage II/III colorectal cancer, particularly for identifying individuals at high risk.},

Curtailing these functions is essential in therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies or organ transplantation to avoid hyperactivation and rejection. A major challenge in the field is the precise, live measurement of T cell function at the single-cell level, limiting the prediction of immune responses, the development of effective immunotherapies, and optimization of immunosuppressive regimens. Gamma-Glutamyl Cysteine Ligase (GCL), the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione (GSH) synthesis, is essential for T cell function in mice, but its role in human T cells is underexplored. GLed , a novel reversible lanthanide-based GSH sensor is introduced that enables real-time, quantitative measurements of GCL activity at single-cell resolution. The GLed approach distinguishes GSH contributions from GCL and GSR, linking GCL activity directly to human T cell effector functions. Additionally, this reveals previously unknown modulation of GCL activity by immunosuppressive drugs, underscoring GCL as a critical player in T cell function and a potential therapeutic target in immune-related diseases.},

The remarkable antitumor activity of the designed recombinant protein-drug conjugate with star-shaped structure in both small and large tumor models can be attributed not only to the triple targeting against EGFR, HER2, and integrin α v β 3 , but also to the “site effect” of targeting elements in heterotrimeric fusion proteins brought by the unique topological structure.

  abstract     = {Aortic aneurysm and dissection (AAD) are life-threatening cardiovascular diseases with limited effective medical treatments. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), the most abundant serine/threonine phosphatase in eukaryotes, is pivotal in regulating intracellular signaling. This study investigates the role of PP2A in the pathogenesis of AAD. Analysis of available datasets revealed that PP2Acα is the most significantly downregulated PP2A subunit in human and mouse aneurysm tissues. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)-specific PP2Acα knockout exacerbates β-Aminopropionitrile (BAPN)-induced aortic dissection and elastase-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm in mice. Collagen-based contraction assays, Western blot, and gelatin zymography confirmed that the deficiency of PP2Acα results in decreased contractility, contractile markers, and elevated production of matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) in VSMCs. Furthermore, PP2Acα deficiency promoted VSMC phenotypic switching through stabilizing Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). Mechanistically, PP2Acα binds to and dephosphorylates protein kinase B 1 (AKT1), thereby reducing phosphorylation of the AKT1 substrate KLF4 at Thr398. The deficiency of PP2Acα diminishes KLF4 phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and degradation, leading to the suppression of VSMC contractile gene transcription. The findings underscore a critical role for PP2Acα in regulating VSMC phenotypic switching and AAD progression by controlling KLF4 phosphorylation and ubiquitination, offering novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis underlying AAD.},
