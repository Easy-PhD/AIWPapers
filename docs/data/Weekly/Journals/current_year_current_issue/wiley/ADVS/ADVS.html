  abstract     = {Behçet's uveitis (BU), characterized by recurrent bilateral panuveitis, is a severe manifestation of Behcet's disease (BD). However, disease-specific metabolic alterations in BU remain largely unknown. Here, untargeted metabolomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are performed in patients with BU and healthy controls (HC). scRNA-seq data of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) mice are also incorporated. The data showed an altered metabolic profile, characterized by upregulated glycolysis in BU. MYC is predicted to be a hub molecule regulating glycolysis and T cell response. Notably, it is discovered that the expression level of MYC is higher in BU compare to HC and may reflect the treatment response of BU disease. Correspondingly, the scRNA-seq data of EAU mice also reveal higher glycolysis levels and MYC expression. Further studies reveal that inhibition of MYC repressed glycolysis and exerted therapeutic effects similar to those of glycolysis inhibitors, including amelioration of EAU and repression of the abnormal response of effector T cells (T helper [Th]-1 and Th17 cells). Mechanically, inhibiting MYC disrupts the glycolysis-PI3K signaling circuit to curb the effector T cell response in uveitis. Collectively, the study indicated that MYC promoted glycolysis to fuel abnormal T-cell responses, thus therapeutically targeting MYC would provide an attractive approach for treating BU.},

  abstract     = {Capturing different pluripotent state stem cells from epiblast in vitro helps understand embryonic development and provides invaluable cell sources for basic research and regenerative medicine. Sheep are not only one of the most important livestock species in agriculture but also serve as an ideal preclinical model for studying human disease. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of sheep preimplantation embryos from embryonic day (E) 1 to E14 is performed to investigate the pluripotency changes of epiblast and elucidate the pluripotent regulation signaling. By combination of growth factors or inhibitors of JAK/STAT3, FGF, WNT, and TGF-β pathways in the culture medium, sheep formative and primed pluripotent stem cells (sfPSCs and spPSCs) are established respectively. The newly derived PSCs could maintain over 100 passages and differentiate into three germ layers. In addition, sfPSCs and spPSCs exhibit different molecular features, and sfPSCs have the ability of contribution to ICM and can be used as donor cells for producing cloned embryos efficiently. A cross-species comparison of early embryo development in mouse, pig and sheep illustrates the conservation of the epiblast naïve to primed state transition process and the divergence of the developmental events time points, the specific gene expression patterns and pluripotent regulation signaling. These studies are expected to improve our understanding of mammal early embryo development and present a reference for defining pluripotency.},

Copper- and iron-based nanozymes enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and regulate metal ion homeostasis, driving ferroptosis and cuproptosis. However, simultaneous delivery of copper and iron ions and the role of mitochondria-targeted copper in inducing cuproptosis remain underexplored. Here, a dual-functional nano-heterojunction platform, MIL-Cu 1.8 S-TPP/FA, is reproted, integrating iron- and copper-based components for synergistic ferroptosis and cuproptosis induction. Mitochondria-targeted Cu 1.8 S nanodots demonstrated high biocompatibility and efficiently induced cuproptosis by disrupting mitochondrial iron-sulfur proteins. Combined with MIL-88B, the iron-based metal-organic framework, the MIL-Cu 1.8 S heterojunction exhibited enhanced ROS catalytic activity, confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) analysis, with improved H 2 O 2 adsorption and lower energy barriers for peroxidase (POD)-like reactions. The dual-targeting MIL-Cu 1.8 S-TPP/FA nanoplatform effectively delivered copper ions to mitochondria and iron ions to tumor cells, modulating key ferroptosis- and cuproptosis-related markers, such as GPX4, GSH, FDX-1, and HSP70. The platform synergistically combined photothermal effects with multi-pathway cell death mechanisms, achieving significant anti-tumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of synchronously delivering copper and iron ions and highlights mitochondria-targeted strategies in advancing multi-modal cancer therapies.},

The incorporation of various photothermal materials into polymers has been developed for endowing composites with the capability of light harvesting and photothermal conversion, and management. However, their opaque appearance, vulnerability, and challenging processability limit their practical applications. Herein, it is successfully synthesized a series of versatile transparent films (PUMW) that combine photothermal self-healing function and mechanical strength through integrating polyurethane (PU) self-healing polymers with plasmonic enhanced MXene and W 18 O 49 hybrids (MXene@W 18 O 49 ). The resulting comprehensive film (PUMW4) maintained a visible-light transmittance of over 79% in 0.2 mm thickness, and could rapidly reach 102 °C within 5 min under light irradiation of 0.45 W cm −2 . Furthermore, it demonstrated a favorable ability for photothermal self-healing, with surface scratches disappearing in 2 min. Besides, the tensile strength of PUMW4 significantly increased from 22.7 to 30.7 MPa, in comparison with PUMW0 (pure PU). The proof of concept for an indoor thermal insulation test demonstrates that the organic glass house model covered with the film exhibited a temperature reduction of 10 °C compared to the naked model, highlighting the potential of as-prepared PUMW films in energy-saving applications for large-scale out-door buildings.},

Fecal microbiota transplantation and fecal conditioned medium are used to assess the specific involvement of gut bacterial metabolites in the effects of GPNs. Comprehensive multi-omics analyses showed that GPN significantly enriched the abundance of Alistipes senegalensis , an indole-producing commensal bacterium. Increased expression of tight junction-associated proteins, as well as activation of gut stem cells, are found to be mediated by the AhR pathway, indicating the causal mechanism by which GPN reduced increases in gut permeability. The results are verified in Caco-2/THP-1 cells, Caenorhabditis elegans , and enteroids. To the knowledge, this is the first identification of an integral functional axis through which GPN and functional metabolites of A. senegalensis influence the gut barrier and reduce systemic inflammation, providing clues for the potential development of innovative plant polysaccharide treatment strategies to promote healthy aging.},

  abstract     = {Impairment of neuronal plasticity is involved in a spectrum of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, yet its regulatory mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, it is reported that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor DEC2 serves as a pivotal regulator of both neuronal plasticity and epileptogenesis through its repression of sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 2 (SCN2A). Knockdown of DEC2 in hippocampal neurons elevates intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, exacerbating seizure susceptibility and severity. Conversely, overexpression of DEC2 in hippocampus reduces intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, ultimately decreasing seizure susceptibility. Mechanistically, DEC2 functions as a transcriptional repressor of Scn2a by directly binding class B E-boxes (CACGTG) in its promoter. Additionally, DEC2 forms complexes with myoblast determination protein 1 (MYOD1) and occupies the CAGCTG E-boxes within the Scn2a promoter; however, this interaction does not affect Scn2a transcription in vivo. These findings also reveal that cannabidiol (CBD) can modulate the DEC2-SCN2A axis. Notably, CBD predominantly enhances DEC2's direct transcriptional repression of SCN2A. In summary, this study identifies DEC2 as a critical regulator of neuronal plasticity in epilepsy progression, suggesting a novel therapeutic pathway for epilepsy treatment.},

Leveraging these characteristics, iPSCs hold great promise for developing wide-spectrum vaccines against cancers. In practice, iPSCs are typically combined with immune adjuvants to enhance antitumor immune responses; however, traditional adjuvants lack controllability and can induce systemic toxicity, which has limited their broad application. Here, a r ed/far-red light-controlled i PSC-based va ccine (RIVA) based on the chimeric photosensory protein FnBphP and its interaction partner LDB3 is developed; RIVA preserves the intrinsic tumor antigens of iPSCs and enables optogenetic control of an immune adjuvant's (IFN-β) expression under red light illumination. Experiments in multiple mouse tumor models demonstrate that RIVA inhibits tumor growth and improves animal survival in prophylactic and therapeutic settings, including against pulmonary metastatic 4T1 breast cancer. RIVA efficiently stimulates dendritic cell maturation, eliciting innate immune activation effects through NK cells and elicit adaptive immune anti-tumor responses through CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Moreover, RIVA protects animals against tumor re-challenge by inducing strong immunological memory, with minimal systemic toxicity. This study demonstrates RIVA as an effective optogenetic approach for developing safe multi-antigen vaccines for the prevention and treatment of cancer.},

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly aggressive subtype, currently lacks potent targeted therapies. ARID1B, a key SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex subunit, is linked to high-grade malignancies and poor prognosis, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. However, its function and regulation remain unclear. Here, it is found that uncontrolled accumulation of ARID1B and its dysregulated nuclear import promoted oncogenesis and drug resistance. ARID1B negatively regulates ARID1A, impairing SWI/SNF-mediated tumor suppression and enhancing tumor survival. Using protein complex purification and mass spectrometry, the KPNA2–KPNB1–RANBP2 protein cascade is identified as critical for facilitating ARID1B nuclear import. Replacing R1518, H1519, and D1522 residues on ARID1B with T1518, G1519, and G1522 attenuates the ARID1B–KPNA2/KPNB1 interaction, preventing recruitment of ARID1B to the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Pharmacologically inhibiting KPNB1 suppressed ARID1B translocation, limiting its nuclear levels. In TNBC mouse models, ARID1B knockout (KO) significantly reduces tumor growth and enhances PARP inhibitor efficacy. Collectively, these findings uncover an undocumented mechanism for ARID1B nuclear translocation and reveal that blockade of ARID1B nuclear translocation can be a new therapeutic strategy for TNBC.},

In this study, 5 batches of animal experiments are conducted to reveal the pathological process of chronic psychological stress on the heart, and found that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is an early manifestation of cardiac damage. Furthermore, it is discovered that corticosterone and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) play an important role in mediating this phenomenon. Additionally, a new direct target gene of GR, Lama5 , is identified and confirmed in vivo and in vitro that the corticosterone-GR-LAMA5 axis is a significant pathway mediating chronic psychological stress-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Moreover, the potential of LAMA5 is validated as a biomarker for myocardial hypertrophy and impaired cardiac function in patients with depression. In summary, a novel hypertrophy-related gene, Lama5 has been identified, that may play an important role in chronic psychological stress-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.},

Using high-throughput screening, the approved all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is identified that exhibit high selectivity in killing HMA-resistant AML cells compared to parental cells. Mechanistically, HMA-resistant cells are overloaded with DNA hypomethylation-associated endogenous viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) which, however, fails to trigger an anticancer interferon (IFN) immune response due to downregulation of dsRNA sensor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). ATRA compensates for RIG-I expression, thereby re-triggering IFN response and potently inhibiting HMA-resistant AML cell lines, xenograft mice, and patient-derived primary cells. A library of potential RIG-I-inducing compounds is rationally constructed and screened, in which the approved M3 AML treatment drug tamibarotene (TAM) exhibits strikingly 28036-fold selectivity and 779 p m IC 50 in killing HMA-resistant AML cells. ATRA and TAM do not selectively inhibit p53-mutant cancer cells. Together, this study uncovers a common resistance mechanism in HMA-treated AML patients and, in addition, provides highly potent and selective agents that can overcome resistance through re-triggering IFN anticancer immune response.},

Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) contribute to cancer ferroptosis, but underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, it is discovered that USP10 as a member of DUBs, is tightly associated with a poor prognosis in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Functionally, USP10 inhibits ferroptosis via transcriptionally upregulating the expression of SLC7A11 in HNSCC. Targeting USP10 via gene depletion and antagonist sensitizes HNSCC cells to ferroptosis inducers both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, USP10 directly interacts with the largest RNA Polymerase II Subunit A (POLR2A), removes the K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains of POLR2A through its deubiquitinase activity and prevents ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Then, POLR2A transcriptionally activates SLC7A11 , eventually leading to the suppression of ferroptosis. Overall, the study indicates that a novel USP10-POLR2A-SLC7A11 axis regulates ferroptosis, positioning USP10 as a potential therapeutic target in patients with HNSCC.},

TDP-43 regulates RNA processing, including cryptic exon splicing. Here, we demonstrate that TDP-43 directly controls growth-associated protein (GAP43) expression by binding to its pre-mRNA. Loss or hyperphosphorylation of TDP-43 disrupts this binding, leading to the inclusion of cryptic exon 4a1 , which introduces premature stop codons and reduces GAP43 protein levels. RNA sequencing analysis of ALS and AD brains revealed GAP43 downregulation, while 4a1 is upregulated in AD cases with phosphorylated TDP-43. TDP-43 knockdown impaired axonal regeneration in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons, whereas GAP43 restoration rescued this defect. These findings suggest that the loss of GAP43 contributes to neurodegeneration in ALS and AD. The inclusion of GAP43 cryptic exon 4a1 may serve as a hallmark of TDP-43 proteinopathies, highlighting a mechanistic link between TDP-43 dysfunction and neuronal vulnerability.},

NETs play a key role in the pathological process of sepsis. However, the specific regulatory mechanism has not been fully clarified. This study finds that the levels of NETs in peripheral blood are significantly elevated in clinical sepsis patients and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse models, and the expression of Acod1 is closely related to the generation of NETs. Acod1 knockout led to a further increase in NETs levels in CLP mice, aggravated the inflammatory response, worsened organ damage, and reduced the survival rate. Further studies indicate that E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5 interacts with PAD4 (one of the core proteins for NETs generation). Acod1/itaconate (ITA) enhanced the enzymatic activity of UBR5 through alkylation modification, promoting the K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of PAD4, thereby inhibiting NETosis. In conclusion, this study combines transcriptomics, metabolomics, genetic engineering, and co-immunoprecipitation techniques to reveal the molecular mechanism of Acod1/ITA in regulating NETs, providing new potential targets and theoretical basis for the treatment of sepsis.},

Nevertheless, their practical deployment is significantly constrained by several challenges, including the intrinsic low conductivity of sulfur, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPS), sluggish redox kinetics, and instability of the Li anode. To overcome these limitations, the integration of catalytic materials has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate sulfur redox reactions, promote LiPS conversion, and enhance cycling stability. Recently, high-entropy catalysts (HEC), comprising five or more metallic elements in near-equimolar ratios, have garnered increasing attention owing to their entropy-stabilized structures, abundant active sites, and tunable electronic properties. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the design principles, synthesis methods, and electrochemical applications of various HEC families, including high-entropy alloys, oxides, sulfides, nitrides, phosphides, MXenes, and Prussian blue analogues, in Li–S battery systems. The synergistic effects arising from multicomponent interactions, structural advantages, and underlying catalytic mechanisms are systematically discussed. Finally, key challenges such as scalable synthesis, in-depth mechanistic elucidation, and rational compositional design are addressed, along with future directions aimed at advancing high-performance HEC-based Li–S battery systems.},

These ordered configurations facilitate efficient pathways for charge and mass transport. Particularly, in comparison with first-order structure, hierarchical structure designs exhibit more obvious advantages in reaction interface, charge, and mass transport.

Their intrinsic advantages—such as superior interfacial contact with electrodes, tunable ionic conductivity, and compatibility with scalable manufacturing methods—as well as the key technical challenges they face, including limited thermal stability, narrow electrochemical windows, and interfacial degradation, are examined. This study highlights emerging solutions from recent research, including polymer molecular design, polymer–ceramic composites, and in situ polymerization strategies. In contrast to oxide and sulfide systems, which face significant barriers in cost, manufacturability, and integration, polymer-based electrolytes offer a realistic and economically viable path to large-scale deployment.

  abstract     = {Redox, a native modality in biology involving the flow of electrons, energy, and information, is used for energy-harvesting, biosynthesis, immune-defense, and signaling. Because electrons (in contrast to protons) are not soluble in the medium, electron-flow through the redox modality occurs through redox reactions that are sometimes organized into pathways and networks (e.g., redox interactomes). Redox is also accessible to electrochemistry, which enables electrodes to receive and transmit electrons to exchange energy and information with biology. In this Perspective, efforts to develop electrochemistry as a tool for redox-based bio-information processing: to interconvert redox-based molecular attributes into interpretable electronic signals, are described. Using a series of Case Studies, how the information-content of the measurements can be enriched using: diffusible mediators; tuned electrical input sequences; and cross-modal measurements (e.g., electrical plus spectral), is shown. Also, theory-guided feature engineering approaches to compress the information in the electronic signals into quantitative metrics (i.e., features) that can serve as correlating variables for pattern recognition by data-driven analysis are described. Finally, how redox provides a modality for electrogenetic actuation is illustrated. It is suggested that electrochemistry's capabilities to provide real-time, low-cost, and high-content data in an electronic format allow the feedback-control needed for autonomous learning and deployable sensing/actuation.},

  abstract     = {Organophosphinic acids, R 2 P(O)(OH), and their derivatives are versatile compounds with applications in catalysis, material chemistry, biomolecular bridging, metal extraction, and flame retardancy. Current synthetic methods primarily rely on white phosphorus (P 4 ) as a precursor, which is converted into nucleophilic or electrophilic P-synthons through acid-/base-induced disproportionation (e.g., PH 3 , [H 2 PO 2 ] – ) or chlorination (PCl 3 ). However, P 4 poses significant drawbacks due to its highly pyrophoric nature, environmental hazards, and the energy-intensive production process from phosphate ores. Previously, we introduced a method to bypass P 4 in the synthesis of P V compounds through the redox-neutral activation of phosphates using trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (Tf 2 O) and pyridine, yielding the electrophilic PO 2 + phosphorylation reagent [(pyridine) 2 PO 2 ][OTf] ( 1a [OTf]). While this reagent exhibits high selectivity for alcohols, amides, and (pseudo)halides, it failed to react efficiently with organometallic compounds to form organophosphinates. Here, we present mechanistic studies that rationalize this limitation and report an optimized strategy, which successfully facilitates reactions with Grignard reagents. By replacing the pyridine leaving group in 1a [OTf] with 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), the reagent [(DMAP) 2 PO 2 ][OTf] ( 1b [OTf]) is obtained, which enables the selective synthesis of a broad range of diaryl- and dialkynylphosphinates, thereby expanding the scope of redox-neutral phosphate activation.},

Activation of the cGAS-STING pathway holds significant potential to enhance antitumor immunity. However, their efficacy remains constrained by various drug delivery and pharmacological obstacles, including poor stability, limited cellular uptake, inefficient intracellular delivery, suboptimal tumor targeting, and immunotoxicity. There is a growing focus on the design and application of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems (nano-DDSs) to improve the delivery of cGAS-STING agonists for safe, effective, and specific targeting. This review outlines the latest advancements in cGAS-STING agonist-based nanotherapeutics. First, the research background of the cGAS-STING pathway and nanotechnology is briefly outlined to emphasize the promise of STING agonist-based nanotherapeutics in cancer immunotherapy. Second, the progress in the development of cGAS-STING agonists and recent advancements in cGAS-STING agonist-based nanotherapeutics are overviewed. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms and applications of STING agonist-based combination therapies are discussed, including synergistic strategies with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy (e.g., immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor, cancer vaccine, adoptive cell therapy (ACT)), phototherapy, sonodynamic therapy (SDT), and targeted therapy. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives of STING agonist-based nanotherapeutics in clinical cancer therapy are proposed.},

In this study, a range of Trp metabolites are evaluated for their potential to modulate tumor immunogenicity using a co-culture assay with tumor cells and T cells. Indole-3-aldehyde (I3A) is identified as an indole derivative that significantly enhances tumor immunogenicity both in vitro and in vivo. This enhancement is attributed to the upregulation of antigen presentation and immunogenic molecules on tumor cells by I3A, thereby promoting their immunogenicity. Mechanistically, I3A induces the activation and degradation of Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), leading to increased expression of MHC-I molecules on tumor cell surfaces. Meantime, I3A induces rapid degradation of c-MYC in tumor cells and further enhances T cell activation. In mouse melanoma and lymphoma models, I3A demonstrates immune-dependent antitumor effects and enhances the efficacy of adoptive OT-I T cell therapy. Moreover, overexpression of the Trp metabolic enzyme interleukin-4-induced gene-1 (IL4I1) in tumor cells increases the intracellular level of I3A and enhances tumor immunogenicity. In summary, I3A is identified as a tumor immunogenicity inducer, which holds the potential to enhance antitumor immunotherapy efficacy.},

  abstract     = {The confinement of breast cancer cells at the interface of the mammary gland lumen and its surrounding extracellular matrix is thought to be a key physical driver of cellular plasticity. The relationship between confinement-induced solid stress and drug resistance is not well understood due to a scarcity of models that faithfully isolate the contribution of confinement on cancer cell behavior. Herein, drop-on-demand printing is used to uniquely replicate the spatial compartmentalization of the native cancer-host interface: MCF-7 breast cancer cells are dispensed within bioinert cup-shaped alginate-based hydrogels in high-throughput to yield “confined” spheroids. Hydrogel confinement affects the emergence of CD44+-CD133+ cells at the spheroid interface that drives a two-fold increase in doxorubicin/tamoxifen resistance compared to control “unconfined” spheroids. Whilst the peripheral drug-resistant phenotype is observed clinically, the model is unique in facilitating the emergence of this population in an in vitro setting. Pharmacological modulation of mechanotransduction proteins (YAP, myosin), abrogated the emergence of this peripheral phenotype, implicating mechanotransduction pathways as an effective way to target solid stress-induced drug resistance. Together, this supports an “interfacial stress—stemness—drug resistance” relationship that sheds new light on the existing paradigm of spatial emergence of drug resistance in breast cancer.},

Second, functional applications of Xenes in electronics, optoelectronics, catalysis, energy storage, and biomedicine are also reviewed.

Recent advances in single-cell technologies have enabled high-resolution profiling of the TME, particularly tumor-infiltrating immune cells, across diverse cancer types. However, our understanding of how immune cells shape ICI responses and how they are dynamically altered during treatment remains incomplete. In this review, we summarize recent progress in characterizing TME features associated with ICI responsiveness, highlighting key immune cell subsets involved in ICI therapy and emphasizing their phenotypic plasticity and functional adaptability following ICIs. Additionally, we outline the spatial architecture of the TME in terms of its effects on immune cell behavior and interactions, and discuss the critical role of stromal components and the microbiota in modulating the immune landscape and influencing ICI responsiveness. By integrating these insights, we aim to deepen our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying ICI responses, elucidate determinants of therapeutic sensitivity and resistance, and inform the development of more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.},

The introduction of oxidizing O 2 gas to the microscope led to structural changes on the NP surface and decrease the intrinsic negative charge of the NP. Conversely, under reducing H 2 gas, the surface structure and charge state of the NP remained almost unchanged compared to those in vacuum. Systematic analysis revealed that the injection and removal of O 2 gas caused reversible changes in the charge state of the NP within the range of a few electrons. The effect of O 2 gas on charging of the NP is confirmed by first-principles calculations. These findings demonstrate the potential of electron holography in gas environments for advancing the understanding the reaction mechanisms on heterogeneous catalysts.},

Here, through serological testing of mice with fatty liver, it is found that the rhythms of prolactin secretion are disturbed and that the circulating prolactin level is reduced. Based on these findings, prolactin's biological effects on fatty liver are investigated, and biomimetic photothermal-responsive core–shell microneedles with periodically prolactin releasing are proposed to inhibit lipid accumulation in liver. The microneedles are comprised of poly(lactic- co -glycolic acid) shells and prolactin-loaded cores of photothermal black phosphorus, phase-change gelatin, and carrageenan. Under periodically stimulation of near infrared (NIR), the prolactin in the microneedles can be released in a rhythmic manner for inhibiting the lipid accumulation in liver cells. Based on these features, it is demonstrated in mice with fatty liver that the bioinspired-responsive microneedles can facilitate prolactin mitigating hepatic steatosis through its interaction with the hepatic prolactin receptor (PRLR) and by modulating the expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36). Thus, these photothermal-responsive core–shell microneedles with prolactin pulse release hold significant promise for the treatment of fatty liver disease.},

The surface of the gripper is composed of vertically aligned composite nanowires with an average diameter of 79 nm. When a liquid is injected into the nanoporous membrane, capillary adhesion occurs, allowing the object to be picked up. As the liquid evaporates, the object can be released by extremely sparse contact. The off-state adhesion of a millimeter-scale gripper is even lower than the gravitational force of thin polymer films (0.18 mN cm −2 ), enabling the solid-contactless release of lightweight materials. We characterize and model the mechanism across length scales and provide pick-and-place demonstrations including LED chips, micro-architected materials, and thin-film electronics.},

This study pioneers a novel approach to fabricating Mg-Ta incompatible LMCs via crystal orientation regulation, achieving in situ formed serrated mechanically interlocked interfaces with exceptional bonding strength (80.5 MPa) through hot-rolling. It also exhibits exceptional tensile properties with an ultimate tensile strength of 340–395 MPa, a yield strength of 301–363 MPa, and an elongation of 5–10.2%. Systematic multiscale investigations combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a hierarchical interfacial architecture comprising dual heterointerfaces zone (hexagonal close-packed /face center cubic Mg/Cu and face centered cubic /body-centered cubic Cu/Ta), with strain-modulated micro-serrations (width: 1.6–5.5 µm; depth: 6–15 µm) morphology, along with atomic interdiffusion zones (1.1–3.1 µm). A quantifiable inverse correlation is identified between serration dimensions and interfacial strength, with reduced width and depth directly enhancing bond integrity. Furthermore, the heterointerface evolution mechanism is decoupled into three thermomechanical stages: 1) crystallographic orientation optimization via dissimilar atomic contact, 2) strain-driven micro-sawtooth generation through dislocation slip competition, and 3) geometric interlocking completion via interface self-assembly. This work establishes a universal paradigm for designing multifunctional structural materials through strain-engineered heterointerface manipulation, rather than just applying several specific deformations processes.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical behavior and microstructural evolution of a BCC-phase NbTaTiV refractory multi-principal element alloy (RMPEA) is studied over a wide range of strain rates (10 −3 to 10 3 s −1 ) and temperatures (room temperature to 850 °C). The mechanical property of present RMPEA shows less strain-rate dependence and strong resistance to softening at high temperatures. Under high strain-rate loading, the formation of thin type-I twins is observed, which could lead to an increase in strain-hardening rates. However, this hardening mechanism competes with adiabatic heating effects, resulting in the deterrence of strain-hardening behaviors. In contrast, substantial strain-hardening occurs at cryogenic temperatures due to the formation of twins, which act as stronger barriers to dislocation motion and interact with each other. To further understand the different strain-hardening behaviors, density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict relatively low stacking fault energies and high twinning stress for the NbTaTiV RMPEA.},

  abstract     = {Co-precipitation is an attractive means for synthesizing mixed metal oxides, a material class with a wide range of application prospects. Often soluble metal salts are precipitated as metal hydroxides or -carbonates, which subsequently are converted to the corresponding oxide(s) upon thermal treatment. The thermal treatment step is used to induce compositional homogeneity on the atomic level. In order to shed some more light on this effect, detailed analyses of a mixed Li-Ni-Mn-oxide with the target composition LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 (LNMO), which is a promising cathode material for rechargeable Li-ion batteries are performed. The first synthesis step is the precipitation of a Ni-Mn-carbonate, which is subsequently thermally lithiated and transformed into an oxide. A combination of X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Raman microscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX) in combination with elemental analysis, as well as electrochemical characterization, revealed that chemical inhomogeneities present already in the precursor particles have a direct influence on the electrochemical performance of the final product. The broader implications of these results in relation to co-precipitation-based syntheses of functional materials are discussed, with special focus on the importance of the particle size distribution of the secondary particles.},

However, the absence of alkali metal cations in the SSE-based CO 2 RR process at the cathode poses a challenge, constraining the performance and stability of CO 2 RR and exacerbating the hydrogen evolution side reaction. Herein, a novel strategy for the tunable production of both electrolyte-free HCOOH and sodium formate (HCOONa) solution through the regulation of anolyte composition in an SSE-based cell is reported. Employing this strategy, the continuous generation of a ≈0.27 m electrolyte-free HCOONa solution and ≈0.22 m electrolyte-free HCOOH solution with extended stabilities of 300 and 200 h, respectively is achieved. More importantly, the introduction of sodium ions resulted in a reduction of cell voltage by ≈1000 mV and further enhances the stability of the cell. In situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that GB-Bi requires a lower applied potential for formate production, owing to its stronger binding energy to the key intermediate OCHO* compared to Bi. Finally, a techno-economic analysis indicates that this strategy for HCOONa solution production possesses excellent economic viability.},

  abstract     = {The magneto-mechano-electric (MME) coupling principle plays an important role in synchronously harvesting magnetic energy and monitoring safe operation in the distribution grid and the Power Internet of Things (PIoT). In this study, an MME resonator is presented, containing two crossed U-fingers made of piezoelectric phase-elastic beams with different lengths and magnet masses, operating in symmetric, decoupling dual bending modes. One U-finger resonating at 50 Hz serves as energy harvester (EH), while the other resonating at 185 Hz acts as current or magnetic sensor, enabling the resonator to simultaneously and wirelessly capture 50 Hz stray magnetic field ( H AC ,50 Hz ) energy and ground fault message of power lines by injecting an additional non-grid-frequency (185 Hz) current. The EH U-finger generates an output power of 1.53 mW RMS under a weak H AC ,50 Hz of only 0.5 Oe, achieving a normalized power density surpassing current standards. While the sensing U-finger shows a high sensitivity to H AC ,185 Hz with a detectability of 710 pT, even the EH U-finger is operating. The application test demonstrates the system's wireless monitoring and synchronous self-powered functions, providing stable energy for self-sensing data processing and transmission.

  abstract     = {Charge transfer properties between 3D and 2D perovskite layers play a key role in determining the performance of 3D/2D heterostructure perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the exact photophysical behaviors at 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure remain ambiguous, which makes it challenging to form the desired 3D/2D heterostructure. Herein, via combining the state-of-the-art ultrafast spectroscopies of femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, transient absorption microscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, charge transfer and recombination dynamics are unveiled at 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure, for comparison, where the 2D layers are fabricated through the two distinct approaches of organic ligand surface reaction (2D L ) and 2D crystal seed direct deposition (2D S ), respectively. 3D/2D S heterostructure exhibits superior hole transfer from 3D to 2D S , featuring a large spatial diffusion constant and high charge mobility compared to 3D/2D L , attributed to the higher phase purity and the lower defects in 2D S . Moreover, 3D/2D S heterostructure yields suppressed nonradiative recombination, reduced Langevin recombination, and increased quasi-Fermi level splitting, significantly aiding fast photoinduced charge transfer at such heterostructure. These advantages are further confirmed by a remarkably improved PSC efficiency using 3D/2D S , especially in terms of enhanced open-circuit voltage and diminished energy loss. This work sheds light on the dynamics at 3D/2D heterostructures, providing a promising guideline for designing 3D/2D high-performance PSCs.},

Herein, by incorporating both the µ -oxo bridged Fe III -porphyrins and NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) mimics into an allosteric coordination capsule, the regulation of O 2 activation and the upregulation of intracellular methionine depletion have been achieved, resulting in effective pH-activated tumor immunotherapy. Upon light irradiation, the transition from the tensed bridged Fe III -porphyrins to the relaxed unbridged Fe IV = O/Fe II porphyrin pair induces unique conformational switching. The relaxed state of the capsule facilitates the binding of substrates for the oxygen atom transfer reaction. The in situ formed Fe II -porphyrin pair, following the substrate oxygenation, activates O 2 with the intervention of NADH mimics to restore the tensed state of the capsule, thereby releasing the product for the next cycle. Regulated by the acid/base content in the system, this allostery-triggered metabolic behavior enhances the efficacy of intracellular methionine depletion therapy through the accumulation of local methionine sulfoxide, thereby improving safety. The allosteric switching strategy offers an improved approach for precise tumor treatment via dual light-and-guest stimuli-responsive regulation.},

However, achieving selectivity for C1 hydrocarbons remains challenging. Here, 32 Janus DACs (J-M'M) are designed and investigated for CO 2 R using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, identifying 13 capable of producing methanol and methane. Notably, J-FeCo and J-CoNi exhibit favorable limiting potentials (−0.38 and −0.45 V vs. RHE) for CH 3 OH and CH 4 production, respectively, based on constant-potential calculations. Compared to normal DACs (N-M'M), Janus DACs demonstrate enhanced initial CO 2 hydrogenation and stronger CO adsorption. Oxygen coordination in J-FeCo and J-CoNi induces a downshift/upshift of majority-/minority-spin energy levels of d z2 , d yz , and d xz orbitals toward the Fermi level relative to N-FeCo and N-CoNi, strengthening the bonding state and weakening the antibonding state, thereby improving CO adsorption. Furthermore, an effective descriptor based on atomic features is identified to evaluate *CO binding strength. This work highlights the critical role of partial oxygen coordination in DACs for C1 hydrocarbons production and proposes a robust descriptor to guide the design of related catalysts.},

Addressing the critical need for simplified system integration, a single-metal bifunctional catalyst is developed by modulating electronic metal-support interactions (EMSI) to construct semi-crystalline Ru domains with metastable crystalline-amorphous interfaces. The optimized catalyst achieves ultralow overpotentials of 21.5 mV (hydrogen evolution) and 254 mV (hydrazine oxidation) at 10 mA cm⁻ 2 , alongside spontaneous hydrazine decomposition at open-circuit potential. This synergy enables near-zero energy input for electrolysis, evidenced by a steep polarization slope (1.235 A cm⁻ 2 V⁻¹), which surpasses conventional hybrid systems. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that amorphous Ru sites near the interface induce charge redistribution, which partially optimizes the free energy changes associated with adsorption * H and the dehydrogenation process from * N₂H₄ to * N₂H₃. This is accompanied by a transformation of the rate-determining step into the * N₂H → * N₂ pathway, thereby advancing the kinetics of the bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction/hydrazine oxidation reaction (HER/HzOR) reactions.

The findings elucidate key regulatory pathways underlying both inflorescence development and sex differentiation. Through the characterization of dynamic transcriptional changes across four consecutive developmental phases, distinct cell types within the shoot apex and stage-specific marker genes are identified. Notably, pseudotime trajectory analysis reveals that spinach sex differentiation occurs at the four-leaf stage. Furthermore, the critical involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in this process is demonstrated. By integrating functional genetic validation, the epigenetic regulator MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA 1 (MSI1) together with histone deacetylase HDT2 is discovered to promote female differentiation. Collectively, this work provides comprehensive insights into the regulatory networks controlling inflorescence development and sexual differentiation in spinach and establishes a valuable resource for advancing sex differentiation research in dioecious plants.},

  abstract     = {Zr 2 Fe alloy is a promising candidate as a tritium-getter material for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), but its practical application is hindered by undesirable inverse disproportionation behavior and poor anti-disproportionation properties. In this study, theoretical computational screening is utilized to predict the effects of partially substituting Fe with Co, Cu, and Ni on regulating the Zr 2 Fe 1-x M x (M = Co, Cu, Ni; x = 0.1–0.5) hydrogen storage systems. Experimentally, these modifications successfully correct the distorted inverse disproportionation reaction and achieve full reversibility in the Zr 2 Fe 1-x M x- H systems. Notably, Zr 2 Fe 0.8 Cu 0.2 and Zr 2 Fe 0.7 Ni 0.3 alloys retain excellent hydrogen storage properties, while their kinetic energy barriers of hydriding disproportionation reaction increase significantly from 87.88 kJ mol −1 (Zr 2 Fe) to 184.35 kJ mol −1 (Zr 2 Fe 0.8 Cu 0.2 ) and 192.32 kJ mol −1 (Zr 2 Fe 0.7 Ni 0.3 ), respectively. The corresponding deceleration of hydriding disproportionation kinetics behaviors is clearly visualized by TEM observations. Combined density functional theory analyses reveal that the mechanism underlying enhanced anti-disproportionation properties in the optimized Zr 2 Fe 1-x M x- H systems involves the homogenization and stabilization of Zr─H bonds within the hydrogen storage interstices, along with the effective suppression of disproportionation-favorable chemical environments.},

  abstract     = {Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains a significant clinical challenge due to delayed diagnosis and multidrug resistance, necessitating innovative strategies to enhance early detection and therapeutic efficacy. This review evaluates the role of lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs), including liposomes, micelles, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers, as advanced drug delivery systems in providing innovative solutions for RCC diagnosis and treatment. These LNPs exhibit unique advantages of great biocompatibility, biodegradability, extended circulation, and tumor-targeting capabilities, which enable precise drug delivery, controlled release, and circumvention of drug resistance mechanisms. After integrating recent advancements, it is highlighted that formulations such as Liposome@Sunitinib can enhance tumor accumulation, two-drug-loaded liposomes can activate immune responses, and RNA therapy in combination with immunomodulators can reverse drug resistance. Current findings underscore the transformative potential of lipid-based nanotechnology in addressing RCC-specific challenges, particularly in overcoming biological barriers and refining personalized treatment approaches. In the future, multifunctional nano platforms, precision therapies based on patient genes, advanced materials engineering, combination therapies, and sustainable manufacturing can be developed to promote the application of LNPs in the treatment of RCC and realize personalized nanomedicine.},

  abstract     = {Heterostructure single crystals have emerged as a significant functional material system due to their unique properties and potential for novel optoelectronic device applications. Particularly, their distinctive structural characteristics offer promising prospects for suppressing ion migration, which is highly advantageous for X-ray detection. Herein, by gradually modifying the cyclohexylmethylamine cation into the 4-aminomethyltetrahydropyran cation, a layered heterostructure single crystal (PbCl 2 ) 2 (4-Aminomethyltetrahydropyran) 2 PbCl 4 is successfully obtained. It comprises two distinct inorganic frameworks, namely a perovskite layer built from PbCl₆ octahedra and an intergrowth layer consisting of PbCl₂ units, wherein the organic components are firmly anchored to the intergrowth layer via Pb─O bonds, thereby enhancing the crystal stability and effectively suppressing ion migration, as evidenced by high ion migration activation energy (1.64 eV) and extremely low dark current drift (2.86 × 10 −18 A cm −1 V −1 s −1 ). X-ray devices based on the ultra-stable heterostructure single crystal demonstrate an extraordinary sensitivity of 8453.3 µC Gy −1 cm −2 (at 40 V), ultra-low detection limit of 5.2 nGy s −1 and superior air stability (≈1 year). Such values make it one of the most outstanding candidates for high-performance X-ray detection. This work promotes the development of heterostructure single crystals optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Halide perovskites (HaP), with their exceptional optoelectronic properties and high-power conversion efficiencies in photovoltaic devices, hold promise for photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications in green fuel and chemical production. However, their stability in aqueous environments remains a challenge. This study investigates the stability and degradation mechanisms of the 2D Ruddlesden-Popper phase phenylethyl ammonium lead iodide (PEA (+) 2 PbI 4 ) thin films in aqueous electrolytes under dark and illuminated conditions. While PEA (+) 2 PbI 4 thin films appear to be thermodynamically stable in an aqueous electrolyte with phenylethyl ammonium iodide (PEAI), illumination causes significant photodegradation generating a deprotonated and dehalogenated 2D intercalation product: phenylethylamine-lead iodide, 2PEA (0) -PbI 2 . The degradation of the 2D semiconductor leads to substantial reduction in the photovoltage, adversely impacting the material performance in photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices. To intercept photo-excited charge carriers in the 2D semiconductor, the I 3 − /I − redox is added, which reduced photodegradation. The findings underscore that while catalytic reactions at halide perovskite electrodes in aqueous electrolytes are feasible, reversible and irreversible photodegradation remains a critical limitation that must be addressed in the design of PEC devices employing metal halide semiconductor layers for direct electrochemical energy conversion.},

However, the enhanced light-matter interactions and reduced group velocity tend to arouse high sensitivity to the environment, challenging fabrication and operation in practical applications. In this work, the first experimental demonstration of topological QI-like effect is reported in a 1D on-chip system, where two different topological mechanisms are induced to provide robustness for slow light. Topological charges rooted in the parameter space can offer immunity to parameter deviations, such as coupling strengths, and topological edge states rooted in the momentum space can manifest robustness against structural disturbances, like width disorders and bending deformations. By incorporating bright and dark edge states into a composite waveguide, the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) window is observed and switching between slow light and fast light is demonstrated by measuring the transmission and group delays. The findings provide an extensible platform for exploring novel QI and topological physics, and pave the avenue for developing robust on-chip devices.},

  abstract     = {Post-transplanted dysfunction remains the key unsolved challenge to construct bioengineered complex organs. Herein, by analyzing the bioengineered trachea, it is found that multiple tissue senescences occur, and poor endogenous cellular contact and exogenous immune microenvironment dysregulation are identified as two crucial factors during senescence. Therefore, a Hebe engineered trachea (Hebe-ET) with a ring–ring structure and dual anti-senescence designs is proposed for maintaining regenerative homeostasis after transplantation. First, in the cartilage rings, a fiber-film structural scaffold is designed to promote close-packed cellular contact, significantly reducing senescent P21+ chondrocytes. Furthermore, between the cartilage rings are distributed fibrous connective tissue rings, in which the loaded quercetin induces an immune cascade to restrain senescence in multiple cells, including chondrocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts via mitochondrion-targeted oxidative stress scavenging, promoting the development of the full tracheal components in vivo. Based on these designs, 12 weeks after orthotopic transplantation, the Hebe-ET achieves sustainable youth and develops a natural-like structure with mature cartilage phenotype, reconstructed vascular network, and epithelium coverage. The mechanical property exceeds that of the natural trachea, and 87.5% of animals survived. This study first reveals the necessity of anti-senescence design in the fabrication of complex organ substitutes and proposes an effective engineering strategy for segmental trachea reconstruction.},

Improving nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) condition first requires a supportive surrounding environment. However, how to provide an excellent microenvironment before regulating the function of the NPCs is not yet a complete strategy. In this study, a sequential drug delivery system is comprised of chitosan hydrogel (G-CS) loaded with Angiotensin (1-7) and mesoporous silica nanospheres (MSN) coating with α-mangostin to achieve synergistic effects of anti-inflammatory and regulation of metabolic disorders of the ECM in NPCs. The system first explosively releases outer G-CSloaded Angiotensin (1-7) by exploiting the different solubility characteristics of the two drugs, which improves the inflammatory environment by inhibiting the integrated stress response and regulating the macrophage phenotype. During the second stage, the inner layer of the MSN controlled-release loaded α-mangostin to regulate ECM metabolism and synthesis, slowing cell aging and apoptosis. Furthermore, α-mangostin promotes mitophagy in NPCs by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and activating the Pink1/Parkin pathway, promoting the clearance of damaged mitochondria. The proposed drug delivery system represents an innovative and promising strategy for treating IDD.},

  abstract     = {Superlattice structures, created by the periodic arrangement of two or more distinct materials, have attracted significant interest. This paper proposes a strategy for designing superlattice structures in soft materials with improved dielectric and mechanical properties. Two types of acid-functionalized block copolymers and a series of zwitterions with varying cationic and anionic structures are synthesized. When the zwitterion anion possesses a localized charge and the cation exhibits weak interactions with the acid groups in the polymers, the zwitterions preferentially localize at the interfacial layers between the ionic and ionophobic domains. As the zwitterion concentration increases and ion–dipole interactions strengthen within the confined subdomains, the interfacial curvature of the superlattice transitions from lamellae to cylindrical morphology and further evolves to Frank-Kasper phases. Notably, these morphological transitions occur despite the symmetrical volume fractions of the ionic phases. These superlattice structures and Frank-Kasper phases exhibit thermal stability up to 150 °C, a high static dielectric constant of 25, and excellent mechanical properties including a modulus of 360 MPa, hardness of 16 MPa, stiffness of 772 N m −1 , and energy dissipation index of 0.675 at 22 °C, making them highly promising candidates for advanced applications in soft electronics and memory devices.},

However, the dual requirement for high mechanical robustness and good injectability poses a fundamental challenge, as improvements in one often compromise the other. Colloidal gels offer tunable mechanical properties and feasible injectability through the bottom-up assembly of building blocks. Here an interfacial reinforcement strategy is developed by enhancing specific surface area and roughness to fabricate nanosheet-mica (NM) magnetic colloidal gels (NMMG). The negatively charged NM, exfoliated from natural ground mica (GM), possessed increased binding sites, while in situ grown Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles enhanced building block roughness, reducing intergranular displacement and thereby maintaining mechanical strength while ensuring injectability. Compared with GM-based magnetic colloidal gels, NMMG can be injected through 2.6 F catheter with ≈20 N force (40% of manual limit), while storage modulus improved from ≈800 to ≈1800 Pa (2.25-fold higher than embolization minimum limit). Transcatheter embolization with NMMG significantly inhibited tumor growth. Furthermore, NMMG-mediated minimally invasive therapies, including TAE combined with magnetothermal therapy, achieved synergistic therapeutic effects in hepatic tumor-bearing rabbits. The rough-interface strengthening strategy facilitates the development of high-performance colloidal gels with mechanical integrity and tailored functions.},

In this study, the helical Landau levels rooted in acoustic quantum spin Hall systems are theoretically proposed and experimentally validated. By linearly increasing the local bandgap through the lifting of the double Dirac cone in acoustic crystals with both square and hexagonal lattices—achieved via topology optimization method—a position-dependent effective mass is introduced in the Dirac Hamiltonian, thereby synthesizing in-plane pseudomagnetic fields. This results in the emergence of spin-locked helical Landau levels, which has been experimentally validated. The large-area conveyance of acoustic energy facilitated by these helical Landau levels is demonstrated and the robustness of Landau-level-mediated propagation against defects is confirmed.

Under mild, energy-efficient conditions (−200 mA), this approach converts cinnamaldehyde to benzaldehyde with complete conversion (100%) and >99% selectivity, outperforming traditional harsh oxidants. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the tailored coordination environment of the catalyst enhances * OOH formation, enabling targeted oxidative activity. The method operates at ambient conditions, eliminates toxic reagents and high energy-consuming process, and aligns with sustainable chemistry principles.

  abstract     = {Enriching trace biomarkers (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids) is critical for biomedical applications; yet conventional methods often lack versatility, limiting their effectiveness to specific biomarker types. To address this, the phase separation-assisted pre-enrichment (PSAP) technology is presented that exploits differential polymer-polymer partitioning to achieve 47-fold antigen and 44-fold RNA enrichment simultaneously. Through systematic optimization of interfacial chemistry, including pH modulation, polymer hydrophilicity, mass fraction, and molecular weights, the protocol is refined to enable direct integration with commercial diagnostics. PSAP-boosted rapid antigen ests (RATs) detected SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza viruses at tenfold and fivefold lower limits, respectively. In clinical validation, 53 clinical specimens (containing PCR undetectable samples as controls) are analyzed. The PSAP method significantly enhanced detection accuracy for both viral antigens and RNA, particularly improving positivity rates in low viral load specimens (27 < Ct < 31) compared to conventional approaches while maintaining specificity in high-Ct and negative controls. With its universality and tunability, PSAP demonstrates universal applicability across respiratory pathogens and lays the foundation for next-generation point-of-care diagnostics.},

  abstract     = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal malignancy of myeloid progenitor cells that demonstrates highly variable responses to current regimens, highlighting the need for precision medicine. However, reliable biomarkers for precision medicine treatment remain elusive due to cellular heterogeneity. Conventional Models based on bulk RNA sequencing and ex vivo assays often fail to capture the intricate molecular pathways and gene networks that underlie treatment response and resistance. Here, NetAML, a novel network-based precision medicine platform that systematically develops 87 drug sensitivity prediction models for 87 clinical drugs using ex vivo drug responses from 520 AML patients with RNA-Seq is presented. The approach leverages network-based analysis and machine learning to identify biologically interpretable gene signatures that capture the complex molecular interactions driving differential drug responses. Notably, the signature genes derived from the models reveal distinct cellular mechanisms. For instance, the co-expression of C19ORF59 and FLT3 is associated with resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. In summary, NetAML offers a powerful strategy for personalized AML treatment by constructing drug-specific models, identifying clinically actionable biomarkers, and supporting the development of optimized, patient-specific therapeutic regimens.},

Due to an insufficient understanding of the underlying pathomechanisms, treatment options remain limited. Although tendinopathy is recognized as a multifactorial disorder, known risk factors and predisposing conditions have largely been studied in isolation. In this review, it is aimed to examine the various pathomechanisms identified to date and synthesize them into a unified concept. Particular emphasis is placed on key drivers believed to be critical in the onset and progression of the disease—namely mechanical stress, inflammation, and vascular changes. By exploring molecular signaling pathways and conditions involved in tendinopathy, how these mechanisms interact and reinforce one another is illustrated, forming a complex and dynamic signaling network, referred to as the tendinopathic loop. In the future, this network is expected to become even more intricate with the inclusion of emerging concepts such as intratendinous pressure and the potential influence of metabolic factors.},

Here, a prototype of space-time acoustic metasurface (STAM) is proposed and implemented, consisting of a reflective piezoelectric array controlled by a field-programmable gate array. Leveraging the spatiotemporally programmable phases of the STAM, this is experimentally achieved Doppler-like chirp modulation and space-time modulation with deterministic frequency and momentum shifts of waterborne acoustic waves. Furthermore, based on this flexible and efficient modulation strategy, a stochastic space-time modulation method is introduced, showcasing its applications in single-channel direction-of-arrival estimation.

Organic electrode materials are currently the best-performing candidates, and among them, poly(1,4-anthraquinone) ( P14AQ ) shows excellent electrochemical properties. This holds in particular for magnesium-ion batteries, where the polymer displays reversible insertion of Mg 2+ ions with high cycling stability. The conventional synthesis of P14AQ , however, employs stoichiometric amounts of bis(cycloocta-1,5-diene)nickel(0) (Ni(COD) 2 ), which is an air- and light-sensitive and expensive chemical, and therefore lacks sustainability. Herein a synthetic route to P14AQ is presented that uses only catalytic amounts of dibromobis(triphenylphosphine)nickel(II) (NiBr 2 (PPh 3 ) 2 ). This route – in addition to being more cost-efficient and less toxic – results in higher yields and polymer molecular weights. A life-cycle assessment (LCA) comparing the new and conventional polymerization methods shows that regarding the environmental impact categories climate change, human toxicity, and cumulative energy demand, the new method brings significant improvement.},

When placed in water, proteinoids swell into microspheres which produce neuron-like spikes of electrical potential. This study combines proteinoid microspheres with Emiliania huxleyi algae to create advanced bioelectronic signal processing systems with neuromorphic characteristics. The morphologies of L-Glu:L-Phe proteinoid microspheres and their interactions with algae are studied using scanning electron microscopy, revealing complex structures with budding forms and traits of self-assembly. Electrical measurements demonstrate that both pure algae and algae-proteinoid mixtures generate spontaneous oscillations with unique amplitude and frequency patterns across different recording channels. The algae-proteinoid mixture exhibits a broad range of oscillatory dynamics with amplitudes varying from 25.49 to 191.42 mV and periods ranging from 251.92 to 5471.01 s. These oscillatory behaviors are utilized to perform Boolean logic operations, through post-processing of biological signals rather than autonomous computing, with pure algae systems showing superior performance for direct gates (AND, OR) while the mixture excels at inverse gates (NAND, NOR). Temperature and pH emerge as critical factors controlling oscillatory dynamics. The findings indicate that algae-proteinoid electrochemical systems represent a step toward biohybrid computing and offer a sustainable and biocompatible alternative for unconventional computing, providing enhanced signal stability, environmental resilience, and more effective information processing compared to traditional electronic systems while acknowledging current limitations in autonomous learning capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), a leading cause of chronic low back pain, arises from nucleus pulposus (NP) cell dysfunction due to oxidative stress-induced mitophagy impairment and ferroptosis, though regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. F-box only protein 2 (FBXO2), a Kruppel-like factor 10 (KLF10)-regulated F-box protein, is downregulated in degenerated human NP tissues and correlates with disease severity. Overexpression of FBXO2 restores extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis by promoting matrix component synthesis and inhibiting catabolic enzymes, while its knockdown exacerbates ECM degradation. Under oxidative stress, FBXO2 activates PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, restoring mitochondrial membrane potential and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Proteomics reveals that FBXO2 suppresses ferroptosis by attenuating lipid peroxidation, glutathione depletion, and iron overload. Mechanistically, FBXO2 binds lipocalin-2 (LCN2) via its FBA domain, promoting K27-linked polyubiquitination to drive proteasomal degradation of this ferroptosis inducer. FBXO2 co-expression reverses LCN2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis markers. In vivo, adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated overexpression of FBXO2 ameliorates IVDD in rats, whereas FBXO2 knockout (KO) mice exhibit exacerbated IVDD. LCN2 silencing in FBXO2-deficient mice partially restores disc integrity and matrix component expression. These findings identify FBXO2 as a dual regulator coordinating mitophagy activation and ferroptosis suppression, offering therapeutic potential for IVDD progression.},

  abstract     = {This reports a dual-functional approach in which Fe catalysts, initially employed for methane pyrolysis to generate COx-free hydrogen, are directly repurposed as anode materials following in situ carbon deposition. During methane splitting, catalytic decomposition of CH₄ at 900 °C forms onion-like graphitic carbon shells (≈280 layers) around Fe cores (≈50 nm), producing a structurally stable and electrically conductive Fe@C900 composite without post-treatment. This carbon-enriched catalyst demonstrates exceptional electrochemical behavior when transitioned into a battery context. Without any conductive additives, Fe@C900 delivers a reversible capacity of 380 mAh g⁻¹ with 98% retention over 1000 cycles at 1 C. Under a 5000 G magnetic field, spin alignment within the Fe cores triggers directional lithium-ion migration, enhancing rate performance by 150%. Multimodal characterization reveals accelerated lithium kinetics, stable SEI evolution, and deep lithiation behavior. DFT calculations further confirm strong lithium adsorption (−24.14 eV) and low insertion barriers (−22.85 eV), validating the spin-guided diffusion mechanism. This work introduces a new class of hydrogen-derived ferromagnetic anodes, where the byproduct of a clean hydrogen process is re-engineered into a high-rate, conductor-free lithium storage platform. By coupling hydrogen generation with energy storage through shared material intermediates, this strategy offers a scalable path to carbon-efficient, magnetically enhanced battery systems.},

Here, it is shown that the cell-cell communication, known as quorum sensing (QS), inhibits the expression and activity of the type III-A CRISPR-Cas system in S. aureus . The QS regulator, AgrA, directly binds to the promoters of two transcriptional regulators encoding the genes sarA and arcR to inhibit their expression. However, both SarA and ArcR act as positive regulators that promote the transcription of cas genes by directly binding to a novel promoter P cas . Furthermore, the P cas of 300 bp located in cas1 displays as a critical regulatory node to initiate the transcription of cas10 and csm3 .

  abstract     = {Bacterial biohybrid microrobots possess significant potential for targeted cargo delivery and minimally invasive therapy. However, many challenges, such as biocompatibility, stability, and effective cargo loading, remain. Bacterial membrane vesicles, also referred to as minicells, offer a promising alternative for creating sub-micron scale biohybrid swimmers (minicell biohybrids) due to their active metabolism, non-dividing nature, robust structure, and high cargo-carrying capacity. Here, a biohybrid system is reported that utilizes motile minicells, ≈400 nm in diameter, generated by aberrant cell division of engineered Escherichia coli ( E. coli ), for the first time. Achieving over 99% purification from their parental bacterial cells, minicells are functionalized with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to enable external magnetic control. Minicell biohybrids are capable of swimming at an average speed of up to 13.3 µm s −1 and being steered under a uniform magnetic field of 26 mT. Furthermore, they exhibit a significantly high drug loading capacity (2.8 µg mL −1 ) while maintaining their motility and show pH-sensitive release of anticancer drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) under acidic conditions. Additionally, drug-loaded minicell biohybrids notably reduce the viability of SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells in vitro. This study introduces minicell biohybrids and establishes their potential as magnetically guided, drug-loaded biohybrid systems for targeted therapies in future medical applications.},

  abstract     = {The lifespan of the transient electronic system can be determined in advance (i.e., predefined) or controlled via on-demand and programmable approaches using a diverse range of principles. However, in most cases, dissolution or disappearance requires an aqueous solution and is only possible for the entire system, not for specific or targeted components. Here, a soft, stretchable, thermally expandable system is introduced for precise, localized, on-demand deactivation or destruction of electronic systems. The incorporation of thermal expansion particles into a polymer matrix produces soft, resilient composites that generate substantial thermo-mechanical forces at a predefined temperature, enabling the direct collapse of electronic devices. Integration with multichannel microfluidics and wireless systems creates a vanishing, self-destructive optoelectronic system and bio-safe drug delivery vehicle for frequency-based selective release, demonstrating the broad potential of this approach in the fields of defense/security and biomedical devices as well as other envisioned areas.},

  abstract     = {High-quality capture of diverse motion signals in flexible sensors requires soft sensing materials to perform signal conversion and transmission stably and without delay over extended periods. However, low hysteresis achieved through purely elastic mechanisms easily exhibits poor crack propagation resistance. By leveraging the significant gap between the strain rate during large-strain service conditions and the crack propagation rate in the fracture process, this study presents a facile strategy for constructing a highly competitive dynamic hydrogen bonding system to produce near-zero-hysteresis and highly crack-resistant D-gels. Through tuning the relaxation dynamics of strong hydrogen bonding interactions with polymer segments by insert deep eutectic solvent (DES) components, the highly dynamic hydrogen bonds are rendered mechanically “invisible” during service condition—an essential factor in achieving a low-hysteresis attribute (low hysteresis: <3%). Meanwhile, the relaxation time of those dynamic bonds is comparable to the inverse of crack propagation rate, effectively alleviating stress concentration at the crack tips, thereby enhancing the ultimate fracture strain (1500%) and crack propagation strain (550%) of the gels. This approach provides a general strategy for synthesizing gels that overcome the traditional trade-off between high crack propagation resistance and high elasticity.},

  abstract     = {Vertebrates have undergone two rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD), termed 1R and 2R, with a third, teleost-specific duplication (TSGD or 3R) occurring in ray-finned fishes. In the order Cypriniformes, additional lineage-specific WGDs have further contributed to species diversification. While polyploidy is well characterized in species like common carp and goldfish, other polyploid taxa—particularly loaches—remain understudied. Here, high-quality, chromosome-level genome assemblies are presented for two loach species: Sinibotia superciliaris (Golden Chinese Loach) and Parabotia fasciatus (Yichang Sand Loach). By integrating these genomes into a comparative framework with 20 other cypriniform species, key phylogenetic relationships are reconstructed, and introduce a novel subgenome partitioning method (M3). Unlike previous approaches, M3 uses differential sequence divergence to accurately and rapidly assign subgenomes, completing partitioning within minutes and outperforming existing tools. Applying M3, a markedly reduced subgenome is uncovered in the Golden Chinese Loach, with lineage-specific molecular changes in several candidate genes, suggesting potential adaptive significance. This study offers a comprehensive view of polyploidy and subgenome evolution in loaches, highlighting the genomic complexity shaped by repeated WGDs in Cypriniformes and providing valuable resources for future research on vertebrate genome evolution and adaptation.},

  abstract     = {Flexible microelectrodes are ideal for chronic neural recordings; however, their low bending strength poses challenges during probe insertion. Here, a stiffness-tunable polyimide probe, termed Neurotentacle, is proposed for deep brain implantation. Its tunability is enabled by embedded microchannels with controllable liquid pressure. During insertion, the Neurotentacle becomes stiff under elevated internal pressure, allowing penetration of brain tissue without additional materials or tools. Once inserted, it regains flexibility by reducing the internal pressure. The novel ultra-thin microchannel fabrication technique enables the Neurotentacle to maintain dimensions similar to conventional flexible probes. This minimizes tissue damage during insertion while ensuring long-term biocompatibility and stability, confirmed by histological evaluations in both acute and chronic animal models. In long-term recordings, Neurotentacles outperform traditional shuttle-assisted implantation methods. The technique is straightforward, controllable, and does not require complex devices, making it ideal for minimally invasive implantation and long-term neural recordings.},

A mixed electrolyte composed of LiFSI (LiN(SO 2 F) 2 ) as the main salt, DEE (1,2-diethoxyethane) as the solvent, and LiNFS (LiC 4 F 9 SO 3 ) as an additive achieves a significantly improved CE of 98.32%. Key molecular descriptors are identified for each performance label, and the most accurate model is selected through rigorous benchmarking. The optimal region reveals a preference for medium-to-high salt concentrations; low C, O, and N content; and high F content in salts, along with high C and low O content in solvents.

However, current treatments for cartilage degeneration often lead to the formation of hypertrophic cartilage and fibrocartilage, making it challenging to achieve full-thickness cartilage. Here, dual-modular hydrogel microparticles (dmHMPs) are developed, which enable precise spatio-temporal modulation and dynamic equilibrium between immune responses and cartilage regeneration. dmHMPs can modulate the inflammatory microenvironment of the joint by promoting the polarization of synovial macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Consequently, as inflammation is mitigated, synovium-derived mesenchymal stem cells recruited by dmHMPs can efficiently undergo chondrogenic differentiation to repair damaged cartilage in situ. In vivo experiments demonstrate that dmHMPs significantly suppress the expression of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and collagen type X, thereby reducing the formation of hypertrophic cartilage and preserving the structural integrity and biological functions of articular cartilage. This therapeutic modulates the dynamic balance between inflammation and repair, providing a promising approach for full-thickness cartilage regeneration.},

  abstract     = {The gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a promising therapeutic target in cancer treatment. However, the specific mechanisms by which gut bacteria and their metabolites exert therapeutic effects in melanoma remain poorly understood. In this study, it is unexpectedly demonstrated that prophylactic supplementation with Limosilactobacillus reuteri exhibits significant tumor-suppressive properties, primarily mediated by its secreted metabolite, reuterin. This metabolite induces trained immunity through macrophage metabolic reprogramming, thereby enhancing antitumor immune responses. Mechanistically, this process involves stabilizing HIF-1α via the AHR-ROS signaling pathway, enhancing glycerophospholipid metabolism, and elevating arachidonic acid levels, thereby amplifying the trained immunity response. Similar to reuterin, arachidonic acid also induces trained immunity and facilitates macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing. To enhance its therapeutic efficacy, reuterin is encapsulated in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). COF-Reuterin demonstrates superior effects in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), remodulating intratumor bacteria and directly facilitating tumor cell killing. Notably, COF-Reuterin demonstrates superior therapeutic efficacy compared to cisplatin. Furthermore, COF-Reuterin reprogrammed TAMs from an M2 to an M1 phenotype, increasing CD8 + T cell infiltration and decreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), reshaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These findings highlight the potential of probiotics and their metabolites in the metabolic reprogramming of TAMs, offering a promising cancer therapeutic approach.},

Ar, N 2 and CO 2 interact with an all-solid composite material composed of activated porous carbon and silica characterized by a high amount of charged interfaces under isothermal conditions and ambient temperature. The intimate contact of both components in the composite allows for the formation of multiple resistor-conductor interfaces enabling the reversible physisorption of these gases using electric fields in the lower V and mA range.

Although substantial progress has been made in elucidating general patterns associated with DSBs, the influence of 3D chromatin structure on DSB formation remains underexplored, particularly concerning its spatial configuration. Here, the ChromInSight framework is introduced. Using standardized datasets,Hi-DSB is developed and deployed in ChromInSight, a genome-wide DSB prediction model based on graph contrastive learning (GCL), and applied advanced interpretability techniques to identify DSB-associated genomic patterns. The findings reveal that the spatial cluster-scene between hub nodes and DSB sites is predominantly shaped by the 3D conformation of chromatin, rather than by linear genomic distance. This phenomenon is validated at both the Loop and topologically associating domain (TAD) levels and proposed a “spatial isolation – damage containment” hypothesis, which illustrates the genome strategy for managing damage. These findings support the role of 3D genome architecture in genomic instability. Consequently, the framework provides a powerful tool for investigating the intricate relationship between chromatin structure and genomic stability.},

  abstract     = {Garnet-type Li 6.5 La 3 Zr 1.5 Ta 0.5 O 12 (LLZO) has emerged as a highly promising solid electrolyte for next-generation Li metal batteries due to its high Li + conductivity and stability against metallic lithium. However, its practical application is hindered by poor interfacial contact between Li and LLZO, as well as the persistent issue of lithium dendrite formation during cycling. In this study, a novel and efficient strategy is proposed to address these challenges by employing a room-temperature ultrasonic treatment combined with a LiMg alloy anode. The fabricated symmetrical UW-LiMg/LLZO/UW-LiMg cell exhibits a low interfacial resistance and achieves an unprecedented critical current density of 4.45 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, these cells demonstrate excellent cycling stability, maintaining stable lithium plating/stripping for over 1000 h at a high current density of 1 mA cm − 2 with a low overpotential of ≈30 mV. The superior performance is attributed to the enhanced anode ductility achieved through Mg alloying and the formation of an ultra-stable interface layer. The all-solid-state UW-LiMg/LLZO/LiFePO 4 battery, incorporating an ultrasonically treated alloy anode and a fluorinated cathode interface, delivers a specific capacity of 153 mAh g −1 at 0.5 C and retains an impressive capacity retention of 90% after 200 cycles at room temperature.},

  abstract     = {Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is a leading cause of discogenic lower back pain, yet the crosstalk between macrophage polarization and nucleus pulposus (NP) cell senescence in IDD progression remains poorly understood. Emerging therapies using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs) show promise for IDD treatment. In this study, it is first demonstrated that senescent NP cells promote macrophage polarization toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype in coculture systems. Reciprocally, conditioned medium from M1 macrophages exposed to senescent NP cells accelerates senescence in healthy NP cells. Notably, it is identified that iMSCs-derived exosomes break this pathogenic cycle by reprogramming M1 macrophages toward anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. Mechanistically, these exosomes deliver miR-100-5p to suppress mTORC1 signaling and regulate glycolysis metabolic reprogramming in macrophages. These findings are corroborated in a rat IDD model, where iMSC-exosomes mitigate IDD progression in vivo. This work elucidates a novel iMSC-exosomes mediated mechanism regulating macrophage-NP cell interactions, which provides a promising therapeutic strategy for IDD intervention.},

  abstract     = {The cGAS-STING signaling pathway has emerged as a promising target for cancer immunotherapy. However, STING agonists have a dual-edged nature. Although they enhance antitumor T cell activity, STING agonists also elicit protumorigenic effects by promoting IL-35-producing B regulatory (Breg) cells, suppressing natural killer (NK) cell density, and fostering immune suppression. To address these challenges, this work develops a tumor microenvironment-responsive hollow mesoporous nanosystem that degrades under high glutathione conditions, thereby releasing the STING agonist MSA-2 and Mn ions. This nanosystem facilitates magnetic resonance imaging-guided chemodynamic therapy and radiosensitization, efficiently activating the cGAS-STING pathway by disrupting mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Notably, by integrating this nanosystem with an anti-IL-35 blockade, this work successfully mitigates the Breg cell-mediated suppression of NK cells, restores innate immune responses, and enhances antitumor efficacy. This study highlights the pivotal role of anti-IL-35 in reversing immunosuppression, enhancing innate immunity, and establishing a synergistic theranostic platform for molecular imaging-guided cancer radioimmunotherapy.},

Topics address gut physiology (gut digestion and absorption, epithelial nutrient sensing, gut motility), intestinal immunity (covering innate, adaptive, and antiviral responses), and extracellular to intracellular processes (i.e. mitochondrial function, stem cell fate, and intestinal circadian rhythm). Special focus is given to the gut microbiome, including both bacterial and fungal communities and how the KD modulates them in conditions such as epilepsy, obesity, traumatic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis. Innovative methods for tailoring the KD, including the use of alternative formulations, ketone esters, and microbiome-focused interventions such as prebiotics and probiotics are examined. Strategies to maximize the diet's benefits while reducing potential side effects are considered. Together, these insights herein offer a comprehensive framework for understanding the interactions between the KD and the gut, a prerequisite for optimizing the overall health benefits of metabolism-based treatments.},

  abstract     = {Aberrant alternative splicing plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis. Here, splicing factor 3A subunit 3 (SF3A3) is   significantly upregulated in endometrial cancer (EC) tissues and associated with poor prognosis. Functionally, SF3A3 drives tumor progression by promoting cell proliferation, suppressing apoptosis, and enhancing cisplatin resistance in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SF3A3 regulates alternative splicing of fos proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (c-FOS), an oncogene linked to chemoresistance, resulting in a ≈2-fold increase in full-length c-FOS expression and activation of downstream anti-apoptotic pathways. Notably, phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) as a direct inhibitor of SF3A3 through database screening and biophysical validation via surface plasmon resonance and mass spectrometry is identified. PEITC reduces c-FOS expression and induces apoptosis in EC cells. Moreover, encapsulating PEITC in a hydrogel delivery system significantly enhances its therapeutic efficacy by enabling controlled release, reducing dosing frequency, and improving clinical applicability. The therapeutic potential of SF3A3 inhibition is further validated using patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters (PTCs), where PEITC and the c-FOS inhibitor T-5224 exhibit synergistic effects in suppressing EC. Collectively, our findings establish SF3A3 as a novel oncogenic regulator in EC and highlight PEITC, particularly in its hydrogel formulation, as a promising therapeutic strategy for improving clinical outcomes in EC patients.},

It is further developed immuno-lung organoids comprising hPSC-derived alveolar and airway organoids co-cultured with macrophages to investigate the impact and underlying mechanisms of macrophage-mediated lung damage following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings demonstrate that proinflammatory macrophages induce lung cell senescence through the THBS1–(ITGA3+ITGB1) signaling axis, a mechanism further validated using spatial transcriptomics. This study not only establishes physiologically relevant immuno-lung organoid models for modeling macrophage-mediated tissue damage, but also identifies a previous unrecognized role of the THBS1-(ITGA3+ITGB1) pathway in driving lung cell senescence during infectious disease.},

Neutrophil aggregation and clearance within the brain parenchyma influence neuroinflammatory damage during ischemic stroke. Microglia-mediated phagocytosis plays a pivotal role in mitigating neuroinflammation and promoting brain parenchyma recovery. However, the mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between neutrophils and microglia remain poorly understood. Here, this study demonstrates that neutrophils can trigger microglial functional change to inhibit microglial phagocytosis and promote pyroptosis, which is regulated by neutrophil-derived myeloid-related protein 14. Additionally, interleukin-1 β released by pyroptotic microglia further upregulates myeloid-related protein 14 expression and facilitates neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow, establishing a self-sustaining inflammatory loop. Therefore, neutrophils accumulate in the brain parenchyma and further exacerbate microglial neuroinflammation in the ischemic brain. These findings reveal a previously unknown interaction between neutrophils and microglia after acute ischemic stroke and suggest that targeting myeloid-related protein 14 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke therapy.},

  abstract     = {Despite advances in understanding the STING signaling pathway, mechanisms governing cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)-induced STING trafficking out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remain unclear. This study reveals that STING localization is regulated by the balance between coat protein II (COPII)- and coat protein I (COPI)-mediated trafficking, maintaining ER residency in the inactive state or promoting transport to the cis -Golgi via enhanced COPII-mediated export upon activation. Two novel TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-regulated phosphorylated COPII sorting signals on STING—a conserved pSGME motif and a primate-specific pFS motif—are biochemically and structurally identified. These cGAMP-induced signals drive activated STING toward the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the cis -Golgi complex. Using a cell-free COPII vesicle reconstitution system, TBK1 activation is shown to occur on COPII vesicles, while IRF3 phosphorylation is confined to the ERGIC or the cis -Golgi complex post-uncoating, due to the competitive binding of COPII Sec24 and IRF3 to phosphorylated STING. A class of compounds is also identified that attenuates IRF3 phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphorylated STING packaging into COPII vesicles. These findings elucidate STING trafficking mechanisms and offer therapeutic potential for diseases linked to dysregulated STING activation.},

It has been established that myelin debris and foam cells are negative on SCI recovery through direct and indirect neurotoxicity. Different from previous studies, the present research utilized efficient biological composite materials to adsorb myelin debris, exploring new avenues for solving foam cells and myelin debris following SCI. To achieve the strategy, the present author team has developed the biomaterial composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber and pretreated macrophage membranes. Results in vitro and in vivo showed that the composite biomaterial effectively adsorbed myelin debris, with a result of few remaining foam cells, mitigated inflammation, minimal scarring, and favorable motor function recovery. Moreover, lipidomics and proteomics, from a metabolic perspective, further demonstrated the regulatory role of the composite biomaterial in myelin debris. Taken together, the composite biomaterial can effectively promote SCI recovery, which provides a novel insight for the treatment of SCI.},

  abstract     = {Bone injury repair remains a significant clinical challenge due to the tissue's limited self-healing capacity and the complex physiological environment at the defect site. Factors such as insufficient vascularization, poor retention of therapeutic agents, and the lack of effective mechanical stimulation further hinder the success of current minimally invasive treatments, which often rely on the delivery of drugs or stem cells. Here, magnetic gelatin/hyaluronic acid composite hydrogels micromotors are developed, capable of promoting bone regeneration through localized micromovement stimulation, eliminating the need for therapeutic payloads. By harnessing the mechanical forces generated by the micromotors under an oscillating magnetic field, the approach directly enhances osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, providing a novel mechanism for bone repair. The efficacy of this strategy is further validated in vivo using animal models of bone defects, where moderate micromovement stimulation is shown to significantly increase the volume fraction of newly formed bone by approximately twofold, accompanied by well-aligned collagen and organized mineralization, thereby demonstrating substantial regenerative effects. This work presents a paradigm shift in bone repair with a payload-free, minimally invasive solution that overcomes conventional limitations and offers new insights into microrobotics in regenerative medicine.},

However, it remains predominantly a research tool due to the challenge to simultaneously achieve mass production, ultrasensitive and rapid detection, high-reproducibility, and ease of integration, which are extremely desired in point-of-care testing (POCT)-based commercial products. Here, a label-free, ultrasensitive, and rapid assay protocol is described for quantitative protein detections in serum samples, which integrates an ultrasmooth gold nanogroove arrays (UGNA) biosensor with an initial rate analysis (IRA) method. i) Compared with the existing plasmonic biosensors, miscellaneous-protein-mixed scheme substantially accelerates the binding kinetics of analytes by passivation of all channel inner surfaces. Combined with the IRA method, a wide linear range of AFP detection (1–10 4 ng mL −1 ) is obtained, and an enhancement factor of ≈160-fold in detection time (≈70 s) is achieved for an analyte with ultralow concentration. ii) UGNA can achieve an extremely high surface figure of merit (FOM surf ) under normal incidence, which is immensely useful for miniaturization and multiplexing. iii) UGNA are fabricated using a high-reproducibility template-stripping technique, which potentially enables low-cost mass production. These unique advantages suggest that the biosensor system and analysis method have tremendous potential in POCT biosensing devices.},

Due to limited knowledge of cortical sensorimotor coordination, artificial feedback is mostly counterintuitive, requiring training to be associated with grasping behaviors. The current study investigates sensorimotor communication by recording neural activities from the primary sensory cortex (S1) and the primary motor cortex (M1) while macaques grasp targets of various textures and loads. Intracortical micro-stimulation is also delivered to S1 to validate the intervention of sensorimotor communication in grasping. The findings identify an S1→M1 functional pathway through which tactile information is transferred. The pathway is shared by both natural and artificial neural propagations. Moreover, it is demonstrated that sensory and motor decoding of neural activities in M1, as well as the actual grip force, are modulated by stimulation designed via S1→M1 communication, without prior training. The work provides a biomimetic strategy to design intuitive haptic feedback for brain-machine interfaces utilizing the S1→M1 pathway.},

  abstract     = {Many plant-derived bioactive molecules with low solubility and permeability can cause hepatocyte injury. However, the mechanism by which they induce hepatic damage without passive diffusion into the hepatic circulatory system remains unclear. This study demonstrate that indirubin, the main component of indigo naturalis with poor aqueous solubility, predisposes mice with chronic colitis to hepatic injury. This closely mimics the hepatic damage commonly observed in ulcerative colitis patients treated with indigo naturalis. Upon administration, indirubin is detected in the plasma, Peyer's patches, and hepatic tissue, with its distribution linked to macrophage infiltration into the liver. Ablation of macrophages significantly reduces indirubin accumulation and attenuates elevated hepatic transaminases in mice with chronic colitis. Mechanistically, macrophages internalize and transport indirubin aggregates from Peyer's patches through the circulatory system to the livers. This internalization activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the formation of macrophage extracellular traps (METs), which contribute to oxidative stress-induced liver injury. The study identifies indirubin as a potentially toxic component of indigo naturalis that provokes METs-mediated oxidative damage. Additionally, the findings reveal a novel transport pathway for poorly soluble molecules to reach the liver via uptake by macrophages within Peyer's patches.},

Overexpression of TaPPR13 enhanced the antioxidative defense system, whereas knockdown of TaPPR13 led to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caused abnormalities in chloroplast thylakoids under drought stress conditions. RNA-seq analysis showed that overexpression of TaPPR13 significantly upregulated the expression of nuclear-encoded genes involved in ROS scavenging and the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway. Furthermore, TaPPR13 interacted with TaAOR1 and TaSIG5 to facilitate detoxification and regulate chloroplast gene expression, thereby enhancing drought tolerance. Overexpression of TaPPR13 and TaAOR1 mediated stomatal closure to reduce water loss, improving photosynthetic capacity and conferring a yield advantage under drought stress. These findings show that TaPPR13 promotes retrograde signaling to alter nuclear gene expression, with the TaBZR2-TaPPR13-TaAOR1/TaSIG5 module representing a novel signaling pathway that likely plays a pivotal role in drought stress response.},

  abstract     = {The color patterns of mammalian fur are determined by melanocytes' ability to respond to and adapt to microenvironmental cues. However, these patterns can be lost following injury or under pathological conditions, and the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, reconstituted hair-bearing skin is generated using skin organoids derived from dissociated epidermal cells, dermal cells, and melanocyte progenitors. The reconstituted skin exhibited pigmented hair patterns. By investigating the molecular cues involved in re-establishing pigment patterns, it is demonstrated that this process is regulated through a two-step mechanism. First, during skin organoid culture, signaling from dermal fibroblasts to melanocytes via the COL6A3-CD44 pathway promotes the early maintenance of organotypic melanocytes. Subsequently, during hair follicle morphogenesis after skin organoid transplantation, signaling from the bulge to melanocytes via the SEMA3C-NRP1 pathway regulates microtubule stability. This regulation guides melanocytes to migrate to their bulge stem cell niche, thereby enhancing hair pigmentation by promoting the adaptive patterning of melanocytes within the hair follicle. The study reveals two novel signaling mechanisms that shape melanocyte adaptive patterning and highlight the hair follicle as a regulatory hub for melanocyte physiological behaviors. These findings may inspire new clinical strategies for preventing hair greying.},

RNA sequencing of HS-fed rat hippocampi showed downregulation of cAMP signaling and SHANK1 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of PKA/CREB reduced SHANK1 levels and impaired dendritic structure and synaptic function, while PKA activation restored CREB activity and SHANK1 expression, reversing HS-induced deficits. Notably, CREB activation is essential for SHANK1 regulation, as a CREB mutant (S133A) blocked the effects of PKA activation, and a constitutively active CREB (S133D) prevented SHANK1 downregulation. These findings highlight the PKA/CREB/SHANK1 pathway as a potential therapeutic target for HS-induced cognitive dysfunction.},

  abstract     = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a complex inflammatory bowel disease characterized by multiple factors. Alleviating inflammation is the primary therapeutic approach. However, currently employed anti-inflammatory treatments have limited efficacy and cause side effects. Safer, more effective therapies are needed. Selenium nanosheets (SeNSs) are biocompatible, anti-inflammatory, and low-toxicity nanomaterials with high surface areas and abundant active sites, making them potential therapeutic agents for UC. This study indicates that SeNSs can interact with macrophages and adhere to their cell membranes, significantly increasing their internalization into cells. Proteomic analysis reveals that the main components of the SeNS protein corona are proteins involved in cell proliferation and migration, including those associated with the AKT/PI3K and NF-κB signaling pathways. SeNSs hydrophobically interact with GP130, inhibiting its expression. This interaction downregulates the proteins involved in the aforementioned pathways. In addition, a transcriptomic analysis confirms that SeNSs inhibit apoptosis, cytokine–cytokine receptor interactions, and the chemokine and TNF signaling pathways. In dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC model mice, SeNSs significantly decrease IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, alleviate tissue damage, and lower the disease activity index. These findings suggest that SeNSs can be a safe and effective treatment strategy for UC, offering a novel approach for managing inflammatory diseases.},

Keratinocytes, the primary cells in epidermis, play a pivotal role in orchestrating the UV-induced immunosuppressive response by releasing platelet-activating factor (PAF) upon UV exposure. Adopting a paradigm shift that transforms a known health hazard as a potential therapeutic asset, a novel therapeutic strategy is set out to investigate for inflammatory conditions by leveraging immunosuppressive properties of UV-irradiated keratinocytes. To safely exploit this mechanism, extracellular vesicles are isolated from UV-irradiated keratinocytes, designate UV KEV, and assess their potential as immunomodulatory agents in the mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis. Subcutaneous administration of UV KEV efficiently stimulates the secretion of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) by keratinocytes and promotes the migration of mast cells to lymph nodes through the PAF/PAF receptor pathway. The as-prepared UV KEV effectively reshapes the immune landscape within the spleen by inhibiting dendritic cell maturation and increasing the population of regulatory T cells. Animal studies confirm that UV KEV can result in robust systemic immune tolerance and significantly alleviate the symptoms of both IBD and psoriasis.

Conditional knockout of Mettl3 in macrophages alleviated psoriasis-like symptoms in mice, whereas knockout of Alkbh5 exacerbated them.

The regulation of macrophage polarization by m 6 A is likely mediated by targeting Slc15a3 .

  abstract     = {Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC), as an emerging approach for target protein degradation based on the intracellular ubiquitin-protease system, is characterized by catalytic and reusability over traditional inhibitors. However, PROTACs are fraught with pharmacokinetic dangers due to poor water solubility and membrane permeability, further posing a huge challenge to the clinical potential. Herein, a nanodelivery system is developed that is elaborately decorated with prodrugs to improve the physicochemical properties and therapeutic efficacy of PROTAC. The nanodelivery, lipid nanodisk (LND), is readily assembled from three commercially available phospholipids, and shows high stability and long circulation time in vivo. The lipid-derived prodrug realizes prolonged retention and precise release of PROTACs at tumor sites under the endogenous stimulus. Collectively, the LND loaded with MZ1 prodrug (LND-MZ1) presents enhanced biocompatibility, improves intracellular accumulation, and superior tumor penetration capacity, enabling more potent and targeted PROTAC therapy with enhanced specificity in vivo. LND-MZ1 shows a more significant anti-tumor effect in the xenograft tumor model, even at a one-tenth dose of the parent PROTACs under the same therapeutic schedule. Overall, the LND-based nanomedicine paves the way for remodeling the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of various drugs to expand the therapeutic scope.},

  abstract     = {Conventional thrombolytic agents demonstrated limited efficacy in treating thrombotic disorders characterized by narrow therapeutic windows and progressive vascular injury, lacking the required precision, timeliness, and treatment durability. Here an engineered probiotic powered micro-rod robot for targeted and penetrative treatment for thrombus is developed. This micro-rod robot ( Sr EcN PL ) using natural probiotics as bio-carriers, functionalized with thrombolytic carbon nanotubes and platelet membrane-coated nanoparticles loaded with targeted vasodilators. The robot exploits the rapid movement of probiotics, combined with the active targeting ability of the platelet membrane, to achieve rapid and precise drug delivery to thrombus tissue. Based on the natural rod-shaped structure of probiotics, Sr EcN PL can deeply penetrate thrombus tissue, achieving faster thrombolysis efficiency. The thrombolytic micro-robot combines thrombus-targeting capability with prolonged circulation time and controlled vasodilation, maintaining vascular patency and inhibiting secondary thrombus. Results indicate that this micro-robot can quickly and accurately target and penetrate thrombus tissue, extending the biological half-life of thrombolytic drugs by ≈332 times and enabling sustained thrombolysis. This novel dual-pronged combined thrombolytic therapy has significant scientific implications for treating thrombotic diseases with narrow therapeutic windows caused by vascular injury.},

  abstract     = {The regulatory mechanisms governing cell fate determination, particularly lineage diversification during mammalian embryonic development, remain poorly understood with in-depth regulatory paradigms yet to be fully elucidated. Here, leveraging the epigenetic landscape of mouse gastrula, p-Enh is identified, an enhancer located within the first intron of Cdx2 and epigenetically pre-marked in the primitive streak region, as a pivotal regulator for posterior tissue development in mouse embryos. Morphological and single-cell transcriptomic analyses confirmed embryonic lethality phenotype with disrupted posterior tissue development trajectories in p-Enh-KO embryos. Molecularly, apart from regulating the neighboring coding-gene Cdx2 in cis , the findings suggest that p-Enh also modulates the global transcriptome and epigenomic landscape, which might through the transient production of eRNA in trans . Further investigation revealed p-Enh-derived eRNAs participate in the regulatory cascades of TGF-β signaling by directly interacting with SMAD4 protein. Combinatorial modulation of TGF-β signaling and p-Enh-eRNA abundance can largely rescue the posterior development deficiency in in vitro gastruloids through a Cdx2 -independent mechanism. Thus, a potential model is proposed in which the broadly distributed p-Enh transcripts within the nucleus can serve as essential cross-modular coordinators, priming the posterior development of mouse embryo.},

  abstract     = {Tumor-intrinsic programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) has been shown to activate the mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET) pathway via its phosphorylation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the immunoregulatory consequences of MET activation remain poorly understood. Herein, a significant positive correlation between phosphorylated MET (p-MET) and tumor-intrinsic PD-1 is verified, both of which are independently associated with adverse prognosis. Elevated p-MET levels correlated with diminished CD8 + T cell cytotoxicity and increased regulatory T cell (Treg) infiltration. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed MET activation selectively drives the accumulation of intratumoral GITR⁺ Tregs—a distinct effector Treg subset with potent immunosuppressive function and high prognostic relevance. Compared to KLF2⁺ naïve Tregs, GITR⁺ Tregs exhibited an activated phenotype and enhanced expression of immunoregulatory markers. Subgroup analysis further demonstrated that elevated GITR⁺ Treg infiltration diminished the prognostic utility of serum CA19-9, underscoring the immunosuppressive dominance of this Treg subset. Mechanistically, MET–IL-23–STAT4 axis orchestrates GITR⁺ Treg-mediated immune evasion in PDAC. In vivo, MET inhibition and GITR agonism synergize to enhance antitumor immunity in an orthotopic PDAC model. Collectively, these findings highlight MET signaling and GITR⁺ Tregs as actionable targets to counteract immune evasion and improve the efficacy of immunotherapeutic strategies in PDAC.},

  abstract     = {NSP7 (Non-Structural Protein 7) of SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial component for viral replication and transcription. In this study, it is revealed that the host E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXO5 suppresses viral replication by mediating NSP7 lysine-48-linked ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, it is also determined that NSP7 expression impairs the host antiviral response by inhibiting the ISGylation of melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), a key sensor for viral RNA. Through an unbiased esiRNA screen, it is identified that NSP7 ubiquitination is coregulated by β-TrCP1 and the kinase TAF1. Additionally, this study uncovers a small molecule FBXO5 stabilizer that disrupts the β-TrCP1–FBXO5 interaction, thereby markedly enhancing NSP7 degradation and effectively mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, the findings reveal a novel mechanism for NSP7 regulation and suggest that small-molecule activators of the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXO5 represent a promising new class of host-directed antiviral therapies.},

  abstract     = {FOXP1 syndrome caused by FOXP1 haploinsufficiency is characterized by intellectual disability, speech, and language impairment, autistic features, and neuropsychiatric abnormalities such as anxiety and hyperactivity. Behavioral changes in patients are mirrored in Foxp1 ± mice. It is shown that decreased Foxp1 in the Foxp1 ± striatum results in a significant decrease in phosphodiesterase 10a (Pde10a). Predominantly expressed in medium spiny neurons (MSNs), Pde10a modulates basal ganglia circuitry. Furthermore, the Foxp1 ± striatum exhibits microglial activation, reduced synaptic pruning, and dysregulation of 111 inflammatory genes. These include the downregulated P2ry12 and Fcrls , markers of homeostatic microglia, and upregulated Cd74 , a marker of reactive microglia, suggesting that neuroinflammation contributes to the observed deficits. Interestingly, treatment of Foxp1 ± mice with the PDE10A antagonist MP-10 (PF-2545920) immediately after birth not only corrects behavioral abnormalities, including decreased ultrasonic vocalization, hyperactivity, and anxiety but also normalizes changes in microglia morphology and synaptic pruning. Transcriptomic analysis with a neuroinflammation-specific gene panel reveals nominal gene expression changes after MP-10 treatment, including Bdnf upregulation and enrichment of neurotrophin signaling. Since FOXP1 and its signaling pathway are highly conserved, administration of MP-10 or other Pde10a antagonists may also alleviate the neurological dysfunction seen in humans with FOXP1 syndrome.},

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have functions of repairing skin wounds, while antimicrobial peptides/proteins (AMPs) can prevent the infections of skin. Therefore, if FGFs can act like AMPs, they will have better application potential in promoting skin wound healing. Here, it is found that grass carp fibroblast growth factor 8a (gcFGF8a) has broad-spectrum and potent antibacterial activity through disrupting the cell membrane, indicating that FGF8 is an uncovered AMP. Further study revealed that gcFGF8a can accelerate skin wound healing through dual functions: inhibiting bacterial and activating of glycolysis. Mechanistically, gcFGF8a/FGFR4 signaling induces epithelial cell glycolytic programs for barrier remodeling through the mTORC1/HIF1α pathway. Interestingly, it is found that mouse FGF8b (mFGF8b), the homolog of gcFGF8a, also has antibacterial and skin wound repair activities, indicating that FGF8 is a functionally conserved molecule in vertebrates. To the knowledge, FGF8 is the only member of the FGF family with both antibacterial and wound repair functions at present, greatly enriching the understanding of this pivotal molecule. Furthermore, these findings highlighted the potential application of FGF8 as a skin wound repair drug.},

  abstract     = {Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) is one of the most complex temporomandibular disorders. Cartilage matrix degradation results in the infiltration of nerves, blood vessels, and inflammatory cells, which disrupts chondrocyte function. Therapeutic strategies for TMJOA designed to maintain cartilage homeostasis remain largely unknown. Here, it is reported that orosomucoid 1 (ORM1) attenuated TMJOA progression by maintaining cartilage homeostasis. It is demonstrated that ORM1 is down-regulated in the synovial fluid of patients with TMJOA and condylar cartilage of unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) rats. Administration of ORM1 protein significantly inhibited cartilage matrix degradation and alleviated TMJOA progression in UAC rats. At the mechanistic level, ORM1 binds to vimentin (VIM), a type III intermediate filament cytoskeletal protein, and inhibits the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, thereby significantly decreasing cartilage matrix degradation mediated through inhibiting the cartilage degradation markers matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) and MMP3, and maintaining cartilage homeostasis. Notably, inhibition of VIM in vivo also markedly improved TMJOA progression, including cartilage degradation and subchondral bone destruction. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate the important functions of ORM1 in maintaining cartilage homeostasis via suppressing VIM/MAPK/MMP signaling and suggest that ORM1 is a promising target for therapeutic intervention in TMJOA.},

  abstract     = {Ferroptosis is a specific type of lipid peroxide-mediated cell death which is crucial in tumor suppression. While the mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2) is implicated in lipid homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism, its role in ferroptosis and colorectal cancer (CRC) remains uncharacterized. Here, MTCH2 is identified as a crucial regulator of ferroptosis in CRC progression. Clinically, high expression of MTCH2 in CRC tissues predicts poor prognosis. Functionally, loss of MTCH2 inhibits azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colorectal tumorigenesis in MTCH2 cKO mice and leads to accumulation of ferrous ion and enhances ferroptosis of CRC in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MTCH2 deficiency promotes the proteasome-dependent ubiquitination of E2F4 and attenuates transcriptional inhibition of transferrin receptor (TFRC) by E2F4, ultimately facilitating TFRC-mediated ferroptosis in CRC cells. Moreover, MTCH2 depletion combined with sorafenib treatment synergistically triggers ferroptosis, suppresses liver metastasis, and effectively eradicates tumors in liver metastasis foci. Taken together, This study reveals the mechanism of MTCH2 deficiency-induced ferroptosis to inhibit the progression of CRC and supports a potential therapeutic strategy targeting the MTCH2/E2F4/TFRC signaling axis in CRC patients with liver metastasis.},
