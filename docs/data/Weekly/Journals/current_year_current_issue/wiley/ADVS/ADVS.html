  abstract     = {The elongation period of cotton fiber development is crucial for ensuring cotton quality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying fiber elongation remain unclear. This study reveals that SER02 _ A11 , which is preferentially expressed during the fiber elongation period, encodes serine protease inhibitors (serpins). A previously uncharacterized SNP 517th is localized in the gene's coding region between Gossypium barbadense and G. hirsutum , leading to the premature translation termination and low expression of GhSER02 in G. hirsutum . However, in G. barbadense , normal protein translation and high expression of GbSER02 are observed. Ectopic GbSER02 expression or site-directed GhSER02' mutagenesis (but not GhSER02 ) promotes trichome and root cell elongation in Arabidopsis , indicating that SNP 517th causes the dysfunction of GhSER02 . Overexpressing GbSER02 in G. hirsutum increases fiber length. GbSER02 interacts with the transcription factor GhVOZ1 (vascular one-zinc-finger protein) in the cytoplasm, alleviating the inhibitory effect of GhVOZ1 on GhGA3ox1 expression, thereby promoting gibberellin synthesis. Subsequently, the cell wall loosening-related genes GhXTH2 and GhEXPA1 are significantly upregulated whereas the flavonoid metabolism-related gene GhCHS1 is significantly downregulated, ultimately improving fiber length. Collectively, this study reveals the essential role of the GbSER02-GhVOZ1-GhGA3ox1 module in regulating fiber quality and provides novel insights into the mechanism of fiber development in cotton.},

  abstract     = {Cancer patients have a higher risk of all types of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Cardiologists are encountering a growing number of cancer patients with CVDs, and an increasing number of cancer patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The mechanistic link between cancer and CVDs remains elusive. Here, the meta-analysis shows the increased incidence ratio of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in patients undergoing PCI with cancer compared with non-cancer. We experimentally demonstrated that cancer aggravated mitochondrial dysfunction and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in two models of lung cancer in mice. Plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from cancer mice exacerbated cardiac I/R injury in vivo and in vitro, while inhibition of tumor EVs secretion by lipid-coated polyacrylic acid/calcium phosphate nanoparticles delivered a neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor (GW4869) showed the opposite results. Lung-specific miR-485-3p sponges mediated by Adeno-associated virus 6 suppress cardiac damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in CC10-KRAS G12D mice post-I/R. Mechanistically, PPARGC1A/PGC-1α is post-transcriptionally repressed by miR-485-3p in cardiomyocytes, leading to the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I subunits and ATP synthesis. Taken together, our findings reveal for the first time that cancer can aggravate cardiac injury and mitochondrial dysfunction by releasing miR-485-3p-enriched extracellular vesicles derived from cancer cells.},

  abstract     = {Creation of well-curated databases tailored to specific structural motifs can underpin and drive materials discovery, as the properties of materials are governed by composition and structure. The role of such motifs in directing the intricate interplay between structure and properties is exemplified by intermetallic compounds with structures that contain kagome layers that exhibit a variety of exotic physical states. Two prevailing approaches have previously been applied to identify such materials: evaluation of structural topology or geometry assessment, however, both present limitations if deployed individually. We augment topological screening with geometrical filtering to allow versatile control over the identification of kagome layers. Applying this approach with minimal further constraints labels over 9000 kagome-containing intermetallics which are assigned to four structural classes, revealing connections between symmetry, composition, direct space structure, and flatband electronic structures in reciprocal space. A machine learning model is used to predict new element combinations that favour the formation of kagome layers. Several highly-ranked phase fields correspond to known kagome-containing materials that were absent from the training dataset, demonstrating that the workflow can identify chemistries affording kagome layers. This motivates the extension of the approach beyond kagome to other property-conferring motifs, such as honeycomb, square planar or triangular plane nets.},

In this study, the authors demonstrated the novel interaction between LEDGF and H3R17me2a. In detail, Asn38 and Asp57 of LEDGF Proline-Tryptophan-Tryptophan-Proline (PWWP) domain are the key binding sites validated by peptide pull-down assays. Subsequently, a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that PPAT , PAICS , GART , ADSL , and ADSS2 are key target genes.

To maximize their efficacy, adjuvants and their combinations are investigated to prepare vaccines with whole tumor antigens. By comparing different nano/micro-vaccines, ≤ 400 nm and 2.5 µm, respectively, are identified as their optimal sizes. When used alone, the optimal cancer vaccine cures all or most tumor-bearing mice with melanoma, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma lung metastasis. The landscape of immune cells in the blood, splenocytes, and draining lymph nodes of vaccine-treated mice is systematically investigated using single-cell sequencing. The diversity of CD8 + T cell receptors (TCR), CD4 + TCR, and B cell receptors (BCR) in cured mice is higher than that in uncured mice. By comparing 21 samples, several biomarkers, including KLRG1, S100A4, S1PR5, IL2Ra, and IKZF2, were identified to distinguish responders and non-responders to immunotherapy. Moreover, S100A4, S1PR5 and KLRG1, are biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy in mouse cancer models and patients with cancer. Hence, this study presents an optimized cancer vaccine that cures most tumor-bearing mouse models and the landscape of immune cells in non-responders and responders to immunotherapy. The results of this study will help to develop better cancer vaccines.},

However,  the structural component alterations and immune cell infiltration characteristics of choroid plexus (ChP) following traumatic brain injury (TBI) remain incompletely understood. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing and histological analysis, the accumulation of group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) in the ChP stroma post-TBI is identified. Intracerebroventricular adoptive transfer of ILC2 is further indicated to exhibit a tendency to colonize the ChP and significantly alleviate pathogenic immune infiltration during the acute phase of TBI, as well as maintain hippocampal integrity during the chronic phase. Sensory-motor function and memory impairments in TBI mice are also improved under ILC2 treatment. Mechanistically, ILC2 is induced by ChP fibroblasts derived IL33 and anchored to stroma fibroblasts via the VCAM-1/Integrin α4β7 pathway. Furthermore, single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the hippocampus reveals that ILC2-derived AREG promotes the initiation of neurogenesis by interacting with EGFR on early-stage neurogenic cells. Overall, these findings highlight that ChP-resident ILC2, through optimizing the immune microenvironment and promoting neurogenesis after TBI, may represent a potential therapeutic strategy.},

Thioesters are widely employed in the realms of physiology, pharmacology, and agriculture. It is imperative to continuously expand the range of sulfur-containing precursors to keep pace with the cutting-edge advancements in the field of organic sulfur chemistry. This research has uncovered that polysulfide anions (K 2 S x ), which serve as reducing catalysts, can also effectively act as sulfur reagents, providing the formation of C( sp 3 )–S bonds through a photoredox catalysis with an oxidative photocatalyst tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) and dual hydrogen atom transfer (DHAT) process. In a pioneering study, a combinatorial strategy of an oxidative photocatalyst TBADT is presented with a reductive photocatalyst K 2 S x , enabled a photo-induced three-component coupling reaction of simple aldehydes with alkanes containing C (sp 3 )─H and polysulfide anions. A numbers of thioester derivatives are successfully obtained in good yields, while a by-product H 2 S is captured and identified by gas chromatography analysis.

  abstract     = {Rotator cuff tears often require surgical reconstruction; however, outcomes remain suboptimal, primarily because of the challenges in fully restoring the tendon–bone interface (TBI). The normal fibrocartilaginous transition zone is often replaced by fibrous scar tissue, thereby increasing the risk of retears. A porous hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel is developed to encapsulate adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). Gelatin microspheres served as porogens to create micropores within the hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel (HMs), and hollow gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel microspheres are used to encapsulate BMP-2 (GMBs). In vitro experiments confirm substantial proliferation and homing of ADSCs within the porous hydrogel system. When the ADSCs-loaded composite hydrogel (HMs/MBs/ADSCs) is applied to a rat rotator cuff injury model, it effectively reconstructs the fibrocartilage transition zone and promotes TBI healing. Transcriptome sequencing is performed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying BMP-2-induced fibrocartilage reconstruction. Furthermore, integrated in vitro sequencing reveals that HMs/MBs/ADSCs modulated the tissue microenvironment to enhance tissue regeneration, primarily through BMP-2′s regulation of the paracrine effects of ADSCs. This study explores the comprehensive pathway through which HMs/MBs/ADSCs enhance tissue regeneration, emphasizing the synergistic effects of BMP-2 and ADSCs, and offers novel insights into the mechanisms underlying TBI healing.},

  abstract     = {Leaf senescence significantly impacts both the yield and quality of non-heading Chinese cabbage (NHCC). Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of leaf senescence in NHCC remain poorly understood. Here, transcriptome changes are first profiled, and found that ethylene (ET) and salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathways are activated during leaf senescence. Further mining of ET, SA, and DNA methylation pathway genes identified that EIN3A and CMT2 are induced and repressed, respectively, during leaf senescence. A whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) analysis revealed a global reduction of DNA methylation during leaf senescence, with the most dramatic decline occurring in the 1 kb regions upstream of transcription start sites (TSS) and downstream of transcription end sites (TES). Knocking down of EIN3A and CMT2 via virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) demonstrated that EIN3A is crucial for ET- and age-triggered leaf senescence, while CMT2 plays an inhibitory role. It further showed that EIN3A directly represses the expression of CMT2 to release its “braking” role on senescence-associated genes ( SAGs ) expression. Thus, the study uncovers a pivotal antagonistic interaction between ET signaling and DNA methylation, which may be involved in setting the pace for the progression of leaf senescence in NHCC.},

  abstract     = {Effective bone regeneration remains a significant challenge in surgical practice, particularly due to the limitations associated with autologous bone grafting, such as donor site morbidity and limited bone availability. This study investigated the potential of human bone-derived endothelial cells (b-ECs) in mediating bone regeneration, especially in conjunction with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (bm-MSCs). It is demonstrated that b-ECs retain unique osteoinductive properties post-isolation, crucial for promoting bone formation in vivo. Utilizing ectopic and orthotopic xenograft models in immunodeficient mice, these findings revealed that the synergistic interaction of b-ECs and bm-MSCs induced rapid and substantial bone formation, highlighting the therapeutic potential of b-ECs in bone repair strategies. The distinct expression of KIT ligand (KITLG) in b-ECs emerged as a key factor in these processes. KITLG expression by b-ECs facilitated the recruitment of c-Kit+/CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells to the osteovascular niche, leading to robust osteogenic differentiation of bm-MSCs, a process regulated by Notch signaling. Moreover, inducing KITLG expression in non-bone-derived endothelial cells conferred similar osteoinductive capabilities. These findings not only enhance the understanding of the intricate interplay between vascular and bone tissues but also open avenues for developing innovative cell-based approaches for bone regeneration therapy.},

  abstract     = {Livestock farming and conventional meat production pose significant environmental, health, and animal welfare challenges. In seeking sustainable alternative solutions, cultivated meat technology typically utilizes differentiation of myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) into muscle cells for in vitro meat production. However, understanding the molecular determinants governing MPC differentiation into muscle cells, and the potential enhancement of this process through modulation of signaling pathways, remains limited. Herein, we characterized the molecular landscape associated with bovine MPC differentiation in vitro by employing multiomics, and explored its augmentation by small molecules, together leading to identification of media that enhanced myogenic differentiation compared with conventional methods in both 2D cultures and tissue-engineered 3D skeletal muscle constructs. Through bulk and single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics, we compared conventional and enhanced differentiation media, demonstrating that the enhanced media gave rise to unique progenitor-like cell populations, while simultaneously promoting differentiation into myocytes and contractile myotubes expressing a wide array of myogenic markers that more closely resemble bovine muscle cells in vivo. The improved method for promoting myogenic differentiation in 2D and 3D formats, together with the corresponding molecular roadmap, may prove valuable for cultivated meat applications.},

  abstract     = {Exposed to mechanical confinement, mammalian cells can establish remarkable unspecific adhesion, which is independent of integrins. How cells facilitate such adhesion remains unclear. Here, it is investigated how mammalian cells exposed to compression initiate unspecific and integrin-mediated adhesion. It is observed that with increasing compression, cells increase adhesion to collagen I or fibronectin and strengthen adhesion faster. Under low and medium compression, cells minimally increase unspecific adhesion to substrates that lack specific binding sites for cell surface receptors, such as integrins. However, under high compression, mammalian cells switch to a strong unspecific adhesion state, which significantly contributes to cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion. Thereby cells use the glycocalyx to directly facilitate strong unspecific adhesion and to enhance early integrin-mediated adhesion. The mechanistic insight of how cells unspecifically adhere to substrates under confinement opens avenues to better understand cell adhesion in development, homeostasis, disease, and in a wide range of biotechnological and medical applications in which cells are exposed to mechanical confinement.},

  abstract     = {Immunotherapy with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) has shown promising therapeutic effects in the treatment of lung cancer, the overall efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors is only 20%-30%. Thus, more effective combination therapies are needed. This study finds that cystine and cysteine levels in tumor tissues of lung cancer patients are significantly higher than adjacent non-tumor tissues. Cystine deficiency polarizes macrophages toward an M1 phenotype, secreting more TNF-α, CXCL9, and CXCL10. However, using a cystine-free diet marginally reduces the development of lung cancer in vivo. A cystine-free diet slightly reduces lung cancer progression in vivo. Further studies show that cystine deprivation or erastin-mediated transport inhibition increased PD-L1 expression in macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. Combining a cystine-free diet or IKE injection with PD-L1 antibody treatment significantly inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth in mice. Mechanistic studies indicat that cystine deficiency-induced GSH depletion activates NF-κB in macrophages by reducing its glutathionylation. This effect can be reversed by replenishing GSH or using an NF-κB inhibitor. At the same time, lung cancer patients with better responses to immunotherapy are found to have lower serum GSH levels. These findings suggest that targeting cystine metabolism combined with PD-L1 inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy.},

Initial studies focused on thin-film-based nanodiodes under vacuum conditions, but more advanced studies conducted under ambient-pressure environments reveal a direct correlation between hot electron excitation and catalytic performance. Furthermore, integrating nanocatalysts into nanodiodes has narrowed the gap between model systems and practical catalysts, demonstrating hot electron excitation in nanoparticle-based systems.

  abstract     = {Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury associated with recanalization therapy in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) exacerbates the initial brain damage. However, it remains a clinical challenge due to limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms of I/R injury. This study aims to investigate the mechanism of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-mediated succinate oxidation in microglia extracellular traps (MiETs) formation and neuronal injury after cerebra I/R injury. The results show that microglia are the main cell type producing extracellular traps (ETs) at 24 h at cerebral parenchyma after cerebral I/R. Additionally, oxygen glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) could induce MiETs formation and increased level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Microglia switches toward glycolysis with enhanced SDH activity and upregulated expression of SDH subunit A (SDHA) during MiETosis. Dimethyl malonate (DMM), a competitive SDH inhibitor, could reduce MiETosis by inhibiting succinate oxidation and mtROS production during reperfusion. Furthermore, DMM is found to alleviate neuronal injury after OGD/R exposure and neurological behavior disorders after cerebral I/R, and the effect is similar to MiETosis inhibitor BB-Cl amidine. These findings reveal a novel functional state of microglia and the role of succinate oxidation in MiETosis after cerebral I/R and provide a novel potential target for the treatment of AIS.},

However, traditional low-frequency microwave absorption materials (MAMs) suffer from issues such as large thickness, heavy weight, difficult impedance matching, insufficient low-frequency microwave loss, and poor environmental stability, severely limiting use and development. In recent years, researchers construct composite systems combining various types of loss, coupled with component adjustments and structural design strategies, significantly improving the impedance matching and multiple loss synergy effects for low-frequency MAMs. Based on the above, this review briefly introduces the basic principle of microwave absorption and the influence factors of low-frequency microwave absorption performance, and systematically reviews the recent research progress of carbon-based composites, magnetics-based composites, polymer-based composites, ceramic-based composites, and multiphase hybrid composites. Additionally, the intrinsic relationship and mechanisms are discussed in detail between the micro-structure and macro-performance of different composites. Furthermore, the key scientific and technical bottleneck problems that need to be addressed in the design and preparation of low-frequency MAMs are identified. It is expected to provide theoretical guidance for the controlled preparation and performance regulation of low-frequency microwave absorption composites.},

The underlying mechanisms of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in glucose metabolism remodeling in breast cancer (BC) are still not well understood. Herein, the expression of a tumorigenic lncRNA, LINC01094 are demonstrated that, is significantly increased in BC tissues and is associated with poorer patient survival. METTL14-mediated m 6 A modification stabilized LINC01094 by recruiting the reader protein IGF2BP2, which contributed to the upregulation of LINC01094 expression in BC. Gain- and loss-of-function assays validated that LINC01094 triggered a switch in glucose metabolism from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis, promoting BC progression both in vitro and in vivo. LINC01094 promoted the dimeric assembly and nuclear translocation of PKM2 by acting as a “molecular scaffold” for the PKM2/JMJD5 complex. This, in turn, facilitated energy metabolic reprogramming and cell proliferation induced by HIF1-α/β-catenin. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of LINC01094 is evaluated through the administration of the PKM2 activator TEPP-46 in mouse xenografts. These findings highlight the critical roles of LINC01094 in cellular glucose metabolism and tumorigenesis in BC, suggesting that it is a potential therapeutic target.},

Yet, its sluggish kinetics in acidic media and reliance on expensive noble metal catalysts limit its efficiency in these applications. Spinel cobalt(II, III) oxide (Co 3 O 4 )-based catalysts are cost-effective alternatives with high theoretical catalytic activity. However, their practical deployment is hindered by their poor stability in acidic electrolytes. This review critically examines recent advances in enhancing the stability of spinel Co 3 O 4 -based catalysts for acidic OER. The fundamental reaction mechanisms of acidic OER are first analyzed to illustrate how different catalyst design strategies can be used to improve their stability. Next, five key catalyst design strategies reported in recent studies are summarized: 1) constructing protective surface layers, 2) modulating reaction pathways, 3) controlling cobalt redox dynamics, 4) tuning cobalt-oxygen covalency, and 5) stabilizing lattice oxygen. Further, recent research progress in understanding the structure-activity-stability relationship of spinel Co 3 O 4 -based catalysts is summarized, with a focus on identifying their catalytically active sites, tracking surface reconstruction, and elucidating degradation mechanisms. This review ends with a discussion of future research directions for addressing key challenges in realizing durable, high-performance Co 3 O 4 -based catalysts for acidic OER applications.},

  abstract     = {Coordinating transcription and replication via transcription factors (TFs) is a conserved mechanism in higher eukaryotes. The role of TFs in regulating these processes in cancers remains unclear. Here, it is shown that oncogenetic ETS transcription factor ETV4 controls DNA replication through both transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ETV4 localizes to specific DNA replication origins and interacts with the origin recognition complex subunits ORC1 and ORC6 during the G1/S phase, facilitating origin formation. Using quantitative in situ analysis of protein interactions at DNA replication forks (SIRF) assays, it is shown that ETV4 transiently localizes to replication forks in the S phase. It interacts with replicative helicase MCM2 N-terminal, histone H3, and histone-chaperone FACT and is involved in histone processing during replication. Additionally, ETV4 transcriptionally regulates key replisome genes MCM2, MCM4, MCM5, MCM10, and ORC1, influencing their expression and recruitment to chromatin. Due to its binding at the origin-promoter locus like the MCM4 gene, ETV4 overexpression increases R-loop formation, DNA damage, and cell death under external replication stress induced by topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor. These findings highlight the dual role of ETV4 in replication and transcription and suggest that targeting TOP1 could be a synthetic-lethal approach in ETV4-overexpressed lung cancer.},

  abstract     = {Lytic forms of regulated cell death (RCD) rely on the activation and recruitment of executioner proteins. The mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) acts as the executioner in the necroptosis pathway, transitioning from an inactive to active state through phosphorylation, oligomerization, membrane recruitment, and membrane insertion, ultimately forming membrane hotpots. These mechanisms involve protein–protein interactions between receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and MLKL, MLKL phosphorylation, protein–protein interactions between MLKL and MLKL, and MLKL-lipid interactions. In this review, the specificity of MLKL activation mechanisms is discussed across different species and describe the processes by which MLKL transitions from an auto-inhibited to a membrane-embedded state. The opportunities are further explored for targeting MLKL, including small molecule inhibitors and functionally interacting proteins.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral fluorescence imaging (HSFI) could simultaneously offer morphological visualization and microenvironmental information through fluorescence wavelength-shifting of microenvironmental-sensitive fluorescent probes, yet its advancement is directly hindered by the scarcity of probes with sufficient spectral sensitivity. Herein, this study focuses on the development of an innovative fluorescent probe that exhibits heightened spectral sensitivity to microenvironmental changes and its advanced HSFI application. First, the comprehensive investigation of various donor-π-acceptor molecules uncovers the critical role of π-spacer on the wavelength sensitivity to microenvironment polarity. Based on this insight, a new fluorescent probe Lipi-PS of whose wavelength sensitivity represents the highest level so far is rationally developed. Further combining with the features of lipid droplets (LDs) targeting and high photostability of Lipi-PS , as well as the newly established wavelength and polarity encoding method, HSFI is successfully realized in cells, tissues, and zebrafishes. Accordingly, the structural morphologies, fluorescence wavelengths, and polarities are intuitively visualized in the HSFI images. Notably, a special HSFI of single LD is achieved using Lipi-PS in a custom-built 3D-SpecDIM system, allowing 5D tracking ( xyzλt ) of individual LDs for the first time. This enables unprecedented correlation of polarity-dynamic behavior at the single-LD level.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial dysfunction is related to etiopathogenesis and progression of heart failure (HF). The underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Transcription factor FOXM1 plays an essential role in cardiovascular development. The present study explores its role in mitochondrial bioenergetics in postmitotic cardiomyocytes (CMs). FOXM1 is significantly upregulated in ischemic heart tissues from humans, mice, and pigs. CM-specific Foxm1 -knockout mice exhibit dilated cardiomyopathy features associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of Foxm1 -knockout mice reveal robust, specific downregulation of gene programs important for mitochondrial energetics and homeostasis. Analysis of proteome and ubiquitinome data reveal that FOXM1 deficiency in CMs promotes LKB1 ubiquitination and impairs the AMPK signaling and energy metabolism pathways. Bioinformatics analysis identifies that E3 ligase MKRN1 promotes the K48-linked ubiquitination of LKB1 on Lys146, which in turn, inhibits the AMPK signaling pathway and impairs energy homeostasis in mice with HF. CM-specific Mkrn1 knockout ameliorates cardiac dysfunction by rejuvenating the impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics induced by FOXM1 deficiency. FOXM1 overexpression preserves mitochondrial bioenergetics and protects against myocardial I/R injury in both rodent and porcine models. In conclusion, FOXM1 is actively involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics during HF. FOXM1 may be a potential promising therapeutic target for myocardial I/R injury and HF.},

  abstract     = {Designing in situ whiskers to enhance the fracture toughness of ceramics presents challenges for structural applications. Herein, two corundum-type medium-entropy oxide ceramics (MEO-1 and MEO-2) are synthesized through solid-state reaction sintering under controlled oxygen partial pressures. MEO-1 is a single-phase corundum-type oxide (Al 0.41 Cr 0.26 Fe 0.31 Ti 0.02 ) 2 O 3 , while MEO-2 incorporates (Fe 4 Al 3 Cr) 0.25 TiO 5 whiskers to reinforce (Al 0.40 Cr 0.25 Fe 0.30 Ti 0.05 ) 2 O 3 . By regulating variable valence ions at different oxygen partial pressures, the whiskers achieved a maximum average length of 28.3 µm and a length-to-diameter ratio of 17.7 at 50.6 kPa, significantly enhancing the fracture toughness of the MEO-2, which possesses the optimal flexural strength, Vickers hardness, and fracture toughness of 321 ± 8 MPa, 22.4 ± 1.5 GPa, and 3.87 ± 0.12 MPa m 1/2 , respectively. Bravais–Friedel–Donnay–Harker law (BFDH) simulation elucidates that oxygen partial pressures can effectively regulate ionic diffusion behavior and whisker growth. First-principles calculations demonstrate that the whisker growth direction [0 4 0] aligns with the high shear modulus direction, contributing to the strengthening mechanism. This work provides new insights for designing high-performance medium/high-entropy ceramics, highlighting the critical role of oxygen partial pressure in regulating whisker growth and improving mechanical properties.},

The developments discussed herein signify substantial progress in material synthesis, characterization, and processing techniques, effectively addressing critical challenges associated with the integration of biodegradable devices into medical implants. Although biodegradable medical implants promise advanced patient care, widespread clinical translation is hindered by inconsistent degradation rates mismatched with healing timelines, insufficient load-bearing strength, and potential inflammatory or toxic by-products. Additionally, most studies exhibit application-material imbalances, inadequate in vivo validation, and poorly controlled degradation behavior. Future efforts must clarify degradation mechanisms and treat materials as therapeutic agents.

Here, an efficient and robust hydrogen-evolving electrode is developed, composed of cobalt oxide (Co 3 O 4 ) nanosheet catalyst with a metal cobalt transition interface on the current-collecting nickel wire mesh substrate. This Co 3 O 4 electrode affords a unique charge avalanche effect at the metal–semiconductor interface to concentrate electron release and thus enables high-current-density hydrogen evolving at 1000 mA cm −2 with only 207 mV overpotential, far outperforming commercial Raney nickel electrode that commonly delivers current densities below 500 mA cm −2 at 300–500 mV overpotentials. An industrial cell-stack electrolyzer utilizing Co 3 O 4 electrodes achieves a consistent current density of 1000 mA cm −2 at a 2.0 V cell voltage, surpassing the operational current density of commercial ALK systems by two to five times (200–500 mA cm −2 ). A significant enhancement in current output and a minimal deactivation rate of only 0.056 mV h −1 demonstrate the potential of the Co 3 O 4 electrode to replace commercial Raney nickel electrode, thereby substantially improving the hydrogen production efficiency of ALK electrolyzers.},

The kinetic studies feature pulsed arc mode as a novel way to improve CO 2 conversion, where CO production tripled compared to pulsed mode with negligible energy efficiency losses. In addition, these devices are also capable of performing dry reforming of methane (DRM) with a maximum energy efficiency of 33% and a syngas ratio close 1.

This study presents two types of STOMs with an area of 11.4 cm 2 , exhibiting homogeneous appearance while retaining up to 92% of their respective small-area cell power conversion efficiency (PCE). Precise laser structuring minimized the area loss originating from the sub-cell series interconnection, allowing narrow cell stripes down to 1.25 mm. This enables a metal-less top electrode composed solely of PEDOT:PSS without compromising fill factor. For a module, an additional challenge is to ensure a low resistance series interconnection between sub-cells. This is realized with a novel approach based on a direct contact between PEDOT:PSS and a thin Ag layer within the back electrode. For the first design, the latter incorporates Al-doped ZnO and Ag attaining a PCE of 6.1% with an average visible transmission (AVT) of 47.5%. A more elaborate design features an extended back electrode using TiO 2 and SiO 2 for improved optical performance (PCE = 7.9%), reaching an unprecedented AVT of 50.8% and a light utilization efficiency (LUE = AVT x PCE) of 4.0%.},

  abstract     = {Copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) have emerged as a remarkable class of CO 2 reduction reaction catalysts that are distinguished by their unparalleled reactivity, but effectively modulating the transport pathway of charge carriers between Cu NCs by feasible chemical means is still challenging. Herein, a thermally induced covalent crosslinking strategy is proposed to modulate the fast electron transport pathway formed between clusters. A copper-sulfur–nitrogen cluster [Cu 4 (SN) 4 ] (denoted Cu 4 SN ) is first synthesized; subsequently, the SN ligands in Cu 4 SN are coupled covalently via a thermally induced covalent crosslinking strategy to yield CC –Cu 4 SN , which exhibits enhanced conductivity and photocarrier transport. As expected, CC –Cu 4 SN shows a high photocatalytic CO production rate of 29.98 µmol g −1 h −1 with ≈99.5% selectivity in CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as sacrificial agents, which is more than 10 times superior to that observed with Cu 4 SN . Systematic experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the covalent crosslinks between clusters accelerate the dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers, increase the light utilization ability, favor CO 2 adsorption and * COOH generation, thereby accounting for the increased CO 2 photoreduction activity. This work presents a novel thermally induced internal covalent crosslinking strategy for synthesizing novel cluster-based covalent polymers with enhanced stability and catalytic activity.},

Mutations of sites 142 and 173 only partially affect the levels of p53 N/T , SLC7A11 and ferroptosis.

ALKBH5 promotes G3BP1 expression through m 6 A methylation at m 6 A sites 142 and 173. Subsequently, G3BP1, YBX1, and p53 interact with each other, the amount of synergistic nuclear translocation of YBX1 and p53 is reduced, and the level of p53 nuclear translocation that inhibiting SLC7A11 transcription is decreased, thereby inhibits cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and reducing myocardial tissue damage during myocardial IRI in diabetes.},

However, the limited stability of natural enzymes, along with interference from electro-oxidizable species, continues to pose significant challenges for their long-term application. Herein, an integrated wearable system is presented for nonenzymatic glucose monitoring in sweat at the point of care. This system integrates a flexible microfluidic glucose sensor patch for sweat sampling and measurement, using Pt nanoparticles (Pt-NPs) confined within phthalocyanine-based conductive metal–organic frameworks (Pc-MOFs) as electrode materials, and a flexible printed circuit board for signal/analysis and wireless communication. The microfluidic sensor patch based on Pc-MOFs confined Pt-NPs exhibits significantly improved nonenzymatic glucose sensing performances. This is attributed to the ultrasmall size of Pt-NPs and the confinement effect within the Pc-MOF channels, which regulates the glucose adsorption intensity and increases the electrocatalytic activity to glucose oxidation. During the continuous monitoring process, the glucose concentration is calibrated in sweat by accounting for fluctuations in pH and temperature, and evaluated the performance of the wearable device in monitoring sweat glucose levels in human subjects over a 12-h period, achieving data as accurate as that obtained using high-performance liquid chromatography.},

  abstract     = {Nanoparticle (NP)–hydrogel hybrid materials have emerged as promising platforms for controlled drug delivery, combining the tunable chemistry of NPs (e.g., liposomes, polymeric, and inorganic NPs) with the porous, biocompatible networks of hydrogels (e.g., alginate or poly(ethylene glycol)-based systems). These composites can encapsulate a wide range of bioactive agents—small molecules, peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids—within hydrogel matrices, guided by molecular interactions such as electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance. Such interactions influence both the physicochemical stability and drug release profiles of the system. This review highlights recent advances in NP–hydrogel composites, emphasizing how molecular-level interactions shape the nanostructure, drug encapsulation, and release behavior. The enhanced mechanical strength, stimuli responsiveness, pharmacokinetics, and biological performance of these materials are also discussed. Particular focus is placed on how improved mechanistic understanding can guide the design of next-generation hybrid systems with tunable, predictable release for biomedical applications. This review provides a comprehensive overview of NP–hydrogel hybrid materials as versatile drug delivery systems and outlines future research directions for their use in personalized therapy, targeted treatment, and broader clinical translation.},

  abstract     = {Regulating the orientation and dynamics of interfacial water is essential for optimizing electrocatalytic reactions, yet it remains challenging due to its intrinsic disorder. Here, it is demonstrated that localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on an Ir single-atom Au catalyst actively restructures the hydrogen-bond (HB) network, accelerating ammonia oxidation reaction kinetics. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that plasmonic excitation shifts the HB network toward a more flexible configuration, favoring the formation of three-coordinated hydrogen-bonded water (3HB·H 2 O) while suppressing cation-associated species (K + ·H 2 O). This transformation enhances the dehydrogenation process and stabilizes reaction intermediates, leading to a 28% increase in NH 3 oxidation kinetics. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy further confirms that LSPR-driven polarization at the Ir active site compresses the Ir─O bond from 1.73 to ≈1.58 Å by generating electron vacancies, thereby accelerating deprotonation with * OH during oxidative electrolysis. Extending this principle to an LED-driven plasmon-assisted symmetric wastewater electrolyzer, achieving a 40-fold current enhancement and 94% ammonia removal efficiency over 120 h at 1 V under landfill leachate-like conditions.},

Polyglycolic acid (PGA) is widely used in biomedical and packaging fields. Here, this study introduces an electrochemical degradation strategy for PGA waste that couples its conversion with seawater-driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using rosette-like high-entropy NiCoFeMnAlO x nanosheets (r-NCFMAO). The PGA-derived glycolic acid oxidation reaction (GAOR) achieves 100 mA cm −2 at 1.36 V versus RHE, benefiting from abundant hydroxyl species (OH*) that lower the required potential by over 190 mV compared to the oxygen evolution reaction. This method produces ≈90% CO 3 2− , and subsequent Ca 2+ precipitation recovers 77% of CaCO 3 , a valuable material in construction and papermaking. Electrochemical analysis, quasi in situ electron paramagnetic resonance, and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal continuous OH − oxidation enhancing GAOR activity, while density functional theory confirms that OH* lowers the energy barrier for the rate-determining C─C bond cleavage and C─H bond activation. The integrated GAOR ‖ HER system sustains performance for over 300 h at industrial current densities and is applicable to upcycling various plastics. This work pioneers a synergistic approach for plastic waste valorization and hydrogen production, advancing circular carbon strategies.},

  abstract     = {Low-temperature annealing is traditionally employed to relieve residual stresses in metallic materials, typically resulting in softening. However, a novel finding in the face-centered-cubic (fcc) CoNiV medium entropy alloy (MEA) is reported, where low-temperature annealing induces significant hardening without sacrificing ductility. Specifically, after annealing at 530 °C, the yield strength increases from 503 to 653 MPa, while maintaining plasticity of ≈60%. The comprehensive analysis reveals that this unexpected strengthening is attributed to the development of multi-scale chemical short-range orderings (SROs) during the annealing process. These SROs, particularly a newly formed L12-type ordered structure (SRO-2), enhance material strength by promoting dislocation slip planarity and reducing dislocation entanglement. This study demonstrates that low-temperature annealing can effectively optimize atomic-scale structures in complex alloys distinct from that in conventional alloys, thereby improving their mechanical properties. These findings extend the conventional understanding of annealing effects and highlight the potential for leveraging SROs to design high-performance materials.},

Here, a glycol lignin ionogel (GLI) with integrated flame-retardant, waterproof, and sensing capabilities for smart firefighting auxiliary equipment is presented. The ionogel, synthesized from the molecular network construction of Gly-lignin, 1-butyl-3-vinylimidazole tetrafluoroborate (BVIMBF 4 ), and benzyl methacrylate (BZMA), forms a stable and elastic 3D conductive network through both chemical and physical crosslinking. This structure imparts remarkable mechanical properties, including considerable adhesion (30.4 kPa on flame-retardant gloves), tensile strength (5.8 MPa), and high ionic conductivity. Notably, through the formation of a protective carbonized/B₂O₃ layer and chemical barrier gases during combustion, the ionogel exhibits excellent flame retardancy, with a weight loss of 41.8% at 800 °C. Additionally, GLI achieves real-time thermal sensing via its negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior (TCR = −0.58% °C −1 ). Even after exposure to fire, GLI retains its temperature and motion-sensing capabilities. Moreover, GLI demonstrates favorable biocompatibility and environmental degradability, broadening its applicability in sustainable and wearable electronics.

  abstract     = {This work elucidates an important open question in the field of mechanically soft magnetorheological elastomers (MREs): how microstructural rearrangements during magnetic actuation modulate their viscoelastic behavior. Experimental assays are provided on mechanically confined and very soft MREs that, under magnetic actuation, show an order of magnitude increase in relaxation times compared to purely mechanical cases. It is demonstrated that such a modulation in the viscous response can be tuned by the amplitude and actuation rate of the magnetic stimuli, and is intrinsically linked to microstructural rearrangements of the magnetic particles. Motivated by these experimental observations, magnetic actuation protocols are conceived to enable mechanical responses in soft materials with force-memory. Specifically, due to the magnetically induced long-term viscous relaxation, one can induce magnetic-driven yielding by introducing material hardening during cycling loading. This mechanical memory of the MRE can be subsequently removed by releasing the magnetic stimuli for h, resetting the material performance and its microstructural state. These mechanisms are deeply understood by a combination of different experimental approaches and a new theoretical magneto-mechanical continuum model. The results reported herein respond to unraveled fundamental questions in soft MREs, and provide a game-changing concept for designing a new branch of soft sensor-actuator and reservoir computing systems.},

As a step further, tunability in fundamental building blocks such as couplers is desired toward topological integrated circuits and communication systems. However, most of existing topologically protected couplers exhibit a constant transmission coefficient within the bandgap, and achieving continuously tunable transmission coefficients remains challenging. Here it is experimentally showed that a four-port coupler consisting of quantum valley Hall effect-based waveguides can exhibit continuously tunable transmission coefficients from one input port to each of the two output ports over the bandgap, while the rest port is consistently isolated by the topological protection. Further topologically protected digital signal transfer is demonstrated with frequency shift keying modulation in the coupler, revealing the data-transfer capability close to the theoretical limit established in the digital communication scheme. These results pave the way for topological data transfer and signal processing.},

However, most kirigami structures can only deform freely within a 2D plane, with limited out-of-plane deformability, making them inadequate for constructing periodic objects with arbitrary 3D shapes. Here, a novel class of 3D mechanical metamaterials with hyperbolic kirigami tessellations has been developed. By projecting hyperbolic kirigami templates onto three types of triply periodic minimal surfaces, candidate structures are developed with remarkable properties. An extreme negative Poisson's ratio of -1 and tunable mechanical multistability are uncovered through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments thanks to the flexible kirigami geometry. Notably, the structure achieves a maximum volume expansion of up to 488% during auxetic morphing. Furthermore, programmable morphing behaviors are demonstrated through voxelated assemblies of kirigami unit cells with varying geometrical parameters. The novel design strategy presented in this work based on hyperbolic kirigami tessellations opens up new avenues toward auxetic and multistable mechanical metamaterials with broad applications spanning shape-morphing architectures, deployable space structures, and soft machines.},

However, techniques for flexible dual-modal sensors mainly rely on integrating multiple sensing units on a platform, thus inducing extra costs and complexities associated with the fabrication and data processing. In this paper, a flexible dual-modal sensor is presented, which contains only one sensing unit, i.e., single-crystalline silicon-based diode, for the real-time, independent, and continuous monitoring of light and temperature. Operation modes for photodetection and temperature sensing of the flexible dual-modal sensor are switchable by controlling the biased condition. In addition, both experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that the crosstalk between light and temperature can be conveniently decoupled by short-circuit current and forward current of silicon-based diodes. Finally, the flexible dual-modal sensor is implemented as a platform to realize the continuous monitoring of photoplethysmography (PPG) and skin temperature of fingertips. These presented results offer paths to the construction of multifunctional, flexible bioelectronic devices or integrated platforms for biomedical uses.},

  abstract     = {Despite the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) agents, substantial individual differences in public acceptance persist. To explain the difference in attitudes toward AI agents, existing research has primarily focused on environmental factors. However, evolutionary psychology research suggests that the mechanism of outgroup rejection has a genetic basis, highlighting the need to explore the potential genetic underpinnings of negative attitudes toward AI agents as an outgroup in human society. This study examines the genetic basis of negative attitudes toward AI agents and their relationship with related personality traits, using a twin study design to assess negative attitudes toward AI agents, victim sensitivity, and moral preferences. Univariate genetic analyses revealed significant heritability of these negative attitudes. Bivariate analyses further identify shared genetic influences between victim sensitivity and personal-level fear and wariness toward robots. Similarly, a shared genetic basis is observed between the moral preferences concerning authority and sociotechnical blindness anxiety toward AI agents. These findings extend the understanding of social cognition in AI agents by emphasizing the role of genetic factors in shaping attitudes toward them. Moreover, they provide new insights for enhancing public acceptance of AI agents and optimizing human-machine interactions.},

  abstract     = {Modeling complex semiconductor fabrication processes such as Ohmic contact formation remains challenging due to high-dimensional parameter spaces and limited experimental data. While classical machine learning (CML) approaches have been successful in many domains, their performance degrades in small-sample, nonlinear scenarios. In this work, quantum machine learning (QML) is investigated as an alternative, exploiting quantum kernels to capture intricate correlations from compact datasets. Using only 159 experimental GaN HEMT samples, a quantum kernel-aligned regressor (QKAR) is developed combining a shallow Pauli-Z feature map with a trainable quantum kernel alignment (QKA) layer. All models, including seven baseline CML regressors, are evaluated under a unified PCA-based preprocessing pipeline to ensure a fair comparison. QKAR consistently outperforms classical baselines across multiple metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE), achieving a mean absolute error of 0.338 Ω·mm when validated on experimental data. Noise robustness and generalization are further assessed through cross-validation and new device fabrication. These findings suggest that carefully constructed QML models can provide predictive advantages in data-constrained semiconductor modeling, offering a foundation for practical deployment on near-term quantum hardware. While challenges remain for both QML and CML, this study demonstrates QML's potential as a complementary approach in complex process modeling tasks.},

  abstract     = {Interfacial instability in aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) leads to uncontrolled dendrite growth and water-induced parasitic reactions, limiting their practical applications. In this work, a novel superhydrophobic HfO 2 -coated functionalized glass fiber separator is proposed. Characterized by its high dielectric constant, HfO 2 can autonomously generate an oriented electric field under external electric field stimulation, ensuring uniform distribution of the electric field and Zn 2+ flux at the interface. This strategy not only enhances Zn 2+ transport kinetics but also effectively suppresses the migration of SO 4 2− via electrostatic repulsion. Furthermore, the HfO 2 @GF separator promotes the deposition of Zn 2+ along the Zn (100) and Zn (002) crystal planes, facilitating the preferential exposure of the unique Zn (101) crystal plane. Additionally, its superhydrophobic property effectively inhibits interfacial side reactions. Therefore, the symmetrical cell exhibits an ultra-long cycling life of 4660 h at 5 mA cm −2 and 1 mAh cm −2 , and maintains stable operation up to 5050 h at 10 mA cm −2 . The Zn||I 2 full battery maintains 87.75% of its initial capacity after 8000 cycles at 10C. Furthermore, the stacked Zn||I 2 pouch battery provides an Ah-level capacity (1.64 Ah). This work provides a new insight into the construction of highly stable interfacial chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Gold is an effective catalyst for low-temperature CO oxidation, yet its mechanism remains debated. Among the various proposed mechanisms, increasing attention has been given to a possible electrochemical pathway in recent studies. Here, experimental evidence is reported that CO oxidation at room temperature in electrolytes proceeds via coupled electrochemical CO oxidation and oxygen reduction half-reactions, i.e., the mixed-potential-driven mechanism. A model system is designed with deposited Au nanoparticles (NPs) and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO) on carbon paper acting as spatially separated electrodes in a single electrolysis cell. After shorting the two electrodes, the reaction current and mixed potential of the overall CO oxidation are measured without any externally applied bias. Independent current–potential curves for each half-reaction are also obtained under identical experimental conditions. The intersection points of these curves, representing the predicted mixed potential and net current, showed good agreement with the values measured in the short-circuited system. These results provide clear evidence that CO oxidation in aqueous media proceeds via a mixed-potential-driven mechanism, analogous to corrosion. This finding provides strong support for the hypothesis that low-temperature CO oxidation over-supported Au catalysts in the presence of water vapor proceeds via a similar electrochemical pathway in gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis.},

However, their inherent vulnerability related to mechanical damage and electrical breakdown seriously limits their safe and long-term service. Herein, a healable dielectric elastomer (PHT-ZnS:Cu) is acquired for premature breakdown warning by synthesising a healable poly(dimethylsiloxane) based on reversible imine bonding and hydrogen bonding and subsequent incorporation of electroluminescent ZnS:Cu particles. Moreover, LiTFSI ionic liquids are introduced into the healable poly(dimethylsiloxane) to prepare a transparent healable compliant electrode (PHT-IL) that does not obscure the light emission of PHT-ZnS:Cu dielectric elastomer. Then, an integral healable DEA (ISDEA) with an excellent interfacial interaction is constructed by coating two sides of PHT-ZnS:Cu with PHT-IL. The optimized ISDEA displays an actuated strain of 17.0% at 15 kV mm −1 with a healing efficiency of 91.9%. The integrated ISDEAs are used as soft anti-counterfeiting labels and soft intelligent keyboards for information transmission, encryption, and human-machine interaction, showing prospective applications in the realm of data leakage prevention and personal privacy protection.},

In the CdZnSe/ZnSeS/CdSeS/CdS (C/S 1 /S 2 /S 3 , in which C is the CdZnSe core and S represents the shells) structure, there is an intriguing metamorphosis from quantum dot (QD) to QS (that is, C and C/S 1 belong to QDs, meanwhile C/S 1 /S 2 and C/S 1 /S 2 /S 3 are in the QS regime). Due to uniform morphology, perfect nanostructure, negligible defects, and unique energy level alignment, the C/S 1 /S 2 /S 3 QS exhibits a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 90.9%, an ultra-long fluorescence lifetime of 215.2 ns, and a slow radiative transition rate. It enables QS-based light–emitting diodes (QS-LEDs) with the state-of-the-art performance, such as high external quantum efficiency (EQE of 22.16%) and excellent stability. Meanwhile, the investigation of charge carrier dynamics reveals the difference between the QD- and QS-LEDs, showing that the charge carriers inside the QS-LEDs need more time to recombine with each other. Based on these findings, this study believes that the emerging QSs can be attractive and efficient light–emitting materials used in lighting and displays.},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this maturation are not yet fully understood. In this study, YTHDC1 is identified as a key positive regulator of hepatocyte maturation and an essential factor in maintaining liver homeostasis. YTHDC1 expression increases in the liver after birth, and hepatocyte-specific deletion of Ythdc1 impairs hepatocyte maturation, leading to reduced liver weight, liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. These defects contribute to the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. YTHDC1 supports postnatal hepatocyte maturation and liver function by enhancing the expression of key transcription factors, FOXA1 and FOXA2, at the posttranscriptional level through m 6 A recognition. Restoring FOXA1 or FOXA2 expression mitigates the phenotypic defects observed in Ythdc1 -HKO mice. Mechanistically, YTHDC1 binds to the m 6 A regions of Foxa1 and Foxa2 mRNAs, promoting their expression. These findings reveal a mechanism by which YTHDC1 regulates hepatocyte maturation.},

However, noninvasive monitoring of tau protein secretion, a key biomarker of AD, across developmental stages, age-related variations, and the interaction between apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) and the tau protein axis is not yet accomplished. Here, the label-free and non-invasive detection of multiple tau variants dynamics across developmental stages, age-related variants, and various APOE isogenic genotyes is presented to investigate the APOE –tau axis using human cerebral organoids (hCOs) combined with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Principal component analysis (PCA) of SERS signals successfully identifies four developmental stages of hCOs: embryonic body, neuronal differentiation, maturation, and maintenance phases. Temporal dynamics of age-related tau protein secretion are observed, reflecting characteristics associated with AD, which are diminished by astrocyte expression. PCA-based dimensionality reduction of SERS signals further reveals distinct clustering for different APOE isogenic genotypes, with tau protein secretion increasing from APOE2/E2 to APOE4/E4 , providing direct insight into the APOE –tau axis in AD. This study introduces a novel method for the non-invasive clinical assessments of disease conditions, dynamics, and the relationship between APOE and tau in AD.},

  abstract     = {The conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a promising strategy for obesity treatment. It is previously identified βFaar as a conserved long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) regulator of islet β-cell function in individuals with obesity, but its effect on WAT browning is not well understood. In this study, it is discovered that βFaar expression in adipose tissue markedly decreases with the progression of obesity in both mice and humans. βFaar in adipose tissue reduces lipid droplet (LD) size in WAT and promotes a browning phenotype in inguinal WAT (iWAT), leading to the amelioration of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. These effects can be attributed to crosstalk between βFaar and proteins within the master regulatory pathways of LD formation and WAT browning, including RAS oncogene family 18 (RAB18) and interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4). Specifically, βFaar inhibits LD swelling by binding to RAB18 and promoting IRF4 nuclear translocation, increases uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) transcription, and further induces iWAT browning by binding to karyopherin subunit alpha 6 (KPNA6). Together, these results demonstrate the critical roles of βFaar in regulating iWAT browning and preserving metabolic health; thus, βFaar may be a potential therapeutic target for management of obesity and related disorders.},

However, the precise regulation of H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas remains a challenge, especially through simple and feasible methodologies. In this work, a novel composite electrocatalyst, copper-indium/black phosphorus ( CuIn/BP ) is developed, using a simple one-step co-reduction method for efficient CO 2 RR. It is found for the first time that there is a linear relationship between BP content in CuIn/BP and the H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas. Consequently, the H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas can be precisely tailored by simply adjusting the BP content in CuIn/BP . A total faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO and H 2 reached ≈ 100% along with a current density of 135.2 mA cm −2 . Mechanistic studies suggest that the CuIn phase and Cu 3 P species are in situ generated in CuIn/BP , where the CuIn phases mainly contribute to CO generation, while the Cu 3 P species promote H 2 formation. The variation in BP content modulates the proportion of the CuIn phase and Cu 3 P species, leading to the variations in H 2 /CO molar ratios. Thus, this study provides an efficient and simple strategy to tailor the H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas for various industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Green hydrogen, produced via renewable-energy-driven water electrolysis, is among the most promising new energy carriers. Ru is a potential catalyst for this purpose; however, its strong hydrogen binding strength results in poor reaction kinetics, limiting its application potential. Creating a new Ru structure by introducing a second element is crucial for optimizing its catalytic performance. However, only a few studies have explored this approach, leaving the understanding of how chemical composition influences Ru's structure and catalytic activity elusive. Here, a systematic study is reported on Si decoration of Ru, achieving a tunable local environment around Ru and optimized reaction kinetics. By constructing a Ru-SiO x interleaved Turing-patterned structure, the ratio of Si coordinated to Ru is tuned by well-designed selective etching. With increasing Si content, the H-binding strength on the Ru center is progressively weakened, resulting in a V-shaped trend in hydrogen production activity. The optimized sample exhibits a low overpotential of 21 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in alkaline solution, along with a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec −1 , surpassing the performance of commercial Pt/C.

Here, the synthesis of two new DELs, named FM-DEL1 and FM-DEL2, including 7′710 and 5′697’690 compounds, respectively is described. These libraries are constructed by installing one or two sets of building blocks on a phenylalanine central scaffold. FM-DELs are screened against markers of prostate cancer, and renal cell carcinoma, and against an immunological target expressed on the surface of natural killer cells. Highly potent and selective binders with affinity constants in the nanomolar range are obtained from DEL screenings against those targets. Small-molecule ligands against tumor-associated antigens are used to develop small-molecule radiopharmaceuticals that selectively accumulate at cancer sites after systemic administration.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge of kinetic rates of intersystem crossing (ISC) k ISC , reverse ISC k rISC , singlet k S , and triplet k T relaxation processes, respectively, is indispensable for material design as well as understanding of the operation of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on organic emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Typically, the various rate constants are obtained by numerically fitting of the photoluminescence (PL) decay, but it is overlooked whether or not the solution of such a fit is unique. Using an analytical model, it is demonstrated that for typical TADF emitters only the sum of k S and k ISC , and the sum of k T and k rISC can be uniquely obtained from the transient PL decay and PL quantum yield (PLQY) experiments. Depending whether nonradiative losses stem from singlets or triplets, various combinations of k T and k rISC , k S and k ISC can be used to obtain the same transient PL decay, while keeping the PLQY constant. The only exception is the case of unity PLQY that allows for a direct determination of all relevant kinetic rates from just a single transient PL measurement. It is further shown that additional PL measurements in oxygen atmosphere with complete triplet quenching are redundant, since the results can be explicitly predicted from PL measurements in inert atmosphere. Using the TADF emitter CzDBA with a PLQY as high as 90% as a model system, it is demonstrated that by a combination of PL decay, PLQY, and OLED device modeling it is possible to quantify all the individual kinetic rates. For CzDBA neat film with PLQY as high as 90%, the majority of nonradiative losses stems from triplets, showing it is vital to conduct comprehensive studies on the molecular origin of nonradiative losses in the future.},

  abstract     = {To effectively minimize reflection losses and achieve compatibility with industrial-scale silicon production lines, textured silicon/perovskite tandem solar cells have garnered significant attention in recent research. However, achieving uniform and stable coverage of the textured silicon substrate with hole-selective layer (HSL) remains a significant challenge. Herein, a HSL material, DPAICz ((indolo[2,3-a]carbazole-11,12-diylbis(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis(phosphonic acid)), is reported specifically designed for textured silicon substrate. Compared to the typical HSL material 2PACz, DPAICz features a π-expanded conjugated core and multiple anchoring groups, forming a split-standing configuration with anchoring groups positioned on opposite sides, resulting in superior anchoring stability on textured substrate under external stimuli. Moreover, DPAICz exhibited a larger molecular dipole moment and a more pronounced p-type characteristic, enhancing the interfacial hole extraction efficiency. Consequently, wide-bandgap (1.68 eV) perovskite solar cells employing DPAICz as the HSL achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.42%. Introducing the DPAICz into monolithic silicon/perovskite tandem solar cells greatly improved their performance, achieving a remarkable PCE of 32.55% in 1 cm 2 area. Importantly, the unencapsulated tandems based on DPAICz exhibited significantly enhanced long-term operational stability, retaining 96% of its initial PCE after 880 h of continuous 1-sun light soaking at 45 °C under open-circuit condition.},

  abstract     = {Developing novel memristive systems aims to implement key principles of biological neuron assemblies – plasticity, adaptivity, and self-organization – into artificial devices for parallel, energy-efficient computing. Solid-state memristive devices, such as crossbar arrays and percolated nanoparticle (NP) networks, already demonstrate these properties. However, closer similarity to neural networks is expected from liquid-state systems, including polymer melts, which remain largely unexplored. Here, the resistive switching in silver/poly(ethylene glycol) (Ag/PEG) nanofluids, prepared by depositing gas-aggregated Ag NPs into PEGs of varying molecular mass, is investigated. These systems form long-range conductive NP bridges with reconfigurable resistance states in response to an electric field. The zeta-potential of Ag NPs and molecular mobility of PEG determine the prevalence of low resistance (ohmic) state, high resistance states (poor conductance) or intermediate transition states governed by space-charge-limited conduction or electron tunneling. The occurrence of these states is given by the interparticle gaps, which are determined by the conformation of PEG molecules adsorbed on the NPs. It is presented, for the first time, an equivalent circuit model for the Ag/PEG system. These findings pave the way to adopt polymer melts as matrices for neuromorphic engineering and bio-inspired electronics.},

Understanding the structure-property relationship is essential for the realization of their use in spintronic, valleytronic, and optoelectronic applications. Herein, after the high pressure-temperature synthesis of 3R-MoS 2 in a large volume cubic press, a concomitant experimental and theoretical high-pressure study of 3R-MoS 2 is reported, leading to the discovery of pressure-induced reversible isostructural phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Concurrent with the isostructural transitions, a semiconductor-to-metal transition is observed, owing to strong interlayer interaction and charge redistribution across the van der Waals gap under pressure. The pressure-induced enhancement of interlayer interactions together with the robust intrinsic layer stacking in 3R-MoS 2 prevent the layers from sliding under pressure and hinder a corresponding volume collapse. This study on continuous pressure-tuning of crystal and electronic structure in 3R-MoS 2 will play a vital role in developing the next-generation devices involving coupling of structural, optical, and electrical properties of 3R-polytypes of TMDs and other layered materials.},

However, achieving this heterogeneity within a single material remains a significant challenge. Here, a strategy to engineer spontaneously generated heterogeneous surface and bulk structures within a material is introduced. The resulting material is termed phase-separation and underwater reconfiguration-enhanced (PURE) elastomers. PURE elastomers integrate the high elasticity of the bulk with superior immunocompatibility at the surface. By de novo designing the immunomodulatory and alkyl acrylate monomer structures, this is regulated that the copolymer's spatial configurations, ultimately influencing its condensed structure. Tuning the alkyl side chain length facilitates the formation of a distinctive phase-separation pattern in elastomers that accommodates large deformations, resulting in excellent toughness and low hysteresis. Moreover, this phase structure supports a water-induced surface phase reconfiguration, aligning with in vivo applications. This reconfiguration enriches immunomodulatory groups at the material surface, significantly enhancing immunocompatibility. Consequently, these elastomers exhibit extremely low fibrotic capsule formation for up to one year in mice and two months in non-human primates. This findings introduce a class of durable, fibrosis-resistant materials and establish a new strategy for designing heterogeneous polymeric elastomers with broad biomedical applicability.},

However, accurately classifying cells based on the parental origin of the inactivated X chromosome in single-cell samples remains challenging. Here we present FemXpress, a computational tool leveraging X-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to group cells based on the origin of the inactivated X chromosome in female single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data. FemXpress performs robustly on both simulated and real datasets, without requiring parental genomic information, and can also identify genes that escape XCI. Applying FemXpress to single-cell RNA-Seq data from multiple tissues of a cynomolgus monkey, we reveal heterogeneity in XCI origin across organs and cell types. In each organ, we identify candidate XCI-escaping genes, and within each cell type, we observe gene expression differences associated with XCI origin, potentially contributing to phenotypic variability. Furthermore, FemXpress demonstrated strong performance in phasing XCI in scRNA-Seq datasets from embryos and colon tumors. In summary, FemXpress provides a powerful approach for XCI status analysis, offering new insights into XCI dynamics at single-cell resolution.},

However, the practical application of traditional ceramic aerogels is constrained by their inherent mechanical brittleness. Herein, a strategy is proposed to customize mechanically tunable aerogels by armoring ceramic nanounits with pyrolytic carbon (PyC). The PyC encapsulating layers with various thicknesses are transformed into ductile tights or rigid armors, facilitating the mechanical customization of BN@PyC aerogel from superelasticity to rigidity across scales. Interestingly, the PyC armor imparts unique versatility to the aerogel, including flame retardancy, elastic response conductivity, and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, owing to the thermal stability of the PyC armor, the BN@PyC aerogel maintains its mechanical integrity even after high-temperature thermal treatment, and exhibits an unexpected resistance to butane torch ablation. Integrating mechanical stability, high-temperature resistance, and multifunctionality, BN@PyC aerogels offer new possibilities for scalable applications in extreme environments. This facile strategy of armoring brittle ceramic aerogels with PyC provides a novel reference for customizing the mechanical properties of multifunctional aerogels.},

This study presents an innovative ionogel-based rain energy harvester that overcomes these limitations. The key advancement lies in the stable polarized interface created by the ionogel, which enables rapid charging and high charge retention, leading to a significant instantaneous power within the first few raindrops and achieving an 8-fold increase in saturation performance over conventional design. The harvester only requires 25 droplets to reach saturation and maximum electrical output, achieving an impressive power density of 235.11 W m −2 and a conversion efficiency of 6.77%, being the highest recorded for ionogel and hydrogel-based droplet energy harvesters.

Here, it is reported that downregulation of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15B) significantly correlated with poor outcomes in patients with KRAS mut -PDAC. Mechanistically, KRAS mut /ERK1-elicited phosphorylation of ABHD17C promotes depalmitoylation and membrane-to–cytoplasm translocation of ALOX15B, facilitating proteasome-dependent degradation of ALOX15B via interaction with the E3 ligase complex CUL4/DDB1/DCAF10. Notably, treatment with methyl protodioscin (MPD), a steroid saponin primarily purified from polygonatum sibiricum rhizome, restored the S-palmitoylation and membrane location of ALOX15B via disruption of the ABHD17C/ALOX15B interaction, consequently resulting in significant inhibition of growth rate of patient-derived KRAS mut -PDAC organoids in vitro and KRAS mut -PDAC-formed tumor in vivo via induction of ferroptosis. Therefore, these findings unveil a prominent role of ferroptosis evasion in KRAS mut -PDAC progression and highlight the potential of targeting KRAS/ERK1/ABHD17C/ALOX15B axis in KRAS mut -PDAC treatment.},

Furthermore, the covalent crosslinking agent, DVS, is introduced to sustain the long-term, high-power production efficiency of PEDOT:PSS. The devised yarn-type TEPG system generates a maximum power of 112 µW cm −3 with artificial sweat. A system comprising 25 yarn-type TEPGs arranged in a series–parallel configuration is implemented utilizing the high spatial-efficiency of the sewable yarn-type TEPG. The results demonstrate the potential of wearable hydrovoltaic nanogenerators as next-generation renewable energy systems for wearable applications.},

  abstract     = {Incorporating conductive nanomaterials into polymers yields a new class of piezoresistive strain-sensing materials. While possessing monotonic resistance-strain behavior is a fundamental requirement for any material used for strain sensing, polymer nanocomposites frequently exhibit nonmonotonic resistance responses under strain, which limits their application prospects. In this study, physical experiments and molecular dynamics simulations are performed to determine a feasible solution to overcome this limitation. The corresponding results demonstrate that regulating the initial inter-nanofiller junction geometry imparts complete control over the monotonic piezoresistive behavior of polymer nanocomposites. Mechanistically, monotonically increasing resistance responses under tension can be achieved by promoting active diffusion that causes van der Waals force-driven barrier crossing of nanofillers (resulting in direct contact between nanofillers, e.g., at elevated curing temperatures) during curing; thus, during deformation, nanofillers primarily move away from one another. Conversely, suppressing diffusion during curing causes barrier crossing of nanofillers, which results in resistance reduction, under deformation owing to stress-driven local rearrangement of polymer molecules in heterogeneous shear transformation zones. The mechanistic insights provided by this study can guide the design of next-generation, advanced strain-sensing materials in the future.},

However, while Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) 2 mediated H3K27me3 clearly contributes to the formation of repressive chromatin loops in Arabidopsis , the role of PRC1 mediated H2Aub remains unclear. Notably, in the Arabidopsis genome, H2Aub and H3K27me3 marks do not always co-localize, and some regions are marked exclusively by H2Aub, but the contribution of these only-H2Aub regions to chromatin looping remains largely unexplored. By using Capture-High-throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture (C-Hi-C) to specifically enrich interactions associated with H2Aub regions, it is find that H2Aub loops are preferentially established between two H2Aub enriched regions. Although pure only-H2Aub-loops can be detected, H2Aub regions tend to interact with regions marked by both H2Aub and H3K27me3, contributing to the formation of PcG hubs. Furthermore, it is find that maintaining appropriate level of H2Aub and H3K27me3 is essential for the stability of H2Aub loops and that the formation of these loops reinforce gene repression. This findings unveil the existence of H2Aub loops in Arabidopsis and their impact on transcriptional regulation.},

Without confirming the identifiability of these parameters, model predictions may be unreliable, limiting their usefulness for understanding biological mechanisms or informing experimental and clinical decisions. In this paper, a novel mathematical framework is proposed for practical identifiability analysis in dynamic models. Starting from a rigorous mathematical definition, it is proved that practical identifiability is equivalent to the invertibility of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). The relationship between practical identifiability and coordinate identifiability is further established, introducing an efficient metric that simplifies and accelerates identifiability assessment compared to traditional profile likelihood methods. To address non-identifiable parameters, new regularization terms are incorporated, enabling uncertainty quantification and improving model reliability. Additionally, an optimal experimental design algorithm is developed to ensure all parameters are practically identifiable from collected data. Applications to Hill functions, neural networks, and biological models demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed framework in uncovering critical biological processes and identifying key observable variables.},

This study introduces AntiBMPNN, an advanced deep-learning framework that leverages an antibody-specific 3D dataset, a fine-tuned message-passing neural network (MPNN), a frequency-based scoring function, and AlphaFold 3 to achieve highly accurate antibody sequence design. AntiBMPNN surpasses ProteinMPNN with a perplexity of 1.5 and over 80% sequence recovery. Its scoring function, combined with AlphaFold 3, effectively prioritizes sequences based on structural recovery, positional stability, and biochemical or complex properties. Experimental validation highlights a 75% success rate in single-point antibody design. AntiBMPNN consistently outperforms AbMPNN, AntiFold, and ProteinMPNN in designing complementarity determining regions (CDR) 1-3, yielding stronger binding affinities. For CDR1 of huJ3 (anti-HIV nanobody), it achieves a half maximal effective concentration (EC₅₀) of 9.2 nM (nanomolar), better than ProteinMPNN (135.2 nM) and AntiFold (59.3 nM), and comparable to AbMPNN (6.6 nM). For CDR2 of the D6 nanobody (targeting CD16), AntiBMPNN reaches 0.3 nM, outperforming AbMPNN (2.3 nM), AntiFold (0.7 nM), and ProteinMPNN (0.7 nM). In CDR3 of huJ3, it achieves 1.7 nM, surpassing AbMPNN (51.2 nM), with no detectable activity from AntiFold or ProteinMPNN. These findings confirm that AntiBMPNN-designed sequences for J3 and D6 outperform the originals, highlighting its potential to improve therapeutic antibody design.},

The creation and control of pore size and interconnectivity can be conveniently achieved with aqueous two-phase emulsions. The decomposition of these emulsions into two separate phases can be controlled by carefully choosing the polymer components and solution conditions. Spinodal decomposition, a mechanism of phase separation, can result in a highly interconnected pore morphology, though controlling this process is difficult in practice, limiting its application for in vitro models. Here, a straightforward method is introduced for dynamically halting the phase separation of a gelatin methacryloyl and poly(vinyl alcohol) (GelMA-PVA) polymer blend in the context of a biofabrication process based on dynamic interface printing (DIP). This is enabled by a novel approach based on the concerted application of acoustic mixing and photocuring to structure the pore size, orientation, and interconnectivity in hydrogels. This approach accordingly enables spatially addressable fabrication of 3D hydrogel architectures, with the potential to enhance the functionality of engineered tissues via tailored microenvironments.},

  abstract     = {Food-grade lipid nanoparticles (FLNs) have been widely used as functional carriers of various nutrients and clinical drugs; however, the potential for FLNs to induce substantial biological effects is often overlooked. Here, it is found that FLNs are first delivered to the early endosomes and then preferentially fused with lipid droplets (LDs) after entering the cells through endocytosis. This process leads to a notable LDs accumulation, which in turn triggers autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway. The cascade ultimately promotes tumor cell growth and invasion. However, autophagy inhibition while FLNs treatment counteracts these effects and further causes mitochondria damage, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and excessive LDs accumulation, eventually leading to cell apoptosis. This indicates a potential anti-tumor strategy. The animal tests further demonstrate that intratumoral injection of FLNs together with an autophagy inhibitor (3-MA) effectively suppresses tumor angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis without harming normal cells in mice, confirming a promising and safe anti-tumor strategy of applying FLNs under autophagy inhibition conditions. The findings represent a substantial step forward in comprehending the biological effects of biomedical carriers.},

Consequently, the development of suitable intratumoral microbiota analysis methods is crucial. Although matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) involves straightforward operations and provides precise results, the “direct smear method” limits the identification of bacterial subspecies. Furthermore, the issue of inadequate quantification with MALDI MS renders it unsuitable for direct analysis of intratumoral bacteria. To address these challenges, a novel ionic liquid in this study is employed, called norharmane conjugated to 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Nor@DHB) for the direct detection of intratumoral bacteria using MALDI MS. Because gram-negative bacteria are dominant within cancer cells, lipid A is selected as the chemical fingerprint for bacterial identification. The results demonstrated that using Nor@DHB can enhance the lipid A signal by an order of magnitude and achieved a good linear relationship within a concentration range of 0.01–80 ng mL −1 . Here, this method is successfully applied to the direct analysis of lipid A in actual clinical samples. Subsequent machine learning and nomogram models further confirmed the correlation between characteristic lipid A ions and LC patient clinicopathological features, which are further validated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments.},

Genetic ablation of Gal3 globally or specifically in macrophages, as well as pharmacological inhibition of Gal3, significantly attenuated kidney fibrosis in diabetic mice.

For example, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) utilize D- and F-motifs, which frequently act in concert to enable bipartite substrate binding. While these motifs are known to modulate phosphorylation efficiency, their quantitative impact on target site phosphorylation within long intrinsically disordered substrates remains largely unexplored. Using NMR spectroscopy, JNK1-dependent phosphorylation of JIP1, a 450-amino acid disordered substrate, is investigated, identifying eleven phosphosites with distinct phosphorylation efficiencies. By selectively disrupting JNK1 binding to the D- and F-motifs of JIP1, the determinants of phosphorylation efficiency are uncovered. Specifically, it is found that the D-motif selectively enhances phosphorylation in the C-terminal direction in a length-dependent manner, impressively increasing the phosphorylation efficiencies of sites located at sequence distances exceeding 120 amino acids, while the F-motif primarily promotes phosphorylation of a site located immediately N-terminal to the F-motif. Additionally, docking-site-independent phosphorylation is observed, whose efficiency is dictated by the intrinsic sequence preference of JNK1, as inferred from motif scores derived from positional scanning peptide arrays. The work highlights how docking site motifs and sequence context synergistically regulate phosphorylation efficiency, emphasizing the critical role of substrate architecture in determining MAPK-mediated signaling outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant advances in the synthesis of biomimetic materials, the scalable fabrication of high-performance bulk materials under ambient conditions remains a formidable challenge— particularly when it comes to achieving rapid processing while preserving superior mechanical properties. Herein, inspired by nacre's “brick-and-mortar” structure, this work develops an energy-efficient approach that utilizes ice-templating technology as the structure framework and carbon mineralization for rapid CaCO 3 production, resulting in a strong yet tough carbon mineralized material (CMM) while also fixing CO 2 . This material replicates both the hierarchical microstructure and chemical composition of nacre. By precisely controlling the freezing dynamics with dual temperature gradients, this work creates an ordered lamellar skeleton composed of γ-dicalcium silicate (γ-C 2 S). The rapid, in situ carbon mineralization under mild conditions generates interspersed CaCO 3 grains within this structure, which are then infiltrated with gelatin to form a nacre-like CMM with exceptional mechanical properties. The resulting material exhibits a flexural strength of 45 MPa (eight times that of a cement-hydrogel composite) and a fracture toughness of 2.03 MJ m −3 (a 20-fold improvement over unmodified CMM), while maintaining a density of only 1.2 g cm −3 . The enhanced performance stems from multiscale toughening mechanisms, including crack deflection, secondary crack formation, and strong interfacial bonding, all of which facilitate efficient energy dissipation. This work establishes a new paradigm for designing high-performance synthetic materials through the synergistic integration of biomimetic principles with carbon mineralization, offering promising applications in the development of sustainable infrastructure and carbon neutrality.},

  abstract     = {Effective management of postoperative pain and wound healing presents significant challenges in clinical settings, driving the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. The analgesic and wound healing effects of hydrogen (H 2 ) have gradually been recognized; however, the lack of efficient hydrogen delivery systems remains a major limitation. This study introduces a novel transdermal drug delivery system, which utilizes sustained-release photothermal microneedles (MNs) to ameliorate incisional pain and accelerate wound healing. Polydopamine (PDA)-modified ZIF-8@ammonia borane (AB) nanoparticles with photothermal conversion properties are designed, along with temperature-responsive QX-314-loaded polycaprolactone (PCL) microspheres for controlled release, which are delivered in vivo by dissolvable MNs. In vitro results showed that PDA@ZIF-8@AB nanoparticles can release H 2 continuously for up to 5 days in an acidic microenvironment, while the photothermal properties of PDA facilitated controlled release of QX-314 through 6 cycles of near-infrared (NIR) exposure. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the MN system provided sustained analgesia for up to 5 days and promoted wound healing in the acidic microenvironment of postoperative incisions. Upon NIR exposure, the photothermal conversion of PDA activated membrane ion channels and induced thermally triggered deformation of PCL@QX-314 microspheres, allowing for on-demand release of QX-314 and targeted neuronal uptake, thus offering personalized analgesia. In vitro cell experiments and in vivo studies confirmed the biocompatibility of the system. This innovative approach not only highlights the dual role of H 2 in pain relief and wound healing but also provides a new personalized treatment strategy for postoperative pain management with promising clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {Radiotherapy-radiodynamic therapy (RT-RDT) has emerged as a promising approach due to its remarkable anticancer efficacy. However, hypoxic tumor microenvironment and insufficient energy deposition severely reduce the radiotherapy outcomes. Herein, lonidamine (LND)-loaded Fe(III) metal-Pt(II) porphyrin framework (FPTM-LP) is designed for radiosensitization through hypoxia alleviation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) amplification. Specifically, the high-Z element Pt effectively absorbs X-ray photons to generate •OH for RT while transferring X-ray energy to porphyrin (TCPP), which stimulates the generation of 1 O 2 for RDT. Moreover, by the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, the weak acidity and glutathione (GSH)-responsive release of LND achieves O 2 economization, which promotes the generation of ROS and stabilizes DNA damage. Intriguingly, Pt(II)TCPP exhibits the capability of O 2 concentration-dependent near infrared luminescence imaging-guided RT-RDT. Moreover, the decomposition of FPTM-LP under high concentration of GSH generates large amounts of Fe 2+ , leading to the augmented production of •OH via Fenton reactions. In brief, this work presents a radiosensitizer with a unique and efficient mechanism of self-monitoring hypoxia alleviation and increasing ROS levels for enhanced cancer RT-RDT. The radiosensitization potency of FPTM-LP is confirmed in tumor-bearing mice in vivo, proclaiming a new strategy for enhancing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing side effects.},

  abstract     = {Carbon dots (CDs) have elicited attention in photodynamic antimicrobial applications, but their susceptibility to aggregation limits their effectiveness. Herein, CDs@ZIF-8 nanocomposites are synthesized. The results reveal that they have superior dual photodynamic enhanced antimicrobial properties, specifically 7.63 log 10 CFU mL −1 (lg) elimination for Escherichia coli (only 3.12 lg with CDs and 4.18 lg with ZIF-8) and 7.27 lg elimination for Staphylococcus aureus (only 4.17 lg with CDs and 2.94 lg with ZIF-8). Optoelectronic property analysis and density functional theory calculations show that the enhanced photodynamic antimicrobial properties of CDs@ZIF-8 can be attributed to their narrow bandgap and higher binding affinity for O 2 , which facilitates the photo-generated e − –h + pairs separation and promotes the generation of 1 O 2 and •O 2 − . Furthermore, the CDs@ZIF-8/polycaprolactone/ethyl cellulose nanofibrous films are prepared by microfluidic-blow-spinning, which have prominent antimicrobial properties and extend the shelf life of strawberries from 6 to 12 d. Overall, this study provides a novel idea for designing synergistically enhanced photodynamic antimicrobial materials and photodynamic preservation of perishable fruits.},

Herein, a bipolar conjugated donor-acceptor (D-A) polymer (PTZ-Pz) is designed and synthesized with the co-storage of opposite ions by utilizing the electron-donating phenothiazine (PTZ) unit and the electron-withdrawing phenazine (Pz) unit as the building blocks. It demonstrates that the continuously alternate storage of anions and cations can facilitate the charge transfer processes and thereby accelerate the reaction dynamic of the PTZ-Pz cathode. Consequently, the D-A polymer PTZ-Pz shows a high specific capacity of 208 mAh g −1 . The electrode exhibits an ultra-long cyclability of more than 80 000 cycles, with an excellent rate performance of 116 mAh g −1 at 20 A g −1 . Benefiting from the fast kinetics, the PTZ-Pz cathode can operate well at a high mass loading of 44.2 mg cm −2 . The enhanced energy and power density via alternate storage anions and cations mode may facilitate the exploration of new electrode materials for aluminum batteries.},

  abstract     = {Red mark syndrome (RMS) is a disease affecting rainbow trout. Although the precise etiology of this disease is still under debate, a Midichloria-like organism (MLO) is suspected as the triggering agent. RMS provokes characteristic skin lesions. Previous investigations pointed to a local immune response characterized by a B cell influx. To elaborate on these findings, here, this study extensively characterizes systemic and local B cell responses in RMS-affected fish. The local influx of IgM+ B cells to the skin lesions is confirmed, and a differentiation of these B cells to plasma-like cells is demonstrated. IgM repertoires suggested a polyclonal activation of local B cells and some trafficking between skin and head kidney. Finally, the fact that transcripts of the gene coding for MLO 16S rRNA are found in sorted skin IgM + B cells and non-IgM + skin leukocytes reveals the capacity of this intracellular bacterium to be internalized by B cells, where it may possibly directly interfere with intracellular pathways. The data significantly advances the knowledge on RMS and provides another example of a fish pathology in which fish B cells seem pivotal, possibly because of the specific ways in which teleost B cells intrinsically sense and respond to pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Obesity is increasingly recognized as a negative prognostic factor for cancers, including osteosarcoma. However, the mechanisms linking obesity to chemoresistance in osteosarcoma remain unclear. This study found obesity is significantly associated with poor responses to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in osteosarcoma patients. In vitro, adipocyte-conditioned medium (Adi-CM) induced cisplatin resistance, while peritumoral adipocytes and diet-induced obesity (DIO) reduce the cisplatin efficacy in vivo. Mechanistically, Adi-CM enhanced DNA repair by the PARP1/ATM pathway activation. Proteomic analysis identified A1BG, a secreted protein upregulated in adipocytes from chemoresistant patients, as a key mediator of this effect. A1BG depletion in adipocytes restored cisplatin sensitivity, whereas recombinant A1BG enhanced resistance and promoted DNA repair. Further investigation revealed a direct interaction between A1BG and NAMPT, leading to the stabilization of NAMPT and an increased NAD + production. This enhanced PARP1 activity and subsequent DNA repair. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of NAMPT and PARP1 using FK886 and Olaparib, respectively, reversed Adi-CM-induced cisplatin resistance and restored cisplatin sensitivity in osteosarcoma cells, DIO mouse models, and patient-derived organoids. A novel link between obesity and cisplatin resistance in osteosarcoma is established, highlighting the A1BG/NAMPT/PARP1 axis as a critical driver. Targeting this axis may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for overcoming obesity-associated chemoresistance in osteosarcoma.},

  abstract     = {Endothelial dysfunction and abnormal activation of the monocyte-macrophage system form a critical loop in atherosclerosis. The role of migrasomes in endothelial-immune interactions remains unclear. This study explores migrasome evolution in the atherosclerotic (AS) microenvironment, highlighting their function as amplifiers in the inflammatory cascade. Through analysis of ApoE −/- mouse models and single-cell multi-omics data, migrasome activity is mapped using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) algorithms. Co-culture systems and anti-Cluster of differentiation 74 (CD74) blocking experiments are employed to investigate immune-metabolic reprogramming triggered by migrasome cargo signaling. Advanced imaging and functional studies demonstrated that the interaction between amyloid protein precursor (APP) ligands on endothelial cells and CD74 receptors on macrophages triggers endothelial cells to produce more migrasomes. The clinical relevance of these findings is confirmed through CD74 blocking experiments, which effectively disrupted migrasome-mediated signaling and attenuated atherosclerotic progression. Importantly, migrasome content is positively correlated with the severity of atherosclerosis. These results fundamentally challenge existing paradigms of intercellular communication by establishing migrasomes as dual-functional entities – serving both as biomarkers of endothelial stress and molecular drivers of immune microenvironment deterioration. The discovery of the “migrasome-APP-CD74” signaling network opens new avenues for developing organelle-targeted therapies to interrupt the vicious cycle of vascular inflammation.},

  abstract     = {Inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) is a key transcriptional regulator involved in the development of various cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the mechanisms regulating ID1 ubiquitination in ESCC are not well understood. This study identifies TRIM21 as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets ID1 for K11-linked ubiquitination at lysine 91. Unlike typical ubiquitination that marks proteins for degradation, TRIM21-mediated K11 ubiquitination does not affect ID1 stability. Instead, it disrupts the ID1-TCF12 interaction, releasing TCF12 to activate SLC31A1, a copper transporter. Elevated SLC31A1 expression increases intracellular copper, inducing cuproptosis and inhibiting ESCC cell proliferation and tumor growth. Functional assays show that overexpressing TRIM21 suppresses ESCC progression, while TRIM21 knockdown promotes growth. Clinically, low TRIM21 expression correlates with advanced disease stage and poorer patient survival rate, underscoring its prognostic value. Additionally, Sorafenib treatment upregulates TRIM21, enhancing ID1 ubiquitination, increasing SLC31A1 expression, and inducing cuproptosis. These findings uncover the TRIM21-ID1-TCF12-SLC31A1 axis as a critical pathway in ESCC progression, suggesting that targeting this axis with Sorafenib can offer a promising therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor growth and improving patient outcomes.},

Immunotherapy has emerged as a crucial treatment modality for OSCC LNM, yet its limited response rate severely restricts its clinical application.

Herein, a metal-organic framework (MOF) nanodrug loaded with orlistat (ORL) is developed, designated as ORL@Cu-MOF. This nanodrug is designed to respond and release under the high glutathione (GSH) stimulus of the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby inducing cuproptosis and suppressing fatty acid metabolism in OSCC cells. In vivo, ORL@Cu-MOF effectively triggers cuproptosis and inhibits fatty acid metabolism, exerting antitumor effects in mouse models and remodeling the TME. Furthermore, the combination of ORL@Cu-MOF with programmed death receptor-1 (αPD-1) significantly enhances immunotherapy outcomes, transforming “cold tumors” into “hot tumors”.

  abstract     = {Optimizing the morphology of the active layer is crucial for achieving high photovoltaic conversion efficiency in all-polymer solar cells (APSCs). Solvent vapor annealing (SVA) is an essential post-treatment strategy for controlling active layer morphology. However, most current SVA are conducted ex situ, limiting their ability to accurately reveal the morphological evolution of active layers of APSCs. In this study, in situ synchrotron radiation GIWAXS and in situ UV–vis spectroscopy combined with GISAXS is used to monitor the morphological evolution of PM6/PY-IT blends during the SVA process in real-time. Results showed that the PY-IT absorption peak exhibited a red shift under a nonpolar carbon disulfide vapor, while a blue shift is observed during the SVA process with a polar chloroform vapor. The SVA process can be divided into three stages: solvent swelling, recrystallization, and molecular rearrangement. For thermally pre-annealed samples subjected to chloroform SVA, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased by 15.1%. The improved PCE stems from reduced crystal plane spacing (d-spacing), enhanced crystal coherence length, and optimal phase separation via SVA. Pre-annealing suppresses excessive swelling, emphasizing the reordering dynamical role in the morphology of APSCs. This study offers insights into balancing SVA conditions to maximize performance and minimize adverse effects.},

  abstract     = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from a breakdown in the symbiotic relationship between the intestinal commensal microflora and the mucosal immune system. Non-toxigenic Bacteroides fragilis , a common human colon symbiote, has been shown to alleviate colitis. However, the underlying mechanisms of this alleviation remain incompletely understood. Herein, it is demonstrated that promoting the secretion of B. fragilis outer membrane vesicles (Bf OMVs+ ) enhances its ability to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, while inhibiting B. fragilis OMV secretion (Bf OMVs− ) reduces this effect. Bf OMVs+ alleviates colitis by inhibiting neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. Further, B. fragilis OMVs (Bf-OMVs) are isolated and extracted, then administered them intraperitoneally to DSS-induced colitis mice, observing that Bf-OMVs can target intestinal tissues, the spleen, and bone marrow, and they are internalized by neutrophils to inhibit NET formation, thereby alleviating colitis. The expression profile of miRNAs in Bf-OMVs is assessed, revealing that Bf-OMVs are enriched with mmu-miR-like sRNA, miR-5119, which targets and inhibits PD-L1, leading to the suppression of GSDMD-mediated NET release and promoting the proliferation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), culminating in the alleviation of colitis. These findings provide new insights into the role of B. fragilis OMVs in the pathogenesis and treatment of IBD.},

  abstract     = {The interaction between SCAF4 and RNA polymerase II (POLR2A) is crucial for proper mRNA termination, with its dysregulation leading to truncated mRNAs and nonfunctional proteins, impairing cellular growth. Despite its potential relevance, the role of this interaction in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unexplored due to the lack of effective molecular tools. To address this, we employed SRiApt, an aptamer generated through the recently established Blocker-SELEX pipeline. Its biological stability is improved by phosphorothioate modifications to form PT f -SRiApt. Using this aptamer, the critical role of the SCAF4-POLR2A interaction in driving TNBC tumor growth and immune regulation is uncovered. PT f -SRiApt effectively inhibits tumor growth and induces cell cycle arrest in TNBC cells with elevated SCAF4 and POLR2A expression. Additionally, PT f -SRiApt promotes premature mRNA termination, boosting antigen presentation and promoting T-cell infiltration. Analysis of patient samples further confirmed the negative correlation between SCAF4-POLR2A interaction and the effectiveness of immunotherapy, highlighting the potential of PT f -SRiApt in improving immune efficacy. Together, the work provides a powerful tool not only for dissecting previously “undruggable” protein-protein interactions but also for enhancing tumor immunogenicity and reshaping the tumor microenvironment.},

The suction cup component is crafted from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel, while the MN section, embedded within the suction cup, comprises a thermoresponsive and antibacterial composite hydrogel infused with the drug S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). This innovative design not only ensures strong adhesion to moist surfaces but also provides substantial antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, controlled drug release, active promotion of concentric wound contraction, and enhanced vasodilation, thereby facilitating rapid and comprehensive healing of BIS.

  abstract     = {Given that sleep and pain are bidirectionally related, we investigated the neural circuits underlying pain-induced sleep disturbances using two acute pain models. Activation of nociceptors in acute inflammatory pain (AIP) significantly reduced sleep by 45–50% in the first 6 h, with reduced sleep spindle density for 1–3 h post-AIP. Additionally, an “optogenetic pain (Opto-Pain)” model is implemented to produce acute peripheral pain-induced awakenings that reduced sleep comparable to AIP. Both pain models are used to test the role of wake-promoting neurons in the parabrachial nucleus that express Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (PBel CGRP ) in relaying nociceptive stimulus from the dorsal horn as part of the spine-ponto-amygdaloid tract. Blocking PBel CGRP neurons with genetic ablation or optogenetic inhibition attenuated sleep loss. To dissect the PBel CGRP pathways, the terminals are then optogenetically silenced post-AIP and found the reversal of sleep disturbances in the following descending order of effectiveness: substantia innominata of the basal forebrain (SI-BF) > central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) > bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) > the lateral hypothalamus (LH). In SI-BF and CeA, a similar reversal of AIP-induced sleep loss occurred with pharmacological blocking of either CGRP or NMDA receptors. The results are relevant to emerging pain therapies aiming to attenuate sleep disturbances.},

  abstract     = {Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a crucial role in tumor progression within the tumor microenvironment (TME) through phenotypic plasticity and functional modulation. While tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) mediate intercellular communication, their role in shaping TAMs phenotypes and function remains unclear. This study explores how TNTs facilitate the transfer of tumor-derived materials, particularly fatty acids, to TAMs, affecting macrophage polarization and function. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified heterogeneous macrophage subpopulations in the TME. Enrichment analysis pinpointed key substances transferred via TNTs. Lipidomics and metabolomics analyzed the fatty acids involved. In vitro and in vivo experiments validated TNTs-mediated material transfer, and transcriptomic analysis revealed the associated signaling pathways. TNTs are the primary route for transferring tumor-derived fatty acids, notably arachidonic acid (AA), to macrophages. This transfer reprogrammed TAMs from anti-tumor CD5L + to pro-tumor TREM2 + phenotypes, increasing CCL18 secretion, reducing phagocytic activity, and impairing CD8 + T cell proliferation. Mechanistically, AA activated the PI3K-AKT pathway, driving TAMs polarization. These findings are confirmed in xenograft models, where TNTs-induced TAMs exhibited enhanced pro-tumor properties. TNTs-mediated transfer of tumor-derived AA reprograms TAMs via PI3K-AKT activation, promoting immune suppression and tumor progression, highlighting TNTs and PI3K-AKT as potential therapeutic targets in iCCA.},

  abstract     = {Pulmonary vascular remodeling, which current therapeutic targets fail to alleviate disease severity, plays a key role in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Irisin is identified as a protective factor involved in regulating inflammation and oxidative stress, but its role in PAH remains unknown. To investigate, plasma irisin levels and its local pulmonary artery expression are measured in patients with PAH and mouse models. Irisin expression is significantly decreased in patients with PAH and PAH mouse models. Furthermore, overexpression and exogenous injection of irisin effectively alleviate hemodynamic and right-heart function in PAH mouse models, meanwhile, it also reverses proliferation and cell cycle progression of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). To illustrate the mechanism of irisin exerts on PAH, Enolase 1 is identified as a key irisin-interacting protein. Irisin suppresses proliferation of PDGF-induced PASMCs by promoting ubiquitination status of Enolase 1 via E3 ligase of down regulated protein 4 in neural precursor cell development. Co-immunoprecipitation and molecular docking analyses verifies the interaction and binding sites between irisin and its interactive proteins. Overall, these findings suggest that, irisin is a novel protective factor downregulated in PAH. By ubiquitination, irisin promotes Enolase 1 degradation and suppresses cell proliferation and pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH.},
