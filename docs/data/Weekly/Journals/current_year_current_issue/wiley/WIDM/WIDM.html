  abstract     = {The global rise in fatty liver diseases is alarming. Traditional diagnostic methods include ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, and liver biopsies, the latter being the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have enhanced liver biopsy accuracy, improving treatment outcomes. This study investigates how various AI techniques aid histopathologists, gastroenterologists, and liver specialists in diagnosing and assessing liver damage due to abnormal fat accumulation. We conducted a systematic review of AI applications in evaluating fatty liver diseases, particularly through histopathological image analysis. Our search encompassed five scientific databases: PubMed Central, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Google Scholar. We focused on peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, theses, and book chapters, adhering to specific terminology. The data synthesis followed the PRISMA guidelines, comparing literature based on four key indices and their annual distribution. We evaluated 37 studies utilizing histopathological imaging for the diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, including related conditions, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. The review summarized the performance of various algorithms and explored the distribution of machine learning efforts. Given the complexity of histopathological images, AI algorithms can effectively stratify liver samples affected by fat. Our findings indicate that AI's diagnostic performance closely matches traditional pathological interpretations, offering reliable results for clinical applications.

  abstract     = {Machine learning models often face significant challenges while dealing with imbalanced and unlabeled datasets. Addressing these issues is resource-intensive, requiring comprehensive strategies to navigate their individual complexities and compounded effects. This article explores the dual challenges imposed by class imbalance and the absence of labeled data, along with their individual complexities and combined effects on the performance of the model. This study addresses approaches for handling the imbalance problem in datasets, such as data-level, algorithm-level, and deep learning methods. The survey also examines hybrid methodologies that integrate these strategies to tackle the compounded issues effectively. Emerging techniques like Bayesian graph-based learning, uncertainty-guided semi-supervised learning, and self-supervised approaches are also considered for their potential to address the scalability, noise filtering, and generalization challenges associated with imbalanced and unlabeled datasets. It identified persistent gaps, such as the lack of robust evaluation metrics and the underutilization of dynamic feature extraction techniques, suggesting solutions with advanced machine learning approaches. Additionally, the need for adaptive techniques, such as dynamic class weighting and data-driven filtering mechanisms, is highlighted to address limitations and improve the scalability of machine learning models in real-world applications.

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of feature extraction (FE) methods across all major signal processing domains and various types of BCIs, addressing a significant gap in existing reviews and surveys that often focus exclusively on EEG-based systems. Also, a detailed comparative analysis of FE techniques, highlighting their formulas, advantages, limitations, and practical applications, is provided. The study not only reviews state-of-the-art methods but also evaluates recent research, identifying trends and gaps in the field. Key insights reveal a growing foundation for invasive BCI research, which, while currently limited, shows promise for future advancements. Based on this analysis, we identify and discuss open challenges such as inter-subject variability, real-time processing demands, integration of multiple modalities, and user training and adaptation. Additionally, we examine pressing concerns related to security, privacy, and the transferability of models.

  abstract     = {Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a vital technology for remote healthcare, offering non-invasive and accessible health monitoring through off-the-shelf standard video cameras. rPPG facilitates the assessment of key health indicators like heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) from video data, providing advantages in early disease diagnosis and routine health assessments. Recognizing its potential, researchers from multiple fields have substantially progressed rPPG by establishing a strong theoretical basis for signal acquisition and developing signal processing and data-driven algorithms for rPPG extraction. While most rPPG reviews primarily focus on HR signal extraction methods, our research provides an overview of the potential scope of rPPG. We systematically organize research on rPPG signal acquisition and extraction techniques and provide a critical review of recent rPPG advancements in diverse health parameter estimation. Besides providing a thorough HR estimation review, we incorporate the extraction of derivative signals such as RR and SpO 2 from rPPG data, including their applications and limitations. We also highlight the adaptation of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Computer Vision (CV) techniques with rPPG technologies, and accumulate available critical rPPG resources like datasets, codes, and tutorials. Finally, we identify challenges and research gaps, such as motion artifacts, varying lighting conditions, and differences in skin tone. We aim to uplift advancements in rPPG systems by outlining future research directions.

The proliferation of crowdsourcing has made it much simpler to utilize the intelligence and adaptability of many people to learn new knowledge to solve the problem of acquiring new knowledge.

This concentrated survey provides a comprehensive review of the technical advances from a systematic perspective. This survey systematically reviews technical advances for a crowdsourcing process that contains four dimensions: task modeling, crowdsourcing data acquisition, the learning process, and predictive model learning, and proposes a comprehensive and scalable framework from CROWD4AI (Crowdsourcing Framework with 4 Dimensions for Artificial Intelligence). In addition, this paper focuses on each dimension's potential challenges and future direction, encouraging researchers to participate in crowdsourcing. To bridge theory with practice, we also include a detailed case study that demonstrates the real-world application of our proposed framework in the context of annotating cultural heritage damages using crowdsourced input.

Understanding consumers' power demands ahead of time and the influences of weather on consumption and generation can help producers generate effective power management plans to support the target demand. In addition to the high correlation with the environment, consumers' behaviors also cause non-stationary characteristics of energy data, which is the main challenge for energy prediction. In this survey, we perform a review of the literature on prediction methods in the energy field. So far, most of the available research encompasses one type of generation or consumption. There is no research approaching prediction in the energy sector as a whole and its correlated features. We propose to address the energy prediction challenges from both consumption and generation sides, encompassing techniques from statistical to machine learning techniques. We also summarize the work related to energy prediction, electricity measurements, challenges related to energy consumption and generation, energy forecasting methods, and real-world energy forecasting resources, such as datasets and software solutions for energy prediction.

  abstract     = {Forecasting soil moisture is critical for keeping groundwater levels stable, monitoring droughts, and assisting agricultural productivity. Surface soil moisture has a tremendous impact on both the environment and society. To provide proper soil moisture, the right tools are required. Gravimetric, physical, and empirical models produce reliable results, but they are generally context-dependent and inappropriate for large-scale investigations. Remote sensing has developed as a credible technology for estimating large-scale soil moisture levels. However, various obstacles exist when getting soil moisture data using remote sensing, including the availability and precision of data sources. The spatial and temporal limits of many remote sensing sources, such as microwave and optical sensors, combined with environmental conditions, provide considerable feasibility issues. As a result, a robust model capable of accurately capturing both linear and nonlinear connections between multiple surface soil variables is critical. Recently, AI approaches have been identified as promising options for managing complicated factors in this domain. This review paper investigates the use of several AI algorithms for estimating soil moisture content (SMC). It focusses on AI-enabled frameworks built with remote sensing satellite imagery.

  abstract     = {Intracranial hemorrhage (IH) is a critical condition requiring rapid and accurate diagnosis to ensure effective treatment and reduce mortality rates. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) models have demonstrated significant potential in automating the detection and analysis of brain injuries in IH patients. However, the “black-box” nature of many AI systems raises concerns about transparency, reliability, and clinical applicability. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses these challenges by making AI models more interpretable, allowing healthcare professionals to understand and trust the decision-making processes. This review paper explores various XAI techniques—such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation (RISE), Class Activation Mapping (CAM), and its variants—and their specific applications in IH clinical tasks. We systematically examine studies incorporating XAI for curing IH patients, highlighting how these methods enhance model transparency and support clinical decision-making. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology was employed to select the papers. Studies are categorized into those using tabular data and those using image data. The literature indicates a rapidly growing number of XAI publications in this field. SHAP is the most commonly used XAI method for tabular data, while CAM-based methods, such as Grad-CAM, dominate in image-based applications. Furthermore, we discuss current limitations of XAI methods and future research directions. This review aims to provide researchers and clinicians with valuable insights into the role of XAI in improving the reliability and practical integration of AI-driven tools for IH patient care.

  abstract     = {Chronic diseases (CDs) present a global health challenge due to their complex, overlapping symptoms and the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Meta-Heuristic Optimization (MHO) algorithms, have emerged as powerful tools for addressing these challenges. This review examines ML and MHO-based approaches for the multi-classification of CDs, highlighting how MHO enhances ML frameworks by addressing key limitations such as class imbalance and suboptimal feature selection. Despite these advancements, MHO-based methods face challenges, including computational complexity and algorithmic biases, which require further research. By critically analyzing existing studies and identifying gaps, this paper provides a foundation for developing more robust and efficient diagnostic models for CDs.

  abstract     = {The success of social media platforms has facilitated the emergence of various forms of online abuse within digital communities. This abuse manifests in multiple ways, including hate speech, cyberbullying, emotional abuse, grooming, and shame sexting or sextortion. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the different forms of abuse prevalent in social media, with a particular focus on how emerging technologies, such as Language Models (LMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), are reshaping both the detection and generation of abusive content within these networks. We delve into the mechanisms through which social media abuse is perpetuated, exploring the psychological and social impact. To achieve this, we conducted a literature review based on PRISMA methodology, deriving key insights in the field of cyber abuse detection. Additionally, we examine the dual role of advanced language models—highlighting their potential to enhance automated detection systems for abusive behavior while also acknowledging their capacity to generate harmful content. This paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on online safety and ethics by offering both theoretical and practical insights into the evolving landscape of cyber abuse, as well as the technological innovations that simultaneously mitigate and exacerbate it. The findings support platform administrators and policymakers in developing more effective moderation strategies, conducting comprehensive risk assessments, and integrating AI responsibly to create safer digital environments.
