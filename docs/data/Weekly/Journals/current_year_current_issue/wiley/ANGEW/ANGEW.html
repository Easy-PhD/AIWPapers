  abstract     = {Particle-based photocatalysts for overall water splitting convert solar energy into hydrogen fuel without the use of any photovoltaic devices. As such they have the potential to revolutionize renewable energy production on Earth. While proven efficiencies have reached 1.1%, further improvements of photocatalyst technology depend on a better understanding of energy loss mechanisms on the individual particle level. Here, we conduct the first in operando photoelectrochemical measurements on individual micrometer-sized Al-doped SrTiO 3 /Rh 2–y Cr y O 3 photocatalyst particles. We find that the photocatalyst particles behave mainly as water oxidation photoanodes reaching up to 0.5 mA cm −2 at 0.8 V versus RHE and a photovoltage of ∼1.00 V under 4.7 mW cm −2 ultraviolet illumination. This proves that charge separation in the unbiased Al:SrTiO 3 /Rh 2–y Cr y O 3 catalyst is driven by a junction at the n-semiconductor-liquid contact. While O 2 is detected symmetrically around photocatalyst particles, uneven H 2 evolution profiles reflect an irregular Rh 2–y Cr y O 3 cocatalyst distribution. Additionally, the H 2 evolution activity varies significantly between different photocatalyst particles. This suggests that performance gains are possible by better controlling catalyst composition on the microscale.},

  abstract     = {Pillar[ n ]arenes are popular macrocycles used in various supramolecular systems and materials due to their unique host–guest properties and ease of synthesis. Their pillar shape originates from the cyclic arrangement of methylene-bridged hydroquinone groups. They usually exist in one of two conformations where all the hydroquinone rings are oriented in the same direction (left or right), which is the source of their planar chirality. However, the controlled formation of pillar[ n ]arenes with intermediate conformations, for example, where only one ring is inverted, remains a challenge. Here we show how mechanical force can be used to reach this elusive conformation via the force-induced flipping of a single hydroquinone ring in a pillar[5]arene-based rotaxane. We show that the flipping motion can be controlled with the shape of the stopper and the axle, as well as with the nature of the pillar[5]arene substituents. This flipping behavior acts as a mechanical damper by slowing the scission of the polymer under tension. These results show how mechanical force can be used to access synthetically challenging supramolecular architectures, and we anticipate that this new dampening mechanism will prove useful in the formation of tougher materials.},

  abstract     = {Efficient hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of the hydroxy groups (C─OH) in alcohol molecules has attracted substantial attention due to its importance in many research fields such as organic synthesis and biomass conversion. Photocatalytic C─OH direct HDO is a promising but challenging process because of the difficulty in C─O bond activation due to the higher bond energy and strong polarity. A polarity enhancement strategy is proposed and a WO 3- x catalyst possessing Lewis–Brønsted dual acid sites is developed to realize the direct HDO of alcohols under ambient conditions. The C─O bond is first heterolytic cleaved to produce the carbocation intermediate and then the carbocation will combine with a proton and photogenerated electrons to form a new C─H bond. The synergistic effect of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites plays a key role in promoting the C─O bond cleavage. A series of comparative experiments, spectral characterizations and DFT calculations were used to demonstrate this new photocatalytic HDO pathway. Different alcohols, including polyols, can be directly converted into corresponding alkanes over this system. The present work discloses a direct HDO process for the hydroxy groups in alcohols and provides a new horizon for the design of new photocatalytic systems.},

  abstract     = {The development of white circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs) faces a critical challenge in simultaneously achieving high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and large dissymmetry factors ( g ), due to the inherent trade-off between exciton utilization and chirality amplification. Herein, we propose an orthogonal architecture synergizing an achiral blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter with chiral orange assemblies to overcome this limitation. The chiral assemblies, featuring exceptional chiroptical activity (| g abs | = 0.95 and | g lum | = 0.85), are engineered as both photon-selective filters and emitters. When integrated with a blue TADF layer, this dual-layer design enables 100% internal quantum efficiency through TADF-enabled triplet harvesting and chiral amplification via selective absorption of blue photons with a specific polarization direction, generating amplified white circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). The resulting white CP-OLED (CIE: 0.31, 0.34) achieves a record | g EL | of 0.34 alongside an EQE max of 6.3%, demonstrating the unprecedented white CP-OLEDs when considering both EQE and g EL values. By optimizing the TADF doping ratio, a cool-white CP-OLED is realized with an EQE of 14.7% and | g EL | of 0.32. This work establishes a material orthogonal engineering to decouple exciton-chirality interdependencies, opening avenues for fabricating high-performance CPEL devices.},

  abstract     = {Zero-dimension (0D) organic-inorganic hybrid metal halides are highly attractive as smart responsive luminescent materials, but the multiple-mode luminescence switch is rarely achieved and intrinsic solvochromism mechanism is unclear. Herein, we report a yellowish-green-emitting (Me 3 BzN) 3 Sb 2 Cl 9 (Me 3 BzN: trimethylbenzyl ammonium) single crystal, revealing quadruple/triple-mode luminescence switch with rapid response time (<1 s) and excellent recyclability (≥ 100 cycles) when triggered by moderately-polar and strongly-polar solvents. Significantly, the intrinsic solvochromism mechanism is systematically proposed, of which the reversibly multiple-mode luminescence tuning is closely related to solvent polarity, the moderate polarity can lead to luminescence redshift from 560 to 670 nm due to the increase of dipole moment for inorganic polyhedron. Besides, the small molecular solvent with strong polarity can insert into crystal and form “host-guest” system, inducing single crystal-single crystal phase transformation with structural disorder and Sb-Sb distance variation. Owing to the unique multiple-mode luminescence adjustment performance, (Me 3 BzN) 3 Sb 2 Cl 9 displays potential candidate in solvent detection, safety monitoring and information encryption scenarios. These findings highlight the significance of solvent polarity and molecule volume on the dynamic luminescence adjustment and offer guidance for the development of new smart responsive 0D hybrid antimony halides in advanced optical switchable fields.},

However, synthesizing topologically complex architectures, particularly those with topological chirality, remains a significant challenge due to the lack of general methods for controlled entanglement. Herein, we report the stereoselective synthesis of a 24-metal-center topologically chiral [6]catenane featuring 18 crossings ( link), representing one of the most intricate MIMs constructed to date. This complex architecture was achieved in high yield (71%) via one-step coordination-driven self-assembly of 12 chiral semirigid bidentate ligands and 12 conjugated binuclear half-sandwich organometallic clips. Critically, chirality transfer from enantiopure ligands enabled exclusive formation of topological enantiomer pairs ( Rh-1 S / Rh-1 R ), each containing four topologically chiral stereogenic units—three cyclic [3]catenane components and one closed three-link chain component. The self-assembly is synergistically directed by integrated noncovalent interactions (sevenfold π–π stacking, hydrogen bonding, and solvophobic effects), as unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This design strategy, incorporating tailored noncovalent interaction sites in building blocks, provides a viable approach for synthesizing other structurally complex topologically chiral MIMs.},

  abstract     = {The rational design and synthesis of reliable binders is a big challenge to efficiently mitigate the severe volume change of silicon-based anodes for lithium ion batteries. Herein, we report a multidentate molecular anchoring strategy to construct a novel self-adaptive aqueous binder. This binder composes of robust 3D dynamic networks derived from the crosslinking of the freely-rotatable multidentate molecular anchor (2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)butyric acid, BHB) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) via dynamic hydrogen-mediated self-assembly, which effectively imparts the fabrication of high-strength Si/C anodes and achieves high areal capacities (6.13 mAh cm −2 ) under a high mass loading of 13 mg cm −2 . Furthermore, the dynamic and reversible adhesion and the efficient “net-to-point” bonding characteristic contribute to enhance structural and interfacial stability in the NCM811/Si/C full cells. Consequently, the cells demonstrate superior cyclability and electrochemical performance. Notably, this multidentate molecular anchoring strategy can be further extended to develop other BHB-derived self-adaptive binders (i.e., BHB/PVA and BHB/CMC) for the purpose of dynamic structure regulation. This work provides valuable insights into the judicious modulation of aqueous binders from the perspective of molecular chemistry and product engineering, paving the pathway for the design of auqeous binders for ultra-high-energy Si-based lithium-ion batteries.},

The R 3 Sn- moiety is faithfully delivered to the terminal C-atom, unless a propargylic or homo-propargylic ─OH or ─NH 2 group is present in the substrate, which (partly or fully) inverts the regiochemical course; this steering effect, however, can be switched off upon protection of the protic site. The trans -addition likely starts by insertion of the [Cp*FeCl] fragment into the R 3 Sn─H bond, followed by a migratory insertion of the ligated alkyne into the Fe─Sn unit of the Fe(IV) species thus formed. This “modified Chalk–Harrod” mechanism is manifested in a stannylative cyclization of 1,6-enyne derivatives, which has hardly any precedent either; a pathway via iron vinylidene intermediates can be excluded on the basis of deuterium labeling experiments.},

Herein, we construct tandem catalysts (M 4 /Ni 1 NC, M = Fe, Co, Cu, or Mn) by coupling tetranuclear metal clusters (M 4 ) with single-atom Ni sites on N-doped carbon (Ni 1 NC) to regulate *H supply. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the *H supply is governed by both thermodynamics and kinetic factors. The M 4 clusters provide the thermodynamic feasibility for *H supply for CO 2 activation. The *H supply rate in kinetic perspective is tuned by the K + -H 2 O ratio of interfacial water, determined by work function of the decorated M 4 clusters. The increased K + -H 2 O ratio can promote water dissociation to maintain optimal *H coverage for intermediate hydrogenation, whereas excessive *H accumulation triggers competitive hydrogen evolution. Therefore, a volcanic relationship was observed between the K + -H 2 O ratio and ECRR performance. Among these samples, Cu 4 /Ni 1 NC with moderate *H supply rate in kinetic exhibits exceptional ECRR performance, achieving >95% Faradaic efficiency for CO across a 0.8 V potential range (−0.2 to −1.0 V versus RHE) and industrial-relevant current densities (∼385 mA cm −2 at −1.0 V) in a flow cell.},

  abstract     = {Due to their exceptional nodal flexibility, anionocages are promising host molecules capable of mimicking the dynamic self-assembly and host–guest chemistry of proteins. However, their application has been limited by the challenges in constructing large internal cavities. Here, we present an effective strategy to overcome this limitation by enhancing node flexibility to improve both structural adaptability and guest encapsulation versatility. Specifically, anion coordination between a C 3 -symmetric tris-urea ligand ( L ) and an organophosphate, PhPO 4 2− ( A ), generates highly flexible nodes that enable adaptive self-assembly and the encapsulation of guests of unprecedented size. Crystal structures revealed that the same ligand and anion can form three geometrically distinct anionocages ( A 4 L 4 tetrahedron 1 , A 6 L 6 trigonal antiprism 2 , and A 6 L 8 octahedron 3 ), with cavity sizes ranging from 0.208 to 1.320 nm 3 . In solution, controlled interconversions among the three anionocages can be achieved by modulating the guest template, A / L ratio, and concentration. These nanoscale cavities successfully encapsulate the luminescent metal complex, [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2 ⁺ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine), resulting in a ∼5-fold increase in quantum yield, and a ∼2-fold increase in lifetime. Moreover, circularly polarized luminescence of racemic [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2 ⁺ is induced via chirality transfer using a chiral-anion-directed octahedral cage ( 4 ) as the host.},

However, systematically correlating inorganic polyhedra configurations with emission characteristics remains challenging. Herein, we address this by synthesizing a homologous series of copper(I) iodides templated solely by the [C 13 H 24 N] + cation. Precise control reaction conditions yielded distinct inorganic polyhedral configurations, monomeric [CuI 3 ] 2− ( 1 ), dimeric [Cu 2 I 4 ] 2− ( 2 ), trimeric [Cu 3 I 6 ] 3− ( 3 ), and tetrameric [Cu 4 I 6 ] 2− ( 4 ). We establish a direct correlation where increasing inorganic aggregation systematically reduces the bandgap and dictates the luminescence color across a near-full visible spectrum, from blue ( 1 ) to cyan ( 2 ), red ( 3 ), and yellow ( 4 ). Detailed spectroscopic and theoretical analyses reveal the self-trapped excitons emission mechanism dependent on the Cu-I configuration, in which the closed [Cu 4 I 6 ] 2− configuration is more resistant to excited lattice deformation, thereby resulting in a lowest Stokes shift energy. Furthermore, stimuli-responsive sequential phase transitions between these well-defined structures were demonstrated, offering insights into their structural dynamics. This work provides critical fundamental understanding of how inorganic framework engineering within a fixed organic host precisely controls both electronic structure and excited-state relaxation pathways in hybrid copper(I) halides, paving the way for rational design of materials with tailored optical properties.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous Mg-ion batteries (AMIBs) have attracted increasing interest due to their safety, fast kinetics, and sustainability. However, the development of AMIBs is hindered by the narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) of electrolytes and electrode degradation. Here, a synergistic strategy, regulating both electrolyte and electrode structures, is proposed to enable high-performance AMIBs. Incorporating a polyethylene glycol crowding agent into Mg(ClO 4 ) 2 /H 2 O electrolyte regulates the solvation structure, which suppresses hydrogen evolution, and expands the ESW beyond 3.1 V. Meanwhile, an ammonium vanadate (NHVO) material with enlarged interlayer spacing is synthesized, and a freestanding NHVO/graphene oxide/carbon nanotube (NHVO/GO/CNT) electrode is constructed to enhance Mg 2+ diffusion and mitigate vanadium dissolution. Under the synergistic regulation, NHVO/GO/CNT exhibits a high capacity of 284.0 mAh g −1 and the longest cycling lifespan (16 000 cycles with 95.6% capacity retention). The solvation structure of electrolytes and interfacial stabilization mechanisms are elucidated through theory calculations. The Mg-storage mechanism of NHVO based on a single-phase insertion/extraction reaction with NH 4 + /Mg 2+ displacement phenomenon is revealed. The constructed multilayer Mg-ion pouch cell achieves a record-high capacity of 103.7 mAh. The integrated solar cell-pouch cell device demonstrates the feasibility of photo-charging AMIBs for the first time.

Extensive efforts have been directed toward alleviating kinetic limitations, but the essential role of thermodynamic factors, particularly under extreme operating conditions, has been largely overlooked. This oversight has impeded the development of comprehensive design principle for optimizing LIBs. In this study, we systematically investigate the coupled effects between thermodynamics and kinetics using advanced multiphysics simulations. We identify the slope of the equilibrium potential profile as a pivotal thermodynamic parameter. Steeper slopes have been demonstrated to induce stronger negative feedback, thereby effectively mitigating polarization heterogeneity and realizing the consistent electrode utilization. Based on this insight, we propose a design strategy centered on steepening the equilibrium potential to enhance thermodynamic feedback. This approach achieves a remarkable 80% reduction in polarization heterogeneity, significantly improving operational stability. Our work establishes a theoretical framework for polarization dynamics and offers actionable thermodynamic design principles, paves the way for the development of LIBs capable of extreme operating conditions.},

In this study, we designed and synthesized a nonfused conjugated small molecule (FNA) with dioctyl fluorene (F) as the π-bridge and N -dimethylaminopropyl-1,8-naphthalimide (NA) as terminal groups. As the CIL, it significantly modifies the interfaces of BHJ/CILs/electrode and minimizes dark current density ( J d ). Using PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F as the BHJ, FNA-based OPDs achieve a remarkably low J d of 1.12 × 10 −8 A cm −2 (at −0.5 V) and a peak specific detectivity of 8.23 × 10 12 Jones (940 nm), outperforming conventional devices with PDINN as CIL. These improvements are attributed to lower J d by modified interfacial contact and increased photoresponse by reducing depletion region width in FNA-based photodiodes. Furthermore, uniform photoresponse in 5 × 5 OPD pixel arrays further validates its potential for imaging applications.},

This reaction concept allows for the formation of cyclooctanoids without benzofusion, as demonstrated by oxidative opening of the furan ring. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism for the [4 + 4] cycloaddition point to a stepwise process. Surprisingly, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction is attributed to protonation of the two organocatalyst-bound cyclooctanoid intermediates leading to a preferred set-up for catalyst elimination to account for the absolute configuration of the cyclooctanoid.},

However, the development of single-layer membranes with well-defined pore structures remains elusive, which makes the realization of efficient molecular sieving and interpretation of molecular transport a difficult task. Herein, we report the fabrication of single-layer nanoporous hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) membranes that uniquely contain triangular nanopores with a high density (around 10 12 pores per cm 2 ). The hBN membranes exhibit a H 2 permeance of 5.43 × 10 −6 mol m −2 s −1 Pa − 1 with a H 2 /CH 4 selectivity of 14.7; they also show a CO 2 permeance of 1.37 × 10 −6 mol m −2 s −1 Pa −1 , with a CO 2 /N 2 selectivity of 12.3. Importantly, we show that straightforward mathematical modeling can predict and describe the gas transport properties of the hBN, providing new insights into the molecular transport across atomically thin nanopores. The results gained from this study could significantly advance our understanding of molecular transport across hBN nanopores and may promote the development of hBN membranes to address critical separation issues.},

However, achieving precise control over their length, solubility, and structural regularity has had limited progress. Herein, we report a versatile solution-phase synthesis of a novel family of structurally precise N -doped nonalternant nanoribbons ( NRs : NR-11 to NR-29 ) through pentagon annulation of pyrazino[2,3- g ]quinoxaline and naphthalene subunits terminated with triptycene end-caps. The longest one comprises 29 linearly fused rings (particularly including 10 pentagonal rings), setting a new length record of 7.18 nm among the soluble nonalternant NRs reported to date. Strategic incorporation of triptycene end-caps and alkoxyphenyl substituents into their molecular backbones confers high solubility and a unique 3D configuration, enabling comprehensive solution-phase structural characterization and systematic investigation of length-dependent optoelectronic properties. Employing terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, we infer high intrinsic charge carrier mobilities in nonalternant nanoribbons, reaching up to ∼2000 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , highlighting this novel family of nanoribbons as promising candidates for future nanoelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Density functional theory (DFT) is the standard approach for modeling MIL-101(Fe) and related Fe-based metal–organic frameworks, typically assuming a ferromagnetic high-spin configuration. However, this widely adopted approach overlooks a key electronic feature: Spin frustration in the triangular -O) nodes. Using flip-spin, broken-symmetry DFT, we identify the true ground state as an antiferromagnetic state that standard DFT fails to capture. We demonstrate that neglecting spin frustration in MIL-101(Fe) leads to structural distortions, incorrect energetics, and misleading predictions of stability and reactivity. By explicitly accounting for spin frustration, we recover the correct structure and rationalize the temperature-dependent and CO binding. Spin frustration enhances fixation at room temperature, while its loss upon partial reduction suppresses this activity but promotes CO adsorption via -backbonding. These findings challenge current computational conventions and highlight spin frustration as a critical electronic feature in these frameworks.},

  abstract     = {The properties of metal-centred species in metal halide perovskite precursor solutions substantially influence the formation and evolution of colloidal particles, which in turn dictate the crystallisation process and the film quality. In this work, we assess the “hard” and “soft” Lewis acid characteristics of Sn 2+ and Pb 2+ cations as a strategy to modulate the chemical environment of these metal-containing species in mixed-metal tin–lead perovskite precursor solutions. We observe enhanced simultaneous access to both metal centres upon adding compounds with functional groups suggested by the hard–soft acid–base principle. Theoretical calculations suggest that the hard base carboxyl group preferentially interacts with Sn 2+ -based species, while the softer base thiol group also targets Pb 2+ -based species. By effectively accessing and manipulating possible classes of inorganic species and their colloidal particle properties in the precursor solutions, we achieve 1.26 eV perovskite polycrystalline films exhibiting enhanced structural and optoelectronic quality, giving the best quasi-Fermi level splitting values of up to 0.95 eV. As a result, the solar cell devices demonstrate efficiency values of up to 23.3% with an extended operational lifetime, retaining 80% of their initial efficiency after over 280 and 180 h of maximum power point tracking under simulated AM1.5G illumination at 25 and 65 °C, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into value-added chemicals represents a sustainable route for plastic valorization. However, previous studies have solely focused on generating oxygenated compounds through intramolecular C─O bond transformations. Achieving heteroatom-containing important chemicals via intermolecular coupling reactions is still challenging. Herein, we report the first example of the direct photocatalytic C─N coupling of PET-derived ethylene glycol (EG) with ammonia to produce formamide (FA) and H 2 over a Pt 1 Au/TiO 2 catalyst. Pt 1 Au/TiO 2 delivers a FA yield rate of ∼7.1 mmol g cat −1 h −1 , as well as H 2 evolution (∼22.8 mmol g cat −1 h −1 ). Photoelectrochemical analyses, including time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), reveal that monatomic Pt sites can effectively trap electrons, while Au nanoparticles act as hole sinks, thereby synergistically enhancing charge separation efficiency. Mechanistic investigations via in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) elucidate the reaction pathway: EG undergoes hole-mediated oxidation to yield an aldehyde intermediate, which is subsequently attacked nucleophilically by hole-derived •NH 2 , inducing sequential C─C bond cleavage and C─N bond formation. This work provides critical mechanistic insights for the sustainable synthesis of high-value heteroatom-containing chemicals from plastic waste.},

We demonstrate that strain-graded lattices with high phonon energy enhance the multi-phonon orbit-lattice relaxation (MPR) in the downconversion process more effectively than distorted lattices, which helps to extend the near-infrared-IIb (NIR-IIb, 1500–1700 nm) lifetime of Er 3+ /Tm 3+ by 2∼4 times. Subsequent epitaxial CaF 2 growth further attenuates surface phonon coupling, enabling exponential tunability of NIR-IIb lifetime (Tm 3+ : 0.74∼6.28 ms; Er 3+ : 0.055∼9.2 ms).

  abstract     = {Immunotherapy is a groundbreaking approach for clinically treating tumors, but its effectiveness is hindered by the tumor's immunosuppressive environment and lack of immune cell infiltration, enabling tumors to evade the immune system. Although the activation of both innate and adaptive immunities is a promising strategy to counteract this bottleneck, their synergy remains challenging. Therefore, we developed Bio-Cy , an unprecedented organic unimolecular photosensitive immunostimulant, which stimulates self-amplifying pyroptosis and cGAS-STING pathways by disrupting pyroptosis checkpoints to enhance adaptive and innate immunity activation. Mechanistic studies have shown that Bio-Cy can target cancer cells and be transported to lysosomes via endocytosis, generating reactive oxygen species through a Type I photodynamic mechanism to destroy cancer cells, even under hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, this lysosomal disruption not only activates the caspase-3/GSDME-dependent pyroptosis of adaptive immunity through mitochondrial damage by releasing Ca 2+ , but also enhances the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway by releasing mitochondrial DNA. More importantly, the initial lysosomal damage impairs protective cellular autophagy, destroying the pyroptosis checkpoint and thus preventing the clearance of damaged mitochondria and amplifying immune responses, ultimately boosting immunotherapy. This strategy effectively treats primary tumors and inhibits metastatic growth, offering a new paradigm for photoimmunotherapy.},

The in situ atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) on scaffold of Zn-COF results in the exfoliation of crystalline COF nanosheets and assembly into nanohydrogels in aqueous solution. The obtained Zn-COF-NHG can effectively mimic photoresponsive oxidase-like activity for the chromogenic catalysis of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by facilitating homogeneous behavior to enhance catalytic efficiency, while also exhibiting intelligent temperature-response regulation of catalytic oxidation activity. Moreover, the high photodynamic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reinforcement of binding to the exterior of bacteria through noncovalent interactions concurrently boost its bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) and Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) by amplifying oxidative stress. In vivo study on S. aureus -infected murine model further substantiates the superior wound disinfection and healing effect of Zn-COF-NHG.

  abstract     = {Traditional strategies for developing small-molecule inhibitors of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) are time-consuming and often yield low success rates due to the flat and dynamic interfaces of PPIs. To enable the rapid design of highly potent PPI inhibitors, we proposed a novel strategy named “Fulcrum Occupancy–Leverage Perturbation (FOLP)”. In this strategy, high-affinity fragments serve as the “Fulcrum” by binding to the orthosteric pocket, while suitable moieties extend into allosteric sites near the PPI interface as “Leverage” to modulate the protein–protein interaction. As a proof of concept, the potent CDK2–Cyclin A2 PPI inhibitor LC-K2CAin-3, which fits the “FOLP” paradigm, was discovered with an IC 50 of 32.1 nM for inhibiting the interaction. Molecular dynamics simulations and cryptic pocket identification were employed, revealing the activation loop (A-loop) of CDK2 was flexible and targetable. X-ray crystallography and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis showed that LC-K2CAin-3 indeed bound to and stabilized the A-loop. LC-K2CAin-3 effectively inhibited the CDK2–Cyclin A2 interaction in CDK2 highly expressed melanoma cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and inhibition of CDK2 mediated signaling. In conclusion, the “FOLP” strategy offers a novel approach for PPI inhibitor discovery and could accelerate the development of PPI inhibitors.},

  abstract     = {Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) show practical potential in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), but their development is hindered by insufficient understanding of Li + solvation chemistry and its impact on ion transport and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. By regulating the solvation abilities of polymer and solvent, this work explores the relationships between GPE composition, Li + coordination structures, Li + transference number, and interphase chemistry. The GPE combining weakly coordinated solvents with strongly coordinating polymer results in strong Li + -polymer attachment, leading to sluggish ion transport. Employing strongly chelating solvents causes complete Li + -polymer detachment, forming micelle structures that obstruct ion transport. The GPE with both weakly coordinated solvent fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and polymer 1 H ,1 H ,2 H ,2 H -tridecafluoro- n -octyl acrylate (TFOA) enables optimal interactions between Li + and polymer/solvent, facilitating partial Li + -polymer detachment and aggregates (AGGs) generation, avoiding micelle formation. This promotes efficient Li + transport and anion-derived SEI generation. The resulting GPE achieves 99.2% Coulombic efficiency (CE) in Cu||Li cells and enables 4.5 V LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 ||Li to demonstrate 81% capacity retention after 140 cycles.

  abstract     = {In this work we report a novel strategy to enhance the adsorption capacity of conventional porous materials by engineering intrinsic framework flexibility into porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs). Through Yamamoto-type copolymerization of a rigid tetrahedral monomer (tetrakis(4-bromophenyl)methane) and a flexible counterpart (tetrakis[(4-bromophenoxy)methyl]methane), we synthesized a series of flexible PAFs (FPAF-x, x = 0–2) with tunable flexibility. FPAF-0.5 with moderate flexibility and surface area (854 m 2 g −1 ) achieves exceptionally high volatile organic compound (VOC) adsorption capacities for various VOCs (e.g., 410.7 wt% for THF and 339.4 wt% for 3-methylthiophene), outperforming many other porous materials reported to date. Both thermodynamic equilibrium and dynamics VOC vapor adsorption studies reveal that optimal flexibility enables guest-adaptive structural transformation, allowing pore expansion to accommodate additional VOC molecules after initial pore filling. Moreover, polar and aromatic VOCs induce greater framework expansion than nonpolar analogues, which can also enhance the VOC uptake capacity in FPAFs. This work establishes flexibility engineering as a design principle for next-generation adsorbents, improving the efficiency of VOC adsorption.},

  abstract     = {Acidic Zn–Mn batteries hold promising prospects in large-scale energy storage owing to their higher discharge voltage and capacity. However, the challenge of developing long-term acidic Zn–Mn batteries still remains due to Zn anode instability in acidic media arising from the inevitable proton corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report self-assembled homogeneous heterobimetallic-oxide interfaces on the Zn anode surface via a multi-cation (Cu 2+ , In 3+ , and Sn 4+ ) synergistic regulation strategy to achieve >85.5% depth of discharge with over 1000 h of cycling in strongly acidic medium (pH = 0.9). The design ingeniously blends the SnCl 4 hydrolysis and In 3+ and Cu 2+ ions replacement with Zn metal to spontaneously generate heterobimetallic In–CuZn 5 and SnO 2 oxide. Heterobimetallic-oxide interfaces could synergistically inhibit proton corrosion and HER while inducing Zn-ordered plating/stripping benefiting from the excellent acid resistance of SnO 2 and the abundant nucleation sites of heterobimetallic. Crucially, the in situ hydrolysis of SnCl 4 establishes a self-regulated acidic environment without additional acidic medium. Consequently, Zn–Mn pouch battery within this acidic environment delivers a high capacity of 1.39 mAh cm −2 and retains 84.9% of initial capacity after 200 cycles at 1 mA cm −2 . This direct multi-cation synergistic modulated self-assembly interface strategy holds significant potential for expediting the advancement of high-safety, large-scale energy storage technology.},

Crucially, the self-complementary and exo-wall CT co-assembly of B[6]A facilitates the construction of 3D macrocycle-based co-crystals (MCCs) with planar electron-deficient guests, including 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene ( TCNB ), tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile ( TFTN ), and tetrachloroterephthalonitrile ( TClTN ). These MCCs exhibit tunable fluorescence with emission maxima at 690, 594, and 592 nm, respectively. Notably, activated B[6]A-TCNB demonstrates selective vapochromic behaviors toward picoline isomers via a dual response mechanism. This study provides new insights into the design of functional macrocyclic arenes and 3D MCCs, paving the way for the development of color-tunable crystalline luminescent materials and advanced vapochromic systems.},

Herein, we describe a method that extends the emission lifetime using dynamic molecular triplet excitons in aggregation systems composed of lanthanide complexes. To demonstrate the conceptual method, molecular crystals comprising lutetium (Lu 3+ ) and luminescent lanthanide (europium: Eu 3+ or terbium: Tb 3+ ) complexes with two organic ligands (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate and 2,7-bis(diphenylphosphoryl)phenanthrene) were prepared. These molecular crystals exhibited persistent emission via slow triplet exciton migration between the phenanthrene units. The extended degree of the lifetime could be controlled between 1 and 152 ms by ligand modifications. This proposed lifetime-tuning method should significantly expand the encoding capacity of lanthanide complexes.},

Inspired by the durable, deformable nature of rubber tires, we report the design and preparation of a self-adaptive solid-state elastomeric electrolyte containing a deep eutectic electrolyte, termed PMEC, which integrates molecular-level plasticizer dispersion, mechanical flexibility, and interfacial adaptivity. The PMEC membrane exhibits high ionic conductivity (2.37 mS cm −1 at 30 °C), a high Li⁺ transference number (0.64), excellent elasticity, and robust interfacial adhesion (36.34 J m −2 ). Structural characterizations confirm its amorphous and homogeneously mixed nature, while micro-Raman and XPS/TOF-SIMS analyses reveal uniform component distribution and the formation of an organic–inorganic gradient SEI layer on lithium. These features enable exceptional electrochemical performance in both symmetric and full batteries, including over 2000 h of stable cycling and >800 cycles at 0.5 C in LFP|PMEC|Li batteries with >88% capacity retention. Moreover, PMEC-based pouch batteries maintain functionality under severe mechanical abuse.

There are only a handful of metal organic cages produced by metalation of a pre-synthesised organic cage. In this work, we show that hexa-cationic hydrazone cages coordinate a range of transition metal ions upon deprotonation to give cage complexes with metal ions oriented towards the cage cavity. Remarkably, a cage with ethyl solubilising groups gives the expected three-fold symmetric metallocage, cages with alkoxy solubilising groups give low-symmetry zinc metallocages, and a cage without a solubilising group switches between high and low symmetry conformations depending on solvent. These low symmetry arrangements persist on the NMR timescale at temperatures as high as 360 K and in the presence of a wide range of anions.},

The phase transition also generated a confined rigid environment for Cell-Lig, activating thickness- and temperature-dependent green RTP emission from the incorporated lignin. Furthermore, red afterglow emission using an energy transfer mechanism was realized by incorporating rhodamine B (RhB). The inherent photothermal activity of lignin endowed Cell-Lig with easy recyclability using light-controlled phase transitions. Under irradiation, photothermal evaporation of residual ethanol triggered liquefaction (solid-to-liquid transition), while ethanol reintroduction facilitated instantaneous hardening. Remarkably, the initial RTP performance was maintained over six recycling cycles. Capitalizing on these attributes, Cell-Lig was successfully used for advanced coating and security applications.},

However, the challenging synthesis and limited cases hinder the understanding, improvement, and regulation of their optoelectronic properties. To avoid this dilemma, we employed cyclic Suzuki–Miyaura coupling between dithienylethene (DTE) and [6]helicene to firstly synthesize donor–acceptor (D–A)-type π-conjugated chiral macrocycles, including m -[1 + 1] , m -[2 + 2] , and m -[3 + 3] , where these compounds displayed photocontrollable ring sizes and chiroptical properties. More importantly, continuous amplification in chirality can be achieved via distinctive multiple chiral-centers-bonding in series within helical rings, giving high | g abs | and | g lum | of up to 0.023 and 0.013, respectively. The macrocycles were endowed with a photoswitchable function that is absent in previously documented π-conjugated chiral macrocycles. Both the cavity sizes and chiroptical properties could be photoregulated. As typical examples, the cavity dimension of m -[3 + 3] - PPP was photoadjusted from 25.8 × 19.8 to 22.6 × 18.3 Å, accompanied by reversible photoswitched | g abs | between 0.023 and 0.014 and remarkable CPL ON/OFF behavior. Moreover, a size-photoswitching correlation was revealed innovatively, i.e., the photoswitching ability increased with increasing ring size. Our study provides a new guidance for developing high-performance chiral systems and novel stimuli-responsive chiral macrocycles and provides ideal platforms for understanding chiral structure–functionality relationships.},

It exhibits dominant antiparallel alignment of dipole moment between quasi-1D chains, while 1D [(MnBr 3 ) − ] ∞ chains display zero dipole moment. The highly-distorted MnBr 4 2− tetrahedra owing to strong hydrogen bonding with halopyridine introduces large inherent structural anisotropy.

The merge of AAS reactions with the concept of multicomponent modular synthesis could allow flexible customization of molecular architectures from fundamental feedstocks, which remains underdeveloped. Herein, we disclose our recent observations on a novel three-component asymmetric Tsuji–Trost reaction enabled by cooperative palladium/Lewis acid (LA) catalysis. This ‘ 1C + 2C + NuH’ approach starts from fundamental organic feedstocks, i.e., aldehyde, allylboronate, and a nucleophile with the in situ formation of a C═C double bond. Diverse nucleophiles have been demonstrated to be applicable in this three-component AAS reaction, including malonates, acetylacetone, acetoacetate, phosphine oxides, sulfonyl hydrazides etc. The protocol successfully offers a novel platform to integrate two distinct bioactive molecular scaffolds to access diverse array of hybrids. Mechanistic studies suggest that the three-component AAS approach proceeds via a reaction sequence of LA-catalyzed allylation of aldehyde, olefin shift under palladium catalysis, and Pd/LA-cocatalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution.},

  abstract     = {The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance over transition metal catalysts is limited by the unsatisfactory surface catalytic reaction kinetics, which involves the transformation of electronic spin states. In this work, we successfully regulate the spin state of Fe single atoms (SAs) from a low-spin configuration (LS) to a medium-spin state (MS) via a biomineralization strategy, where the coordination configuration of Fe SAs transforms from Fe-N 4 to Fe-N 3 S. This spin state transition of Fe center is able to not only influence the orbital orientation but also modulate the electronic coupling between active sites and the adsorbates, thereby enhancing the kinetic process of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Besides, the spin polarization induced by this unique structure could also improve the utilization efficiency of the carriers by facilitating the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers and prolonging their lifetime. All these factors directly contribute to the superior activity of Fer-N-C@ZIS (Fer, ferritin; ZIS, ZnIn 2 S 4 ), which delivers an impressive H 2 evolution rate of approximately 31 mmol g −1 h −1 and a high stability over 25 h of continuous operation.},

  abstract     = {Developing durable ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) remains challenging due to irreversible Ru dissolution and lattice oxygen instability. Although elemental doping is a general method to improve stability, it inadvertently induces oxygen vacancies (V O s), which are randomly distributed in the nanocatalyst. Notably, the impact of V O distribution on the stability of Ru-based catalysts remains unresolved. Herein, we synthesized the Se-doped Ru oxide via annealing the mixture of ruthenium (III) chloride and selenium (Se) in the air (Ur-Se-RuO x ) with the presence of urea, showing the V O s distributed away from Se dopants, which is significantly different from the Se-doped Ru oxide synthesized without urea (Se-RuO x ), showing V O s distributed relatively close to the Se dopants. The Ur-Se-RuO x demonstrates superior oxygen evolution reaction performance over Se-RuO x . Particularly, Ur-Se-RuO x delivers a low working voltage (1.62 V@1 A cm −2 ) and excellent durability (>1000 h@200 mA cm −2 ) in PEMWE tests. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that V O s engage in long-range cooperation with spatially decoupled Se dopants in Ur-Se-RuO x , synergistically enhancing reaction kinetics via an intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism, while inhibiting the lattice oxygen mechanism and suppressing Ru dissolution, which demonstrates a new strategy to break the activity–stability trade-off in promising Ru-based catalysts.},

In this work, the dienoic-acid coupling effect is innovatively proposed to in-situ construct a hierarchical SEI layer (HSL) through the structural screening of a series of organic-acid molecules. Strong electron-withdrawing ability of dual carboxyl and metastable double bond can strengthen the self-decomposition tendency of trace electrolyte additive to form HSL via chemical and electrochemical reaction. HSL can effectively regulate interfacial H 2 O environment via hydrogen-bond anchoring to reduce thermodynamically active H 2 O, facilitate desolvation kinetics, and uniform Zn 2+ diffusion, thus significantly suppressing HER and dendrite growth. As a result, Zn anode with HSL can achieve high average coulombic efficiency of 99.8% over 2400 cycles, long-term cycling stability of 3800 h, and good reversibility under 50 mA cm −2 . Zn–I 2 full battery with HSL displays a long cycling life of 15 000 cycles and successfully powers the portable and wearable instruments. This work opens a novel route to design an advanced interface with fast kinetics by trace electrolyte additive for high-performance Zn metal batteries.},

  abstract     = {The structural design and facile synthesis of ligands are crucial for the development of innovative catalysts. Advances have enabled the iterative design of benchmark α-diimine nickel catalysts for the synthesis of polyolefins, which represent the largest class of polymers. In this work, a versatile post-synthetic modification (PSM) strategy is introduced for the synthesis of a new family of α-diimine nickel catalysts, deviating from the conventional methods. Based on the commercial butanedione ligand backbone that is found in α-diimine nickel catalysts, target groups were introduced into the backbone via a one-pot substitution reaction. This simple and efficient approach enabled the large-scale production of the target systems without purification. Using this protocol, 20 new ligands (50 g-level) and 20 new nickel catalysts were easily and rapidly synthesized. The catalysts demonstrated significant enhancements in their catalytic activities (4.4 × 10 8 g mol −1 h −1 ), thermostabilities (from 90 to 150 °C), and polymer molecular weights (8.3-fold those of polyethylenes produced by the unmodified catalyst) during ethylene polymerization. These improvements are comparable to those achieved through complicated and tedious aniline modifications in pioneering reports, thereby facilitating the kg-scale synthesis of polyethylenes, varying from semi-crystalline plastics to thermoplastic elastomers and ultimately to wax-like and oil-like products.},

However, besides hydrolytic stability, cycling stability is also a crucial feature that renders a MOF a good candidate for water adsorption. Through a series of Zr-MOFs with one-dimensional (1D) channels showing high water cycling stability, a principle of confining the accessibility of Zr 6 nodes aligning along channel direction in Zr-MOFs was unveiled. According to this principle, several topologies that regulates Zr 6 nodes with chelating formate aligning in a same plane with a distance less than 5.4 Å can successfully hinder the introduction of in-plane water molecules, thus significantly improve the cycling stability of Zr-MOFs for water adsorption. Along with this principle, we illustrated a linker designing strategy by horizontal extending the core of organic linkers toward the synthesis of Zr-MOFs with similar node alignment. By either intentionally shortening or elongating the core horizontally, both MOFs shows high water-vapor cycling stability. Among them, NJTech-5 (NJTech for Nanjing Tech University) with scu -topology, presents a water uptake capacity of 0.93 g g −1 and working capacity of 0.82 g g −1 , making it among the top stable MOFs with high water uptake capacity and a promising candidate for indoor humidity control.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic plastics sourced from petroleum have gained widespread use since the 1950s. Polystyrene (PS) is one of the most extensively used plastics, as it is colorless, has high mechanical strength, and exhibits excellent chemical and thermal stability; however, it is also one of the least recycled plastics because of the high cost and low profit in recycling. Herein, we demonstrate a mechanochemical recycling approach that allows PS to be efficiently degraded into benzene when it is ground in a ball mill with AlCl 3 . For example, when 165 kDa PS pellets are milled with AlCl 3 , the extent of degradation reaches 90% at 15 min. Isotope labeling experiments indicate that both ambient water and the polymer backbone can be proton sources for the formation of benzene. The benzene generated in the mechanochemical degradation can be used to synthesize styrene, which can be repolymerized to produce polystyrene, allowing for the closed-loop recycling of PS. In addition, a mechanochemical Friedel–Crafts acylation between the generated benzene and the subsequently added benzoic anhydride produces benzophenone in 40%–50% yield. The mechanochemical degradation process demonstrated here is solvent-free, cost-effective, and energy-efficient, providing a promising route for the chemical recycling and upcycling of PS.},

However, it remains a significant challenge to precisely control over interlayer stacking configurations in 2D COFs, which critically influence charge carrier transport and consequently determine catalytic efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate a solvent-driven strategy to precisely regulate the interlayer stacking configurations of metal-incorporated 2D COFs, successfully achieving both AA eclipsed (COF-TD-AA) and ABC staggered (COF-TD-ABC) configurations. Notably, by modulating the coordination interactions between solvent 1-butanol and Zn 2+ (within the COFs), the interactions between the Zn 2+ and nitrogen atoms (from imine bonds, pyridine, and triazine units) can be precisely tuned, which leads to the formation of AA or ABC stacked 2D COFs. Interestingly, the ABC-stacked COF-TD-ABC exhibited an extended light absorption and superior charge migration/separation efficiency than those of COF-TD-AA. As a result, when coupled with Pt co-catalysts, COF-TD-ABC achieved a high hydrogen evolution rate up to 10.92 mmol g −1 h −1 , representing a ∼3.5-fold enhancement over COF-TD-AA (3.12 mmol g −1 h −1 ). This work provides a fundamental insight into the stacking-dependent structure-property relationships in COFs, paving the way for the rational design of high-performance COF-based photocatalysts.},

Herein, we developed a general design strategy—introducing a positive charge into the fluorophore skeleton—for the construction of FAPα-activated fluorescent probe with enhanced sensitivity. Molecular docking simulations and fluorescence spectra revealed that the FAPα-activated fluorescent probe with positive charges displayed an improved affinity and sensitivity toward FAPα. As demonstration, FQCy7 , featuring two positive charges, NIR fluorescence emission, and large Stokes shift, exhibited a satisfactory sensitivity toward FAPα and was used for the relationship study between FAPα and carcinoma cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that FQCy7 is highly useful in distinguishing invasive tumor from benign lesions and evaluating the precise resection of tumor tissues.

Herein, we introduce a bidirectional hydrogen spillover strategy to enable synergistic bifunctional HER/HOR catalysts for hydrogen batteries. We demonstrate a Ru–WO 3 catalyst grown on Cu foam (Ru–WO 3 @CF), where the interaction between Ru and WO 3 enables dynamic shuttling of adsorbed hydrogen species under alternating potentials. The Ru–WO 3 @CF electrode demonstrates exceptional HER/HOR bifunctionality in acidic media (0.5 M H 2 SO 4 ), achieving an ultralow HER overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and an HOR current density of 21.5 mA cm −2 at 50 mV — both significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C benchmarks. The hydrogen battery fabricated with Ru–WO 3 @CF demonstrates exceptional performance across a wide range of temperatures.

  abstract     = {The water molecule is regarded as a double-edged sword in organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs), particularly for n-type semiconductors. On the one hand, hydration facilitates ion transport within OMIECs; on the other hand, water acts as an electron trap, capturing electrons in n-type materials. Excessive hydration may disrupt the continuity of OMIECs crystalline domains, leading to device degradation. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative strategy by incorporating perfluoroalkyl hybridized ethylene glycol (fag) side chains into the polymer. The strong hydrophobicity of fluoroalkyl segments effectively repels water from polymer backbone, thereby reducing electron trapping. Meanwhile, the ethylene glycol components facilitate efficient ion transport. These findings are confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM-D). Additionally, the electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, which in turn enhances stability in aqueous environments. We also discovered that the incorporation of fag side chains also promotes polymer self-assembly and improves crystallinity. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) reveals a face-on/edge-on mixed orientation in fag-based polymers, facilitating efficient ion-electron transport. Consequently, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) fabricated from fag-based OMIECs demonstrate state-of-the-art n-type performance, achieving a µC* figure of merit of 189.78 F cm −1 V −1 s −1 . Furthermore, they exhibit excellent stability, retaining 68% of their initial performance after 50 000 switching cycles in aqueous electrolyte. This study demonstrates that a rational approach to molecular design can effectively alleviate the detrimental effects of water, providing a novel strategy for the development of high-performance and stable n-type OMIECs.},

  abstract     = {Incorporation of non-benzoid rings into cycloarylenes significantly alters their molecular geometry and optical behavior. Recently, we synthesized two ferrocene-doped cycloarylenes, (CpFe) 3 -1 and (CpFe) 4 -2 . However, the {FeCp} moieties in these architectures limited their optical properties. In this work, we report a reductive Fe─Cp bond cleavage approach that enables the removal of {FeCp} moieties efficiently, yielding two anionic cycloarylenes, 1 3– and 2 4– . Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals different structure deformation between two charged species including molecular symmetry and π-conjugation. Comprehensive spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations demonstrate that both 1 3– and 2 4– exhibit steady emission at 560 and 587 nm, respectively, with noticeable high quantum yields (59.70% and 84.99%). 1 3– violates Kasha's rule via a rare mixed emission from S 2 →S 0 and S 1 '→S 0 , whereas 2 4– adheres to the conventional S 1 '→S 0 decay. Furthermore, both compounds exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) as the first example observed in cycloarylenes, with lifetimes reaching the millisecond scale. This work establishes alkali-metal-mediated reductive cleavage as an effective strategy to break Fe─Cp bond and provides new insight into the photophysical behavior of charged molecular nanocarbons, paving the way for the rational design of functional molecular materials.},

  abstract     = {Ruthenium-based catalysts are pivotal as cost-effective alternatives to Pt for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). However, they typically face irreversible deactivation above 0.2 V vs. RHE due to synergistic Ru oxidation/OH ad over-adsorption. We propose a Taichi-inspired TiN-TiO 2 heterophase-segregated electron-relay mechanism that dynamically balances bidirectional electron flow (Ru→TiN electron donation and TiO 2 →Ru electron replenishment), achieving complete activity retention (100%) even under 1.1 V operation. This potential-adaptive regulation can significantly inhibit electron redistribution and band compression under the high potential induced electric field, and effectively alleviate the d- band upshift and OH adsorption energy surge. Spatially decoupled Ti(TiN)-Ru bridge sites simultaneously adsorb OH ad (E ads = -1.40 eV) and decouple H ad /OH ad adsorption domains, eliminating competitive binding. This configuration delivers triple synergies: 1) geometric isolation of reactive intermediates adsorption, 2) potential-responsive Ru 0 stabilization, and 3) accelerated Volmer kinetics via interfacial hydroxyl migration. The Ru/TiN-TiO 2 catalyst achieves 100% activity retention at 1.1 V vs. RHE (vs. >60% loss for Ru/TiN) with 73.23% metallic Ru 0 preserved after 10 h operation. This work resolves the intrinsic activity-stability trade-off in Ru HOR catalysts and establishes dynamic charge-relay interfaces as a universal design paradigm for oxidation-prone electrocatalysts.},

  abstract     = {Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are promising precatalysts to access active metal oxyhydroxide [M(O)OH] phases for anodic oxidation reactions (AORs). In this study, we have introduced a d-d electron complementation strategy to fine-tune the electronic features of a VOFe-PBA precatalyst. Spectroscopic studies revealed the altered coordination and electronic features of the VOFe-PBA precatalyst compared to the FeFe-PBA counterpart. The electrochemical activation of the VOFe-PBA precatalyst led to the formation of a strained V-Fe(O)OH active catalyst. Notably, V-Fe(O)OH demonstrated exceptional performance, requiring a potential of only 1.56 V versus RHE for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 1.42 V versus RHE for iodide oxidation reaction (IOR) at a current density of 100 mA cm −2 , significantly outperforming the Fe(O)OH. When employed in IOR-assisted water splitting, V-Fe(O)OH achieved an energy efficiency of 60% compared to overall water splitting. In-situ Raman studies reflected the potential dependent generation of active reaction intermediates, which participated in IOR to produce iodate. Mechanistic investigations suggested the involvement of a lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) facilitated by a proton-decoupled electron transfer (PDET) pathway.},

  abstract     = {Freezing hydrogels at subzero temperatures severely compromises mechanical flexibility, ionic conductivity, and structural integrity, thereby limiting their application in low-temperature environments. Hydrogel freezing involves both ice nucleation and ice growth; however, simultaneously inhibiting these two processes remains a significant challenge. In nature, freeze-tolerant organisms do not rely on completely preventing ice formation to survive freezing conditions. Instead, they utilize bacterial membrane-anchored ice nucleating protein (BMIP) to promote ice nucleation and ice binding protein (IBP) to regulate ice growth, thereby achieving freeze protection through precise ice management. Inspired by this biological strategy of “selective nucleation of small ice crystals with restricted growth,” we developed anti-freezing hydrogels by incorporating both BMIP and IBP. The anti-freezing hydrogels exhibit enhanced mechanical and electrical performance at low temperatures, with a non-freezing matrix stable down to −30°C and excellent structural integrity over multiple freeze-thaw cycles. When employed as a functional component of a robotic hand designed for low-temperature operation and integrated with machine learning algorithms, the anti-freezing hydrogels enable precise recognition of object stiffness and size under ultra-low temperature conditions. This bioinspired approach provides a promising strategy for the development of next-generation anti-freezing hydrogels capable of supporting stable human-robot-environment interactions in harsh, low-temperature environments.},

Due to the intermittency of renewable energy, the dual-site catalysts must efficiently enable both the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e − ORR) and water oxidation reaction (2e − WOR). The Kirkendall effect was employed to engineer interfaces and construct a NiZnO x ─C catalyst with exposed (100) facets. The hetero-cluster NiO x induces oxygen vacancies and built-in electric fields, which facilitate water activation and subsequent formation of hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals, thereby enabling a single catalyst to rapidly electrosynthesize H 2 O 2 at both the anode and cathode. Notably, 2e − ORR on the cathode enabled rapid synthesis of high-concentration H 2 O 2 (33987 mg L −1 , 33.18 mol g catalyst −1 h −1 ). NiZnO x ─C achieves stable 2e − ORR/WOR coupling in a continuous-flow reactor, operating reliably for 4 h under simulated alternating current (AC) and peaking at a total Faradaic efficiency of 150.9% under amperage-level direct currents. This work provides insights into interface engineering based on the Kirkendall effect, demonstrating the feasibility of directly integrating intermittent renewable energy into H 2 O 2 electrosynthesis systems.},

O vac reduces the hydrogen proton desorption energy by regulating local charge redistribution, thus realizing the rapid transformation of Ni 2+ →Ni 3+ →Ni 4+ . Meanwhile, the hard Lewis acid Ni 4+ has strong selectivity to OH − , avoiding the competitiveness and corrosiveness of chloride ions in seawater.

  abstract     = {Ether based electrolytes are promising for the realization of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs). However, the oxidation chemistry of these electrolytes stemming from the disruption to solvent coordination by interfacial electric-field remains unresolved and challenging. Herein, we demonstrated that reinforcing the interactions between solvent and diluent to decouple solvation dynamics from interfacial electric fields could maintain Li⁺-solvent coordination integrity and drastically diminish uncoordinated solvents, thereby increasing electrolyte anodic stability. To realize this concept, we identify a class of solvophilic diluents (SPDs, whose interaction energies with solvent>3.3 kcal mol −1 ) to strongly anchor diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) solvent at electrified interfaces via mutually reinforcing H (DEGDME) ···F/O (SPD) and H (SPD) ···O (DEGDME) interactions and effectively decrease dipole moment of DEGDME (< 2.47 D), creating an electric field-insensitive solvation environment wherein the O─H/C─H bond polarization of DEGDME is dramatically impeded. Remarkably, our designed SPD-assisted electrolyte mediated by electric field-insensitive methyl nonafluorobutyl ether exhibits outstanding anodic stability, endowing 4.7 V-class 30 µm Li||2.1 mAh cm −2 LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 cell with 80% capacity retention after 168 cycles-an improvement over the 90 cycles achieved with a Li friendly electrolyte.

  abstract     = {CRISPR/Cas systems have transformed genome editing, yet achieving precise temporal and conditional control remains challenging. Traditional strategies involving linear guide RNAs (gRNAs) modified with multiple chemical groups throughout their strands often face limitations such as heterogeneous reaction outcomes, irreversibility, and variable editing efficiencies. To overcome these issues, topology-engineered guide RNAs (TE-gRNAs) have emerged, featuring defined structural architectures including polymeric, circular, and dendrimer-like topologies that enable precise spatial control, reversibility, and programmable activation of CRISPR activity. By selectively incorporating physical or chemically responsive linkers and stimuli-sensitive groups at specific sites, TE-gRNAs facilitate dynamic and conditional genome editing that can be activated or deactivated with external triggers such as light or chemical signals. These engineered RNA structures significantly improve synthesis feasibility, stability, reduce off-target effects, and provide unprecedented control over gene editing processes. Recent advancements in TE-gRNAs demonstrate their broad applicability in synthetic biology, functional genomics, and therapeutic interventions, highlighting their potential to achieve precise spatiotemporal modulation of CRISPR systems. This review summarizes the current strategies, benefits, and challenges associated with TE-gRNAs, and discusses future directions for enhancing their performance and utility in complex genome editing applications.},

Although RuO 2 exhibits high catalytic activity, its solubility and corrosion in acidic environments are of concern. In this study, high-melting-point metal oxides were multi-step rationally screened as protective layers for RuO 2 to identify their roles in the acidic OER process. Among them, Ta-related oxide was selected as the best candidate. To demonstrate the theoretical predictions, RuO 2 @TaO x with a core-shell structure was deployed, which exhibited low overpotentials of 163 and 232 mV at 10  and 100 mA cm −2 , respectively. In fact, the dense amorphous TaO x layer effectively prevented the dissolution of RuO 2 and optimized the charge transfer through interfacial synergy, significantly improving both the activity and durability of OER. Meanwhile, the operando quick X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Quick-XAS) confirmed that Ru served as the active site during OER, while Ta inhibited the over-oxidation of Ru, correlating with theoretical considerations. This study provides a new paradigm using targeted computational screening to guide the design of advanced catalysts, and serves as a proof-of-concept for the deployment of high-melting-point metal oxides as a protective layer for RuO 2 in the acidic OER.},

  abstract     = {Capture agents that selectively bind to biological targets are indispensable tools in diagnostics, therapeutics, and biomedical research. However, discovering such capture agents, particularly for structurally conserved or challenging targets, remains a challenge. Here, we describe a protein-templated in situ click strategy enabled by a nanoparticle-based DNA-encoded library (nanoDEL) platform. The nanoDEL enables the construction and screening of vastly large, chemically diverse combinatorial libraries with high redundancy, far exceeding the scale and throughput of conventional approaches, such as one-bead-one-compound and solution-phase in situ click methods. Thus, this enables the rapid and efficient identification of high-affinity, high-selectivity ligands in a single selection round, eliminating the need for iterative screening. To demonstrate the utility of this strategy, we performed an in situ click screening of a 27-million-member nanoDEL of azido-functionalized peptoids, in the presence of a weak and promiscuous alkyne-bearing anchor ligand. This yielded bidentate inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, a challenging target due to its highly conserved active site. These inhibitors exhibited nanomolar potency and exceptional selectivity over closely related phosphatases. This work represents a broadly applicable strategy for discovering high-performance capture agents, particularly for selectively targeting closely related protein families or isoforms where achieving selectivity remains a critical challenge.},

Starting from the HER2-binding peptide LTVSPWY, we engineered the first-generation HerTAC ( LP ), a conjugate of the HER2-binding peptide and a PD-L1 ligand, to degrade programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in HER2-positive cells. Guided by AlphaFold modeling and alanine scanning, we developed a stapled peptide-based HerTAC ( L 2,5 P ) with enhanced degradative efficacy (DC 50 = 156 nM), stability, and pharmacokinetics. HerTAC L 2,5 P showed potent antitumor activity and low systemic toxicity in HER2 + breast cancer animal models. The HerTAC strategy was further extended to other clinically relevant inaccessible membrane and extracellular targets (i.e., V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation [VISTA] and macrophage migration inhibitory factor [MIF]), highlighting its generality and broad applicability.

  abstract     = {Macrocyclic compounds are pivotal in both supramolecular chemistry and materials science, as their preorganized cavities enable selective molecular recognition, while their cyclic frameworks facilitate electronic and spatial coupling of monomeric units to yield advanced optoelectronic and magnetic properties. However, macrocycles that combine exceptional host–guest recognition with these properties remain rare and challenging to design. Herein, we report the synthesis of three pairs of enantiopure, redox-active, conjugated macrocycles, termed corral[ n ]bicarbazole, employing axially chiral 4,4′-bicarbazole units. These macrocycles display strong blue emission (quantum yields up to 78% in THF) and pronounced circularly polarized luminescence (| g lum | up to 10 −3 ). Notably, controlled oxidation of corral[ n ]bicarbazoles generates their mono- and polyradical cations with exceptional air stability (half-lives up to five days) and intriguing magnetic properties. The electron-rich deep-cavity of corral[4]bicarbazole confers strong hosting ability ( K a = 10 4 –10 5 M −1 ) toward cationic guests, facilitating redox-responsive guest capture/release. By integrating a chiroptical, redox-active backbone with a switchable recognition cavity, corral[ n ]bicarbazoles offer a versatile platform for advancing interdisciplinary innovation, with potential applications in optoelectronics, spintronics, and smart supramolecular materials.},

  abstract     = {The selective modification of carbohydrates to achieve structural complexity has emerged as a crucial strategy in carbohydrate-based drug development. However, the intricate stereochemistry and densely packed functional groups of carbohydrates pose significant challenges for precise stereoselectivity and regioselectivity control. Herein, we report a palladium-catalyzed, stereospecific, and ligand-controlled regiodivergent glycosyl Suzuki–Miyaura coupling of 3-boryl-glycals, establishing a robust platform for glycoside diversification with versatile C1 and C3 modification. Notably, stable 3-boryl-glycals with 1,1,2,2-tetraethylethylene glycol protection were first synthesized and fully characterized. Operating under mild conditions, this reaction enables the efficient synthesis of diverse 2,3-unsaturated aryl/alkenyl C -glycosides with exceptional regio- and stereoselectivity. Importantly, this ligand-controlled regiodivergent C -glycosylation offers a concise and efficient strategy for accessing 3- C -glycals (C3-arylated/alkenylated glycals), circumventing time-consuming and labor-intensive multi-step sequences. To elucidate the origins of regioselectivity control, we employ a data-driven approach integrating DFT-assisted multivariate regression analysis, identifying key ligand parameters that govern regioselectivity. Leveraging this predictive model, we pursued rational ligand design to enhance C3-glycosylation selectivity and yield. Additionally, density functional theory calculations (DFT) provide critical insights into the fundamental principles dictating regioselectivity and tunability. These findings establish a solid foundation for advancing ligand-controlled regiodivergent glycosylation reactions and significantly expand the synthetic toolkit for glycochemical synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Charge transport and nonradiative recombination loss at the buried interface are important factors, which limit the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we screen a series of diphosphate Lewis-base molecules, where N,N-bis(diphenylphosphino)amine (N-DPPM) with appropriate alkyl chains and multiple active sites not only can efficiently facilitate carrier transport but also coordinate with undercoordinated Pb 2+ and interact with FA + through N⋯H bond. These features prompt the formation of high-quality perovskite films along (100)/(200) crystal facets. Interestingly, these oriented low-Miller-index crystal facets have approximately a twice-increase in heterointerface energy and twice-decrease in grain-boundary energy, flattening grain-boundary grooves, thereby reducing nanoscale physical voids and releasing residual stress. Consequently, the champion inverted PSCs exhibit impressive power conversion efficiencies of 26.80%, 26.18%, and 20.59% for narrow-bandgap (1.55 eV), large-area (0.5 cm 2 ), and wide-bandgap (1.73 eV) devices, respectively.

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) mesoporous metal oxide crystals that integrate atomic-level single crystallinity with ordered mesoporosity represent a promising but rarely realized class of materials, particularly in multicomponent systems. Here, we report a universal strategy for synthesizing freestanding 2D mesoporous spinel supracrystals with tunable compositions, spanning from unary to multinary spinel oxide systems. This approach decouples crystalline framework formation from mesopore generation, combining emulsion-mediated, on-surface crystallization of 2D nanocrystal superlattices with thermally-induced collective nanocrystal reorientation and facet-selective epitaxial fusion. Concurrent surface reconstruction exposes {110} facets along nanocrystal edges, which define the internal surfaces of vertically aligned mesopores. As a proof of concept, 2D mesoporous FeMnCoO supracrystals are employed as functional interlayers in lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. These interlayers demonstrate strong polysulfide adsorption, accelerated redox kinetics, and enhanced Li + ion transport, enabled by their multimetal-induced electronic modulation, facet-specific catalytic activity, and 2D mesoporous architecture. As a result, Li–S cells equipped with FeMnCoO-modified separators deliver exceptional electrochemical performance, even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions. This work addresses a longstanding challenge in reconciling ordered mesoporosity with crystallographic coherence in mesoporous materials, establishing a molecularly modular approach for synthesizing 2D mesoporous spinel crystals with programmable compositions and facet-engineered functionality.},

The instability of the organic electron transport layer (ETL) materials in air undoubtedly affects the carrier transport properties, which significantly reduces the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices. Here, based on the antioxidant strategy, the stability of PDINN in air is enhanced by doping PDINN with the antioxidant C 60 -OH, thereby successfully achieving the all-air preparation of OSCs. Eventually, the PCE of the air-prepared green OSCs based on PM6:BTP-eC9 and PM6:PTQ10:BTP-eC9 (o-xylene) achieves 19.35% and 20.22%, respectively, after being optimized by the antioxidant strategy. Moreover, C 60 -OH remarkably improves the operational stability of the device in air with a T 80 lifetime of over 1060 h, which is higher than that of undoped device (416 h). Furthermore, the PCE of large-area (25 cm 2 ) modules based on PDINN:C 60 -OH attains 16.47%. This study highlights the potential of the antioxidant strategy to fabricate high-efficiency and stable organic photovoltaics in air, significantly promoting the development of OSCs.},

Precise modulation of the hydrophobic characteristics of PCC linkers enables fine-tuning of π-stacking strength, thereby controlling the length of the nanotubes, ranging from the nano- to micro-scale. With exceptionally high drug-loading efficiencies (43.9% to 52.3%) and stimulus-responsive release properties, the optimized PCC nanotubes exhibit tumor-selective cytotoxicity of 20- to 50-fold greater potency against tumor cells compared to normal cells.

To date, the scarce reported YTHDF1 inhibitors suffer from poor selectivity and limited potency, primarily due to the high homology of the YTH domain within the YTHDF family, which poses significant challenges for the discovery of subtype-selective inhibitors. Here, we report SKLB-Y13 , the first small-molecule inhibitor achieving exclusive targeting of the YTHDF1 m 6 A-binding pocket (IC 50 = 0.76 µM), via structural optimization of a novel 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[2,3- c ]pyridine scaffold. Uniquely, SKLB-Y13 interacts with YTHDF1-specific residues Tyr397 and Trp470, as confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis, and demonstrates improved selectivity for YTHDF1 over YTH family proteins. Cellular and in vivo studies reveal that SKLB-Y13 disrupts YTHDF1- PRPF6 mRNA interaction in an m 6 A-dependent manner, thereby impairing the translation of PRPF6 and inhibiting BC proliferation while promoting apoptosis. Chemical proteomics profiling confirms its good target specificity, while pharmacokinetic analysis shows favorable in vivo properties. This study introduces the first selective YTHDF1 inhibitor, serving as a novel chemical probe to elucidate m 6 A-dependent oncogenesis and a promising starting point for developing precision therapies against YTHDF1-overexpressing BC.},

Nonetheless, chloride solid electrolytes (SEs) still undergo electrochemical degradation when paired with high-voltage cathodes such as LiNi 0.85 Co 0.1 Mn 0.05 O 2 . A viable strategy to enhance the intrinsic electrochemical stability of chloride electrolytes is to partially substitute Cl with F. By leveraging complementary insights from neutron and X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), and electrochemical studies, we investigate the interplay between ionic and electronic conductivity, voltage stability, and overall battery performance of a family of new dual-halogen SEs—Li 2 HfCl 6−x F x . All-solid-state cells utilizing Li 2 HfCl 5.5 F 0.5 as the electrolyte demonstrate much-enhanced battery performance compared to Li 2 HfCl 6 . This improvement is mainly attributed to the formation of a kinetically stable LiF-rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), which inhibits detrimental reactions between the cathode and the SE, as revealed by ToF-SIMS studies. The findings from this study are applicable to other dual-halogen solid ionic conductors, offering valuable insights into the relationship between intrinsic electrochemical window (IEW), electronic and ionic conductivity, and battery performance in dual-halogen solid-state electrolytes.},

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was proposed to measure neuromelanin in the substantia nigra or locus coeruleus , potentially providing a marker of Parkinson's disease. Here, synthetic neuromelanin analogues were prepared with iron and copper and used for characterization of metal binding and impact on proton relaxation, a prerequisite for optimizing neuromelanin-sensitive MRI. The results confirm the presence of paramagnetic mononuclear Fe(III) and antiferromagnetically coupled clusters, which enhance relaxation to variable degrees. Further complexity arises from Cu(II), which can compete for binding to mononuclear sites, aggregate in mixed-metal clusters, or bind to proteins associated with the melanin moiety. Unlike the strong relaxant Fe(III), Cu(II) only indirectly impacts relaxation by replacing iron. Overall, MRI primarily provides measures of average neuromelanin concentrations. Information on the distribution of neuromelanins with different metal compositions might be obtained with multiparametric MRI.},

For the most extensively investigated Cu-based electrocatalysts that favor NO 3 − adsorption, insufficient hydrogenation capability and sluggish NH 3 desorption hinder the ultimate performance. Herein, we report Ca-doped Cu 2 O co-modified by oxalate (Ca─Cu 2 O─OA) as a novel and high-performance NitRR electrocatalyst. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the Ca dopant with strong hydration effect facilitates the hydrogenation steps of adsorbed NO 3 − on the adjacent Cu active sites. The hydrogen-bonding interaction between OA and adsorbed NH 3 promotes the product desorption. Together with the strong NO 3 − adsorption capability and inhibited hydrogen evolution as a side reaction, excellent NitRR performance with a high Faraday efficiency (FE) of 97.49% and a high NH 3 yield of 15.02 mg h −1 cm −2 is achieved in neutral condition, outperforming most reported electrocatalysts. This work has provided new insights into the rational design of advanced NitRR electrocatalysts.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous hydroaminomethylation (HAM) of olefins generally requires the use of organic solvents, additives, and high-pressure hydrogen to synthesize amines in satisfactory yields and selectivity. Herein, we accomplish the HAM reactions of long-chain olefins in water without organic solvent or additives by using a hydrophilic bis-NHC-Ir complex as the catalyst. A broad scope of long-chain olefins and amines is well compatible, affording corresponding higher amines in up to 99% yields with excellent linear/branched ( l/b ) selectivity (up to 94/6). Mechanistic investigations reveal that water acts as both solvent and hydrogen source. The protocol can be readily extended to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and deuterated analogues with excellent yields and deuterium rates. Moreover, the amine products are easily separated by extraction, and the recovered aqueous phase could be directly used and recycled. This protocol offers a sustainable, safe, and cost-effective approach for synthesizing higher amines.},

  abstract     = {Viruses are versatile colloidal materials in their biofunctions, monodispersed and periodic structures, and high surface designability. For expanding the applicability of virus-based materials, spatiotemporally controlled immobilization and dispersion of viruses with retained activity should be useful, though control of the dynamic nature of viruses hybridized with commonly used polymers has been difficult due to their strong interactions. Here, we report a self-assembling peptide (A2Az) enabling photo control of adhesion and dispersion of M13 bacteriophage virus (M13 phage) and successfully demonstrate patterning of localization and infection of the virus. A2Az is a cationic peptide with amphiphilicity that consists of eight amino acid residues containing a photo-responsive azobenzene group at the second position and self-assembles into a helical supramolecular fiber to form a hydrogel. The helical fibrillar morphology of A2Az exhibits strong interaction with M13 phage, allowing for immobilization not only on a two-dimensional surface but also in a three-dimensional hydrogel with suppression of infectivity. The A2Az fiber undergoes a light-triggered fiber-to-particle transition and releases the immobilized M13 phage with retained infectivity for the photo-controlled patterning of localization and infection. This approach has potential applicability to various virus-based biomaterials, such as structural materials and materials for photo-selective gene transfection to cells.},

CPOF-12 exhibits a Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) surface area of 1,140 m 2 g −1 , a pore volume of 0.66 cm 3 g −1 , and a uniform pore size of 0.59 nm, which closely matches the kinetic diameter of SF 6 (0.52 nm). Gas adsorption measurements reveal a high SF 6 uptake of 2.20 mmol g −1 at 298 K and 1 bar, along with an exceptional SF 6 /N 2 selectivity of 149.4, calculated using ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST).

  abstract     = {Lophine, the first chemiluminescent compound discovered in history, has rarely been applied for in vivo imaging since its discovery in 1877. In this report, we demonstrate that lophine's chemiluminescence emission could be significantly enhanced by caging the imidazole moiety via molecular afterglow mechanism. Notably, our study revealed a rare superoxide anion-mediated luminescence. Our novel probes JIMI-11 and JIMI-12 could be used for in vivo mouse imaging. Compared to its uncaged form JIMI-6, JIMI-11 exhibited a significant enhancement (126-fold) in vitro and a 190-fold higher emission signal in vivo. JIMI-11 selectively accumulates in white adipose tissues (WAT) and can be used to monitor changes in WAT mass in a mouse model of type-1 diabetes. Additionally, it can assess the therapeutic effects of Semaglutide in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Lastly, we designed JIMI-12 with a reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) responsive moiety as the caging group and demonstrated its utility for in vivo imaging of ROS in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory mouse model. Our studies suggest that re-designing lophine-based probes could unlock their potential for both in vitro and in vivo applications. The ability to switch from chemiluminescence to molecular afterglow introduces a novel approach to designing imaging probes.},

  abstract     = {Cell mechanics play a pivotal role in regulating numerous biological processes. Although super-resolution microscopy enables the imaging of cellular forces in the lateral dimension with sub-10-nm resolution, achieving comparable resolution along the axial dimension remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce metal-induced energy transfer (MIET)-based tension probe microscopy (MIET-TPM), a technique for mapping cellular mechanical forces with nanometer precision in the axial direction. This approach combines the nanometer spatial resolution of MIET imaging with the piconewton sensitivity of DNA-hairpin-based molecular tension probes (MTPs), enabling the simultaneous observation of both the plasma membrane and force-exerting molecules in the axial dimension. Using MIET-TPM, we mapped axial integrin tension within focal adhesions and podosomes, alongside their corresponding plasma membrane height profiles, offering detailed insights into the nanoscale structures and mechanisms involved in force transmission. Notably, MIET-TPM can be implemented on any fluorescence microscopy setup without hardware modifications, making it a versatile and accessible tool that promises to become an integral part of future cellular mechanobiology analysis.},

We prepared series of polypeptides modified with sulfates or amidosulfonates (sulfamates), and importantly, we demonstrate that such linkages derived from SuFEx exhibit unique nature, which possibly benefits future biomaterial designs. In addition, the linkages can synergize with incorporated functionalizing moieties, demonstrated in a proof-of-concept example in which the sulfate-linked, saccharide-modified polypeptides showed outstanding antiviral activity and biocompatibility.},

Despite the recent advances in photoelectrode optimization for the practical application, the corresponding interfacial reaction mechanism has not been elucidated owing to a lack of suitable measurements at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, the key factor for an interfacial reaction in a model system (WO 3 photoanode coated with amorphous TiO 2 overlayers) is elucidated using operando spectroelectrochemistry. The thin TiO 2 overlayers are shown to enhance n-type semiconductor characteristics and heal the excessive oxygen vacancies on the WO 3 photoanode surface, which suggests reduced bulk and surface charge carrier recombination and 1.5-fold increase in Faradaic efficiency. Operando transient absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal that the overlayers accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the electrode to the external circuit and increase the population of trapped holes by promoting band bending, which reveals that the kinetic connection between ultrafast phenomena and real water oxidation reaction. Thus, our work elucidates band bending in the space-charge region as a key factor and provides a major strategy for designing surface-modified PEC devices.},
