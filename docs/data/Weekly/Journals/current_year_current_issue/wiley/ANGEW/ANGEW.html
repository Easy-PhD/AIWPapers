  abstract     = {Degradable polymers hold promise for their recyclability and their potential to facilitate the transition toward a circular economy of plastics. As such, a consecutive di-SN2 reaction between dithiols and polyhalogenated compounds was used to produce degradable polymers with tunable amounts of redox-enabled dithioacetal and disulfide linkages. The reaction employed bases of varying strengths and different thiol types, allowing for control over molecular weights ranging from <1 kDa to 16 kDa, with tunable degrees of polymerization ranging from 3 to over 75. The ratio of dithioacetals to disulfides was adjusted by manipulating the concentration of the methylene source, enabling the formation of polymers with up to 100% disulfide linkages or up to 93% dithioacetal linkages. This tunability resulted in polymers with multiple redox degradation pathways, capable of being degraded by either reduction or oxidation. Vinyl ether functionalized, telechelic oligomers were used as crosslinkers in network formation, yielding materials with multiple degradation pathways. This di-SN2 approach provides a promising and straightforward method for creating materials with tailored degradation characteristics.},

Herein, we reported a cage engineering strategy in anion-pillared metal-organic frameworks (APMOFs) for efficient C 2 H 2 and CO 2 capture simultaneously. Specifically, two stable ZrF 6 2− anion-pillared cage-type MOFs (ZNU-17 and ZNU-27) are prepared with both ultramicroporous (∼4 Å) and microporous (>7 Å) cages but featuring different shapes. While ZNU-17 allows the efficient binary C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 separation, ZNU-27 enables the benchmark ternary C 2 H 2 /CO 2 /C 2 H 4 separation by increasing the adsorption affinity toward CO 2 . Notably, remarkably increased C 2 H 2 (170.1 cm 3 g −1 versus 120.1 cm 3 g −1 ) and CO 2 (91.8 cm 3 g −1 versus 64.5 cm 3 g −1 ) adsorption capacities are achieved in ZNU-27, and the IAST selectivity of ZNU-27 for CO 2 /C 2 H 4 is 4.3 times as high as that of ZNU-17 (6.5 versus 1.5). The C 2 H 2 , CO 2 and C 2 H 4 binding sites in ZNU-27 are studied by gas loaded in situ single crystal structure and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, which revealed that the unique fluorinated 8.5 Å spherical cages provide strong hydrogen binding or electrostatic interactions for C 2 H 2 and CO 2 . Dynamic breakthrough tests show that from a C 2 H 2 /CO 2 /C 2 H 4 (1/9/90) mixture, polymer-grade C 2 H 4 (≥99.99%) can be obtained in ZNU-27 with a high productivity of 12.04 mol kg −1 .},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a sustainable platform in constructing C─N bonds for amino acid production. Glycine, a particularly valuable target compound, continues to experience escalating global demand, yet achieving simultaneous high efficiency and operational stability remains a persistent challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a CO 2 -mediated strategy for glycine electrosynthesis using oxalic acid and N 2 /nitrate as feedstocks. By using Pb/Pb 7 Bi 3 -CO 2 catalytic system, a very high glycine Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 91.8% with durable stability over 120 h could be achieved. Moreover, when using nonthermal plasma-activated N 2 as the nitrogen source, the glycine production rate could maintain at 94.4 µmol h −1 cm −2 with N-selectivity as high as 93.2%. Mechanistic investigations combining experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that CO 2 undergoes facile protonation on the Pb/Pb 7 Bi 3 heterointerfaces to form * OCOH intermediate, which donates hydrogen for the reduction of oxalic acid and nitrate into glyoxylic acid and NH 2 OH, respectively, while CO 2 is simultaneously regenerated. Notably, hydrogenation via the * OCOH intermediate significantly lowers the energy barriers compared to direct protonation, thereby promoting the subsequent spontaneous C─N bond formation and enabling highly efficient electrosynthesis of glycine.},

  abstract     = {Scheelite-type oxides have been extensively investigated in diverse inorganic systems due to their exceptional structural versatility and promising multifunctional properties, ranging from luminescence to ionic conduction. However, despite decades of research, borates have remained conspicuously absent from this important structural family. This exclusion stems from a fundamental synthetic and structure chemistry challenge: the difficulty in achieving the essential zero-dimensional anionic framework composed of isolated tetrahedral units, a defining characteristic of scheelite-type materials. In this work, we break this long-standing barrier by reporting the first successful isolation of [BO 2 F 2 ] tetrahedra in a crystalline solid. This breakthrough was enabled by employing Sb's stereochemically active lone pair electrons to stabilize these discrete [BO 2 F 2 ] units, ultimately leading to the discovery of SbBO 2 F 2 —the first borate compound adopting a scheelite-type structure. Through a combination of single-crystal X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic techniques, and first-principles calculations, we unequivocally confirm the scheelite-type framework of SbBO 2 F 2 and demonstrate its remarkable multifunctional properties, including anisotropic thermal expansion, ionic conductivity, and large birefringence. This work not only expands the structural chemistry of scheelite-type oxides with borates but also opens new avenues for designing multifunctional materials through targeted anionic group isolation.},

  abstract     = {β-Amino acids are essential building blocks in bioactive molecules, offering unique properties and potential in peptide and drug synthesis. Among them, β 2,2,3 -amino acids—characterized by a contiguous quaternary and tertiary stereocenter—represent a structurally unique subclass with promising biological potential. However, their broader application has been hampered by the scarcity of general and efficient synthetic methods. To address these challenges, we have developed a visible-light-driven radical-radical coupling strategy enabled by chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. In this synergistic dual catalytic system, β-keto esters are activated by CPA and undergo single-electron oxidation to generate tertiary carbon radicals, while redox-active NHPI esters derived from α-amino acids are reduced via SET to form α-amino alkyl radicals. Under the chiral environment provided by CPA, these radicals engage in highly selective cross-coupling to afford β 2,2,3 -amino esters in good yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivity. This strategy provides a mild, modular approach for the stereo-controlled assembly of structurally complex β 2,2,3 -amino esters, overcoming long-standing limitations in substrate scope and reaction efficiency.

  abstract     = {Bulk water serves as an inert environment for lignin linkages, resulting in their natural half-lives that extend over centuries. In this study, we present the striking results of the spontaneous and ultrafast C─O/C─C bond cleavage of various lignin models in water microdroplets, yielding value-added aromatic chemicals. The β-O-4 linkages, the most abundant interunit linkages in natural lignin, were selectively cleaved at C β ─O bonds, producing phenols in yields exceeding 70%. Mechanistic studies elucidated that the cleavage of β-O-4 linkages is derived from the unique alkaline environment at the air–water interface of a negatively charged water microdroplet, even in the absence of extra alkalis. The challenging cleavage of the highly stable C α ─C β bonds in β-O-4 and β-1 lignin linkages was also accomplished, yielding valuable benzoic acid product. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the oxidation of the substrates by molecular oxygen is the key step for the C α ─C β bond cleavage. Notably, all intermediates, including the fragile peroxide intermediates, were identified using mass spectrometry. Accompanied by evidence from radical scavenging and 18 O labeling, the mechanisms for the selective C─O/C─C bond cleavages have been unambiguously characterized, paving a new and green way for the cleavage of lignin linkages.},

  abstract     = {Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are Cu-containing enzymes that play a crucial role in lignocellulosic biomass degradation for use in biofuel production. These enzymes carry out the selective oxidation of C─H bonds in the sugar units, leading to the cleavage of the glycosidic bond. Creating LPMO mimics facilitates the study of the mechanism of action, the characterisation of the reactive species responsible for the C─H bond activation and the potential scale up for industrial application. Here, we report the design, structural and functional characterisation of two novel Cu-binding β-hairpin peptides, called HisPins, that mimic the Histidine-brace site of LPMOs. Activity assays were conducted with p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (PNPG) and demonstrate that the Cu-HisPins show LPMO-like activity on the model substrate. Furthermore, the Cu-HisPins can also perform light-driven oxidation of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) in the presence of melanin, similarly to some LPMO enzymes. Hence, the Cu-HisPins represent the first structural and functional LPMO mimics based on short, folded peptide sequences and show a light-stimulated melanin-mediated oxidative activity, which is unreported for any LPMO mimic characterised so far. Thus, this work paves the way to further exploration of LPMO mechanism, structure-activity relationship and substrate scope expansion.},

  abstract     = {Superstructures assembled from nanoscale polyoxometalates (POMs) attract considerable interest due to their well-defined architectures and outstanding physicochemical properties. However, the targeted synthesis of self-assembled POM-based superstructures with high-efficiency electrocatalytic performance remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the rational design and construction of three POM-based superstructures with ultrathin graphene-like morphologies and well-organized frameworks via a simple self-assembled method, in which transition metals (TMs) bridge POMs into graphene-like planes, while cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) serves as an intercalation agent, endowing the structures with high surface area and enhanced electronic conductivity. Among the resulting materials (denote as POM-CTAB-TM, TM═Co, Ni, or Cu), POM-CTAB-Co exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieving a low overpotential of 292 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 . In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical calculations underscore that the Co atoms within the POM serve as active sites and facilitate the rate-determining step of *OOH formation. Moreover, an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer employing POM-CTAB-Co as the anode and Pt/C as the cathode demonstrates exceptional performance, delivering a current density of 2 A cm −2 at a cell voltage of 2.247 V, along with remarkable durability exceeding 2000 h at an industrial-grade current density of 500 mA cm −2 . This study develops a simple and efficient method for synthesizing supramolecular POM-based nanosheets as OER electrocatalysts.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical upcycling of organic pollutants in wastewater into value-added chemicals presents a dual solution for water treatment and sustainable synthesis, yet achieving high Faradaic and energy efficiencies remains challenging. Here we, for the first time, report the paired electrolysis strategy to produce valuable cyclohexanol and para -benzoquinone ( p -BQ) simultaneously from phenol in wastewater. More importantly, to address the dilemma of mismatched operation conditions between cathodic hydrogenation and anodic oxidation, we propose a pulse current strategy with alternating high-/low-current periods, which ensures the reduction kinetics of phenol at the cathode while effectively preventing the over-oxidation of generated p -BQ at the anode. By using tailored PdRu/C and NiRu/C as the cathode and anode, the paired pulse system realizes 84.9% phenol conversion and 83.9% cyclohexanol yield at the cathode, alongside 100% phenol conversion and 68.5% p -BQ yield at the anode, with an exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 114.5% and ultra-low energy consumption of 0.064 kWh mol −1 . Carbon emission accounting and techno-economic analysis highlight its environmental benefits and economic feasibility (US$1.36 profit per kg phenol).

However, constructing effective Na + diffusion channels in these materials is very challenging. To address this issue, we design a new organic molecule, N,N ’-bis(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide (NDI-DTMA), containing a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) structure. The D–A–D architecture significantly enhances π-conjugation extent of single organic material while narrowing its bandgap, facilitating electron transportation along the NDI-DTMA skeletons. Moreover, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl groups not only suppress dissolution issue but also enlarge the intermolecular planar spacing for Na + mobility through constructing efficient transport channels. As an electrode material for SIBs, NDI-DTMA achieves a reversible capacity of 200 mAh g −1 after 2000 cycles at 1 A g −1 owing to its fast Na + kinetics. Through systematic investigation on the anomalous capacity increase and the dynamic evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), we have elucidated the fundamental mechanisms that the distinctive NDI-DTMA architecture enables exceptional energy storage performance. This work pioneers a design paradigm of organic small molecules that simultaneously address low solubility, high conductivity, and rapid ion transport, thereby providing a transformative strategy for SIBs.},

The method operates under continuous flow electrochemical conditions, avoiding the need for divided cells, strong chemical oxidants, or homogeneous transition-metal catalysts. The broad substrate scope includes a wide range of electron-rich, electron-deficient, and halogenated arenes, as well as heterocycles, demonstrating excellent functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the process is readily scalable, as shown by a 4-day continuous operation in parallel microreactors, producing over 100 grams of aniline product with high efficiency.

TUB41 demonstrates remarkable chemical stability across a wide pH range (1–11) and retains its structural integrity after 2 years of repeated adsorption cycles and activation at 80 °C under ambient humidity. Cryogenic adsorption experiments reveal that TUB41's pores selectively exclude gases with larger kinetic diameters, such as N 2 and Ar, while accommodating smaller molecules like CO 2 and H 2 O at elevated temperatures. The enthalpies of adsorption for CO 2 at a loading 0.01 mmol g −1 and H 2 O at a loading of 0.7 mmol g −1 are −41 and −38 kJ mol −1 , respectively, reflecting their strongly attractive interactions with TUB41 under different conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that CO 2 molecules adopt ordered arrangements in the central hydrophobic regions of the pores, guided by strong nonbonding interactions, while H 2 O molecules preferentially bind to the hydrophilic secondary building units. Mean-squared displacement analyses confirm that both gases remain spatially constrained within the pores. These findings highlight TUB41 as a chemically robust and highly selective MOF, with potential for applications in gas separation, photocatalytic water splitting, and CO 2 reduction under challenging conditions.},

However, limited by the large synthetic difficulties, functional biisoquinoline-containing polymers (BCPs) have rarely been reported. Furthermore, the construction of optically active BCPs via asymmetric catalytic polymerization have not been achieved so far. Herein, we developed a multicomponent cascade C─H activation/annulation polymerization (CAAP) strategy that can facilely convert readily available benzil derivatives, internal diynes, and ammonium acetate into structurally diverse BCPs via successive C─H activation and N -annulation processes in a one-pot and one-step operation. The rhodium-catalyzed CAAP reactions proceed efficiently under air, affording a variety of multisubstituted BCPs with high molecular weights ( M w up to 49900 g mol −1 ) in good yields. Benefiting from the unique structures, the resulting BCPs exhibit excellent solubility, good film-forming capability, and readily tunable luminescent properties. The luminescent thin films of a photosensitive BCP can be applied for the generation of multiscale fluorescent photopatterns with high resolution. Moreover, by using different chiral cyclopentadienyl rhodium catalysts, a series of optically active BCPs and BCP–metal complex with stable axially chiral configurations are in situ generated from the asymmetric CAAP reactions.},

Open-shell luminescent diradicals, featuring two unpaired and synthetically tunable spins, offer a molecular platform to achieve such control. However, previous studies have been restricted to symmetric systems, where spin interactions occur between two identical, luminescent radicals. Here, we demonstrate that a non-luminescent (dark) radical can effectively modulate the spin and photophysical behavior of a luminescent (bright) radical within an asymmetric diradical framework. The resulting molecule exhibits a unique three-stage magnetoluminescence (ML) response at low temperatures, arising from hyperfine coupling (HFC) ( B < 0.05 T), the Δg -induced spin mixing (0.05–0.8 T), and spin polarization (0.8–7 T). Notably, the system exhibits pronounced ML enhancement (>14%) under ultra-low magnetic fields ( B < 0.05 T), a previously unreported phenomenon in molecular spin-optical systems. These findings establish asymmetric bright–dark diradicals as a powerful new motif for spin-photon interface design, providing fresh insights into the fundamental photophysics of open-shell systems.},

  abstract     = {Electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes with water at nearly industrial current densities is highly important. However, a low interfacial alkyne–water ratio leads to severe hydrogen evolution, making it extremely challenging to obtain alkenes with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE). Here, a strategy involving fluorine···π interaction-induced alkyne concentration and orderly arranged sulfonate-repelled interfacial water-cation is developed over commercial Nafion-modified palladium nanotips, enabling electrolysis of 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBE) with up to 83% FE under −100 mA cm −2 . The fluorine···π effect concentrates the alkyne via its adsorption enhancement, promotes electron transfer, and lowers the activation energy, thus accelerating hydrogenation kinetics. Under the bias potential, the side chain of Nafion undergoing rearrangement from disordered to nearly ordered significantly decreases the interfacial free water coverage and activity, thereby reducing the amount of in situ-generated surface-active hydrogen, which contributes to suppressing hydrogen evolution and improving the FE. An 82% FE and 18.9 mmol h −1 reaction rate of MBE is achieved in a 10 h continuous electrosynthesis at 1.25 A, demonstrating potential utility. Furthermore, the hydrogenation and deuteration of different alkynes with improved Faradaic efficiencies at −100 mA cm −2 rationalize the design concept.},

  abstract     = {Although solvatochromic materials provide visual function to differentiate solvents, they fail to precisely monitor complex solvent environments where solvent composition varies dynamically, because of an insensitive absorptional shift in these environments. Relatively, their fluorescence signal change, which should be more sensitive, has always been inefficient, resulting from inherent challenges in excited-state dynamics. Here, we present a charge-rearrangement averaged dye design, instead of traditional donor-acceptor structures, to enable a high locally excited or twisted intramolecular charge transfer emission efficiency. A ratiometric dual-fluorescence behavior can be observed along with a solvent-dependent emission trade-off rather than complete quenching. In this case, the dyes can not only precisely visualize various mixed solvents but also enable heterogeneous detection with over hundreds of reuse cycles after being integrated into a crosslinked polymer. The leading portable material achieves a self-calibrated visual tracking of ethanol content (error<0.2%) with a robust working curve ( R 2 = 0.9992) while applied to E10 ethanol gasoline, operable via user-friendly software analysis through mobile phone photography.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous zinc-bromine (Zn-Br 2 ) batteries have emerged as promising candidates for grid-scale energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, their practical deployment is hindered by the dissolution of polybromide species at the cathode and their subsequent shuttling and corrosive reactions at the zinc anode, which severely limit areal capacity and cycling stability. Herein, a Taiji-inspired dual-electrode stabilization strategy is developed to synergistically regulate interfacial chemistry at both electrodes, enabling durable high-areal-capacity Zn-Br 2 batteries. This design leverages the dynamic balance of opposing yet complementary electrostatic interactions, facilitating targeted attraction (Yin) and repulsion (Yang) of polybromides at cathode/anode interfaces, respectively. At the cathode, positively charged quaternary ammonium groups in poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) enable strong electrostatic binding to polybromides, effectively confining them within the cathode and preventing diffusion into the electrolyte. Simultaneously, a lotus-leaf-biomimetic interphase with high electronegativity and hydrophobicity is constructed on Zn anode to repel polybromides and suppress parasitic reactions. Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopic analyses confirm the effective suppression of polybromide shuttling and Zn corrosion. Consequently, the optimized KB-PDDA//Zn@ZnO-PFNA cell achieves a high areal capacity of 5.5 mAh cm −2 and exceptional cycling stability exceeding 20000 cycles, highlighting the critical importance of dual-interface engineering for advancing practical Zn-Br 2 battery technologies.},

  abstract     = {The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (ECO 2 R) offers a promising pathway to convert CO 2 into value-added products. While catalyst advances remain crucial, gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) architecture is equally vital in CO 2 electrolyzer design. Most ECO 2 R studies use pure CO 2 feeds, whereas industrial sources like flue gas contain ∼15% CO 2 , requiring costly purification. Eliminating this step demands electrolyzers that directly process impure streams via in situ separation. Here, we introduce a composite GDE (CGDE) featuring a thin CO 2 -selective interlayer of intrinsically microporous polymer (PIM-1) reinforced with the CO 2 -philic ionic liquid [Emim][BF 4 ]. This layer selectively adsorbs CO 2 and suppresses N 2 /O 2 existence at the catalyst interface. In simulated flue gas (15% CO 2 , 5% O 2 in N 2 ), the CGDE with 20 wt% [Emim][BF 4 ]/PIM-1 achieved >70% CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) at 100 mA cm − 2 , versus ∼20% FE for a pristine GDE. Multiphysics simulations confirmed effective CO 2 delivery through the selective layer, with minimal O 2 permeation. Cost estimation analysis indicates around 25% reduction in CO's minimum selling price using the integrated design and >50% under ideal performance metrics by eliminating compression/transport. These results demonstrate that advanced electrode design with CO 2 -selective interlayer enables direct mixed-gas ECO 2 R, establishes key design criteria for selective layers, and significantly improves process economics.},

We determined the SEC parameter | T xyz | to be 2.04(16) × 10 −10 m · V −1 , two orders of magnitude larger than the effective value directly extracted from comparing the signal intensity, as validated by our electric-field-modulated (EFM) continuous-wave EPR experiments and simulation program. The coherence time of this Ce(III) qubit is 24.1(13) µs at 5 K with dynamical decoupling and the electric control efficiency is approaching 0.1 Hz · m · V −1 .

However, there is a general concern on the dissolution of Cr 2 O 3 , calling for the development of environment-friendly metal oxides. Here, we employ phenylphosphonic acid (PPOA) as a model surface modifier to decorate the model Rh@CeO 2 cocatalysts and demonstrate the critical role of organic surface passivation in H 2 evolution catalysis. We identify a “surface passivation effect” in photocatalysis, wherein the PPOA modification on CeO 2 overlayers not only suppress the adsorption and activation of oxygen but exhibit strong resistance to hydrogen reduction during POWS. This dual functionality effectively suppresses the reverse reactions by blocking the redox cycle of exposed Rh sites and defective CeO 2 overlayers, resulting in significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability. Importantly, this strategy is not limited to Rh@CeO 2 -PPOA systems; it also improves POWS performance in systems where other reducible oxides-organophosphonic acids structure are used as passivation layers on other noble metal cocatalysts. These findings provide fundamental insights into the universal principles of surface passivation in photocatalysis and offer a practical framework for regulating the reverse reactions and provide guidance for optimizing POWS through targeted surface organic modification.},

  abstract     = {Electroplating technology is crucial for interfacial engineering due to its flexible controllability and excellent protective performance. However, electroplated coatings often exhibit uneven deposition morphology due to the uncontrollable nucleation and growth of metal grains, which results in degraded coating performance. Here, we propose ligand coordination equilibria (LCE) that creates a dense coating by simultaneously modulating the solvation structure and optimizing the reduction process, exemplified by Al/Zr alloy electroplating. Multiscale calculations revealed that Cl − coordination with AlCl 3 and ZrCl 4 forms a dynamic equilibrium between active ionic species Al 2 Cl 7 − and ZrCl 5 − , which is predominantly governed by AlCl 3 due to its stronger Lewis acidity. This coordination mechanism was directly validated by Raman spectroscopy. The dynamic equilibrium between Al 2 Cl 7 − , which dominates nucleation density and growth rate, and ZrCl 5 − , which increases the interfacial diffusion barrier, synergistically promotes the small-sized alloy grain. The resulting compact microstructure significantly enhanced the hardness (268 HV) and corrosion resistance (−0.78 V versus SCE) of the coating, far surpassing that of conventional aluminum alloys coatings. This work highlights the innovative use of LCE for interfacial engineering by tailoring the dynamic equilibrium of active ionic species, providing new insights for the industrial electroplating of high-performance alloys.},

However, the impact of high-entropy component compatibility on electrodes’ lattice stress and kinetics remains underexplored. Herein, a series of high-entropy PBAs are served as cathode materials for SIBs. The tailoring Na 2 Mn 0.2 Fe 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 [Fe(CN) 6 ] (HE-Cu) with superior mechanochemical compatibility shows superior phase stability without obvious lattice stress and faster electron/ion transfer kinetics.

Serious Jahn–Teller structural distortion and unstable octahedron, observed in Na 2 Mn[Fe(CN) 6 ] with complicated Na-ion storage phase evolution (monoclinic ↔ cubic ↔ tetragonal), can be entirely suppressed by high-entropy effect, appearing a zero-strain solid-solution reaction mechanism for HE-Cu employing Mn, Fe, and Co-ions as redox centers to involve in charge compensation. Consequently, HE-Cu presents high initial specific capacity of 120.4 mAh·g −1 , superior rate capability and outstanding cyclability with ultra-long cycling life of 9000 cycles with the lowest capacity-decay-rate of 0.0042% per cycle.

Here, we introduce a pioneering slurry-based strategy leveraging Hofmeister “salting-in” effect to disperse binders in a poor-solvent environment, dramatically expanding the applicable binder spectrum. The copolymer poly(vinylidenefluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVTC) was uniformly dispersed in tetrahydrofuran via Li-salts mediation, reducing chain aggregate to hundreds of nanometers. PVTC with reduced size was homo-dispersed in the Li 6 PS 5 Cl slurry, enabling the film-formation of SSE/ PVTC composite electrolytes (SCEs) with an ultra-low resistance of 0.69 Ω cm −2 , synchronously facilitating the formation of continuous polymer networks to provide mechanical cushioning that stabilizes interfaces during cycling. The high dielectric PVTC enhances Li-salts dissociation, eradicating conduction barriers and establishing efficient Li + -pathways. Notably, the excellent thermal transfer capability of SCEs enables direct lamination onto electrodes, enabling industrial manufacturing. ASSBs featuring LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 cathodes and silicon-based anodes exhibited energy densities exceeding 380 Wh kg −1 and retained 80% capacity over 750 cycles.

The modified electronic structure electrostatically inhibits Cl − corrosion as well as promotes H 3 O + adsorption, creating a local acidic microenvironment in the natural seawater, neutralizing OH − and effectively avoiding Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ deposition. In situ spectroscopy and local pH monitoring confirm the pivotal role of the microenvironment in regulating reaction kinetics and stability.

  abstract     = {Selective proteolysis remains a significant challenge with relevance to industrial and pharmaceutical applications, motivating development of chemical strategies emulating the specificity of natural proteases. Here, we report that the discrete Zr-oxo nanocluster-based solid, [Zr 17 O 8 (OH) 24 (OH 2 ) 12 (HCO 2 ) 12 (SO 4 ) 8 ] · 6 HCl · 30 H 2 O (Zr 17 ) serves as an efficient, recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for site-selective proteolysis with tunable fragment selectivity. A combination of solution- and solid-state NMR spectroscopy highlighted the importance of the ligand environment of solid Zr 17 for enabling efficient protein-cluster interaction and controlling reactivity. We demonstrate that Zr 17 achieves a proteolytic performance comparable to natural enzymes while allowing fine modulation of peptide product profiles by adjusting reaction parameters. Substrate adsorption and product desorption were found to be governed by the net charge of both catalyst and substrate, as well as rapid reorganization of the cluster's capping ligands, according to UV-Vis/IR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Crucially, the insoluble nature and excellent stability of Zr 17 , evidenced by pair distribution function analysis, allowed reuse across multiple catalytic cycles, overcoming a major limitation of proteolytic systems. This study reveals how cluster surface chemistry governs substrate interaction and catalysis, guiding rational design of next-generation cluster-based catalysts, including hybrid materials such as metal-organic frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Due to the presence of residual tensile strain, as well as the inherent brittleness and film quality of the perovskite, flexible perovskite solar cells (f-PSCs) face ongoing challenges in stability. To address these issues, this study introduces a multi-hydroxyl regulated stress management strategy for f-PSCs. Three hydroxyl-substituted phenylacetic acids (p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 2-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid) are incorporated into the perovskite films to investigate the significance of their interaction modes with perovskite in regulating f-PSC performance. These multi-hydroxyl molecules, through their progressively enhanced synergistic interactions with the perovskite, effectively promote greater energy dissipation during stress deformation, reducing the Young's modulus of the perovskite by 11.1% and decreasing the thermal expansion coefficient of perovskite film by 38.5%, thereby improving the mechanical strength of the f-PSCs. Additionally, the multi-hydroxyl molecules regulate the excess PbI 2 during the fabrication process of perovskite, enhancing the film quality and optimizing the energy level alignment. As a result, the inverted f-PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.01%. These devices demonstrated excellent mechanical and thermal stability, retaining 90% of their original PCE after 3000 bending cycles, and maintaining 83% of their initial PCE after continuous heating at 85 °C for 1000 h.},

Herein, we introduce a “Hydrogen-Bond-Directed Modular Assembly” strategy for the rational construction of ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals. In this strategy, programmable hydrogen-bonding schemes serve as a predictive handle to propagate local asymmetry into a macroscopic polar network. Using an explicit modular design algorithm, we selected three building units—C 3 H 3 O 4 − , C 4 H 5 O 4 − , and C(NH 2 ) 3 + —and assembled them into two one-dimensional polar chain modules, [C(NH 2 ) 3 C 3 H 3 O 4 ] ∞ and [C(NH 2 ) 3 C 4 H 5 O 4 ] ∞ . These modules crystallize as two new UV NLO materials, C(NH 2 ) 3 C 3 H 3 O 4 and C(NH 2 ) 3 C 4 H 5 O 4 , which exhibit excellent linear and nonlinear optical properties. By shifting the synthetic focus from serendipitous screening to hydrogen-bond-guided, module-level engineering, our strategy establishes a predictive framework for the a priori design of NCS structures with tailored properties.},

In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking photoredox-catalyzed radical relay process that accomplishes direct C─N bond cleavage in unstrained cyclic amines, thereby enabling the efficient construction of highly functionalized 9–11-membered lactams adorned with a Z-olefin moiety. Remarkably, our methodology exhibits exceptional compatibility with a broad spectrum of acids, encompassing α-amino acids, peptides, and carboxylic acids, thus facilitating the ring expansion of readily accessible propiolamides. Control experiments and computational investigations provide compelling evidence that the ring expansion mechanism is initiated via a reductive radical-polar-crossover-induced C─N bond cleavage, offering profound insights into the underlying reaction dynamics. This advancement not only broadens the synthetic methodology for medium-ring lactam construction but also paves the way for future explorations in complex molecule synthesis and drug discovery.},

In this study, a tandem-triggered transition system is presented that enables the transformation of single-phase coacervates into multiphase structures through the sequential application of two external stimuli: pH and salt concentration. A polyanion containing acid-labile amide bond is incorporated into the membrane-less coacervates. Upon exposure to an acidic pH, hydrolysis of the amide bond induces charge reversal from polyanion to polycation, triggering the first transition from single-phase to nested multiphase coacervates. This transformation alters the spatial redistribution and viscosity of coacervate components and influences sequestration behavior toward various (macro) molecules. Subsequently, the introduction of hypertonic environment as secondary stimulus induces selective dissociation and structural reconfiguration of nested multiphase coacervates into vesicular-like multiphase coacervates, further altering the coacervate components' fluidity and partitioning properties. Notably, the diverse inherent properties of coacervates among this tandem-triggered transition enables the variation of spatial organization for enzymatic reactions. Overall, the findings demonstrate a strategy for the sequential control of coacervate structural reconfiguration through dual stimuli, providing a versatile platform for the development of programable and adaptive coacervate-based protocells.},

Here, we report the exploration of the synergy between the concave π-extended tetrathiafulvalene (exTTF) and the curved CPP scaffold for constructing the rigid, conjugated nanohoop exTTF[10]CPP . X-ray analysis reveals a unique spherical packing arrangement in which six adjacent nanohoops interlock through concave and convex interactions. Interestingly, fluorescence studies revealed that exTTF[10]CPP exhibited unexpected anti-Kasha emissions originating from higher excited states, along with Kasha emission from S 1 excited state in toluene and THF. However, in a PMMA film, it displayed a redshifted Kasha emission. The unique Kasha/anti-Kasha dual-emission behavior represents a rarely explored photophysical phenomenon within exTTF derivatives and nanocarbon-based systems. Ultraviolet-Visible (UV–vis) absorption investigations showed that exTTF[10]CPP demonstrated reversible redox responsiveness with tunable binding affinity for C 60 up to 1.92 × 10 6 M −1 . Notably, femtosecond transient absorption measurements further revealed a prolonged lifetime of the charge-separated state, C 60 •− /exTTF[10]CPP •+ , which provides sufficient time for charge utilization. This exceptional charge-transfer property enhances the photocurrent in C 60 ⊂exTTF[10]CPP -based cast film, which is 2.43 times higher than that of exTTF[10]CPP alone, highlighting its potential in photoelectronic device.},

In response to these issues, here we report a copper-catalyzed asymmetric BER of azaarene-derived 1,2-diketones with simple alcohols to give diverse α-azaaryl-α-hydroxy esters. It is proposed that the azaarene nitrogen and the adjacent carbonyl group chelate copper to form a five-membered metallacycle, initiating the subsequent stereoselective 1,2-nucleophilic addition step. Meanwhile, enantiocontrol over vicinal diketones was achieved by a tailored bisoxazoline (BOX) ligand with two rigid, long, and terminally bulky sidearms. This study overcomes the incompatibility between azaarenes and BOX ligands, and also unlocks asymmetric catalytic 1,2-azaarene migrations.},

This system employs a dual-lock mechanism—combining tetrazine quenching and twisted intramolecular charge shuttle (TICS) dynamics—to maintain an ultra-low fluorescence background in the precursor state, even under aggregating conditions. Upon bioorthogonal reactions and molecular aggregation, the resulting AIEgens exhibit tunable emission peaks ranging from 605 to 665 nm, large Stokes shifts (up to 201 nm), and an exceptional fluorescence enhancement (up to 1033-fold). Their high biocompatibility and spatial precision allow for multiplexed, simultaneous labeling of intracellular targets. Compared to conventional fluorogenic and bioorthogonal probes, these AIEgens exhibit a sigmoidal amplification response, enabling the sensitive discrimination of subtle biomarker expression differences and the effective identification of injured cells during disease progression.

DFT calculations reveal that the adsorption capacity of *CO varies under different interfacial electric field intensities for the Cu, Ag/Cu, Pd/Cu, and Au/Cu models. Accordingly, we design three kinds of self-evolution tandem catalysts and investigate the adsorption and migration behaviors of *CO under interfacial electric fields. Electrochemical CO 2 reduction test results indicate that the higher CO selectivity of Au/Cu is attributed to its weak *CO adsorption capacity, confirmed by in situ attenuated total reflection-infrared and in situ Raman. The low C 2+ selectivity of Pd/Cu is owing to its high reaction energy barrier and low catalytic activity. In contrast, Ag/Cu achieves a high FE C2+ of 89.2% and a partial current density (j c2+ ) of 553.9 mA cm −2 thanks to the low reaction energy barrier and moderate *CO adsorption capacity. COMSOL multiphysics simulations reveal that the effect of the interfacial electric field on *CO external migration could be neglected in the nanometer range. Although a strong interfacial electric field increases the energy barrier for internal migration of *CO, the enhanced adsorption capacity of *CO still dominates C–C coupling in the *CO-rich microenvironment over tandem catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Carbon dioxide capture and functionalization sequesters carbon dioxide in more robust products and offers a viable route to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We present herein a unique molecular Ti III oxo anion that reversibly binds CO 2 to allow both its sequestration and functionalization. The reduction of [(PN) 2 Ti═O] ( 1 ) [PN = (2-P i i Pr 2 -4-methylphenyl)(mesityl)amide] with KC 8 and 2.2.2-cryptand (crypt) resulted in formation of [K(crypt)][(PN) 2 Ti═O] ( 2 ), which was fully characterized and shown to contain a Ti-centered radical. Complex 2 reacts with Al(CH 3 ) 3 to form [K(crypt)][(PN) 2 Ti{O(Al(CH 3 ) 3 }] ( 3 ), which can be independently prepared from [K(crypt)][(PN) 2 Ti(OCP)] and Al(CH 3 ) 3 . Whereas 1 does not react with CO 2 , 2 rapidly captures the gas (1 atm, 25 °C) to produce a Ti III carbonate [K(crypt)][(PN) 2 Ti(κ 2 -O 2 C═O)] ( 4 ). Chemical and electrochemical oxidation of 4 releases CO 2 to regenerate 1 while a soluble organic carbonate [Me 3 SiOC(O)OSiMe 3 , Me = CH 3 ] is obtained from reaction of 4 with ClSiMe 3 .},

Its substrate scope has progressively expanded to include internal disubstituted and, more recently, gem -disubstituted alkenes. Herein, we report the first examples of Wacker-type oxidation of trisubstituted alkenes under Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalysis. In the presence of Selectfluor (2.3 equiv) and a catalytic amount of Pd(MeCN) 4 (BF 4 ) 2 (10 mol%), exocyclic trisubstituted α , β -unsaturated carbonyl compounds undergo a fluorinative one-carbon ring expansion to deliver 2-fluoro-1,3-dicarbonyl compounds in good yields. The reaction displays broad functional group tolerance, including alkyl halide, aryl halide, alkyl tosylate, hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, ester, secondary amide, ketone, cyano, and N -phthalimide. While a semi-pinacol rearrangement of the Pd(IV) intermediate is a plausible mechanistic pathway given the excellent nucleofugality of the Pd(IV) atom, preliminary studies suggest that a 1,2-alkyl/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement is operative in product formation.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous zinc-ion batteries suffer from electrolyte-induced degradation despite their inherent safety advantages. While localized high-concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) mitigate interfacial instability, the excessive cation–anion association elevate ionic transport barriers, resulting in sluggish migration kinetics. Herein, ion-decoupled LHCE (ID-LHCE) are proposed using amphiphilic 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propanol (TFP) as anion-affinity diluent. The TFP-mediated anion-diluent matrix (ADM) liberates anion OTF − from Zn 2+ solvation sheaths, which maintains Zn 2+ -enriched nanodomains while significantly reducing ionic transport barriers with an elevated Zn 2+ transference number of 0.72. ADM decouples aqueous networks into biphasic H 2 O-rich/poor nanodomains, establishing a localized environment with attenuated water activity that suppresses hydrogen evolution reaction. Concurrently generated water-deficient interfaces and dehydrated OTF − coordination environment synergistically facilitate the construction of dense gradient heterogeneous SEI: an inner ZnF 2 -ZnS inorganic layer and an outer oligomer layer, enabling dendrite-free zinc deposition with ultralong cyclability (3,000 h at 1 mA cm −2 ) and 99.88% coulombic efficiency. Full cells paired with NaV 3 O 8 ·1.5H 2 O cathodes retain 72.5% capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at 0.5 A g −1 . Practical viability is demonstrated by the stable operation of high mass loading ampere-hour-level pouch cells (1.04 Ah). By correlating molecular interactions, nanoscale phase separation, and macroscopic ion migration, this work establishes a multiscale design paradigm for electrolyte nanostructure.},

In this work, we successfully develop a novel electrolyte by effectively modulating the competitive solvation process in LMBs. In this formulation, the C─O─C motifs of glymes are competitively substituted by other anions and solvents to achieve single oxygen site coordination, thereby facilitating a weak solvation effect. At an apparent concentration of 1.25 M, a solvated sheath enriched with anions and single oxygen-bound complexes is formed, which significantly enhances lithium metal compatibility and promotes rapid desolvation kinetics. The designed electrolyte using weakly solvated structures exhibits remarkable stability at both 25° and 80 °C, enabling the lithium iron phosphate (LFP)||Li cell to achieve over 2000 cycles (capacity retention: 90%) and 500 cycles (capacity retention: 96%), respectively. Interestingly, the low N/P ratio LFP||Li (N/P = 1.8) full battery maintains a stable capacity over 50 cycles, and the commercial 1.1 Ah LFP||Li pouch cell shows a great stability (capacity retention: 91.0%, CE: 99.82%) over 20 cycles.

HDAC6 is involved in multiple cellular processes, yet its protein interaction network remains poorly understood. To uncover novel HDAC6 substrates, we performed an acetylome analysis of HDAC6 knockdown cells, which served as a basis for the design of an HDAC6-trapping peptide library containing hydroxamic acids. Most probes enriched HDAC6 from cell lysates stronger than HDAC1. Proteomic profiling of the trapping probes revealed a preferential enrichment of HDAC6 and resulted in the identification of novel putative HDAC6 interaction partners. Among those were several components of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB that were independently confirmed as HDAC6 binders. Mechanistically, HDAC6 counteracted NF-κB activity induced upon p300-catalyzed acetylation of NF-κB p50. These findings indicate a potential anti-inflammatory function of HDAC6 in NF-κB signaling.},

FLipA-HIPS is essentially nonfluorescent but reacts with aldehydes to give an environmentally sensitive fluorophore with a higher quantum yield in SDS micelles as compared to aqueous buffer alone. FLipA-HIPS reacts with lipidic aldehydes to give 10- to 25-fold higher fluorescence intensities than reactions containing either short-chain aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes in aqueous buffer. Confocal microscopy shows that live cells pretreated with potassium bromate or the aldehydic phospholipid “POVPC” display rapid and selective FLipA-HIPS staining that co-localizes with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), consistent with the ER's known role in accumulating lipidic aldehydes.

While current research primarily targets more reactive catalytic lysines buried in the ATP-binding pocket, no systematic rational strategy has yet been developed for selectively engaging surface-exposed lysines. Herein, we present a versatile strategy for developing cell-active covalent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) by selectively targeting unique surface-exposed lysines using squarate chemistry. By using Aurora A (AURKA) as a proof-of-concept, we systematically evaluated this approach against other well-known lysine-reactive warheads (e.g., EBA, SO 2 F, and OSO 2 F) and demonstrated, for the first time, squarates’ superior efficacy in engaging these challenging low-reactivity lysines. Amongst various AURKA CKIs, AL8 emerged as the first-in-class squarate-based, cell-active inhibitor, exhibiting excellent selectivity in both biochemical and cellular assays with long-residence time in covalently engaging endogenous AURKA. Detailed investigation of effects of leaving groups on squaric esters provided valuable insights for future development of lysine-reactive CKIs. Our finding has established squarate-containing ligands as a unique and readily tunable platform for covalent modification of surface-exposed, non-catalytic lysines in targeted kinase drug discovery.},

Within this context, quasi[8]circulenes and indenofluorenes (IFs) have gained considerable attention due to their rich chiroptical, optoelectronic, supramolecular, and redox properties. However, their combined integration into a single molecular framework has not yet been realized. This work demonstrates that curved indeno[2,1- c ]fluorene quasi[8]circulenes are easily accessible through an intramolecular cyclization of a readily available helicene diketone. The cyclization is high yielding and accompanied by an unexpected regioselective triflation that—alongside both ketones—allows orthogonal functionalization. This synthetic utility offers great potential for incorporating 8-membered rings and formally antiaromatic as -indacene moieties into complex architectures. Herein, a series of fully conjugated antiaromatic indeno[2,1- c ]fluorene quasi[8]circulenes were synthesized and studied spectroscopically and electrochemically, showcasing the rich properties of these rare, purely carbon-based quasi[8]circulenes. It is shown that the studied compounds display multiple accessible redox states at mild potentials, which can be significantly altered through adequate substituents. These substituents additionally induce unprecedented aggregation behavior for one of the compounds. Furthermore, the studied IFs exhibit chirality arising from the curved structure of the quasi[8]circulenes, which allowed studying chiroptical properties for one of the structures.},

However, the inherent contradiction between the fluctuating nature of renewable energy and the need for stable operation in electrochemical processes significantly hinders their development and implementation. To mitigate this, we propose a robust two-electron oxygen reduction reaction system using O-coordinated Co single-atom catalysts for the electrosynthesis of environmentally friendly hydrogen peroxide. It excels in stability and efficiency across various operating conditions, including steady-state, start−stop cycles, and fluctuating power inputs. At a current density of −50 mA cm −2 , the system sustains over 55 stable start−stop cycles with an average Faradic efficiency above 96%. The high selectivity and durability are attributed to the reservoir-containing O-coordinated Co single-atom sites and the self-healing capability of gas diffusion electrodes. Furthermore, we evaluate its practicality under simulated photovoltaic power supply scenarios in the field of smart agriculture, particularly for integrated fertilization, disinfection, and irrigation.

  abstract     = {Porous materials are important for many technologies, but the measurement of porosity by gas adsorption isotherms is slow, taking around one day per sample using a single-port gas sorption analyzer, even when using a “quick” analysis method with relatively few data points. With the increased use of automated platforms for material generation, porosity analysis is now frequently the bottleneck in the discovery of new porous materials. Here, we present a semiautomated pre-screening strategy that uses dye adsorption to create a colorimetric array that is combined with computer vision analysis for porosity screening. By using a six-dye multichannel array and a defined porosity threshold, our method rapidly screened 50 candidate materials that spanned molecular solids, polymers, and metal–organic frameworks. The method showed a 98–100% classification accuracy compared with gas uptake measurements. While this method is more qualitative than quantitative, it is more than 30 times faster than conventional gas sorption measurements, and it has the scope to be made much faster with greater parallelization and automation. This makes this colorimetric method suitable for pre-screening arrays of materials to choose samples that merit more detailed conventional porosity analysis.},

  abstract     = {Degradation of synthetic polymers inevitably leads to the formation of nanoplastics (NPs), and recent studies associate health risks with NPs. Therefore, catching and degrading NPs are important to manage environmental and human health risks. In this study, we developed a biohybrid catalyst system with two functionalities to capture (Hook) and degrade (Decay) NPs. The biohybrid catalyst is composed of a Grubbs-Hoveyda (GH) type cofactor conjugated to the material-binding peptide LCI_F16C, which immobilizes the GH-cofactor onto superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The anchored biohybrid catalyst initiates a ring-opening metathesis polymerization to generate a hydrophobic polynorbornene film around iron oxide core, which enables to efficiently capture and remove a broad spectrum of hydrophobic NPs, including polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene (PS), poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(methyl methacrylate), and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), with hydrophobic interaction as the main driving force. This hydrophobic coating facilitated rapid adsorption of PS-COOH 500 nm NPs within 10 min, reaching an impressive adsorption capacity of 5.53 ± 0.29 g/g on PS NPs, and demonstrated a high recovery efficiency of 99% for SBR NPs. Notably, the embedded GH-cofactor preserved its ethenolysis activity, cleaving internal C═C bonds of SBR and resulting in 6.5% degradation, thereby validating the concept of simultaneous nanoplastic capture and catalytic breakdown.},

We, herein, report a nickela-electrocatalyzed approach for the expedient synthesis of β -arylated pyrroles via a unique multiple dehydrogenative C─H activation approach. Hence, direct C─C bond formation between pyrroles and arenes was enabled, obviating the need for prefunctionalized substrates. The reaction proceeded under electrochemical conditions in a user-friendly undivided cell, utilizing electricity as a traceless oxidant. Mechanistic studies, including cyclic voltammetry, provided support for a nickel(II/III/IV) regime, wherein anodic oxidation facilitates the dehydrogenation and C─H activation paired with the valuable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our findings highlight the potential of electrocatalysis to unlock distinct reaction manifolds and provides a sustainable platform for accessing complex heteroaryl frameworks.},

Two proof-of-concept emitters, m-Cz-DABNA and tBu-Cz-DABNA , were synthesized via high-yield, lithium-free borylation. These emitters exhibit pure-blue emissions at 453 and 463 nm with narrow full-width at half-maximums (FWHMs) of 24 and 21 nm in solution and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 88% and 95%, respectively. OLED devices based on m-Cz-DABNA and tBu-Cz-DABNA show emissions at 456 nm (FWHM 24 nm, EQE max 23%, CIEy 0.06) and 467 nm (FWHM 24 nm, EQE max 26%, CIEy 0.10), respectively, holding among the highest efficiencies for blue OLEDs without sensitizers. Notably, the tBu-Cz-DABNA -based device shows an LT 90 of ∼81 h at 1000 cd m − 2 (EQE 8.95%), representing one of the longest operational lifetimes for blue fluorescent OLEDs with CIEy ≤ 0.10.

Rh-NS/Rh-NR, characterized by a high density of unsaturated coordination sites and a large specific surface area, greatly enhances the adsorption capacity of NO 2 − and crucial intermediates and lowers the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of *NOH formation from *NO. Consequently, Rh-NS/Rh-NR exhibits satisfactory Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.7% and a remarkable NH 3 yield rate of 44.3 mg mg cat −1 h −1 for NO 2 RR at high reduction potential (0.00 V). Using Rh-NS/Rh-NR as cathode, the assembled zinc–nitrite battery delivers excellent discharge performance (24.2 mW cm −2 ) and promising NH 3 synthesis capacity (5.96 mg mg cat −1 h −1 ).

This prompted our hypothesis that confining hydrolases and substrates to distinct biomolecular hierarchies (e.g., a protein and its modifying glycans) could enable transmission of spatial proximity information through localized hydrolysis. Using New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), we developed a localized hydrolysis-based proximity reporting (LHPR) platform for in situ elucidation of the hierarchical architecture of glycoproteins. We constructed protein probes by conjugating target-recognizing molecules with NDM-1, and designed click chemistry-reactive, substrate-caged fluorescent molecules as glycan probes. Programmed NDM-1 activity enabled in situ protein-specific imaging of glycans via proximity-dependent activation within various biological specimens. Within a unified enzymatic framework, we successfully quantified distinct glycans of individual proteins and established the principle of protein-specific glycosylation stoichiometry analysis. Our work provides a powerful tool for developing glycoprotein-based disease biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and diagnostic approaches, offering new possibilities for precision medicine research.},

This dual-functional synergy yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.11% in our best device.

Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon-related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H 2 O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H 2 O is critical during CO 2 RR process, as H 2 O molecules are directly involved in CO 2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid–liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper-based catalyst containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities to investigate the influence of H 2 O molecules on CO 2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H 2 O molecules, instead of asymmetric H-bonded H 2 O or ice-like H 2 O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO 2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C 1 FE to 70% C 2 FE. We unveil, via in situ ATR-SEIRAS measurement, that the H 2 O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO 2 reduction pathways.},

Despite longstanding interest in reprogramming these systems for metabolic engineering and biosynthetic chemistry, the mechanisms underlying their reaction order remain poorly understood and difficult to control. Here we describe a β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase from Pseudomonas putida ( Pp FabG4) with an unusual selectivity for medium chains and use it to explore the molecular basis of substrate specificity in enzymes that pull intermediates from fatty acid synthesis, a common route to specialized products. X-ray crystallography shows no obvious barriers to short-chain binding. Molecular simulations and supporting mutational analyses indicate that substrate preference arises instead from a weak enzyme–ACP interaction that is stabilized by medium acyl chains but not by short chains. Indeed, mutations that strengthen this interaction for Pp FabG4 or weaken it for Ec FabG, an Escherichia coli β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase with a broad substrate specificity, can enhance or reduce activity on short-chain substrates by over 100-fold. Our findings show how the stability of enzyme-ACP interactions can control substrate scope in promiscuous enzymes and guide the exchange of intermediates between (and within) assembly-line systems.},

  abstract     = {The synthesis of sterically hindered α-tertiary and β-quaternary (neopentylic) ethers has long been constrained by the limitations of traditional S N 2 and related S N 1 approaches, namely low or inexistent reactivity arising from severe steric hindrance or competitive elimination/rearrangement pathways diverting the reaction outcome. Herein, we describe a general solution to the synthesis of sterically hindered ethers via an iridium-catalyzed reductive deoxygenation reaction of readily available ester and lactone starting materials. Employing commercially available, bench-stable IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF 3 ) 2 ] 3 ) 2 as a precatalyst at 1 mol% loading with 4 equivalents of tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDS) as the terminal reductant at room temperature, this practical synthetic approach to hindered ethers features a simple, mix-and-stir, single-vessel protocol under ambient conditions and produces a diverse range of both acyclic and cyclic ether products in good to excellent yields. Control experiments demonstrated that the IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF 3 ) 2 ] 3 ) 2 /TMDS catalytic system could not only rapidly hydrosilylate esters to mixed silyl/alkyl hemiacetal intermediates but also catalyze the reduction of acetals directly to ethers, revealing the Lewis acidic and hydridic properties required for this deoxygenative transformation.},

  abstract     = {The duality of nitrate is nowhere better exemplified than in human physiology—a detrimental pollutant but also a protective nutrient—particularly as connected to nitric oxide. Aside from limited insights into nitrate uptake and storage, foundational nitrate biology has lagged. Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors can address this gap with real-time imaging, but such technologies for mammalian cell applications remain rare. Here, we designed and engineered a biosensor fusing the green fluorescent protein EGFP and the nitrate recognition domain NreA from Staphylococcus carnosus . Seven rounds of directed evolution and 15 mutations resulted in NitrOFF. NitrOFF has a high degree of allosteric communication between the domains reflected in a turn-off intensiometric response ( K d ≈ 9 µM). This was further reinforced by X-ray crystal structures of apo and nitrate-bound NitrOFF, which revealed a large-scale conformational rearrangement changing the relative positioning of the domains by 68.4°. This dramatic difference was triggered by the formation of a long helix at the engineered linker connecting the two domains, peeling the β7 strand off the EGFP and thus extinguishing the fluorescence upon nitrate binding. Finally, we highlighted the utility of NitrOFF to monitor exogenous nitrate uptake and modulation in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line.},

  abstract     = {Ammonia from nitrate-containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag-N/O bonds on one-dimensional WO 3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The resultant catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeding ∼90% over a potential range of −0.6 to −0.2 V RHE with a maximum FE approaching 100% at −0.4 V RHE and a maximum NH 3 yield at −0.55 V RHE . Importantly, the catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm −2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ∼94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), we succeeded in obtaining an NH 3 production rate of 12.75 mmol h −1 at −4 V and maintained the stability for over 30 h with FE > 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis have demonstrated that the formation of Ag-N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of *NO→*NHO, thereby considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities. This work provides insights into acidic nitrate reduction for ammonia electrosynthesis, which develops corrosion-resistant electrocatalysts for energy conversion.},

  abstract     = {Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) catalyzes the conversion of cysteine with dioxygen to yield cysteine sulfinic acid, which lies at the branching point of cysteine catabolism. Despite many years of research there are still many questions related to its functioning. Thus, CDO is inactive with selenocysteine (Sec) or when the central iron ion is replaced by cobalt. In this context, we report here biomimetic CDO models with bound selenocysteamine substrate ligands, namely [Tp Mes Fe(Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )] and [Tp Mes* Fe(Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )] (with Tp Mes = hydrotris(3-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)borate, Tp Mes* = hydrobis((3-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)(5-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)borate) and in addition a cobalt-analogue [Tp Mes Co(Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )]. Upon treatment of the Fe/Se homologues with O 2 – as in case of the parent cysteamine-bound complexes – the dioxygenation of the chalcogen atoms was observed. This suggests that the lack in reactivity of CDO-Sec toward O 2 does not originate in the electronic situation but in the surrounding protein matrix. Subsequent DFT calculations indeed showed lower initial barriers for selenocysteamine than for cysteamine in support of the experimental work. The complex [Tp Mes Co(Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )], where Fe is formally replaced by Co, also reacts with dioxygen – more slowly but selectively – to give [Tp Mes Co(O 2 Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )]. Hence, this is an experimental observation of a dioxygenation with O 2 mediated by a cobalt center in a molecular compound, which is so far without precedence.},

  abstract     = {Supramolecular polymerization of π-extended compounds with hydrogen-bonding sites remains challenging, especially at high concentrations, due to their limited solubility in nonpolar solvents. Herein, we report a novel method incorporating a thermal precursor approach for the supramolecular polymerization of a poorly soluble tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP) derivative with multiple hydrogen-bonding sites and chiral cholesterol groups ( BP Chol ). Polymerization in the nonpolar solvent tetralin is induced by the retro-Diels–Alder reaction of the highly soluble precursor ( CP Chol ) to BP Chol in the hot solution and subsequent natural cooling, as confirmed by monitoring absorption spectra. The emergence of circular dichroism signals corroborates the formation of aggregates with supramolecular chirality, as the first chiroptical characterization of BP aggregates. Detailed structural analysis using high-resolution microscopies reveals a unique pyramidal multilayer structure with a spiral nature. Additionally, faster cooling produces monolayer nanosheets, which differ from the multilayer structures formed upon natural cooling. This is due to a different nucleation process in the cooperative polymerization. By using the nanosheets as seeds, seed-induced polymerization is achieved, resulting in extended sheets. Notably, the indirect precursor method using CP Chol enables outstanding polymerization at high concentrations (mM level) to afford micro-sized pyramids, which cannot be realized by a direct method using BP Chol .},

  abstract     = {Peptide-based biosensors are widely used for in vitro detection of protease activity but often suffer from the limited sensitivity, poor accuracy, and incompatibility with point-of-care testing (POCT) devices. Herein, we developed a versatile deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme)-amplified protease-sensing (DP) platform that integrates the positively charged oligopeptides with a negatively charged DNAzyme biocatalyst for highly-sensitive protease detection. The system leverages the electrostatic peptide–DNAzyme interactions to inhibit DNAzyme catalytic activity, which is reactivated upon the protease-triggered peptide hydrolysis, thus enabling an efficient signal amplification via the successive cleavage of DNAzyme substrate. Compared to conventional peptide-based sensing platform, our DP system offers an enhanced sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio and is highly modular for detecting various clinically relevant proteases through a simple replacement of the peptide blocker. By introducing a dual-enzyme recognition mechanism, we developed a dual-protease-triggered DP platform for enabling the accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 proteases in saliva. We also applied the DP platform to differentiate between normal and cancerous colon cells and tissues by detecting colorectal cancer (CRC)-associated proteases. Overall, this work introduces a universal and scalable biosensing strategy for activity-based protease detection with potential applications in both infectious disease diagnostics and cancer classification, advancing the field of DNAzyme-based POCT technologies.},

Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) shows promise for detecting structurally similar analogs but faces challenges like subtle receptor signal changes and distortion with weakly adsorbing plasticizer analytes. We address these limitations by integrating direct and indirect SERS to capture intrinsic Raman signals and receptor-analyte interactions, achieving 100% classification accuracy eight plasticizer analogs and multiplex quantification of three major plasticizers extracted from canola oil with < 5% predictive errors at a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.01 mg L −1 , despite interference from other lipophilic contaminants such as adipates. Experimental SERS data and interaction energy calculations affirm that direct SERS detects alkyl chains, while indirect SERS identifies aromatic rings and carboxyl groups in eight plasticizer analogs with varying alkyl structures. A hybrid direct-indirect superspectrum was constructed, enabling the differentiation of eight analogs via Partial-Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and further analysis using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) reveals equal contribution from all platforms, which highlights their complementary roles. These findings pave the way for broader applications in rapid, on-site detection of complex contaminants across industries.},

Here, we report on two iodocuprate hybrids (HO 2 C(CH 2 ) n -1 NH 3 )CuI 2 ( n = 3, 4) exhibiting excitation-wavelength-dependent emission. The thermodynamically stable n = 4 compound (2D-C4) is based on a rare 2D iodocuprate network, while a more common 1D network of edge-sharing tetrahedra is found both in the n = 3 compound (1D-C3) and in the metastable n = 4 (1D-C4) hybrid. Depending on the excitation wavelength, 2D-C4 and 1D-C3 hybrids exhibit yellow emission, red emission, or white light emission—resulting from the emission of both components,—while 1D-C4 does not emit in the red region. The description of the electronic structure based on density functional theory (DFT) indicates two different origins for the emissions of 2D-C4 and 1D-C3, in particular from iodide vacancies (red emission), which involve mid-gap states. The emission of 2D-C4 can also be modulated from red to yellow depending on applied pressure. 2D-C4 also has an exceptionally low congruent melting temperature of 110 °C, allowing the solvent-free preparation of thin films. Finally, phosphor-converted-LED based on 2D-C4 have been prepared, showing that either pink or nearly white emission is produced.},

  abstract     = {Electronic structures fundamentally influence material properties, with electron spin playing a pivotal role in defining catalytic activity and reaction pathways. However, the precise spin-mediated mechanisms of adsorption energies and nitrogen–nitrogen transition states on the catalyst surface, remain unclear due to the complexity of spin-mediated promotion factors. Herein, we demonstrate that tuning the spin state of single iron (Fe) sites on TiO 2 can significantly enhance photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Our theoretical predictions reveal that low spin states of single Fe sites facilitate N 2 adsorption and intermediate formation, thereby activating more catalytic sites on TiO 2 for efficient nitrogen fixation. By manipulating the crystal phase and incorporating fluorine dopants, we systematically modulate the spin states of Fe sites, achieving optimized N 2 adsorption and desorption kinetics and suppressing charge recombination. Experimental results combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that these modifications reduce the magnetic moment of Fe sites, lower free energy barriers, and strengthen electronic interactions with key intermediates, particularly during N─NH formation. Intriguingly, we find that weakening N 2 adsorption via reduced Fe magnetization enhances catalytic performance, challenging conventional assumptions that stronger N─N bond activation necessarily improves NRR efficiency. Our experimental results corroborate these findings, showing a remarkable 72-fold increase in ammonia production rate compared to pristine TiO 2 . This work highlights the crucial role of electron spin engineering in designing highly efficient NRR catalysts and provides a new paradigm for rational catalyst design.},

  abstract     = {Modular assembly of multivalent therapeutics with precise modulation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties remains a critical challenge in drug development. Here, we present ATPlug, a self-assembling protein platform that integrates three crucial functional modules: a trimerization domain to enhance avidity, a SpyCatcher module for efficient conjugation, and an albumin-binding domain to optimize pharmacokinetics and tissue selectivity. This rational design facilitates the modular assembly of multivalent artificial antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), demonstrating remarkable versatility through the successful incorporation of diverse therapeutic modules targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The trivalent constructs exhibited up to 30-fold enhancement in target binding avidity and extended plasma half-life via endogenous albumin hitchhiking. Notably, the ATPlug-customized modular ADCs achieved binding affinities of 1.8 nM for EGFR and exhibited selective cytotoxicity toward EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells, resulting in potent tumor suppression efficacy. This plug-and-play strategy provides a framework for next-generation therapeutics combining customized multivalency with multidrug synergies.},

  abstract     = {Water transport across biological membranes is essential for life, facilitated by water channel proteins like aquaporins (AQPs). Drawing inspiration from these natural systems, artificial water channels (AWCs) have emerged as transformative tools for advancing industrial and environmental applications. Herein, we report the design and comprehensive characterization of a groundbreaking class of AWCs, derived from unprecedented butterfly-shaped aromatic folding synthons, carefully engineered to emulate the functional attributes of natural AQPs. These foldamers, with their intricate helical architectures, exhibit exceptional water transport performance. Remarkably, the highest-performing AWC achieves an ultrafast water transport rate of 2.6 × 10 10 H 2 O s −1 per channel—2.4 times the efficiency of AQP1—without the need for lipid anchors to preserve its functional orientation within phospholipid bilayers, while effectively excluding salts such as NaCl and KCl, along with protons. This work presents an ideal bio-inspired, high-performance artificial alternative to natural systems, demonstrating the remarkable potential of foldamer-based AWCs as next-generation solutions for tackling critical challenges in water purification and desalination.},

  abstract     = {Controlling product selectivity in electrochemical CO 2 reduction (eCO 2 R) is critical for efficient CO 2 conversion. However, the dynamic structural changes of Cu-based catalysts during operation complicate mechanistic understanding. Here, we investigate fluorine-modified copper pre-catalysts with varying doping levels and reveal how their structural evolution governs eCO 2 R activity and selectivity. Through operando spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical simulations, we show that fluorine leaches rapidly during electrolysis, transforming Cu 2 ⁺ precursors into metallic Cu⁰ with distinct local structures. Cu-F-4, with the lowest coordination number, exhibits high eCO 2 R activity and favors CO formation with a Faradaic efficiency (FE CO ) of 81% at −0.45 V. In contrast, Cu-F-1, enriched in grain boundaries and Cu(100) facets, achieves a high FE C2+ of 80% at −0.65 V. Differences in local pH, *OH coverage, and *CO binding energies further modulate catalytic pathways. Our findings highlight the importance of dynamic catalyst reconstruction in steering product selectivity and offer design principles for advancing CO 2 -to-chemicals conversion.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO 2 where CO 2 enrichment and purification is an energy-intensive process. Herein, we report a Co-COOH-COF with an asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO 2 . The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst, Co 17.7 -COOH-COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1 mmol g −1 h −1 from neat CO 2 and 180.5 mmol g −1 h −1 from 40 vol% CO 2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g −1 h −1 from neat CO 2 and 116.0 mmol g −1 h −1 from 40 vol% CO 2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state-of-the-art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits a widely and continuously adjustable CO/H 2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the covalent organic frame (COF) by the formation of atomically dispersed N–Co–O 4 sites and enhances dissociation of water and CO 2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO 2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for the design of high-performance catalysts for the photoreduction of CO 2 to syngas.},

  abstract     = {Photoenzymatic catalysis facilitates stereoselective new-to-nature chemistry under mild conditions. In addition to the rational design of artificial photoenzymes, naturally occurring redox enzymes can be repurposed to promote photoredox catalysis in the chiral protein environment. Here, we show that enzymes utilizing the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) cofactor expand the toolbox of photobiocatalysis. PQQ absorbs visible light and is capable of single-electron transfer. It thus exhibits mechanistic similarities to flavin cofactors, which are widely used for photoenzymatic approaches. First, we established the trimethyl ester PQQMe 3 as a stand-alone photoredox catalyst in pure organic solvent. Upon excitation, PQQMe 3 enables the redox-neutral radical cyclization of an N -(bromoalkyl)-substituted indole. We then tested a panel of PQQ-dependent sugar and alcohol dehydrogenases for photoenzymatic catalysis in aqueous buffer, focusing on a redox-neutral radical reaction to form oxindoles. Under optimized reaction conditions, we obtained a 69% yield and an 82:18 enantiomeric ratio. Our work thus demonstrates that PQQ enzymes are capable of stereoselective photoredox catalysis. Future enzyme engineering efforts based on computational modeling and directed evolution will fully unlock their synthetic potential.},

  abstract     = {Single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs) are designed by covalently bonding anions to the polymers, which is attractive for mitigating anion aggregation-derived polarization. However, one major challenge for developing SICPEs with higher ambient ionic conductivity comes at the expense of structural robustness. Here, boron ion-centered lithium salt (LiT4PAB) with symmetric cross structure and terminal functional C═C was proposed as a units, and then 3D coordination electrolyte (LiPHB) was constructed via chemical cross-linking of LiT4PAB with poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP). The boron ion-centered units catenated by single bonds show the abundant conformation transitions, enabling the deformable architecture of LiPHB with the aid of electrostatic interactions of diphenylsulfonimide. Therefore, LiPHB undergoes adaptive deformation when subjected to impact, achieving good ductility with elastic moduli of 1.4 GPa and a maximum elongation of 447.4%. Moreover, LiPHB demonstrates 3D single lithium-ion transport channels to guide the homogeneous lithium deposition. As a results, lithium symmetric cells exhibit stable plating/stripping cycle for over 1500 h at 0.1 mA cm −2 at 30 °C. Li/LiPHB SICPEs/NCM811 solid-state batteries deliver a capacity retention of 90.3% in 150 cycles at 30 °C and 0.2 C.
