  abstract     = {The interaction between air jets and hairy yarns is an important aspect in textile machinery. Currently, there is a need for high-fidelity two-way coupled Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) simulations of a hairy yarn subjected to high-speed air flows in textile processing, as these models are vital to understand yarn dynamics in, for example, air-jet weaving looms. Therefore, this work develops a fully three-dimensional two-way coupled FSI framework for modeling the yarn dynamics in air-jet weaving. The framework combines an adapted version of the Actuator Line Method (ALM) for the flow with beam elements for the structural representation of the yarn. This enables computationally efficient simulations at the machine scale without the need for resolving fiber-level details. Instead, these properties—derived in earlier work using microscale simulations—are homogenized into aerodynamic force coefficients and structural material parameters, resulting in a multiscale modeling approach. The framework is first validated on the launch of a nylon monofilament yarn, demonstrating its ability to predict yarn velocity and transversal oscillations while reducing the computational cost compared to existing overset mesh methods. In a second step, the method is applied to a hairy staple-fiber yarn, marking the first high-fidelity FSI simulation of such a system. The results confirm the potential of this approach for characterizing hairy yarn behavior in air-jet weaving without tuning of coefficients.},

  abstract     = {The Generalized/eXtended Finite Element Method (G/XFEM) augments standard FEM approximation spaces with functions tailored to represent well specific behaviors of a problem, such as those introduced by cracks in linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). The method allows mesh generation to be made independently of crack surfaces and achieves optimal first- and second-order convergence rates, while keeping the condition number of its global matrices under control. Regarding second-order G/XFEM formulations, it has been shown that when only singular enrichment functions able to represent the singularity are adopted, the convergence rate is still bounded by the second-highest crack singularity. In this case, mesh refinement around crack fronts is a strategy to recover optimal convergence. In this work, this is addressed by h-adaptive mesh refinement algorithms. To this end, first, a Zienkiewicz and Zhu block-diagonal (ZZ-BD) error estimator is proposed for three-dimensional (3-D) LEFM problems. For that, the most challenging part is the definition of good recovery enrichment functions that are able to represent the crack singularity. These functions are proposed in this work based on the derivatives of enrichment functions commonly adopted in the G/XFEM context. It is shown that the use of these new singular recovery enrichment functions in the recovery process of the ZZ-BD error estimator leads to estimated discretization errors that are very close to the exact discretization errors. Also, the performance of the error estimator becomes much better than if one adopts recovery enrichment functions commonly used in 2-D. Finally, with a good error estimator able to also quantify the distribution of discretization errors over the domain and along crack fronts, adaptive algorithms are developed. Herein, h-adaptive techniques are proposed to recover optimal second-order convergence for G/XFEM and enhance its usability in such a way that final discretizations meeting a user's pre-specified tolerance on the discretization error are delivered on the fly by the adaptive procedure. 3-D LEFM numerical experiments with increasing levels of complexity are used to assess the ZZ-BD effectivity as well as to show that the proposed h-adaptive algorithms can, at a reasonable computational cost, deliver accurate discretizations at optimal convergence rates.},

  abstract     = {The partitioned approach for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations involves solving the structural and flow field problems sequentially. This approach allows separate settings for the fluid and solid subsystems, ensuring modularity and leveraging advanced commercial and open-source software capabilities to offer increased flexibility for diverse FSI applications. Most partitioned FSI schemes apply the Dirichlet–Neumann partitioning of the interface conditions. The Dirichlet–Neumann coupling scheme has proven adequate in a wide range of applications. However, this coupling scheme is sensitive to the added-mass effect and is susceptible to the incompressibility dilemma, that is, it completely fails for FSI problems in which the fluid is incompressible and furnished with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the part of its boundary complementary to the interface. In the present paper, we demonstrate that if the fluid is incompressible and the fluid domain is nearly- closed, in the sense that the fluid domain is furnished with Dirichlet conditions except for a permeable part of the boundary where a Robin-type condition holds, then the Dirichlet–Neumann partitioned approach is sensitive to the flow resistance at the permeable part and, in particular, convergence of the partitioned approach deteriorates as the flow resistance increases. The Dirichlet–Neumann partitioned approach then becomes arbitrarily unstable in the limit of vanishing permeability, that is, if the flow resistance passes to infinity. Based on a simple model problem, we establish that in the nearly closed case, the convergence rate of the Dirichlet–Neumann partitioned method depends on a so-called added-damping effect . The presented analysis provides insights that can be leveraged to improve the robustness and efficiency of partitioned approaches for FSI problems involving contact, such as valve opening/closing applications. In addition, the results elucidate the incompressibility dilemma as a formal limit of the added-damping effect passing to infinity, and the corresponding challenges related to FSI problems with nearly closed fluid-domain configurations. Based on numerical experiments, we consider the generalization of the results of the simple model problem to more complex, nearly closed FSI problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel computational framework for modeling complex thermo-mechanical fracture behavior. A high-order element formulation is established on the basis of the hierarchical quadrature element method (HQEM) to perform spatial discretization of transient heat conduction problems. Due to the use of hierarchical, high-order shape functions, temperature gradients can be effectively captured even on relatively coarse meshes. The discretized transient heat conduction equation is subsequently solved using an implicit time integration scheme, specifically, the backward difference method. Numerical validation against the commercial software ABAQUS demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed approach in simulating heat transfer and predicting thermoelastic deformation fields under mixed thermal boundary conditions. Furthermore, HQEM is integrated with the virtual crack closure method (VCCM) for the evaluation of fracture parameters in two-dimensional cracked structures subjected to coupled thermo-mechanical loadings. Within the VCCM framework, a unified explicit expression of the virtual crack closure integral is derived for HQEM with arbitrary nodal configurations. The integration of HQEM with VCCM significantly reduces mesh refinement requirements and preprocessing effort compared to conventional FEM. Case studies confirm that the integrated HQEM–VCCM approach yields accurate solutions for fracture parameters of cracked structures under coupled thermo-mechanical conditions.},

To address the issue of decreased computational accuracy of the material point method (MPM) near physical domain boundaries, a Gaussian kernel function with kernel correction is employed to establish the interpolation formulas between particles and the background grid.

  abstract     = {The long-term performance of pavement structures is influenced by the combined effects of repeated traffic loads and environmental conditions, such as temperature variations. Traditional numerical approaches face significant challenges in simulating the decades-long lifespan of pavements due to the vast disparity between the time scales of individual loading events and the overall lifespan. This paper presents a novel framework for the thermo-mechanical analysis of pavement structures, based on a time homogenization technique to efficiently predict long-term performance. An Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation is employed to simulate the mechanical response of pavements to consecutive tire overruns, while a thermo-mechanical material model accounts for the effects of temperature variations. A key innovation is the treatment of history variables (HVs). The framework incorporates both spatial and temporal mapping of HVs, enabling the extrapolation of material behavior when the evolution rate of HVs stabilizes. This allows for the skipping of computationally expensive tire overruns, significantly reducing simulation time without compromising accuracy. Numerical examples demonstrate the framework's ability to predict the long-term response of pavement structures under realistic traffic and thermal conditions.},

  abstract     = {Reduced-basis methods (RBMs) constitute a promising technique for delivering numerical solutions of parameterized PDEs in real time and with reasonable accuracy. The most significant drawback of RBMs is the requirement of parametric affinity, a condition that only very trivial problems satisfy. Without parametric affinity, the reduced model cannot be quickly assembled in the online stage. The most common solution to this issue is to establish a form of approximate parametric affinity. However, most methods for doing so are highly intrusive: they require in-depth expert knowledge of the problem to be solved, of the high-fidelity simulation software for solving it, or both. It is often impossible to adapt a high-fidelity software package for RBMs without significant source-code edits. We present an approach for approximate affinization based on least-squares projected quantities over a predetermined function space. We contend that this offers a method for affinization with minimal impact, which we demonstrate by producing linear elastic RBMs for components using two widely different simulation software packages, without source code edits and with no significant expert knowledge.},

FFT-based methods were originally developed for periodic boundary conditions, and recent work provided extensions to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the unit cube faces by utilizing dedicated sine and cosine series. Unfortunately, such approaches were only developed for discretizations that fail to converge for complex porous microstructures. The article at hand closes this gap by constructing the appropriate Eshelby-Green operator for the displacement gradient associated with the staggered grid discretization and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The eponymous staggering of the displacement variables infers certain challenges to be resolved, that is, the construction is significantly more difficult than for the cases discussed in the literature.

  abstract     = {This work presents a novel stabilized bipenalty formulation for explicit contact-impact analysis, aiming to enhance traditional bipenalty methods and resolve issues associated with a large mass penalty parameter. To address this challenge, two key contributions are introduced. First, a new formulation integrates the bipenalty method with a predictor-corrector scheme, enabling a more accurate penetration estimation by dividing the computational process into prediction and correction phases. This separation ensures that the mass penalty affects only the contact forces, thereby eliminating undesirable mass effects on internal forces when a large mass penalty parameter is used. Second, new criteria tailored to the predictor-corrector scheme are proposed for two types of contact problems: the flexible-rigid case and the flexible-flexible case. Unlike traditional bipenalty methods, which rely on stability conditions for explicit time integrators, the proposed criteria focus on enforcing the kinematic constraints. As a result, any predicted penetration is eliminated during the correction phase, leading to zero penalty energy. Stability analysis confirms that the computation of the gap within the correction phase maintains stability. Contact impact examples are performed in 1D, 2D, and 3D and demonstrate that the proposed method provides improved stability and superior performance compared to the penalty and traditional bipenalty methods for various contact scenarios, including extremely large penalty parameter cases.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian optimization is a popular and versatile approach that is well suited to solve challenging optimization problems. Their popularity comes from their effective minimization of expensive function evaluations, their capability to leverage gradients, and their efficient use of noisy data. Bayesian optimizers have commonly been applied to global unconstrained problems, with limited development for many other classes of problems. In this article, two alternative methods are developed that enable rapid and deep convergence of nonlinearly-constrained local optimization problems using a Bayesian optimizer. The first method uses an exact augmented Lagrangian and the second augments the minimization of the acquisition function to contain additional constraints. Both of these methods can be applied to nonlinear equality constraints, unlike most previous methods developed for constrained Bayesian optimizers. The new methods are applied with a gradient-enhanced Bayesian optimizer and enable deeper convergence for three nonlinearly-constrained unimodal optimization problems than previously developed methods for constrained Bayesian optimization. In addition, both new methods enable the Bayesian optimizer to reach a desired tolerance with fewer function evaluations than popular quasi-Newton optimizers from SciPy and MATLAB for unimodal problems with 2 to 30 variables. The Bayesian optimizer had similar results using both methods. It is recommended that users first try using the second method, which adds constraints to the acquisition function minimization, since its parameters are more intuitive to tune for new problems.},
