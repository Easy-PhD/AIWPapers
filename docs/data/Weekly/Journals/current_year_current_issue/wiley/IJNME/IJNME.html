  abstract     = {Based on the dimensional splitting method (DSM) and an improved complex variable element-free Galerkin (ICVEFG) method, the complex variable dimension coupling method (CVDCM) is proposed to analyze 3D inhomogeneous transient heat conduction problems. The original 3D governing equation is split into a collection of 2D forms by the dimensional splitting method (DSM), and the discrete equation of the 2D problem is derived via the ICVEFG method. The splitting direction is then treated by using the finite element method (FEM), while the time-dependent term in the governing equation is handled by the finite difference method (FDM). Finally, the numerical solution formula is obtained. To verify the accuracy of the CVDCM, the ratio of the L 2 norm to the true value is used as the relative error. The convergence of the proposed method is demonstrated by increasing the number of nodes and meshes. Five numerical examples of transient inhomogeneous heat conduction problems with spatially varying material properties (density, specific heat capacity, and thermal conductivity) are solved using the CVDCM; the results show that the proposed method achieves good convergence and achieves higher accuracy compared to the dimension coupling method (DCM) and the improved element-free Galerkin (IEFG) method in five examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a fresh perspective on solving two-parameter singularly perturbed parabolic convection-diffusion-reaction equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The methodology integrates the Crank–Nicolson (CN) scheme for discretizing temporal derivatives and applies the Trigonometric Quintic B-splines (TQBS) approach to approximate both the state variable and its spatial derivatives on an exponentially graded mesh. Through a meticulous convergence analysis, the study establishes a parameter-uniform convergence of fourth order in space and second order in time. To verify the theoretical claims and evaluate the method's efficacy, four test examples are solved using the numerical algorithm, offering tangible evidence of the parameter-uniform convergence of the proposed numerical scheme. Additionally, the paper includes a graphical comparison of the proposed method with Shishkin meshes, providing empirical evidence of its efficacy and parameter-uniform convergence.},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization has experienced rapid development over the past two decades and has been widely applied in fields such as aircraft structures, civil engineering, and transportation equipment. Common topology optimization methods, such as density-based methods and level set methods, focus on global variable optimization. These global optimization approaches often consume substantial computational resources and are not suitable for parallel optimization. In contrast, structures in nature evolve from a combination of numerous local optimization problems, where each cell unit adjusts on the basis of its perception of the surrounding environment, leading to the formation of biological structures. This paper proposes a novel heuristic topology optimization method, the biomimetic moving-mesh (BMM) method, inspired by biological cell growth and evolution. The BMM method uses the positions of mesh nodes as variables to simulate cellular expansion and contraction, thereby creating a new optimization approach. Compared with traditional topology optimization methods, the BMM method offers smoother meshes and is more suitable for handling large-scale parallel optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {The classical material point method (MPM) is particularly suitable for large deformation problems with surface contact, but its capability to capture size effects remains relatively limited. In order to capture the size effect widely observed in solid materials as well as to eliminate mesh dependency, we present an F-bar B-spline MPM for solving finite strain-gradient plasticity in the micromorphic approach. A multiplicative finite strain thermoplasticity model is first regularized in a micromorphic approach, where a global internal variable is introduced to take into account the size effect. An implicit B-spline MPM is developed to solve the coupled problem in a monolithic manner with consistent linearization. This implementation provides a general framework to incorporate phenomenological elasto-plasticity models while preserving the prescribed size effect in the MPM. Although B-spline basis function is effective in suppressing the volumetric-locking deformation pattern when volume-preserving plasticity model is used, severe stress oscillation may manifest when the deformation mode approaches the incompressible limit. Therefore, we propose an F-bar method for the implicit B-spline MPM to suppress the spurious stress oscillation. The exact linearization of the F-bar method and its coupling with the balance equation of micromorphic momentum are derived in closed form. Three representative numerical examples are presented to validate our implementation and demonstrate the advantages of our method. Results show that the proposed method is effective in capturing the size effect at extreme conditions with large distortion and contact, and the F-bar method suppresses the spurious stress oscillations associated with volume-preserving plastic flow. One limitation is that the convergence behavior is less satisfactory when strain-softening model is used due to the inherent limitation of the implicit MPM.},

  abstract     = {Focusing on the homogenization of periodic composite materials, this study investigates computational methods based on volume integral equations. Such formulations are revisited from the standpoint of the preconditioning of the original cell problem by the introduction of a comparison material. This allows for to recovery of simple convergence criteria for iterative steepest-descent and fixed-point schemes for composites with general non-linear behaviour. In the case of linear materials, the preconditioned volume integral formulation coincides with the well-known Lippmann–Schwinger equation. The spectral properties of the featured linear integral operator, which is bounded and self-adjoint, are investigated to shed light on the behaviour of conventional computational homogenization methods. The so-called Lippmann–Schwinger spectrum is analyzed, with its bounds governing the convergence rate of iterative solution methods. The associated eigenvectors, which constitute the eigenstates of the composite material considered, are also described in detail to understand their role in constructing the solution to the cell problem and ultimately in computing the effective properties. Formulated in the continuous setting, this analysis is followed by the investigation of a discrete representation of the integral operator considered. A number of examples on synthetic microstructures are finally considered in the conductivity setting to illustrate the obtained theoretical results and highlight the role of the spectral properties in the operation of computational homogenization methods. This paves the way for the development of reduced models and more efficient computations.},
