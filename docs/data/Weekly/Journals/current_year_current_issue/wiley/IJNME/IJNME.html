  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel computational framework for modeling complex thermo-mechanical fracture behavior. A high-order element formulation is established on the basis of the hierarchical quadrature element method (HQEM) to perform spatial discretization of transient heat conduction problems. Due to the use of hierarchical, high-order shape functions, temperature gradients can be effectively captured even on relatively coarse meshes. The discretized transient heat conduction equation is subsequently solved using an implicit time integration scheme, specifically, the backward difference method. Numerical validation against the commercial software ABAQUS demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed approach in simulating heat transfer and predicting thermoelastic deformation fields under mixed thermal boundary conditions. Furthermore, HQEM is integrated with the virtual crack closure method (VCCM) for the evaluation of fracture parameters in two-dimensional cracked structures subjected to coupled thermo-mechanical loadings. Within the VCCM framework, a unified explicit expression of the virtual crack closure integral is derived for HQEM with arbitrary nodal configurations. The integration of HQEM with VCCM significantly reduces mesh refinement requirements and preprocessing effort compared to conventional FEM. Case studies confirm that the integrated HQEM–VCCM approach yields accurate solutions for fracture parameters of cracked structures under coupled thermo-mechanical conditions.},

  abstract     = {This article follows a preference-based conflict situations model that extends the rough set approach to agents' preferences on issues gathered via pair-wise comparisons. The study focuses on defining and examining various types of consensus within this model, addressing strict and more relaxed disagreements. The consensus problem is then explored at the coalition level. The key properties and quantitative measures for evaluating consensus quality are discussed. Finally, the negotiation process is investigated. The first approach is based on the expanding range of preferences derived from different definitions of consensus, and the second is focusing on issues position adjustment in order-based conflict situation. Using examples, including a medical case with multiple specialists, the paper demonstrates the practical utility of the methods. In general, this work improves the understanding of preference-based conflicts and the possibility of consensus, contributing to more effective decision-making processes.},

  abstract     = {A smoothed total Lagrangian material point method (STLMPM) is developed in this study to effectively simulate dynamic problems involving large deformation in nearly incompressible soft materials. In this method, the governing equations are spatially discretized within the framework of the total Lagrangian material point method (TLMPM) and temporally discretized using an explicit time integration scheme. To address the issue of decreased computational accuracy of the material point method (MPM) near physical domain boundaries, a Gaussian kernel function with kernel correction is employed to establish the interpolation formulas between particles and the background grid. Furthermore, to mitigate volumetric locking caused by the nearly incompressible nature of soft materials, the F -bar method is further developed within the framework of TLMPM. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed STLMPM are demonstrated by several representative numerical examples, and the simulation results are compared with analytical solutions and other numerical methods.},

  abstract     = {The long-term performance of pavement structures is influenced by the combined effects of repeated traffic loads and environmental conditions, such as temperature variations. Traditional numerical approaches face significant challenges in simulating the decades-long lifespan of pavements due to the vast disparity between the time scales of individual loading events and the overall lifespan. This paper presents a novel framework for the thermo-mechanical analysis of pavement structures, based on a time homogenization technique to efficiently predict long-term performance. An Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation is employed to simulate the mechanical response of pavements to consecutive tire overruns, while a thermo-mechanical material model accounts for the effects of temperature variations. A key innovation is the treatment of history variables (HVs). The framework incorporates both spatial and temporal mapping of HVs, enabling the extrapolation of material behavior when the evolution rate of HVs stabilizes. This allows for the skipping of computationally expensive tire overruns, significantly reducing simulation time without compromising accuracy. Numerical examples demonstrate the framework's ability to predict the long-term response of pavement structures under realistic traffic and thermal conditions.},

Moreover, a method for calculating the remaining fatigue life of structures based on a combination of fracture mechanics and sequential methods has been proposed. Compared with the linear cumulative damage theory, the influence of structural crack size and external load sequence effects on structural fatigue life is considered. In addition, the remaining fatigue life of the crane girder structure was analyzed using the above method, and the accuracy of the proposed method was verified through comparative analysis.},

  abstract     = {Reduced-basis methods (RBMs) constitute a promising technique for delivering numerical solutions of parameterized PDEs in real time and with reasonable accuracy. The most significant drawback of RBMs is the requirement of parametric affinity, a condition that only very trivial problems satisfy. Without parametric affinity, the reduced model cannot be quickly assembled in the online stage. The most common solution to this issue is to establish a form of approximate parametric affinity. However, most methods for doing so are highly intrusive: they require in-depth expert knowledge of the problem to be solved, of the high-fidelity simulation software for solving it, or both. It is often impossible to adapt a high-fidelity software package for RBMs without significant source-code edits. We present an approach for approximate affinization based on least-squares projected quantities over a predetermined function space. We contend that this offers a method for affinization with minimal impact, which we demonstrate by producing linear elastic RBMs for components using two widely different simulation software packages, without source code edits and with no significant expert knowledge.},

  abstract     = {There is a variety of microstructured materials that involve voids and pores, for example, high-porosity foams, mechanical metamaterials, or composites involving defects due to damage and cracking, respectively. Computational methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) typically face convergence problems for such microstructures unless specific discretizations are used, most prominently the discretization on the staggered grid. FFT-based methods were originally developed for periodic boundary conditions, and recent work provided extensions to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the unit cube faces by utilizing dedicated sine and cosine series. Unfortunately, such approaches were only developed for discretizations that fail to converge for complex porous microstructures. The article at hand closes this gap by constructing the appropriate Eshelby-Green operator for the displacement gradient associated with the staggered grid discretization and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The eponymous staggering of the displacement variables infers certain challenges to be resolved, that is, the construction is significantly more difficult than for the cases discussed in the literature. However, our innovative techniques permit treating the class of microporous materials—which have a wide range of applicability—in a robust and efficient way. We showcase the superiority of the novel techniques via dedicated computational experiments.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian optimization is a popular and versatile approach that is well suited to solve challenging optimization problems. Their popularity comes from their effective minimization of expensive function evaluations, their capability to leverage gradients, and their efficient use of noisy data. Bayesian optimizers have commonly been applied to global unconstrained problems, with limited development for many other classes of problems. In this article, two alternative methods are developed that enable rapid and deep convergence of nonlinearly-constrained local optimization problems using a Bayesian optimizer. The first method uses an exact augmented Lagrangian and the second augments the minimization of the acquisition function to contain additional constraints. Both of these methods can be applied to nonlinear equality constraints, unlike most previous methods developed for constrained Bayesian optimizers. The new methods are applied with a gradient-enhanced Bayesian optimizer and enable deeper convergence for three nonlinearly-constrained unimodal optimization problems than previously developed methods for constrained Bayesian optimization. In addition, both new methods enable the Bayesian optimizer to reach a desired tolerance with fewer function evaluations than popular quasi-Newton optimizers from SciPy and MATLAB for unimodal problems with 2 to 30 variables. The Bayesian optimizer had similar results using both methods. It is recommended that users first try using the second method, which adds constraints to the acquisition function minimization, since its parameters are more intuitive to tune for new problems.},
