We establish sufficient conditions to ensure that nonuniform exponential contractions, nonuniform exponential expansions and nonuniform exponential dichotomies of impulsive differential equations persist within a wider range of perturbations. It is worth emphasizing that the new results provide some significant improvements of existing results in the case where the perturbations are not required to be sufficiently small. Moreover, the conditions of our conclusions even for differential equations without impulse are more relaxed. Finally, we illustrate our results with a concrete example.},

More specifically, a special structure R J ‾ + J $$ R\overline{J}&amp;#x0002B;J $$ is found in the construction of the Riemann solution. R J ‾ $$ R\overline{J} $$ is formed by a rarefaction wave R $$ R $$ and a discontinuity J ‾ $$ \overline{J} $$ attached to the wavefront of this rarefaction wave. It should be stressed that the rarefaction wave and the shock wave share the same wave velocity on this discontinuity J ‾ $$ \overline{J} $$ . In the asymptotic limits of the Riemann solutions, not all solutions converge to those of the conservation law equations when the perturbation parameters tend to 0 with the same initial data. What is interesting is that the vacuum and delta shock wave solutions are obtained by the small Riemann solution S + J $$ S&amp;#x0002B;J $$ , which consists of a shock wave S $$ S $$ followed by a contact discontinuity J $$ J $$ , where the small Riemann solution means that the solution whose structure remains unchanged for the solution of the Riemann problem of the macroscopic production model with modified Chaplygin gas under the small enough perturbation parameters.},

  abstract     = {Predator-prey models, such as the Leslie-Gower model, are essential for understanding population dynamics and stability within ecosystems. These models help explain the balance between species under natural conditions, but the inclusion of factors like the Allee effect and intraspecific competition adds complexity and realism to these interactions, enhancing our ability to predict system behavior under stress. To detect early indicators of population collapse, this study investigates the intricate dynamics of a modified Leslie-Gower predator-prey model with both Allee effect and intraspecific competition. We analyze the existence and stability of equilibria, as well as bifurcation phenomena, including saddle-node bifurcations of codimension 2, Hopf bifurcations of codimension 2, and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations of codimension at least 4. Detailed transitions between bifurcation curves–specifically saddle-node, Hopf, homoclinic, and limit cycle bifurcations–are also examined. We observe a novel transition phenomenon, where a system jumps from saddle-node bifurcation to homoclinic and limit cycle bifurcations. This suggests that burst oscillations may serve as an early warning of system collapse rather than simply a tipping point. Our findings indicate that moderate levels of intraspecific competition or Allee effect support coexistence of both populations, while excessive levels may destabilize the entire biological system, leading to collapse. These insights offer valuable implications for ecological management and the early detection of risks in population dynamics.},

In detail, nonlinear multisource disturbance encompasses the disturbances brought about by exogenous systems and norm-bounded disturbances. In this relation, two kinds of PDE-type disturbance observers are put forward for the purpose of estimating the disturbances produced by the exogenous systems. Subsequently, an output feedback-based secured control law is devised through the assistance of estimation information gathered from the constructed observer. In addition, hybrid cyber attacks are undertaken in the control channel with the goal of enhancing the security of the system. In this context, a Bernoulli distributed white sequence is utilized for the purpose of managing the randomness of cyber attacks. Also, the gain fluctuations in the control framework are considered within a structure of linear fractional form to improve the control design robustness. Apart from this, with the intent of addressing the norm-bounded disturbances, an extended dissipative technique is implemented. At the end, a numerical example accompanied by the simulation findings is provided to showcase the efficacy of the developed theoretical results and control mechanism.},

  abstract     = {The equivalence problem in differential geometry investigates whether two geometric structures can be transformed into one another through an appropriate change of variables. This issue is central to understanding the invariants associated with dynamical systems, which remain unchanged under such transformations. The Cartan equivalence method provides a powerful and systematic framework for addressing these problems by reducing complex equivalence questions to more tractable ones involving coframes and structure equations. In this study, we apply Cartan's method to second-order autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs), offering insights into the intrinsic geometric structure of these systems under coordinate transformations. Specifically, we examine a class of second-order ODEs that model nonlinear dynamical behavior, employing the pseudogroup of web transformations to identify differential invariants and symmetry classes. The study introduces a step-by-step construction of an invariant coframe, elucidates the structure equations governing the system, and provides a classification of the equations based on their differential invariants. Two representative physical systems are investigated in detail: the motion of a damped spring-mass system and the van der Pol oscillator. In addition to these applications, the paper explores the interplay between equivalence, symmetry reduction, and integrability. By leveraging Cartan's method, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the equivalence problem in the context of higher order differential equations, highlighting both the theoretical elegance and practical utility of the approach in uncovering hidden geometric features, symmetries, and conserved quantities.},

  abstract     = {The current manuscript introduces a single-strain dengue model developed from stochastic processes incorporating fractional-order transmission and recovery. The fractional derivative has been introduced within the context of transmission and recovery process, displaying characteristics similar to tempered fractional ( T F $$ TF $$ ) derivatives. It has been established that under certain condition, a function's T F $$ TF $$ derivatives are proportional to the function itself. Applying the following observation, we examined the stability of several steady-state solutions, such as disease-free and endemic states, in light of this newly formulated model, using the reproduction number ( R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ ). In addition, the precise range of epidemiological parameters for the fractional-order model was determined by calibrating weekly registered dengue incidence in the San Juan municipality of Puerto Rico, from April 9, 2010, to April 2, 2011. We performed a global sensitivity analysis method to measure the influence of key model parameters (along with the fractional-order coefficient) on total dengue cases and the basic reproduction number ( R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ ) using a Monte Carlo-based partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC). Moreover, we formulated a fractional-order model with fractional control to assess the effectiveness of different interventions, such as reducing the recruitment rate of mosquito breeding, controlling adult vectors, and providing individual protection. Also, we established the existence of a solution for the fractional-order optimal control problem. Finally, the numerical experiment illustrates that policymakers should place importance on the fractional-order transmission and recovery parameters that capture the underlying mechanisms of disease, along with reducing the spread of dengue cases, carried out through the implementation of adult vector control.},

We establish the unique existence and structural stability of subsonic potential flow in a multidimensional nozzle. This is accomplished by prescribing the electric potential difference on a noninsulated boundary from a fixed point at the exit, along with specifying the pressure at the exit. The Euler-Poisson system is reformulated into a second-order quasilinear elliptic system, and the key ingredient of the analysis is to gain the estimate of the corresponding linearized system.},

Steady-state and Hopf bifurcations are carried out in detail, especially under the degenerate conditions such as invalid simple eigenvalue condition or crossing condition. It is shown that the steady-state solutions under the violated simple eigenvalue are characterized by a coupling of two eigenfunctions, and the bifurcation direction from simple eigenvalue is supercritical or subcritical. Meanwhile, there is no nonconstant steady-state solution under the degenerate case of violated crossing condition. In addition, whether the transversality condition in Hopf bifurcation is true or not, instead of the center manifold theory, we apply the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method and the singularity theory to illustrate the existence and stability of periodic solutions as well as the bifurcation diagrams. But it is proved that the usual pitchfork Hopf bifurcation is changed to the transcritical bifurcation through the invalid transversality condition. Finally, some numerical simulations allow us to identify the influence of external current on the predicted dynamics. The novel results on the effect of degeneracy obtained in this paper shall complement classical theories and enrich numerical examples in the existing work.},

By employing the vector fields obtained from the optimal system, we efficiently transform the governing model into a collection of ordinary differential equations.

According to the credit period provided by the supplier to retailer, three distinct scenarios may arise among which are discussed in detail.

The model, represented by a system of ordinary differential equations, captures the complex interaction between the host's immune response and viral infection. The study focuses on the model's fundamental aspects, such as equilibrium analysis, computing the basic reproduction number ℛ 0 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ , stability analysis, bifurcation phenomena, numerical simulations, and sensitivity analysis. The analysis reveals both an infection equilibrium, which indicates the persistence of the illness, and an infection-free equilibrium, which represents disease control possibilities. Applying matrix-theoretical approaches, stability analysis proved that the infection-free equilibrium is both locally and globally stable for ℛ 0 < 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;lt;1 $$ . For the situation of ℛ 0 > 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;gt;1 $$ , the infection equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable via the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. We also studied the uniform persistence of the infection, demonstrating that the infection remains present above a positive threshold under certain conditions. The study also found a transcritical forward-type bifurcation at ℛ 0 = 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;amp;#x0003D;1 $$ , indicating a critical threshold that affects the system's behavior.

  abstract     = {Software has been increasingly important in many critical systems. To measure the growth of software reliability during testing phases, several software reliability growth models (SRGMs) have been investigated. Different from hardwares, softwares' failure mechanisms follow the basic rules of logic, behavior, and psychology rather than physical laws. Consequently, software testing phase embodies lots of epistemic uncertainties, which are not suitable to be modeled by probability theory-based SRGMs. In addition, fuzzy theory-based SRGMs may give counterintuitive results. Confronted with these, we proposed a software belief reliability growth model (SBRGM) under the framework of uncertainty theory which is a new mathematics system to deal with epistemic uncertainties. However, testing coverage, a key factor in software testing, has not been considered in SBRGM. Therefore, a novel SBRGM considering testing coverage, named SBRGM with testing coverage (TCSBRGM), is proposed in this paper. Based on belief reliability theory, several essential belief reliability indexes for software such as belief reliability and belief reliable time are considered. Unknown parameters in the proposed TCSBRGM are estimated. Finally, real data analysis using two real-world software testing data is carried out to compare the performance of our proposed model with some representative SRGMs. The results exhibit that the proposed model gives a better fitting and predictive performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies some deterministic mathematical models that seek to explain the expansion of Zika virus, as a viral epidemic, using published data for Brazil. Three SIR type models considering several aspects in the spread of the disease are considered with 3, 6, and 10 unknown parameters, respectively. The parameter identification is carried through a search algorithm based on a combination of a stochastic domain exploration and a heuristic calculation of a descent direction, in order to avoid stopping the algorithm at a local optimum. The models are validated using the epidemic data found. Finally, it was confirmed that the basic reproductive ratio is consistent with those previously reported in the literature. We conclude that the proposed optimization method improves computation time with respect to a genetic algorithm or an exhaustive search in the parameter space.},

  abstract     = {In nature, there is no ideal impulse response system. When the input is switched, the output cannot respond to this input instantaneously, which needs some time. This causes a transient oscillation process, which will inevitably affect the control accuracy, produce noise, and even cause fatigue damage. The usually adopted integer mathematical model is an ideal impulse response model and has no memory property. The fractional model has memory property, but the historical information before the switching time is usually lost. The transient oscillation process caused by intermittent control has rarely been reported in the obtained achievements with both the integer model and the fractional model. In this paper, based on the input-output property of a system, we have studied this transient oscillation. First, the impulsive response is approximated as a short memory model according to its decaying property. Second, the intermittent signal is treated as a piece-wise continuous signal to study. The study indicates that the transient oscillation is inevitable. This transient process is affected by the historical information within the memory length, and its duration is equal to the memory length. Different systems have different memory lengths. To optimize the transient oscillation process, we have to study the intermittent control approaches for different systems case by case. These do well with the engineering applications of intermittent control. Some numerical examples verify our theoretical analysis.},

Unlike the traditional approach, which replaces the Fourier kernel with the LCT kernel, this method employs convolution to capture the linear canonical spectrum over limited temporal intervals, constrained by a window function. This approach not only reduces computational complexity but also holds significant potential for applications in various scientific and engineering fields. We begin our investigation by examining fundamental properties of the proposed transform, such as the orthogonality relation, inversion formula, and characterization of the range, using tools from LCT and convolution theory. Further, we explore the time-frequency resolution and the uncertainty principles associated with the proposed transform. Additionally, we present several potential applications, including the Poisson summation formula, Paley-Wiener criterion, and a sampling formula. To support our theoretical findings, clear examples are provided throughout the paper.},

Given the mapping between traversal trees and cuts in a graph, we propose to deal with the problem from a new perspective, namely, cut enumeration. The algorithm enumerates the cuts using the depth-first traversal tree, locates the optimal tree per node with the smallest local cut, and compacts them for acceleration. Any node pair can be separated by compacted trees containing only one of them. Its serial implementation is validated to be effective in obtaining the accurate solution for 99.9% or more pairs of vertices in a graph. Its calculation time per pair is as low as a thousandth of that of the most efficient existing method, that is, several microseconds in a graph with tens of millions of edges using an off-shelf computing node, thus serving as an effective heuristic for min-cut approximation.},

Currently, it poses a significant health challenge in various regions, and there is concern that it may evolve into a more severe global threat. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic approach to modeling an influenza outbreak. The study begins by formulating a mathematical representation that incorporates random fluctuations influencing the disease's progression. We demonstrate that the proposed model guarantees a positive global solution. By utilizing Lyapunov functionals, we investigate specific parametric conditions under which the disease may be eliminated from the population. Additionally, an ergodic stationary distribution is used to demonstrate conditions under which the infection may persist. A threshold quantity is identified, offering insight into key parameters that influence other dynamic aspects of the model. The stochastic model of influenza is further examined through graphical representation for better understanding.},

This paper looks at modular businesses that have income and costs directly proportional to the number of units. This work assumes that all of the plants or units have the same capital cost, operating costs, and revenue and that the company reinvests all net profit into purchasing more units. Furthermore, this model ignores depreciation, inflation, fluctuating market prices, and market saturation. With these assumptions, the question of when the company can afford to scale and purchase the next unit is directly related to the payback period and the harmonic number. This work describes a novel growth function called the harmonic growth function based on harmonic numbers. This function is related to the standard ROI. The harmonic growth function is explained and applied to a micro combined heat and power (mCHP) station, a biomass company expanding the number of biorefineries, and biochar retort kilns for biochar production.},

  abstract     = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are major public health concern worldwide, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. Managing co-infection between HIV and HBV presents additional challenges in clinical treatment and patient outcomes. In this article, we developed a comprehensive co-infection model to explore the complex transmission dynamics between HIV and HBV in the United States. Our model incorporates crucial factors such as infection through birth or migration, HBV vaccination, and the possibility of reinfection following HBV recovery. Our mathematical analysis started with the analysis of the two non-co-infection submodels, that is, for HIV-only and HBV-only models. We derived the basic reproduction number for each submodel and appliedthe Routh-Hurwitz criterion to assess the local stability of their respective disease-free equilibrium points. Our investigation revealed that the HIV-only submodel is globally asymptotically stable when its basic reproduction number remains below one. Conversely, the HBV-only submodel exhibits a backward bifurcation, meaning that both disease-free and endemic equilibrium states can coexist even when the reproduction number falls below one. This phenomenon complicates HBV control strategies under such conditions. However, in the absence of reinfection, the HBV-only model reaches global stability at the disease-free equilibrium whenever its reproduction number is below one. Using center manifold theory, we further demonstrated that the full HIV-HBV co-infection model also undergoes backward bifurcation. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the basic reproduction numbers of HIV and HBV to identify critical parameters influencing the transmission dynamics of both infections. Our results indicate a positive correlation between the spread of one infection and the prevalence of the other. Additionally, we validated the model by fitting it to annual cumulative data on new HIV cases and reported acute HBV infections in the United States. Numerical simulations suggest that increasing condom use adherence, enhancing treatment coverage for both infections, and boosting HBV vaccination rates can substantially reduce the prevalence of HIV, HBV, and their co-infection.},
