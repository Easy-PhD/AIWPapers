  abstract     = {Lexical analysis is a fundamental task in natural language processing, which involves several subtasks, such as word segmentation (WS), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and named entity recognition (NER). Recent works have shown that taking advantage of relatedness between these subtasks can be beneficial. This paper proposes a unified neural framework to address these subtasks simultaneously. Apart from the sequence tagging paradigm, the proposed method tackles the multitask lexical analysis via two-stage sequence span classification. Firstly, the model detects the word and named entity boundaries by multi-label classification over character spans in a sentence. Then, the authors assign POS labels and entity labels for words and named entities by multi-class classification, respectively. Furthermore, a Gated Task Transformation (GTT) is proposed to encourage the model to share valuable features between tasks. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated on Chinese and Thai public datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear transforms have significantly advanced learned image compression (LIC), particularly using residual blocks. This transform enhances the nonlinear expression ability and obtain compact feature representation by enlarging the receptive field, which indicates how the convolution process extracts features in a high dimensional feature space. However, its functionality is restricted to the spatial dimension and network depth, limiting further improvements in network performance due to insufficient information interaction and representation. Crucially, the potential of high dimensional feature space in the channel dimension and the exploration of network width/resolution remain largely untapped. In this paper, we consider nonlinear transforms from the perspective of feature space, defining high-dimensional feature spaces in different dimensions and investigating the specific effects. Firstly, we introduce the dimension increasing and decreasing transforms in both channel and spatial dimensions to obtain high dimensional feature space and achieve better feature extraction. Secondly, we design a channel-spatial fusion residual transform (CSR), which incorporates multi-dimensional transforms for a more effective representation. Furthermore, we simplify the proposed fusion transform to obtain a slim architecture (CSR-sm), balancing network complexity and compression performance. Finally, we build the overall network with stacked CSR transforms to achieve better compression and reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion performance compared to the existing LIC methods and traditional codecs. Specifically, our proposed method achieves 9.38% BD-rate reduction over VVC on Kodak dataset.},

Energy management is a challenging issue that is critical in cloud data centres and an important concern of research for many researchers. In this paper, we proposed a cuckoo search (CS)-based optimisation technique for the virtual machine (VM) selection and a novel placement algorithm considering the different constraints. The energy consumption model and the simulation model have been implemented for the efficient selection of VM. The proposed model CSOA-VM not only lessens the violations at the service level agreement (SLA) level but also minimises the VM migrations. The proposed model also saves energy and the performance analysis shows that energy consumption obtained is 1.35Â kWh, SLA violation is 9.2 and VM migration is about 268. Thus, there is an improvement in energy consumption of about 1.8% and a 2.1% improvement (reduction) in violations of SLA in comparison to existing techniques.},

  abstract     = {Recently, numerous estimation issues have been solved due to the developments in data-driven artificial neural networks (ANN) and graph neural networks (GNN). The primary limitation of previous methodologies has been the dependence on data that can be structured in a grid format. However, physiological recordings often exhibit irregular and unordered patterns, posing a significant challenge in conceptualising them as matrices. As a result, GNNs which comprise interactive nodes connected by edges whose weights are defined by anatomical junctions or temporal relationships have received a lot of consideration by leveraging implicit data that exists in a biological system. Additionally, our study incorporates a structural GNN to effectively differentiate between different degrees of infection in both the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Subsequently, demographic data are included, and a multi-task learning architecture is devised, integrating classification and regression tasks. The trials used an authentic dataset, including 800 brain x-ray pictures, consisting of 560 instances classified as moderate cases and 240 instances classified as severe cases. Based on empirical evidence, our methodology demonstrates superior performance in classification, surpassing other comparison methods with a notable achievement of 92.27% in terms of area under the curve as well as a correlation coefficient of 0.62.},

However, in the face of increasingly complex optimization challenges, the Bat algorithm encounters certain limitations, such as slow convergence and sensitivity to initial solutions. In order to tackle these challenges, the present study incorporates a range of optimization components into the Bat algorithm, thereby proposing a variant called PKEBA. A projection screening strategy is implemented to mitigate its sensitivity to initial solutions, thereby enhancing the quality of the initial solution set. A kinetic adaptation strategy reforms exploration patterns, while an elite communication strategy enhances group interaction, to avoid algorithm from local optima. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the proposed PKEBA is rigorously evaluated. Testing encompasses 30 benchmark functions from IEEE CEC2014, featuring ablation experiments and comparative assessments against classical algorithms and their variants. Moreover, real-world engineering problems are employed as further validation. The results conclusively demonstrate that PKEBA exhibits superior convergence and precision compared to existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Tibetan medical named entity recognition (Tibetan MNER) involves extracting specific types of medical entities from unstructured Tibetan medical texts. Tibetan MNER provide important data support for the work related to Tibetan medicine. However, existing Tibetan MNER methods often struggle to comprehensively capture multi-level semantic information, failing to sufficiently extract multi-granularity features and effectively filter out irrelevant information, which ultimately impacts the accuracy of entity recognition. This paper proposes an improved embedding representation method called syllableâwordâsentence embedding. By leveraging features at different granularities and using un-scaled dot-product attention to focus on key features for feature fusion, the syllableâwordâsentence embedding is integrated into the transformer, enhancing the specificity and diversity of feature representations. The model leverages multi-level and multi-granularity semantic information, thereby improving the performance of Tibetan MNER. We evaluate our proposed model on datasets from various domains. The results indicate that the model effectively identified three types of entities in the Tibetan news dataset we constructed, achieving an F1 score of 93.59%, which represents an improvement of 1.24% compared to the vanilla FLAT. Additionally, results from the Tibetan medical dataset we developed show that it is effective in identifying five kinds of medical entities, with an F1 score of 71.39%, which is a 1.34% improvement over the vanilla FLAT.},

  abstract     = {Modern automated generation control (AGC) is increasingly complex, requiring precise frequency control for stability and operational accuracy. Traditional PID controller optimisation methods often struggle to handle nonlinearities and meet robustness requirements across diverse operational scenarios. This paper introduces an enhanced strategy using a multi-objective optimisation framework and a modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (SNSGA). The proposed model optimises the PID controller by minimising key performance metrics: integration time squared error (ITSE), integration time absolute error (ITAE), and rate of change of deviation (J). This approach balances convergence rate, overshoot, and oscillation dynamics effectively. A fuzzy-based method is employed to select the most suitable solution from the Pareto set. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the SNSGA-based approach offers superior tuning capabilities over traditional NSGA-II and other advanced control methods. In a two-area thermal power system without reheat, the SNSGA significantly reduces settling times for frequency deviations: 2.94s for and 4.98s for , marking improvements of 31.6% and 13.4% over NSGA-II, respectively.},

This paper contributes to enhancing age prediction as a regression problem using a union of two CNNs and exchanging knowledge between them. This specifically re-starts the training process from a possibly higher-quality point in different iterations and, consequently, causes potentially yeilds better results at each iteration. The method proposed, which is called cooperative deep neural network (Co-DeepNet), is tested on two types of age prediction problems. Sixteen datasets containing 1899 healthy blood samples and nine datasets containing 2395 diseased blood samples are employed to examine the method's efficiency. As a result, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) is 1.49 and 3.61Â years for training and testing data, respectively, when the healthy data is tested. The diseased blood data show MAD results of 3.81 and 5.43Â years for training and testing data, respectively. The results of the Co-DeepNet are compared with six other methods proposed in previous studies and a single CNN using four prediction accuracy measurements ( R 2 , MAD, MSE and RMSE).

CD-GAD classifies anomalies as unique or common based on their presence in both the source and target graphs. However, existing models often fail to fully explore domain-unique knowledge of the target graph for detecting unique anomalies. Additionally, they tend to focus solely on node-level differences, overlooking structural-level differences that provide complementary information for common anomaly detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, Synthetic Graph Anomaly Detection via Graph Transfer and Graph Decouple (GTGD), which effectively detects common and unique anomalies in the target graph. Specifically, our approach ensures deeper learning of domain-unique knowledge by decoupling the reconstruction graphs of common and unique features. Moreover, we simultaneously consider node-level and structural-level differences by transferring node and edge information from the source graph to the target graph, enabling comprehensive domain-common knowledge representation. Anomalies are detected using both common and unique features, with their synthetic score serving as the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving an average performance by 12.6 on the AUC-PR compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Selecting appropriate tourist attractions to visit in real time is an important problem for travellers. Since recommenders proactively suggest items based on user preference, they are a promising solution for this problem. Travellers visit tourist attractions sequentially by considering multiple attributes at the same time. Therefore, it is desirable to consider this when developing recommenders for tourist attractions. Using GRU4REC, we proposed RNN-based sequence-aware recommenders (RNN-SARs) that use multiple sequence datasets for training the recommended model, named multi-RNN-SARs. We proposed two types of multi-RNN-SARsâconcatenate-RNN-SARs and parallel-RNN-SARs. In order to evaluate multi-RNN-SARs, we compared hit rate (HR) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of the item-based collaborative filtering recommender (item-CFR), RNN-SAR with the single-sequence dataset (basic-RNN-SAR), multi-RNN-SARs and the state-of-the-art SARs using a real-world travel dataset. Our research shows that multi-RNN-SARs have significantly higher performances compared to item-CFR. Not all multi-RNN-SARs outperform basic-RNN-SAR but the best multi-RNN-SAR achieves comparable performance to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms. These results highlight the importance of using multiple sequence datasets in RNN-SARs and the importance of choosing appropriate sequence datasets and learning methods for implementing multi-RNN-SARs in practice.},

  abstract     = {Urban traffic prediction with high precision is always the unremitting pursuit of intelligent transportation systems and is instrumental in bringing smart cities into reality. The fundamental challenges for traffic prediction lie in the accurate modelling of spatial and temporal traffic dynamics. Existing approaches mainly focus on modelling the traffic data itself, but do not explore the traffic correlations implicit in origin-destination (OD) data. In this paper, we propose STOD-Net, a dynamic spatial-temporal OD feature-enhanced deep network, to simultaneously predict the in-traffic and out-traffic for each and every region of a city. We model the OD data as dynamic graphs and adopt graph neural networks in STOD-Net to learn a low-dimensional representation for each region. As per the region feature, we design a gating mechanism and operate it on the traffic feature learning to explicitly capture spatial correlations. To further capture the complicated spatial and temporal dependencies among different regions, we propose a novel joint feature, learning block in STOD-Net and transfer the hybrid OD features to each block to make the learning process spatiotemporal-aware. We evaluate the effectiveness of STOD-Net on two benchmark datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art by approximately 5% in terms of prediction accuracy and considerably improves prediction stability up to 80% in terms of standard deviation.},

  abstract     = {Referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to locate a specific region in an image described by a natural language. Existing two-stage methods generate multiple candidate proposals in the first stage, followed by selecting one of these proposals as the grounding result in the second stage. Nevertheless, the number of candidate proposals generated in the first stage significantly exceeds ground truth and the recall of critical objects is inadequate, thereby enormously limiting the overall network performance. To address the above issues, the authors propose an innovative method termed Separate Non-Maximum Suppression (Sep-NMS) for two-stage REC. Particularly, Sep-NMS models information from the two stages independently and collaboratively, ultimately achieving an overall improvement in comprehension and identification of the target objects. Specifically, the authors propose a Ref-Relatedness module for filtering referent proposals rigorously, decreasing the redundancy of referent proposals. A Relatedness module based on robust multimodal pre-trained encoders is built to precisely assess the relevance between language and proposals to improve the recall of critical objects. It is worth mentioning that the authors are the pioneers in utilising a multimodal pre-training model for proposal filtering in the first stage. Moreover, an Information Fusion module is designed to effectively amalgamate the multimodal information across two stages, ensuring maximum utilisation of the available information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the approach achieves competitive performance with previous state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Although the image dehazing problem has received considerable attention over recent years, the existing models often prioritise performance at the expense of complexity, making them unsuitable for real-world applications, which require algorithms to be deployed on resource constrained-devices. To address this challenge, we propose WaveLiteDehaze-Network (WLD-Net), an end-to-end dehazing model that delivers performance comparable to complex models while operating in real time and using significantly fewer parameters. This approach capitalises on the insight that haze predominantly affects low-frequency information. By exclusively processing the image in the frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), we segregate the image into high and low frequencies and process them separately. This allows us to preserve high-frequency details and recover low-frequency components affected by haze, distinguishing our method from existing approaches that use spatial domain processing as the backbone, with DWT serving as an auxiliary component. DWT is applied at multiple levels for better information retention while also accelerating computation by downsampling feature maps. Subsequently, a learning-based fusion mechanism reintegrates the processed frequencies to reconstruct the dehazed image. Experiments show that WLD-Net outperforms other low-parameter models on real-world hazy images and rivals much larger models, achieving the highest PSNR and SSIM scores on the O-Haze dataset. Qualitatively, the proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in handling a diverse range of haze types, delivering visually pleasing results and robust performance, while also generalising well across different scenarios. With only 0.385 million parameters (more than 100 times smaller than comparable dehazing methods), WLD-Net processes 1024Â ÃÂ 1024 images in just 0.045Â s, highlighting its applicability across various real-world scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/AliMurtaza29/WLD-Net .},

  abstract     = {Early exiting has shown significant potential in accelerating the inference of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by allowing easy samples to exit from shallow layers. However, existing early exiting methods primarily rely on local information from individual samples to estimate prediction uncertainty for making exiting decisions, overlooking the global information provided by the sample population. This impacts the estimation of prediction uncertainty, compromising the reliability of exiting decisions. To remedy this, inspired by principal component analysis (PCA), the authors define a residual score to capture the deviation of features from the principal space of the sample population, providing a global perspective for estimating prediction uncertainty. Building on this, a two-stage exiting strategy is proposed that integrates global information from residual scores with local information from energy scores at both the decision and feature levels. This strategy incorporates three-way decisions to enable more reliable exiting decisions for boundary region samples by delaying judgement. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark validate that the method achieves an average speed-up ratio of 2.17Ã across all tasks with minimal performance degradation. Additionally, it surpasses the state-of-the-art E-LANG by in model acceleration, along with a performance improvement of 0.6 points, demonstrating a better performance-efficiency trade-off.},

  abstract     = {The goal of point cloud completion is to reconstruct raw scanned point clouds acquired from incomplete observations due to occlusion and restricted viewpoints. Numerous methods use a partial-to-complete framework, directly predicting missing components via global characteristics extracted from incomplete inputs. However, this makes detail recovery challenging, as global characteristics fail to provide complete missing component specifics. A new point cloud completion method named Point-PC is proposed. A memory network and a causal inference model are separately designed to introduce shape priors and select absent shape information as supplementary geometric factors for aiding completion. Concretely, a memory mechanism is proposed to store complete shape features and their associated shapes in a key-value format. The authors design a pre-training strategy that uses contrastive learning to map incomplete shape features into the complete shape feature domain, enabling retrieval of analogous shapes from incomplete inputs. In addition, the authors employ backdoor adjustment to eliminate confounders, which are shape prior components sharing identical semantic structures with incomplete inputs. Experiments conducted on three datasets show that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to improve anomaly detection techniques, particularly in the context of high-dimensional, distributed clinical data. Analysing patient data within clinical settings reveals a pronounced focus on refining diagnostic accuracy, personalising treatment plans, and optimising resource allocation to enhance clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, this domain faces unique challenges, such as irregular data collection, inconsistent data quality, and patient-specific structural variations. This paper proposed a novel hybrid approach that integrates heuristic and stochastic methods for anomaly detection in patient clinical data to address these challenges. The strategy combines HPO-based optimal Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise for clustering patient exercise data, facilitating efficient anomaly identification. Subsequently, a stochastic method based on the Interquartile Range filters unreliable data points, ensuring that medical tools and professionals receive only the most pertinent and accurate information. The primary objective of this study is to equip healthcare professionals and researchers with a robust tool for managing extensive, high-dimensional clinical datasets, enabling effective isolation and removal of aberrant data points. Furthermore, a sophisticated regression model has been developed using Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to assess the impact of the ensemble abnormal pattern detection approach. Various statistical error estimation techniques validate the efficacy of the hybrid approach alongside AutoML. Experimental results show that implementing this innovative hybrid model on patient rehabilitation data leads to a notable enhancement in AutoML performance, with an average improvement of 0.041 in the score, surpassing the effectiveness of traditional regression models.},
