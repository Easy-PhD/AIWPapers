  abstract     = {Wave-based mechanisms inspired by traveling wave locomotion in animals have shown great potential use in robots to navigate unstructured environments. Herein, the dual actuator wave-like navigator (DAWN), a multisurface robot employing two actuated helical wave generators to produce continuous traveling waves on flexible link tracks enclosed in elastomer skins, is presented. These skins provide mechanical resilience, enhanced friction, and adaptability on uneven terrain. The robot demonstrates steering and controlled locomotion on flat surfaces, inclines, and declines. To characterize the robot, locomotion tests are performed on plywood, PMMA, and sand, achieving average linear speeds of 16.00, 15.76, and 1.63 mm s −1 , respectively. A key innovation is cyclic pneumatic actuation of the skins with actuation frequencies of 0.5 and 0.9 Hz, improving locomotion performance on sand to 2.22 and 2.70 mm s −1 . DAWN's capability to move on sand, grass, gravel, and wet soil is also demonstrated. Its modular design enables plug-and-play assembly of components including helical wave generators, flexible link tracks, and elastomer skins, allowing for easy maintenance, modification, and replacements. Potential applications include navigation in complex terrains for search and rescue, inspection, and environmental monitoring.},

  abstract     = {The high reliance on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) knowledge and practical skills has led to prolonged training cycles for therapists and a significant talent shortage, posing a severe challenge to the standardization of TCM physiotherapy in rehabilitation. Meanwhile, most physiotherapy robots based on rigid robotics technology suffer from insufficient safety and adaptability, resulting in unsatisfactory treatment effects. This paper presents a novel wearable pneumatic soft physiotherapy device, designed to achieve high-safety and personalized physiotherapy for shoulder and neck acupoint massage. The device integrates four soft massage actuators, four embedded thin-film stress sensors, two miniature airflow sources, and a power supply system, enhancing its portability. Additionally, a hybrid control strategy combining feedforward inverse compensation and PID feedback is proposed to regulate and customize the therapy intensity on human acupoints. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed device can apply therapeutic intensities ranging from 0 to 3.45 N to human acupoints, effectively adapting to the human shoulder and neck region to achieve good wearing comfort, and performing safe acupoint massage with customized physiotherapy intensities. This study explores and realizes the integration of emerging soft robotics technology with TCM, providing a paradigm for the development of more soft physiotherapy devices.},

  abstract     = {Tensegrity robotic joints, inspired by the musculoskeletal systems of vertebrate animals, have gained interest due to their unique interplay of tension and compression forces, offering a high strength-to-weight ratio and inherent adaptability. However, their use in legged and grasping applications remains challenging. A key challenge is striking the right balance between high compliance, which can undermine stability and control, and high stiffness, which can restrict essential movement and demand more powerful actuators. This study presents a tensegrity-inspired spine-like joint that integrates thin McKibben pneumatic artificial muscles and rubber cords directly into its tensile network. The artificial muscles enable active joint bending while also serving as tensile elements. The rubber cords counteract these forces, storing elastic energy to facilitate smooth recovery to the original position. The joint's topology design is primarily influenced by the artificial muscles’ limited 20% contraction. To optimize the balance between range of motion, payload capacity, and structural stability, the joint's geometry is refined through an evolutionary algorithmic form-finding process. Two generated joints are integrated into two functional robotic applications: a crawling robot and a gripper, showcasing their adaptability for diverse robotic applications.},

In this article, a comprehensive framework is introduced for the design and control of modular soft robotic devices. These modules can be combined in various configurations to develop a wide range of haptic devices capable of dynamically modifying their stiffness and shape to accommodate different applications, including providing haptic feedback in virtual environments and assisting individuals with hand rehabilitation needs. The design methodology of these modules is reported and two potential use cases are presented. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that how it is possible to intuitively control the modular soft robotic devices, monitor their state, and use limited sensing capability with machine learning models to enable interpretations of interactions with users and the surrounding environment.},

A hallmark of these systems is their bilayer structure, where strain mismatch caused by differential expansion between layers induces complex deformations. Despite progress in theoretical modeling and numerical simulation, accurately capturing their dynamic behavior, especially during environmental interactions, remains challenging. This study presents a novel simulation environment based on the discrete elastic rod (DER) model to address the challenge. By leveraging discrete differential geometry, the DER approach offers superior convergence compared to conventional methods like finite element method, particularly in handling contact interactions—an essential aspect of soft robot dynamics in real-world scenarios. The simulation framework incorporates key features of bilayer structures, including stretching, bending, twisting, and interlayer coupling. This enables the exploration of a wide range of dynamic behaviors for bilayer soft robots, such as gripping, crawling, jumping, and swimming. The insights gained from this work provide a robust foundation for the design and control of advanced bilayer soft robotic systems.},

  abstract     = {Biological organisms excel in dynamically reshaping their bodies to navigate and manipulate ever-changing environments, and some can even tune their mechanical properties for enhanced adaptability. Many existing shape-morphing robots rely on the inherent softness of materials or structures, which sacrifices load-bearing capacity. Despite efforts to achieve both morphing and stiffness tuning in one system, these strategies often rely on separate mechanisms, such as heating liquid metal components to reduce rigidity before employing other mechanisms to change the shape, leading to bulky and complex systems that limit practicality and scalability. Here, a tunable-stiffness architected morphing structure (TSAMS) is introduced, which unifies shape morphing and tunable stiffness in a single, compact platform. By combining 3D-printed tessellated particles with shape memory alloy springs, TSAMS transitions smoothly from soft to rigid states, exhibiting a ≈308 times increase in bending stiffness while concurrently executing intricate shape transformations through electrothermal actuation. This design is demonstrated with the following robotic applications, including rolling robots that can explore diverse terrains by climbing slopes, avoiding obstacles, and carrying loads; compact manipulators that lift objects nearly 50 times heavier than themselves; and snake-inspired robots performing undulation and sidewinding gaits. These results highlight TSAMS's potential to advance next-generation soft robots and bioinspired systems that demand both dynamic shape reconfiguration and robust structural performance in diverse operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in locomoting robotics have demonstrated how shape morphing can enhance efficiency, mobility, and speed during transitions between domains, such as from land to water. However, prior approaches often optimize a robot's propulsor shape, stiffness, and gait to minimize the cost of transport in distinct domains while neglecting the energy required to achieve these shape and stiffness changes at domain interfaces. Additionally, many shape-morphing robots rely on thermally driven materials that couple shape and stiffness changes to environmental temperatures, limiting their applicability in real-world multidomain scenarios. This work introduces the Jamming Amphibious Robotic Turtle (JART), which employs pressure-responsive, topologically altered kirigami laminar jamming to transform its limbs between hydrodynamic flippers and load-bearing legs. Energetic analyses reveal that JART achieves a 98.5% reduction in the energetic cost of morphing compared to thermally driven predecessors. Its pressure-responsive morphing mechanism also enables temperature-independent energy expenditures when morphing, rapid stiffness switching, decoupled control of stiffness and shape, and robust postloading shape recovery. System-level evaluations highlight JART's ability to efficiently transition between domains, demonstrated through a continuous terrestrial–aquatic–terrestrial transition at an ocean inlet. This study provides valuable insights into the design of deployable, multidomain robots, advancing their potential for real-world applications.},

This study presents the design, fabrication, and wing-morphing behavior of 3D-printed magnetic butterflies, focusing on optimal material and design parameters to replicate monarch wing-morphing behavior. Using composite of thermoplastic polyurethane and micron-sized Nd 2 Fe 14 B magnetic powder, 12 unique butterfly designs—varying in size, vein patterns, and stiffness—are fabricated via powder bed fusion (PBF) 3D printing, resulting in 84 specimens. Lightweight and batch-producible with minimal postprocessing, the specimens have weights per unit area of ≈270, 480, and 1045 g m −2 for small, medium, and large sizes, respectively. A permanent magnet induces deformation in the specimens—mimicking monarch butterflies, without embedded electronics. A systematic analysis combining finite element simulations and experiments reveals the effects of size, geometric features, and laser energy scale on wing morphing. Lower laser energy scales result in porous, fast-bending specimens, while higher scales specimen show greater mechanical strength and varied deformation, with vein structures further improving deformation. The results provide a detailed dataset for optimizing wing-morphing designs while highlighting the potential of the PBF process in creating lightweight magnetic bioinspired structures capable of optimal shape morphing.},

To achieve 3D programmable shape morphing (PSM), the deployment of array-based actuators is essential. However, a critical knowledge gap in 3D PSM is controlling the complex systems formed by these soft actuator arrays to mimic the morphology of the target shapes. This study, for the first time, represents the configuration of shape-morphing devices using point cloud data and employing deep learning to map these configurations to control inputs. Shape Morphing Net (SMNet), a method that realizes the regression from point cloud to high-dimensional control input vectors, is proposed. It has been applied to 3D PSM devices with three different actuator mechanisms, demonstrating its universal applicability to inversely reproduce the target shapes. Further, applied to previous 2D PSM devices, SMNet significantly enhances control precision from 82.23% to 97.68%. In the demonstrations of morphology mimicking, 3D PSM devices successfully replicate arbitrary target shapes obtained either through 3D scanning of physical objects or via 3D modeling software. The results show that within the deformable range of 3D PSM devices, accurate reproduction of the desired shapes is achievable.},
