  abstract     = {Electrochemical random-access memory (ECRAM) devices are a promising candidate for neuromorphic computing, as they mimic synaptic functions by modulating conductance through ion migration. However, the use of a thick electrolyte layer (>40 nm) in conventional ECRAMs leads to an unavoidable tradeoff between synaptic weight updates and operating speed. To address this problem, a Cu-based ultrathin ECRAM (UT-ECRAM) that uses a single 5 nm HfO x active layer and a ≈1.2 nm AlO x liner is designed. The highly efficient gate-tunable fast Cu-ion transport in the AlO x /HfO x UT-ECRAM enables 1) near-ideal linearity in weight updates (0.45) even achieved with a pulse width ( t w ) of 50 μs, 2) dynamic multilevel retention of 10 4 s, and 3) reliable cycling endurance of 10 4 cycles. A numerical analysis based on device scaling quantitatively reveals that a relatively high concentration of field-driven Cu ions (≈10 20 cm −3 ) contributes to each synaptic weight update per gate voltage ( V G ) pulse in the UT-ECRAM without becoming deactivated by traversing thicker layers. This improved gate sensitivity can ultimately overcome the linearity and the ratio/speed tradeoff relationships, paving the way for robust neuromorphic synaptic units.},

  abstract     = {Quadrupedal mobile manipulators are receiving increasing attention due to their excellent terrain adaptability and nearly unlimited workspace. Recent achievements have integrated legged mobility with manipulation capabilities, yet the accuracy of end-effector trajectory tracking remains a challenge, which is crucial for practical applications. This study proposes an innovative approach that integrates coordinated trajectory generation with decoupled tracking control to enhance the accuracy of end-effector trajectory tracking. This approach also expands the end-effector's workspace and improves the smoothness of the robot's movements. The trajectory optimization-based coordinated trajectory generator leverages the active motion of the quadruped's body to produce smooth movements. Meanwhile, the decoupled tracking control models the robotic arm and quadrupedal robot as independent floating-base systems, incorporating interaction forces to enhance the overall system's tracking accuracy. Finally, a series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully perform a variety of trajectory-tracking tasks, reducing the root mean squared error by 82.7% compared to independent control in the stance mode, and cutting additional computational overhead by 53.4% compared to the unified control.},

  abstract     = {Heart failure (HF) is a major clinical and public health problem. Cardiac assist devices are crucial treatment modalities for end-stage HF, but they still face limitations, such as direct blood contact and high power consumption. We present a lightweight (<60 g), compact, electroactive polymer (EAP)-based cardiac assist device (E-CAD) as a nonblood-contacting, low-power alternative to address these limitations. E-CAD consists of EAP units paired with negative bias springs (NBSs), mounted on a flexible sleeve that wraps around the heart to assist in cardiac compression. The device is designed to be biomimetic to match the regionally varying mechanical stiffness of the heart. Benchtop silicone phantom and ex vivo porcine tests demonstrated E-CAD's ability to increase volume displacement by 1.21-fold in benchtop tests with a silicone phantom and 1.17-fold in ex vivo settings, along with an associated increase in ejection fraction, compared to cases without the device. Furthermore, it operates on low power (<0.3 W), enabling a compact design with a thin driveline (outer diameter = 0.3 mm), which reduces infection risk. In summary, we showed that EAP-based direct cardiac compression was feasible with low power demand. The improvement in cardiac output may translate into clinical benefits for advanced HF patients.},

  abstract     = {Collecting detailed information from trees via hovering with an aerial robot is both energetically inefficient and often infeasible in dense forest canopies. Perching on trees offers a promising solution by enabling prolonged observations with reduced energy consumption. To overcome perching location limitations, in this article, a bird-inspired passive perching mechanism specifically optimized for vertical tree trunks is proposed. Similar to the tail action of treecreepers ( Certhiidae family) when perching on vertical tree trunks, the proposed aerial robotic platform perches on tree surfaces using a main clawed gripping mechanism combined with a supporting “tail” mechanism featuring arrays of embedded microspines. To cope with the complex curvature of tree trunks, adaptive elastic joints that allow the mechanism to passively contact the tree's surface are introduced. By incorporating the region of attraction for the mechanism, the aerial platform is designed to be more reliable during perching maneuvers by adjusting angular movement, thereby defining suitable initial velocities and accelerations for achieving stable equilibrium. The proposed system is validated in a motion capture environment using vertical trunks with diameters ranging from 40 to 220 mm, and further demonstrates in outdoor perching tests. Results confirm the feasibility of dynamic perching on vertical tree trunks under realistic forest conditions.},

The robot's twisting is modeled using numerical simulation and its geometry is optimized to maximize the twist angle.

Although the application of liquid metals (LM) and their composites has improved the stretchability of various tactile sensors, there remains a considerable gap between the performance of current flexible tactile sensors and human skin, attributed to their limited sensitivity and narrow working range. In this work, a liquid metal droplet (LMD)-based flexible tactile sensor that achieves both high-pressure sensitivity of 3 × 10 −2 kPa −1 and a wide working range from 50 Pa to 1.2 MPa is proposed. The novel sensor consists of an LMD array in which each pair of droplets is connected by an electrolyte solution within the polydimethylsiloxane microchannel grid. It is demonstrated that the 2-LMD sensor is capable of detecting human motion and physiological signals, while the electrical impedance tomography-based 3.5 × 3.5 cm sensor can detect the shape and position of single-point, multipoint, and other complex contact using only eight evenly distributed electrodes along the sensor's edge. These findings highlight the promising potential of the sensors in future robotic and wearable electronic applications.},

In this combined theoretical and experimental study, the geometric parameters to realize the coupling synergy between the two structures in terms of kinematics are adapted.

This article introduces a soft pneumatic pressure regulation system with self-rhythmic characteristics and simple structure. In this system, the hose generates self-excited oscillations due to jet force, which realizes the transformation of constant pressure to periodically varying pressure. This mechanism allows soft robots to perform rhythmic movements. A mathematical model is developed to describe the self-excited oscillations of the jet hose. Numerical simulations are conducted to analyze the impact of various parameters on system oscillations. The system operates under pressures from 90 to 150 kPa. By adjusting the pressure, hose length, and jet hole diameter, the oscillation frequency of the pressure can be tuned between 5.9 and 11.1 Hz. The comparison between simulation results and experimental data verifies the correctness of the mathematical model. Finally, a soft robot capable of crawling based on anisotropic friction is designed and fabricated. Powered solely by the soft pneumatic pressure regulation system, the robot achieves self-rhythmic crawling. By adjusting the air source pressure, hose length, and jet hole diameter, the robot's crawling speed can be effectively controlled, ranging from 2.5 to 6.8 mm s −1 .},

  abstract     = {6D object pose estimation, a critical component in computer vision and robotics domains, involves determining the 3D location and orientation of an object relative to a canonical reference frame. Recently, the widespread proliferation of RGB-D sensors has precipitated a marked increase in interest towards 6D pose estimation leveraging RGB-D data. A deep bidirectional fusion network is developed, DBF-Net, achieving efficient yet accurate 6D object pose estimation. Specifically, a sparse linear Transformer (SLT) with linear computation complexity is introduced to effectively leverage cross-modal semantic resemblance during the feature extraction stage, such that it fully models semantic associations between various modalities and efficiently aggregates the globally enhanced features of each modality. Once acquiring two feature representations from two modalities, a feature balancer (FB) based on SLT is proposed to adaptively reconcile the importance of these feature representations. Leveraging the global receptive field of SLT, FB effectively eliminates the ambiguity induced by visual similarity in appearance representation or depth missing of reflective surfaces in geometry representations, thereby enhancing the generalization ability and robustness of the network. Experimental results demonstrate that DBF-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art works by nontrivial margins across multiple benchmarks.

Conventional proportional–integral–derivative (PID) algorithms require frequent control parameter adjustments under varying voyage conditions, which increases operational and experimental costs. To address this issue, a multiple line-of-sight guidance law integrated with a deep reinforcement learning control framework is proposed. This framework enables seamless switching among guidance modes, such as waypoint following, path following, and trajectory tracking, to achieve optimal attitude control. For comprehensive control of roll, pitch, yaw, and longitudinal velocity, an augmented-twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (A-TD3) algorithm streamlines the training of the control agent. It enables adaptation to large-range attitude variations using small-scale training data, thereby reducing computational costs for diverse missions. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach: A-TD3 improves training speed by 30.8% while mitigating issues such as excessive rudder motion, poor operability, and high energy consumption across different missions. The attitude control experiments on the X-AUV prototype validate that A-TD3's control performance with PID method.},

  abstract     = {Materials science has traditionally relied on a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical modeling to discover and develop new materials with desired properties. However, these processes can be time-consuming, resource-intensive, and often limited by the complexity of material systems. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, has revolutionized materials science by offering powerful tools to accelerate the discovery, design, and characterization of novel materials. AI not only enhances the predictive modeling of material properties but also streamlines data analysis in techniques like X-Ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and electron microscopy. By leveraging large datasets, AI algorithms can identify patterns, reduce noise, and predict material behavior with unprecedented accuracy. In this review, recent advancements in AI applications across various domains of materials science, including spectroscopy, synchrotron studies, scanning probe and electron microscopies, metamaterials, atomistic modeling, molecular design, and drug discovery, are highlighted. It is discussed how AI-driven methods are reshaping the field, making material discovery more efficient, and paving the way for breakthroughs in material design and real-time experimental analysis.},

  abstract     = {Reservoir computing (RC) provides a route to use physical systems for computation and machine learning. Owing to their inherent nonlinearity, nanomechanical systems constitute an interesting technology to serve as reservoir. While RC platforms are built using microelectromechanical systems, the energy efficiency, response time, and footprint of these systems can be significantly improved by using nanoscale devices. Herein, the use of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) is investigated, which can be used in RC, utilizing inherent nonlinearities and the fading memory effect from the transient response of NEMS. The smaller size and higher operating frequencies of NEMS enable faster processing rates compared to micromechanical systems, while their compact footprint, low power consumption, and ability to operate under ambient conditions simplify integration into practical applications. In modified national institute of standards and technology (MNIST) handwritten digit–recognition test, this system achieves 90% accuracy with a 3.3 μs processing time per pixel. Also the effect of driving frequency and amplitude on NEMS classification accuracy is investigated using experiments and simulations and it is shown that no significant dependency in any of the parameters is observed. Herein, an estimate for energy consumption of core NEMS RC system on MNIST data is provided. These results highlight the potential for various applications that require efficient and fast information processing in resource-constrained environments.},

Traditionally, studies have focused on single-domain datasets. These approaches overlook the potential insights gained from integrating data across different domains. This research addresses this gap using a cross-domain dataset that includes building characteristics, energy usage, and environmental factors. Feature selection techniques, including filter methods (correlation, mutual information), wrapper methods (RFE), embedded methods (Lasso, Random Forest, and gradient boosting), and dimensionality reduction are used to identify the most significant features contributing to the energy efficiency of residential properties. These techniques identify the most significant features influencing energy consumption. The findings show that cross-domain features like energy consumption, CO 2 emissions, and heating cost play a key role in predicting energy performance. By integrating data from multiple domains, the feature selection process reveals areas for energy optimization that are previously overlooked in single-domain studies. The results provide valuable insights for energy consultants, building managers, and policymakers aiming to enhance energy efficiency in residential buildings. This research highlights the importance of cross-domain data integration and offers a robust framework for feature selection.

By positioning a vibrating microrobot on tissue surfaces, the resonant frequencies of the resulting vibrations are analyzed to create detailed elasticity maps. These maps reveal tumor margins and provide critical information about the tumor's properties spatially. This approach leverages the high spatio-temporal resolution and noncontact nature of LSCI to offer a minimally invasive elastography method for potential use in colonoscopy, providing an alternative to complex and time-consuming biopsy analysis and advancing future cancer diagnostics.},

These accelerators require a large network of synaptic elements with high degree of plasticity, high endurance, large integration density, and ultralow programing energy. Although emerging nonvolatile memories exhibit promising potential as synaptic devices, their widespread application in training accelerators is limited due to their low endurance and immature fabrication technology. In contrast, capacitor-less 1 transistor-dynamic random-access memories (1T-DRAMs) have recently emerged as lucrative alternative to the conventional (1T/1C) DRAMs owing to their high scalability and low footprint. Considering the high endurance, large integration density, and ultralow write energy of the 1T-DRAMs, in this work, for the first time, their potential is explored as synaptic elements for online learning. The proposed 1T-DRAM-based synaptic element exhibits multi-level capability (up to 6 bits), a large dynamic range (3.91 × 10 3 ), an ultralow energy, and an appreciable linearity for potentiation/depression. The 1T-DRAM-based synaptic element also exhibits a paired pulse facilitation with an exponential decay similar to the biological synapses. Furthermore, a multilayer perceptron utilizing the proposed 1T-DRAM synapses achieves an accuracy of 87.10% on MNIST dataset.},

Several sections, e.g., data acquisition, learning model, hidden layers, nodes, activation function, and data bandwidth, are designed to make the RNN-based learning method establish the overall dynamic model of the robot manipulators. The proposed method has a key point that the optimal data bandwidth can be obtained by the loss function and its derivative in the robot manipulators. Since the data bandwidth is set to be effective in learning process, it helps to provide high learning hit rate while significantly reducing time-consuming tasks caused by trial and errors in any robot manipulators. From these benefits, the proposed method offers a compact form and simplicity so that it can produce the convenience of practicing engineers in industrial fields. The effectiveness of the proposed one is verified through experiments with three scenarios, which is compared with that of the original data bandwidth in a real robot manipulator.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks could compare the difference among all samples (nodes in graph) and transmit the interrelationship among them to obtain a global landscape. Compared with radiomics and clinical feature-based machine learning methods, whether a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) based on radiomics and clinical features improve the performance in distinguishing benign and malignant pulmonary nodules is not well studied. We propose an approach based on multimodal GCNNs that integrates patients’ lung computed tomography images with clinical information to differentiate between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. Leveraging large-scale and multisource data from multiple hospitals (i.e., 6033/290/524 patients for three hospitals respectively) enhances the diversity of features. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) are used to evaluate the performance. We achieved the average accuracy/sensitivity/specificity/AUROC of 0.8612/0.9425/0.6786/0.9025 for the main dataset via the novel GCNN proposed, respectively, maintaining the robustness of the deep learning procedures. Especially for the external testing dataset (hospital 2/hospital 3), the specificity is much higher than comparison methods (0.6250–0.6731 vs. 0.2569–0.2788). The graph neural network-based deep learning method holds the potential to assist clinicians, aiding in treatment planning, patient management, follow-up strategies, resource optimization, and overall healthcare decision-making.},

As workspaces shrink, the need for precise autonomous manipulation in confined and isolated environments increases, particularly in areas such as electronics and biological assemblies. Herein, an autonomous, untethered, holonomic, mobile micromanipulator driven by piezoelectric actuators with nanometer resolution is developed. The micromanipulator comprises a driving circuit, single-board computer, battery, manipulator, and small camera; it is lightweight (515 g), compact (90 × 116 × 104 mm), and untethered, capable of independently operating in confined and dangerous spaces for humans. The micromanipulator can autonomously position a single object with a positioning error of 0.18 ± 0.51 mm and an angular deviation of −0.4° ± 1.2°, utilizing image recognition, machine learning, and visual feedback. Moreover, the micromanipulator is verified to function in extreme conditions that simulate draft chambers and clean benches, where it successfully performs circuit mounting in confined space. The device can arrange droplets under microscopy for applications in chemical and biomedical fields, demonstrating its versatility and precise positioning capabilities. Additionally, its multi-scale applications are explored from centimeters to sub-micrometers and adjusted to the magnification capabilities of various microscopes.},

Despite its popularity, some applications on mechanobiology are limited by the low throughput of the technique. Currently, the analysis of AFM-nanoindentation data is performed by model fitting. Model fitting is slow, data intensive, and prone to error. Herein, a supervised machine-learning regressor is developed for transforming AFM force–distance curves into nanorheological behavior. The method reduces the computational time required to process a force volume of a cell made of 2.62 × 10 5 curves from several hours to minutes. In fact, the regressor increases the throughput by 50-fold. The training and the validation of the regressor are performed by using theoretical curves derived from a contact mechanics model that combined power–law rheology with bottom effect corrections and functional data analysis. The regressor predicts the modulus and the fluidity coefficient of mammalian cells with a relative error below 4%.},

  abstract     = {Medical ultrasound (US) has been widely used in clinical practices due to its merits of being low cost, real time, and radiation free. However, its capability to reveal the underlying tissue properties remains underexplored. A physics-constrained learning framework is studied to reversely approximate tissue property representations from multiple B-mode images acquired with varying dynamic ranges. First, an extractor network is used to generate property maps, that is, attenuation coefficient α , reflection coefficient β , border probability ρ b , scattering density ρ s , scattering amplitude ϕ , and one perturbation p map characterizing the variations caused by varying dynamic range. The α − ϕ maps are loosely regularized by rendering them forward to realistic US images using ray-tracing simulator. To further enforce the physics constraints, a ranking loss is introduced to align the disparity between two estimated p maps with the discrepancy between two distinct inputs. Due to the missing ground truth α − ϕ maps, alternatively, the method is validated by evaluating the consistency between the feature maps inferred from distinct images. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can robustly extract consistent intermediate maps from images. Furthermore, one potential downstream application is showcased to perform realistic US augmentation by introducing specific noise into the physics-inspired α − ϕ maps.},

The gripper consists of pneumatically driven hierarchical adhesive modules (bio-toe) with the capability of contact sensing, and rolling inward/outward module (rolling module). The bio-toe manufactured using soft materials can safely and flexibly cater to curved and flat surfaces. The rolling module developed using four-bar linkage mechanism allows the opposing bio-toes to roll inward to enhance adhesion (adhesion forces up to 6.3 N on a flat surface and 23 N on an 18 m −1 curved surface) and roll outward to decrease the force in releasing (less than 3 N and especially less than 0.8 N on the flat surface). Embedded resistive strain gauges provide real time signals for the controller to determine the status of the bio-toe, such as bending, adhesion/release, and even adhesive contact rates, thereby allowing the gripper to autonomously approach, envelop, adhere to, and release objects of various shapes, with the potential for dynamic adhesion control in the future. The adhesive gripper equipped with adhesive contact sensing and biomimetic inward adhesion/outward release capabilities exhibits a broader grasping range and applicability in smart adhesive grabbing across industrial, agricultural, and human–robot interaction contexts.},

Augmented reality (AR) technology currently offers a solution to provide intuitive guidance. To enhance the AR user experience, an automated method for calibrating and dynamically registering deformable tissues is proposed. First, an automatic calibration method is proposed to help register the target tissue from the virtual to the real world. The calibration method is based on a 6D pose estimator, which is built on the feature-matching network, SuperGlue and the depth estimation network, Metric3D. Subsequently, a dynamic registration method is proposed to track the deformation of the target tissue in real-time. Moreover, a piece of cloth is utilized for four automatic calibration trials, resulting in a mean absolute error (MAE) of calibration accuracy at 3.79 ± 0.64 mm. The dynamic registration accuracy is also assessed by varying the deformation of the target, yielding an MAE of 6.03 ± 0.96 mm. Finally, an ex vivo experiment involving a piece of small intestine is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system, with an MAE of 3.11 ± 0.56 mm for AR calibration and 3.20 ± 1.96 mm for dynamic registration error.},

To address these limitations, we propose MultiMedRes, a multimodal medical collaborative reasoning framework that simulates human physicians’ communication by incorporating a learner agent to proactively acquire information from domain-specific expert models. MultiMedRes addresses medical multimodal reasoning problems through three steps i) Inquire: The learner agent decomposes complex medical reasoning problems into multiple domain-specific sub-problems; ii) Interact: The agent engages in iterative “ask-answer” interactions with expert models to obtain domain-specific knowledge; and iii) Integrate: The agent integrates all the acquired domain-specific knowledge to address the medical reasoning problems (e.g., identifying the difference of disease levels and abnormality sizes between medical images). We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of difference visual question answering for X-ray images. The experiments show that our zero-shot prediction achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing fully supervised methods, which demonstrates that MultiMedRes could offer trustworthy and interpretable assistance to physicians in monitoring the treatment progression of patients, paving the way for effective human–AI interaction and collaboration.},

Vine robots, a type of continuum robot, offer a promising solution with their unique ability to evert, allowing them to navigate complex environments while reducing friction. This article presents a novel vine robot design powered by magnetic fluid. The fluid drives both vine growth through pressurization and enables precise steering and manipulation using external magnetic fields. Unlike previous designs, the robot's high magnetic volume ensures precise control even under pressure, while maintaining a fully soft structure. This allows for controlled needle movements during biopsies. Additionally, the robot achieves passive stabilization by pressing against surrounding walls. This stabilization, combined with magnetic forces, can exert up to 1.26 N of insertion force at the tip, enabling effective tissue penetration. Experiments are conducted with a 5 mm diameter, 145 mm long magnetic fluid-driven vine robot, demonstrating movement in free space, through narrow constrictions, and within phantoms modeled after human bronchial anatomy. These results pave the way for the robot's potential application in minimally invasive surgeries, particularly in difficult-to-access areas of the body.},

In this study, we used simplified heat transfer models based on the finite element method (FEM) to generate realistic simulation data. We developed a novel management system that integrates two trained artificial neural networks with deep and wide networks using hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction speed, a known limitation of FEM. The system predicts temperature variations at multiple points on the coil, enabling strategic placement that minimizes temperature deviations and enhances cooling uniformity. This real-time computational approach eliminates the necessity for additional cooling equipment and ensures high product quality. The system's efficacy was validated through case studies, revealing dynamic adjustments and optimized placements. The proposed system achieved a mean absolute error of 3.44 and a mean absolute percentage error of 0.24%, outperforming conventional regression techniques.

However, in most cases, human intervention remains essential for the healing process.

To address this gap, in this article, first, the different phases of the healing process in soft robotics are discussed and then the technologies that are or can be integrated into self-healing soft robots to allow each individual phase to be performed autonomously with minimal human involvement are reviewed. Finally, in this article, the challenges of integrating all phases into self-healing soft robots are discussed and the perspectives on achieving fully autonomous self-healing in the future are offered. These phases are classified into five: damage detection, damage cleaning, damage closure, stimulus-triggered material healing, and recovery assessment. Achieving these attributes requires employing physical intelligence at the material level through the use of stimuli-responsive materials or utilizing embodied intelligence at the system level by integrating healing-assistive subsystems or a synergistic combination of both. Consequently, self-healing soft robots can achieve self-sufficiency in their healing capabilities, rendering them a sustainable solution for broader applications.},
