In this paper, we present a hybrid fusion approach combining Generative AI, ADASYN, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and boosting algorithms to detect DDoS attacks. RFE was employed to optimize feature selection, enhancing model interpretability and performance by reducing dimensionality. The proposed model leverages (1) Packet Capture (pcap) data generated from virtual networks as real data, (2) synthetic data generated by the Synthetic Data Vault, (3) ADASYN to balance the data, and (4) boosting algorithms for training and testing. The results obtained from this hybrid-fusion model provided an accuracy of 97–98%, indicating that the model is robust and reliable. Cross-validation of the model further validated the results},

CHD can result from genetic, environmental, and maternal health factors, making early detection essential. Early diagnosis allows for timely intervention, reducing risks like heart failure or stroke. In countries like Egypt, CHD often remains undiagnosed due to limited healthcare resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) can improve early detection by analyzing risk factors. This study presents a predictive model for CHD using maternal and paternal health factors. Data was collected from 571 families: 260 with a CHD-affected child and 311 with healthy children. After preprocessing the data, ten machine learning models were tested, including Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and MLP Classifier. RF achieved the highest accuracy at 97.37%, followed by DT at 96.49%, and MLP at 92.96%. The results show AI's potential in predicting CHD, supporting early diagnosis and improving infant outcomes.},

While deep learning methods, like Stable Diffusion and origin Transformer-based framework, have advanced super-resolution, they require heavy computation, making them difficult for tasks like face recognition. However, recognition accuracy only needs images of size 112x112, reducing the necessity for extremely large outputs. Existing methods often rely on convolutional attention, limiting receptive fields and performance. To address this, we propose SETFSR, a Semantically Guided Efficient Attention Transformer Face Super-Resolution. Our model leverages efficient self-attention for global feature extraction and incorporates face parsing constraints for structural accuracy. Experiments on Helen, CelebA, and FFHQ datasets show that SETFSR outperforms state-of-the-art models in PSNR, SSIM, and identity preservation.},

To enhance robustness and responsiveness, a hybrid adaptive control method is introduced, integrating adaptive laws (AL) for online tuning of parameters and offline optimization using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. This improves tracking control efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, offline reinforcement learning refines parameters without adding real-time computational demands. Finally, semantic web principles ensure interpretability and transparency of the control flow.

A GSR model for the identification of suboptimal operating conditions of yield and quality based on random forest classification was established. The experimental results demonstrate that the method is capable of rapidly and accurately identifying the production and quality of the calcining kiln. The identification accuracy of the yield and quality of the suboptimal operating conditions is 99.82% and 99.18% respectively.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a standard non-invasive method to detect brain tumors. For early detection and better patient survival through MRI scans, the diagnosis needs a high level of knowledge in the radiological and neurological domains to identify the cancers. Researchers have suggested various brain cancer detection techniques. However, most existing automatic cancer detection approaches suffer from poor accuracy and low detection rates. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) using deep feature extraction and adaptive Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask-RCNNs) model for brain tumor detection and classification method to overcome these issues. The experimental findings on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that the planned model is highly effective, with 99.64% accuracy, 95.93% precision, 95.39% recall, and 95.67% F1-score.},

The model exploits the synergistic incentives of similar interest behaviours to achieve a steady construction of trust relationships. We propose a similarity filtering algorithm that calculates the similarity to filter out false, misleading, or unfair information effectively. Through simulations, we compare our model with RRGRET, Surework, and community-based approaches, and the results show that our model has good network properties, while also resisting multiple malicious attacks and guaranteeing collaboration success.

IMX662 image sensor is employed, which simultaneously captures both HCG and LCG images with the same exposure time, enabling efficient HDR image synthesis. The proposed method directly addresses the source of the problem, eliminating the need for post-processing steps, thereby preserving algorithmic simplicity. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method not only removes ghosting by 100% but also processes data on an FPGA 98.79% faster than traditional software-based HDR fusion techniques, enabling real-time video stream processing.

However, there is a lack of effective integration between the existing car rental system and reserved parking spaces. As a result, users often need to spend extra time and energy looking for parking spaces when using car rental services, and the insurance policies generated by temporary insurance services are difficult to cover at the same time. To address these issues, this study proposed an integrated car rental service platform based on blockchain technology and the Interplanetary File System.

However, the sensitivity and privacy of data make data sharing for analysis challenging. Current systems typically rely on local data, making it difficult to handle cross-institutional data or complex fraudulent activities. To address this issue, we propose a financial risk control model based on the Federated Semantic Web (FSW). This model deploys a federated learning framework between banks, allowing data to be stored independently, thus ensuring privacy protection. The model automatically selects and scores risk features from transaction data using a multi-perspective topological graph, and assigns the final risk labels via a weighted voting mechanism. The central model updates and redistributes the global model based on parameters shared by local models through the federated averaging algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively identifies fraudulent transactions and predicts credit risk, meets security standards, and improves accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Campus guide systems are crucial to university infrastructure, shaping the experiences of students, staff, and visitors. Current systems face critical challenges in three areas: capturing diverse user needs, translating emotional requirements into design elements, and integrating campus cultural identity. This study integrates Kansei Engineering (KE) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (AIGC) to propose a semantic-driven design method. Using Semantic Web and Natural Language Processing (NLP), it models demand semantics, extracts emotional semantics such as safety and belonging, and maps them to design semantics for AIGC to generate personalized guide solutions. The approach leverages data-driven emotional semantic analysis and generative models to improve path guidance precision and cultural representation. Results indicate significant improvements in user experience, pathfinding accuracy, and cultural communication, with higher user satisfaction. This method provides a new semantic-driven pathway for developing campus guide systems and development prospects.},

For this problem, we present a multi-UAV-assisted MEC offloading optimization model that jointly optimizes task offloading decision, UAV resource allocation, UAV trajectories and establish collaborative computation through inter-UAV communication. First, to solve the multi-UAV-assisted MEC offloading optimization issue, we define a weighted utility function that balances delay and energy consumption. Then, to tackle the continuous nature of the computation-offloading problem and the coexistence of discrete and continuous variables, the PPO algorithm is enhanced by integrating an average reward objective function and a hybrid action generation offloading mechanism. Finally, we propose a multi-UAV-assisted MEC computing offloading optimization method to improve the utility function.

The proposed DBSCAN++ based aiNet clustering algorithm (D-aiNet) is firstly used for clustering the training samples on the extracted network traffic, and then generates a Self Set (Ss) and an Antibody Set (As). In the testing phase, an Immune Network based anomaly detection model (INAD) is employed to match network traffic samples from the selected dataset with antibodies of the Antibody Set (As) in order to detect APT attacks. To validate the effectiveness of UADDN, experimental studies were conducted using the SCVIC-APT-2021 dataset.

By utilizing semantic information to guide the separation and restoration self-attention in establishing long-range relationships, the model optimizes semantic perception and enhances information aggregation. Multi-branch parallel separable convolutions such as a feed-forward network are introduced to extract fine-grained textures of the main objects and macro features of the background selectively.

However, NTN faces security challenges such as high-latency communication, dynamic topologies, and increased cyber threats. This paper proposes a semantic-aware authentication protocol that leverages real-time environmental semantics to enhance security adaptability. The authors' approach ensures mutual authentication, secure key exchange, perfect forward secrecy, and data integrity while dynamically responding to network conditions. Using Syverson-Van Oorschot Logic (SVO Logic) and Scyther, the authors formally verify the protocol's security properties. By integrating semantic security policies, this work advances intelligent, context-aware security frameworks for next-generation 6G NTN architectures.},

By leveraging AI's semantic capabilities, such networks organize, analyze, and visualize linguistic data to support deeper knowledge sharing and language development. This interdisciplinary research empirically investigates the approach. A semester-long intervention involved 69 Chinese junior students majoring in linguistics, who engaged with an AI-assisted education management system equipped with tools, such as Gephi, WORDij, and mathematical software. Triangulated data from linguistic assessments, structured interviews, and semantic network analysis demonstrates notable improvements in students' language proficiency and conceptual understanding. The findings suggest that semantic AI-driven knowledge networks hold significant potential in advancing linguistic competence and optimizing educational management practices.},

Despite their widespread use in intrusion detection against DDoS attacks, machine learning methods still suffer accuracy degradation due to inadequate data pre-processing and computational inefficiency. This study combined a fine-tuned extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model with correlation-based feature selection—for efficient feature selection—to effectively maximize detection accuracy while lowering computing overhead. Both correlation-based feature selection and XGBoost contribute to boosting the final model's efficiency. To evaluate the proposed model, different metrics were employed over three DDoS data sets, considering both binary and multi-classification scenarios. Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed XGBoost achieves highly competitive accuracy. For the Network Security Laboratory–Knowledge Discovery Databases data set, University of New South Wales–Network Behavior15 data set, and Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity–Intrusion Detection System–2017 data set, the model secures 0.995, 1.000, and 0.999 and 0.996, 0.885, 0.998 for binary and multi-classification, respectively, outperforming its rival models.},

The performance of the proposed framework was tested using predefined queries processed on LinkedGeoData datasets. Benchmark comparisons were made to evaluate WasGeo against Ontop and GeoSPARQL. The proposed framework achieved a reasoning accuracy of 95%, processed up to 1 million Resource Description Framework triples, and demonstrated execution times ranging from 0.3 to 7.7 seconds. Comparative benchmarks show that WasGeo provides greater reasoning depth than GeoSPARQL and Ontop, while maintaining better balance between scalability and analytical power.

The review shows that the field has entered a maturity phase, with established approaches—including preprocessing strategies, hand-crafted features, and learned features—being used to address OOV words in POS tagging. Nevertheless, challenges remain in coping with language variation and low-resource data, which indirectly affect model accuracy.

  abstract     = {Abstract The Marine Spatial Data Infrastructure (MSDI) faces persistent challenges in achieving semantic interoperability, integrating heterogeneous data, and fostering limited stakeholder cooperation. This paper proposes an ontology-driven conceptual framework to address these issues by harmonising disparate marine data using semantic technologies. Built with Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM), the framework employs an MSDI-specific ontology developed in Protégé and modelled using UML, formalising key concepts such as MarineFeature, TemporalDimension, and SpatialDimension. The approach enables structured knowledge representation, advanced semantic querying via SPARQL, and seamless integration with GIS tools for spatial visualisation and decision support. Industrial-scale validation, including coral reef conservation mapping, demonstrates improved data retrieval accuracy and semantic conflict resolution. Results confirm the framework's ability to enhance cross-domain interoperability, semantic integrity, and support for marine spatial planning (MSP) and ecosystem-based management.},
