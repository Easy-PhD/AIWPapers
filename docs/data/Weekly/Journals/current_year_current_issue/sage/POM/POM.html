  abstract     = {Online marketplaces such as Amazon and Tmall have been expanding services to boost the growth of their ecosystems. One is information service on sharing privately gathered massive consumer data that is unavailable to their sellers, and the other is financing service, e.g., Amazon Lending and Ant Financial, aiming to provide accessible and affordable financial support for small and medium-sized sellers. This paper develops a game-theoretical model to examine the interplay between information sharing and financing services on a retail platform, particularly when sellers are financially constrained. The results show that while the information-sharing service always makes the platform less likely to provide an attractive financing service, the financing service also makes the information-sharing service less likely to be provided under certain conditions. These conditions depend on the structure of capital market and the seller’s initial working capital. We find that such misalignment between these two services can be resolved by charging a fixed payment for the information service, leading to improved operational efficiency and social welfare. We finally extend our analytical results and managerial insights to general settings, demonstrating the robustness of our findings. Our findings could provide useful guidance for platform practitioners in designing integrated information-sharing and financing services.},

  abstract     = {Platform firms are increasingly investing in value-added services (VAS), believing these investments in VAS universally contribute to their success. Although many studies have examined platform firms’ core services (e.g., intermediation), systematic analyses of VAS provision strategies remain limited. In this article, we develop a game-theoretic model to analyze (1) the conditions under which platform firms benefit from providing VAS and (2) to which side(s) platform firms should provide VAS. We offer several insights. First, variable service costs are a critical yet previously neglected factor in governing platform firms’ VAS provision. Second, a comparison of equilibrium outcomes across three VAS provision strategies—one-sided unidirectional, two separate unidirectional, and bidirectional—reveals that the optimal strategy is jointly determined by variable service costs, cross-network externalities, and the asymmetry in the benefits of bidirectional VAS to the two platform sides. Specifically, when asymmetry is low, bidirectional VAS is optimal. When asymmetry is high, platform firms should provide unidirectional VAS to one side, considering the second side only when variable service costs are low or cross-network externalities are significant. Third, we explore the implications of VAS provision strategies for platform firms’ investment and pricing decisions. For example, when platform firms provide two separate unidirectional VAS, these investments are complementary. VAS could incentivize platform firms to offer price subsidies to one side of the platform. Finally, optimal VAS provision strategies do not always increase consumer surplus.},

  abstract     = {Social media users generate a variety of content that can potentially influence their followers’ behaviors and preferences. However, most user-generated content, such as text and images, is unstructured, making it difficult to analyze how individuals impact the creation of such data as existing models primarily focus on the numerical aspects of behavioral data. In this article, we propose a method to identify influential users who significantly affect others’ interest in content topics, with a specific focus on text and images. Our study introduces a new variant of the topic model, incorporating a hierarchical structure and a vector auto-regressive approach. This method accounts for both the evolution of topic distribution and the social influence among users on their interest in content topics. The empirical application of our model to image-sharing social media data demonstrates that our model outperforms conventional topic models in terms of predictive accuracy and topic interpretability. Moreover, we illustrate how visualizing the estimated social influence within the network can provide valuable insights for seeded marketing campaigns and data-driven product development by identifying influential users in various content areas. This approach also offers a deeper understanding of evolving trends in content, preferences, and demand.},

  abstract     = {Challenges faced by call centers in managing capacity, efficiency, service speed and quality, training, emotional labor, and turnover are intrinsically intertwined. Call center agents are considered frontline workers, and as such, they often deal with hostile behavior from rude customers. However, they are expected to suppress their feelings and maintain a courteous demeanor despite rude customer behavior, which results in emotional dissonance. Such working environments, where the frontline workers experience emotional dissonance, are termed emotional labor environments. Emotional dissonance, if sustained over a long period of time, can lead to an erosion of organizational identification (OID) among agents, unless they perceive adequate protection and support from the management. A low OID can lead to high employee turnover, which in turn results in high recruitment and training costs as well as loss of experience and compromised service quality. In this study, we examine how employee protection policies and leadership style manifest in mitigating the erosion of OID. We develop a research framework to understand the mediating role of agents’ perception of the efficacy of the firm's policies to protect them from rude customers and the relevant aspects of the servant leadership style of supervisors in mitigating the erosion of agents’ OID caused by the cumulative emotional dissonance over their tenure duration. For this study, we partner with a major multinational firm in Korea in the insurance industry. We find that the perceived organizational support for protection from rude customers and supervisors’ servant leadership style are positively related to agents’ OID. The agent's OID decreases with their tenure duration, unless mediated by the agent's perception of the efficacy of protection from rude customers. We provide insights for the retention of agents with implications for capacity and service quality for the call centers. These insights may be extended to frontline workers in other emotional labor environments.},

  abstract     = {We explore retail supply chains in emerging markets in which a manufacturer can reach consumers by selling its product through very small independent stores (nanostores) and/or through a supermarket. Nanostores offer consumers the advantage of proximity, but supermarkets offer the advantage of bulk buying. We explore the competition between the supermarket and nanostores and examine the manufacturer’s role in shaping the retail market structure for its product through wholesale price contracts. We model and analyze a multi-party supply-chain game in which a manufacturer can sell its product to spatially distributed, utility-maximizing, price-sensitive consumers through nanostores and a supermarket. Consumers can buy in bulk at the supermarket, optimizing their purchase quantity, and hence visit frequency, in an economic order quantity type approach, or they can purchase from a nanostore (frequently due to store storage-space limitations). We fully solve for the equilibrium market structure and the associated retail and wholesale prices, establishing that the manufacturer’s desired channel strategy is governed by three factors: the manufacturer-nanostore supply chain cost, the manufacturer-supermarket supply chain cost, and the supermarket bargaining power. If the supply chain efficiencies are somewhat similar, then the manufacturer should (typically, but not always) use both retail formats to avail of the nanostore advantage in serving proximate consumers and the supermarket advantage in serving distant customers. The specifics of how the manufacturer should use the retail formats will depend on the supermarket power. Among other results, we establish that aggregate nanostore demand and profit can decrease in nanostore density and that the presence of a high-power supermarket can increase consumer surplus because the manufacturer induces strong price competition.},

We appeal to a real options framework to predict that firms delay layoff decisions and the issuance of WARN notices until the resolution of political uncertainty. Using establishment-level data on layoffs disclosed in WARN notices and state elections occurring between 1994 and 2022, we document that the likelihood of issuing WARN notices declines during the election quarter but increases in the subsequent quarter. Cross-sectional findings show that political uncertainty plays a significant role in the timing of WARN notices during election periods while other factors, including partisanship, economic conditions, union strength, and firm visibility, may also play a role. Further, firms that delay WARN notices do not experience a significant deterioration in their medium-term financial performance. Overall, our findings provide evidence that firms delay labor adjustment decisions and the announcements of such decisions in response to political uncertainty.},

We consider a dynamic setting with uncertain patient arrival and use of the emergency department. This problem is formulated as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process model. Since we cannot solve large-sized instances via conventional approaches, we hybridize this model with a neural network to simplify feasibility constraints while respecting all assumptions. Given the curse of dimensionality, we use an affine approximation architecture to estimate the value function. An equivalent linear programing model is solved through column generation in order to compute approximate optimal policies and derive two easy-to-implement scheduling policies. Simulation results demonstrate that the approximate optimal policy and heuristics outperform alternative scheduling policies. Finally, we demonstrate that the application of our methodology can enhance performance metrics in a large ambulatory care center in Canada. We show that a template-based scheduling rule can result in high resource utilization but poor scheduling decisions. However, an efficient scheduling policy equips a booking clerk with intelligent scheduling rules that are difficult for her to predict in real-time and work well in comparison to scheduling templates.},

  abstract     = {Social advertising platforms and search engines employ the so-called quality score to favor certain advertisers in ad auctions. These scores typically consider several factors including ad relevance, click-through rate (CTR), and landing page quality. While quality scores are often justified as a mechanism to enhance ad rank and reduce cost per click for high-quality ads, this study examines their broader role in incentivizing advertisers with varying investment costs to improve landing page quality and explores the implications for advertisers’ profits and the platform’s revenue in a setting where landing page quality is an endogenous decision made by advertisers. The results suggest that a quality score function in excess of the CTR incentivizes advertisers to invest in page quality in a non-monotonic way. These incentives have dual effects on auction dynamics: While advertisers can lower their cost per click by improving quality, such incentives also increase advertisers’ competitive pressure to maintain their quality advantage and secure the discount per click, particularly for those in higher positions. Our findings reveal that the former effect dominates, leading to increased advertiser profits with higher rewards. However, the intensified competition slows the profit growth for the top-position advertiser when the bottom-position advertiser invests. For platform revenue, which comprises both auction revenue and benefits derived from user experience, a quality score in excess of CTR is recommended when the user experience benefits are substantial enough to compensate for auction revenue losses. In a scenario where page quality is capped, our results show that a quality score in excess of CTR can generate higher platform revenue, even in the absence of user experience benefits.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a decision support system used by an agricultural cooperative in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to optimize the purchase, blending, sale, and storage of groundnuts for maximum profit. The cooperative buys raw groundnuts (input commodity) from member farmers and processes them into multiple grades of groundnut seeds (output commodity). These may then be blended to create intermediate grades to exploit arbitrage opportunities. The cooperative sells part of the output on the spot market while storing the rest for future periods. A key challenge is the random supply of input commodity—driven by the cooperative’s obligation to accept all member produce—and the option to blend the output. Unlike prior work, this study examines blending across a multiperiod planning horizon, a novel aspect in operations management literature. The problem is modeled as a dynamic program over a harvest season. We analyze the structure of the optimal value function and decisions and find that the function is not separable in input and output inventories, which complicates the identification of optimal solution. However, in special cases such as when blending is disallowed, the function simplifies. An efficient computational procedure is developed for the general case. Using real cooperative data, we demonstrate that multiperiod blending significantly boosts profits—by 100–900%, or Indian National Rupees 1.94–17.46 million annually—highlighting the value of this approach.},

  abstract     = {The financial industry is plagued with account-based fraudulent transactions in which perpetrators surreptitiously siphon away money from customer accounts. To address this recurrent problem, service operations teams at financial institutions (e.g., the fraud detection and mitigation teams) spend millions yearly identifying perpetrators, attributing blame, and averting customer churn. However, in the vast majority of cases, the service operations teams cannot trace fraudulent transactions back to the perpetrators, and hence, it remains unclear whether they should continue to expend significant resources into investigating account-based fraud and attributing blame. Employing a wide range of econometric and machine learning techniques on a rich dataset from a US bank and an experiment, we attempt to offer the first empirical assessment of the association between blame attribution, or lack of it, in response to customer-identified account-based fraud and customer churn. The results indicate that relative to the customers that did not experience fraud, those that did and received a resolution lacking blame attribution have 40.69 %Lift (95% confidence interval (CI) = [24.41 %Lift , 56.97 %Lift ]) in churn rate. However, customers that experienced fraud and received a resolution involving blame attribution have −62.45 %Lift (95% CI = [−31.22 %Lift , −93.68 %Lift ]) in churn rate, making them less likely to churn than those that did not experience fraud. The latter result offers one of the first field evidence of the well-known service recovery paradox. Additionally, we observe significant heterogeneity in the findings based on customer tenure and the number of customer-firm interactions and document the long-term effects of attributing and not attributing blame. These insights can assist service operations teams in their postservice failure efforts to mend customer-firm relationships. Overall, the results underscore the importance of blame attribution during service recovery for service operations teams and inform a topical debate on a banking reform proposed by the US Department of Treasury.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we explore the impact of implementing an algorithmic supervisor, a data analytics tool that offers real-time feedback to employees, on their overall performance. We collaborate with a leading service company that initiated the transition from human supervisors to an algorithmic supervisor for managing call agents in their outbound call center on September 18, 2019. We collect data for 220,085 calls over a span of 6 months—that is, 3 months before and 3 months after the introduction of the algorithmic supervisor. We find that the introduction of the algorithmic supervisor improved the agents’ service quality in terms of customer satisfaction; however, this came at the expense of quantity as fewer customers were served. In particular, the adoption of the algorithmic supervisor resulted in a 15.80% reduction in the number of served customers, accompanied by a 14.91% increase in the number of satisfied customers. Moreover, our study uncovers a gender-related dimension to the impact of the algorithmic supervisor. Before its adoption, male agents outperformed their female counterparts. However, after its adoption, female agents exhibited an 11.52% increase in the number of served customers, and a remarkable 14.00% increase in the number of satisfied customers as compared to their male counterparts. Our results suggest that the adoption of the algorithmic supervisor strikes a new economic balance between service quality and service quantity and generates a social impact in differently affecting service performance of female and male employees.},

  abstract     = {This study examines the relationship between major customer concentration and supplier firms’ adoption of blockchain. Using a sample of 9,745 Chinese firm-year observations spanning 2018–2021, we find that the likelihood of suppliers’ blockchain technology adoption in supply chain management is negatively associated with major customer concentration. The negative relation is reduced when supplier firms possess greater bargaining power and demonstrate governance mechanisms against information leakage, and when major customers have less incentive to engage in opportunistic behaviors, and have fewer concerns regarding information leakage by suppliers. Our findings suggest that major customers tend to discourage supplier firms from adopting blockchain due to the concerns regarding competitive advantages and information leakage risk.},

  abstract     = {Purchasing new experience products or services often involves significant quality uncertainty for both consumers and firms. Social learning through online reviews helps reduce this uncertainty but exacerbates strategic waiting, as consumers delay purchases to gain more information. This paper examines the impact of social learning on firms’ pricing policies in the presence of strategic consumers under two widely adopted schemes: Contingent pricing and price guarantee. We find that while social learning always benefits the firm, it enables the price guarantee scheme to outperform contingent pricing in terms of profitability for highly patient consumers, which would not be possible without social learning. Notably, social learning drives a range of pricing patterns, even making price skimming optimal under price guarantee for highly patient consumers, as high initial prices combined with markdowns effectively alleviate strategic waiting, enhancing review outcomes and the firm’s profitability. Additionally, social learning always enables the firm to extract greater consumer surplus for impatient consumers under price guarantee. In contrast, social learning under contingent pricing consistently benefits consumers and can achieve win-win outcomes when consumers are moderately patient. Our extensions validate the robustness of these findings under different assumptions, including fully rational consumers and partially forward-looking firms. In particular, a partially forward-looking firm can achieve win-win outcomes with social learning under price guarantee, expanding its practical applicability. This study provides novel insights into the role of social learning in shaping pricing strategies, highlighting its implications for firm profitability and consumer welfare in markets influenced by review dynamics and strategic consumers.},

Using a multimethod approach, we show (a) a positive relationship between CSR investments and gross margin and (b) the moderating role of advertising investment. The contribution of our research is three-fold. First, our results suggest that mandating firms to spend on CSR can be a win-win situation for firms and governments, as opposed to the view of considering mandatory CSR as an additional burden. Second, our inquiry is one of the first to analytically and empirically show CSR contribution positively affects gross margin premium, which is based on price, important revenue-generating marketing, and operations construct. Third, we show the moderating role of advertising in achieving CSR-related gross margin premium. We discuss our study's implications for marketing and operations managers and policymakers.},

  abstract     = {This article examines how the composition of managerial teams influences the information and competitive landscapes in which firms operate. Specifically, the impact of teams depends on the task environment under which they operate and the extent of competition the firm faces in the product markets. Under a substitute task environment, team heterogeneity better facilitates firm learning, whereas, under a complementary task environment, team homogeneity enhances learning. However, more learning is not always optimal, as this accentuates adverse selection concerns, which leads the firm's rival to counter by becoming more aggressive in competition. This, in turn, forces the firm to cede some of its information advantage through disclosures. In effect, when designing teams to manage information, the firm must balance its learning needs with its rival's competitive threats. Consequently, in a substitute task environment, team heterogeneity is only optimal for the firm when competition is not fierce, and homogeneity is desirable otherwise. In a complementary task environment, the preference for teams as a function of competition is reversed. Additionally, any inherent heterogeneity in the level of competition in the product markets in which the firm operates diminishes the demand for team heterogeneity. The article also derives the firm's optimal team composition when the markets are characterized by Bertrand or Cournot competition, when the available managerial pool for the firm is constrained or unconstrained, when tasks are market-specific or firm-specific, and when the task environment is generalized.},

The accuracy of master data significantly influences the viability of such applications. However, the maintenance of master data is considered a tedious and error-prone task. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of plan lead times. We apply both unsupervised and supervised learning methods for creating lead time prediction models. We test our approach using historical data of a global equipment manufacturer. In a numerical analysis the calculated plan lead times are over 30% more accurate than current plan lead times in terms of mean-squared-error (MSE). This increased accuracy of plan lead times reduces inventory investment by approximately 7%.},

Our results indicate that E-waste regulations significantly boost the number of eco-patents filed by producers, with the effect intensifying as regulatory pressure increases. Additionally, our findings show that regulated producers tend to focus more on upstream resource efficiency innovations than on downstream waste management.

  abstract     = {To mitigate information asymmetry, Expert Review Programs, in which experts evaluate products on multiple dimensions, have gained traction on platforms. However, the role of multidimensional expert reviews and how they affect consumer behaviors remain unknown. Using an empirical opportunity on an automobile review platform, we investigate how multidimensional expert reviews affect subsequent consumer ratings and the underlying mechanism. Our findings first reveal that expert reviews tend to be neutral and more critical than consumer ratings. We then find that consumers provide reviews with higher ratings following expert reviews due to the information disclosure effect. Decomposing the effect by expert reviews’ multidimensional characteristics, we find the effect is attenuated by multidimensional expert rating valence and multidimensional rating discrepancy between experts and consumers but amplified by multidimensional expert rating variance. Natural language processing of consumer review texts unveils a positive impact of multidimensional expert reviews on consumer satisfaction and a negative impact on consumer disappointment, which speaks to the underlying mechanism behind the information disclosure effect. Lastly, we find that the effect varies with expert characteristics, product characteristics, and information channels, diminishes when multidimensional expert reviews are posted sooner after product launch, and decays over time but persists in the long run. These findings not only advance information theories in understanding expert reviews and multidimensional rating systems but also provide valuable insights for stakeholders, such as platforms, firms, and expert reviewers, to improve review program operations and consumer engagement.},

We analyze more than 55,000 papers published by more than 54,000 unique authors during this period to document four sets of findings. First, our analysis suggests that Operations Management and Multidisciplinary areas experienced significant publication growth from 2008 to 2022, increasing their publication and citation share in FT 50 journals, even after accounting for the relative handicap in terms of number of journals in the FT 50 list. Second, the growth in publications of the Operations Management discipline is driven by significant growth in Production and Operations Management and Manufacturing and Service Operations Management . The Journal of Business Ethics is a notable outlier, it alone published nearly 10% of the papers published in the FT 50 list, more than the number of papers published by the five disciplines each: Accounting, Marketing, Multidisciplinary, Operations Management, and Information Systems. Third, we find that the most prolific authors in Management and Organizations, Operations Management, Economics, and Marketing had a higher number of publications during the 2008–2022 period than the most prolific authors of other disciplines. Finally, our analyses of the most prolific 150 worldwide universities published in the FT 50 list suggest that the list is dominated mostly by about a dozen countries that include North American countries (the USA and Canada), European countries (Netherlands, Germany, the UK, France, and Spain), China (including Hong Kong), Australia, and Singapore.
