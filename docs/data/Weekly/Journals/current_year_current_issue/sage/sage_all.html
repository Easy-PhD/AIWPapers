  abstract     = {This paper examines the concept of creativity from a historical-psychological perspective, exploring its evolution over time and its manifestation as both an individual and collective phenomenon. Through a narrative-theoretical review of the literature on creativity’s conceptualization, nature, and valuation, we examine how social, cultural, and psychological factors have influenced the understanding of creativity throughout history. The discussion contrasts key aspects at the individual level, such as motivation, personality, intuition, exceptionality, and intelligence, with group dimensions like domain, field, collaboration, background, and the societal consequences of creative acts. The paper presents diverse psychological frameworks, including behaviorism, psychoanalysis, Gestalt psychology, humanistic psychology, and cognitive psychology, each offering unique insights into the mechanisms behind creativity. By tracing the historical phases of creativity—from its early association with divine creation to its modern applications in art, science, and technology, as well as its relationship with artificial intelligence—this paper highlights how creativity has been judged and valued across different eras. One of the conclusions drawn is that while the concept of artistic genius and originality cannot be disentangled from its broader social and cultural context, creativity is also an intensely personal psychological process, with the internalized sociocultural context acting as a proxy for external fields and domains.},

  abstract     = {We humans have scaffolded minds into an ecological niche. Considering this, the main thesis I will defend in this article is that we humans live surrounded by images, and we spatially organise these images into a particular cultural niche which I call imaginal space, a material or virtual space that we interactively navigate. We use such images in the imaginal space as fundamental props in the imaginative dynamics of our scaffolded minds. The images we find in our imaginal space are public depictive representations. They are twofold objects: on the one hand, they are material objects in that they can be manipulated into the ecological niche; on the other hand, they also are normative objects in that their representational function can be redesigned through a practice of use. As a first consequence of this main thesis, I will contend that public representations emergent into the imaginal space of a certain community may play a crucial regulative role for imagination: emergent systems of public representations can get a canonical status in their community, so that they can exert a normative power on the members of that community regulating their imagistic mental representations. As a second consequence, I will defend that the canonical images emergent in the imaginal space constitute the collective imagery of a human community: they support and influence the development of public narratives in the considered community.},

  abstract     = {The foraging task is a commonly studied scenario for distributed swarm robotic systems. The robots switch searching and resting behavior in a distributed manner to perform foraging quickly and energy efficiently. It is known that robots that are resting can act as a potential labor pool in addition to saving energy. Because they function as a potential labor pool, resting robots can help with foraging if needed. In this study, we consider the group foraging task, which requires two or more robots to transport a food item. In a group foraging task, resting robots can help with the transportation of a heavy food item in response to the recruitment of other robots. Until now, the efficacy of the resting behavior as a potential labor pool has been suggested, but the environments in which this function is dominant is still unknown. In this study, we propose a state-transition model for robots that includes the resting behavior and investigate the performance through multi-agent simulation. By comparing models with and without the resting behavior, we found that the function of the resting behavior as a potential labor pool is dominant in cases when the food items are heavy or the population is small.},

Furthermore, all essential aspects are integrated with deep learning optimisation, encompassing data normalisation and hybrid learning methodologies to efficiently manage large-scale data, resulting in personalised healthcare solutions. The implementation of the suggested technology in real time addresses the significant disparity between data-driven and healthcare applications, hence facilitating the seamless integration of genetic insights. The contributions are illustrated in real time, and the results are presented through simulation experiments encompassing 4 scenarios and 2 case studies. Consequently, the comparison research reveals that the efficacy of bioinformatics for enhancing routes stands at 7%, while complexity diminish to 1%, thereby indicating that healthcare operations can be transformed by computational biology.},

  abstract     = {The spinal diseases commonly faced by people in the 19th century included intervertebral disc degeneration, tuberculosis and congenital defects that resulted in neurological impairment and global disability. To address these issues, cervical spine surgery was performed. Modern techniques currently used in spine surgery include interbody devices, pedicle screws, artificial discs and bone grafts. The postoperative complications clinically reported during follow-up include nonunion and implant subsidence, which remain significant drawbacks. The objective of this study is to develop a 3-dimensional finite element model of the C2-C7 cervical spine and validate it against existing experimental studies. The loading conditions considered for this study include a compressive preload of 50 N and a 1 Nm moment applied to the C2 vertebra, with the C7 vertebra fixed at the bottom. In this study, the biomechanical alterations of 4 different cage morphologies were analysed using finite element analysis. Valeo cages with 4 distinct designs were implanted at the C5-C6 level, and physiological motion at the surgical site was studied. Cage subsidence and migration, which can lead to adjacent segment disc degeneration, were also examined. Subsidence was primarily attributed to higher stress encountered in the cage, so stress distribution within the cages was evaluated. Additionally, stress distribution in the anterior plate and screws was analysed. The study concludes that introducing anterior plate and screw fixation helps prevent cage subsidence. Physiological motion at the surgical level was reduced compared to the intact model. Adjacent disc stress was also evaluated and found to be lower than in the intact model.},

In the present study, the epidemic patterns of SARS-COV-2 disease have been investigated from the point of view of mathematical modeling. Also, the effect of quarantine has been considered. This mathematical model is designed in the form of fractional calculations along with a model predictive control (MPC) to monitor this model. The fractional-order model has the memory and hereditary properties of the system, which can provide more adjustable parameters to the designer. Because the MPC can predict future outputs, it can overcome the conditions and events that occur in the future. The results of the simulations show that the proposed nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) of fractional-order has a lower mean squared error in susceptible people compared to the optimal control of fractional-order (~3.6e-04 vs. 47.4). This proposed NMPC of fractional-order can be used for other models of epidemics.},

The current research work puts forward a framework integrating CNN with CBAM and BiLSTM layers for the purpose of extracting valuable features and classifying ECG signals. The model classifies heartbeats according to the AAMI EC57 standard into 5 categories: normal beats (N), supraventricular ectopic beats (S), ventricular ectopic beats (V), fusion beats (F), and unknown beats (Q). To tackle uneven class distributions, SMOTE synthesizes new samples, making the model more robust. Evaluation on MIT-BIH arrhythmia database yields remarkable results with 99.20% accuracy, 97.50% sensitivity, 99.81% specificity, and 98.29% mean F 1 score.

First, the finite element method (FEM) in Abaqus software was used to model the effects of 10 muscle and joint forces across various regions of the femur. Then, using the response surface methodology (RSM), and examining the effect coefficients of each joint and muscle force, the hip joint reaction force with an impact coefficient of 210.97 was identified as the most effective force on bone stress. After that, the gluteus minimus and gluteus medius muscle forces were ranked second and third in terms of stress effect with coefficients of 66.6 and 34.47. This study showed that the anterior femoral muscles have a significant effect on stress compared to the posterior femoral muscles. RSM enables faster and more precise identification of joint and muscle forces influencing femoral stresses compared to conventional methods. This innovative approach not only increased the understanding of biomechanical phenomena, but also provided a more efficient tool for investigating and optimizing such processes in biomedical engineering applications.},

This study focuses on reducing the acoustic noise produced inside the cylindrical shell of the scanner, where the patient is located. Vibration modes are generated by eddy currents in the cylindrical shell induced by gradient magnetic fields. Additionally, the scanner wall is typically joined to the gradient spiral cylinder, causing vibrations to be transmitted to the wall and thereby producing extra sound waves. The present study investigates methods for mitigating noise from the scanner wall and reducing the transmission noise from the spiral gradient cylinder. Numerical methods and practical solutions for lowering acoustic noise in MRI gradient coils are explored. A 20 mm uniform absorber is demonstrated as an effective design for significantly reducing acoustic noise in the frequency range 0 to 3 kHz. Finally, numerical analysis of gradient cycles yields solutions that lower both vibration and noise levels.},

  abstract     = {Tiny Artificial Intelligence (Tiny AI) is transforming resource-constrained embedded systems, particularly in e-health applications, by introducing a shift in Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) and its integration with the Internet of Things (IoT). Unlike conventional machine learning (ML), which demands substantial processing power, TinyML strategically delegates processing requirements to the cloud infrastructure, allowing lightweight models to run on embedded devices. This study aimed to (i) Develop a TinyML workflow that details the steps for model creation and deployment in resource-constrained environments and (ii) apply the workflow to e-health applications for the real-time detection of epileptic seizures using electroencephalography (EEG) data. The methodology employs a dataset of 4097 EEG recordings per patient, each 23.5 seconds long, from 500 patients, to develop a robust and resilient model. The model was deployed using TinyML on microcontrollers tailored to hardware with limited resources. TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) efficiently runs ML models on small devices, such wearables. Simulation outcomes demonstrated significant performance, particularly in predicting epileptic seizures, with the ExtraTrees Classifier achieving a notable 99.6% Area Under the Curve (AUC) on the validation set. Because of its superior performance, the ExtraTrees Classifier was selected as the preferred model. For the optimized TinyML model, the accuracy remained practically unchanged, whereas inference time was significantly reduced. Additionally, the converted model had a smaller size of 256 KB, approximately ten times smaller, making it suitable for microcontrollers with a capacity of no more than 1 MB. These findings highlight the potential of TinyML to significantly enhance healthcare applications by enabling real-time, energy-efficient decision-making directly on local devices. This is especially valuable in scenarios with limited computing resources or during emergencies, as it reduces latency, ensures privacy, and operates without reliance on cloud infrastructure. Moreover, by reducing the size of training datasets needed, TinyML helps lower overall costs and minimizes the risk of overfitting, making it an even more cost-effective and reliable solution for healthcare innovations.},

The algorithm integrates advanced parameter optimization techniques to improve clustering accuracy and interpretability. Key innovations include a fast grid search method for optimizing the search of optimal minimum points (MinPts) by keeping the ϵ parameter obtained constant. Notably, this study emphasizes the often-overlooked MinPts parameter, introducing a dynamic approach that initiates by calculating density metrics within a specified ϵ distance and adjusting the MinPts range based on the standard deviation of these metrics. This approach identifies optimal MinPts values based on the maximum allowed range. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate SS-DBSCAN’s superior performance compared to density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), hierarchical DBSCAN, and ordering points to identify the clustering structure (OPTICS), evidenced by higher silhouette and Davies–Bouldin index scores. The results highlight SS-DBSCAN’s ability to capture intrinsic clustering structures accurately, providing deeper insights across various research domains. SS-DBSCAN’s scalability and adaptability to diverse data densities make it a valuable tool for analyzing large, complex datasets.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning fairness enhancement methods based on data bias correction are usually divided into two processes: The determination of sensitive attributes (such as race and gender) and the correction of data bias. In terms of determining sensitive attributes, existing studies tend to rely too heavily on sociological knowledge and neglect the importance of exploring potential sensitive attributes directly from the data itself. The accuracy of this approach is limited when dealing with data that cannot be fully explained by sociological factors. Regarding data bias correction, existing methods are primarily categorized into causality-based and association-based methods. The former requires a deep understanding of the underlying causal structure in the dataset, which is often difficult to achieve in practice. The latter method correlates sensitive attributes with algorithmic results through statistical measures, but this approach often tends to ignore the impact of sensitive attributes on other attributes. In this paper, we formalize the identification of sensitive attributes as a problem solvable through data analysis, without relying on commonly recognized knowledge in social science. We also propose a data pre-processing method that considers the effects of attributes correlated with sensitive attributes to enhance algorithmic fairness by combining the association-based bias reduction method. We evaluated our proposed method on a public dataset. The evaluation results indicate that our method can accurately identify sensitive attributes and improve the fairness of machine learning algorithms compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a growing trend in utilizing deep learning techniques to solve various NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, mostly using deep neural networks to generate the solutions directly. In this work, we address a famous combinatorial optimization problem on graphs, the graph coloring problem (GCP), and propose novel ways that train and utilize deep node embeddings to facilitate the problem’s solving. Specifically, we propose to use Transformer to learn the correlation between nodes in graphs. The Transformer learns the node embeddings (feature vectors) such that nodes that might be in the same color in (near-)optimal solutions have close embeddings. To generate the labels, we use a typical GCP heuristic called Tabucol to solve each small training instance multiple times. In this way, the labels are generated more efficiently and robustly as compared to using an exact solver. We then apply the learned embeddings to guide several construction and searching algorithms for the GCP, including Tabucol. Empirical results show that all the algorithms could be improved by utilizing the learned node embeddings, and our methods generalize well to graphs on much larger scales than the training graphs.},

  abstract     = {Since the text-to-image synthesis with non-stacked network structure only models the global features of the image and the semantic features of the text, it is easy to cause problems such as semantic inconsistency, loss of detail features, and incomplete main content in the generated images. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a text-to-image generation method (cascaded structure and joint attention generative adversarial network (CSGAN)) that combines cascaded structure and joint attention. After encoding the text, this method utilizes a conditional enhancement module to process it, which enhances the expressive ability of the text features. In order to make the local area of the image better fit the text features, this method designs a joint attention module to solve the problem that the image generation process cannot fully reflect the local details of the text content. By using affine transform mapping visual features and cascade structure to fuse the features of different modules, the integrity of the whole content of the image is effectively guaranteed and the semantic consistency of the text image is improved. Experimental results on the CUB dataset show that compared with the current mainstream non-stacked network model DF-GAN model, the inception score index of the CSGAN model is improved by about 4.01%, and the Fréchet inception distance index is reduced by about 13.36%. These data indicators and visualization results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the CSGAN model.},

It includes RGB, depth, and skeleton sequences captured by Microsoft Kinect in a theatrical setting. The dataset features untrimmed theater scenes as well as trimmed sequences consisting of individual gestures for actor gesture recognition. We test state-of-the-art image captioning models on untrimmed scenes, revealing that dense captioning models generate redundant captions with fixed numbers, leading to imprecise descriptions and a lack of context. These challenges hinder visually impaired individuals from comprehending theater scenes descriptions effectively. Additionally, we assess the performance of skeleton-based graph convolution networks for human action recognition in a theater environment using trimmed skeleton sequences. The results highlight limitations in recognizing human actions in this setting. Based on these findings, we propose solutions for overcoming these challenges, paving the way for future improvements in making theater performances more accessible to individuals with visual impairments.},

  abstract     = {Paraphrasing involves rewording a text to maintain its meaning while using different language. In recent years, there has been growing interest among researchers in automatic paraphrase generation (APG). Previous studies have primarily focused on developing corpora and methods for APG tasks in English and other languages. However, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmark corpora and standardized methods specifically designed for APG in Urdu. To address this gap, this study introduces two extensive benchmark corpora: the Urdu Phrasal Paraphrase corpus (UPP-22 corpus) at the phrasal level and the Urdu Sentential Paraphrase corpus (USP-22 corpus) at the sentence level. The UPP-22 corpus contains 3,50,000 paraphrased pairs, while the USP-22 corpus consists of 11,000 paraphrased pairs, both specifically curated for the Urdu APG task. As a second major contribution, this research developed and applied various state-of-the-art deep learning models, including sequence-to-sequence models (using long short-term memory [LSTM], gated recurrent unit [GRU], bidirectional LSTM, and bidirectional GRU) and sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanisms as baseline methods for the proposed Urdu Paraphrase corpora. Additionally, the study introduced a bidirectional and auto-regressive transformer-based model specifically tailored to these corpora as a third contribution. A fourth significant contribution was the development of a test corpus at the phrasal level, consisting of 10,000 instances, created through automatic translation, followed by manual inspection and correction, to evaluate the performance of APG tasks for the Urdu language. As a fifth major contribution, the study applied and fine-tuned a large language model (GPT-4-Mini) for APG in Urdu, resulting in significant performance improvements. The evaluation was carried out using the standard bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) metric. The best results were achieved with BLEU-1 = 75.89 for the UPP-22 corpus and BLEU-1 = 75.16 for the USP-22 corpus using the GPT-4-Mini model, representing a significant improvement over all other models including baseline. These corpora and methodologies will be made publicly available to encourage and promote further research in APG for under-resourced languages such as Urdu.},

However, the heterogeneity of multimodal signals poses a challenge in learning modality representation and fusing information. To address it, the BiMSA (multimodal sentiment analysis based on BiGRU and bidirectional interactive attention) is proposed in this paper. In the modality representation learning layer, BiMSA incorporates a structure consisting of BiGRU to extract contextual information from video and audio inputs. Subsequently, modality features are projected into modality internal representations and interactive representations for extracting information. This practice allows the model to take into account more aspects of modality information. In terms of the modality fusion layer, a bidirectional interactive attention mechanism is used to focus on the key representations of key modalities, and integrate multimodal information flexibly and efficiently. Attention weights are concentrated on modality representations that synergistically contribute toward overall sentiment orientation. Additionally, the constraints of similarity loss and difference loss are introduced to align with representations while mitigating redundant information and achieving a better fusion effect. Experimental results on public datasets (CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI) demonstrate the effectiveness of the BiMSA model.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle detection using computer vision plays a crucial role in accurately recognizing and responding to various road conditions, targets, and signals, particularly within autonomous driving technology. However, traditional vehicle detection algorithms suffer from slow detection speed, low accuracy, and poor robustness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the simple attention mechanism-you only look once (SAM-YOLO) algorithm. SAM-YOLO incorporates the simple attention mechanism into the YOLOv7 network, allowing for the capture of more detailed information without introducing additional parameters. In this study, we experimentally redesigned the backbone network of SAM-YOLO by replacing the redundant part of the network layer with the C3 module, resulting in improved model performance while maintaining accuracy. The experimental results show that the SAM-YOLO algorithm performs excellently in several evaluation metrics under conventional conditions, especially outperforming other algorithms in accuracy and mean average precision values. In tests on the ExLight dataset facing extreme lighting conditions, SAM-YOLO similarly demonstrated optimal detection capabilities, especially in terms of robustness when dealing with complex lighting variations. These findings emphasize the potential of the SAM-YOLO algorithm for real-time and accurate target detection tasks, especially in environments with highly variable lighting conditions.},

Particularly noteworthy is the heightened prowess of pre-trained large language models in tackling tasks that were a real challenge a few years ago, such as the abstractive summarization of dialogs. An approach to generating summaries involves engineering prompt templates. The easiest way would be by using a static prompt, but it can lead to unreliable outcomes for different classes of dialogs. We implemented a scoring system to enhance the performance of a few-shot training. This involves constructing finely tuned prompts composed of dialog samples with the highest scores. The scoring process is grounded in a set of heuristics that specifically assess the structure and content of the dialogs. The use of the scoring system resulted in enhanced ROUGE scores and positive evaluations from human assessors. These promising results were consistently validated across all three large-scale datasets used in the testing phase.},

  abstract     = {Since several years, sustainability has become a very important challenge for our societies. Our lifestyles are in the process of making our planet uninhabitable because of the various impacts that we, as human beings, are inflicting on it. As part of these impacts, we focus on Complex Systems designed by humans. It is of uttermost importance to be able to analyze and design complex systems so that the sustainability features are taken into account. More specifically, the contribution of this article is to propose models and tools for the assessment of systems sustainability during the analysis and design phases. The analysis and design of systems may be difficult tasks. It is even more so for complex systems. Since decades, the System Engineering (SE) field has given birth to a family of systemic and multidisciplinary approaches for the design of systems. Among SE approaches, Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) is a special kind of SE that relies on formalized models as first-class citizens deliverables for all analysis and design activities from requirements elicitation to final design and validation. SysML (Systems Modelling Language) is one of these MBSE approaches. SysML is a well-known, general purpose graphical systems modelling language that supports SE approaches. In addition, SysML allows its own language extension by the creation of new concepts and diagrams. This extension mechanism is known as Domain Specific Modelling Language (DSML). The contributions presented in this paper consist in the definition of an extension of SysML that provides models and tools in order to assess the sustainability of systems during analysis and design. This extension of SysML is based upon a technique, named profile, and proposes new modelling concepts for taking into consideration sustainability issues during systems engineering. Moreover, these new model elements are supported by software tools issued from the MBSE domain and allow the development of ad-hoc software tooling support.},

Moreover, the system is equipped with a microcontroller and appropriate sensors that enable its automated operation based on measurements of the internal and external environmental conditions. A Raspberry Pi acts as a server, enabling the communication between the shading devices and the users, through an open-source home automation operating system (Home Assistant OS).

  abstract     = {Wi-Fi sensing exploits radio-frequency signals emitted by Wi-Fi devices to analyze environments, enabling tasks such as people tracking, intruder detection, and gesture recognition. Its growing diffusion is driven by the IEEE 802.11bf standard, which facilitates environmental monitoring, and the increasing demand for tools capable of penetrating obstacles while preserving privacy. However, the performance of Wi-Fi-based sensing solutions is influenced by the environment in which signals are acquired. This is critical when extracting spatial and temporal information from the surrounding scene, as such data reflect both environmental structure and interference sources. A main challenge is achieving generalization across domains, that is, ensuring consistent performance under varying conditions, such as different rooms or buildings, without significant accuracy loss. This paper presents a deep model for domain adaptation of Wi-Fi signals by simulating a digital shielding mechanism. The model is based on a Relativistic average Generative Adversarial Network (RaGAN), which mimics physical shielding to suppress domain-specific features while preserving signal integrity. Both the generator and discriminator use Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) architectures, enabling modeling of waveform and time-dimension signal characteristics. To support training, an acrylic box lined with electromagnetic shielding fabric, replicating a Faraday cage, was constructed. Spectra from same-sized objects made of different materials were acquired both inside (domain-free) and outside (domain-dependent) the box. A multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM), trained on shielded spectra and tested on RaGAN-denoised data, achieved 96 percent accuracy. The SVM also distinguished materials, suggesting a promising approach for security systems aimed at identifying the nature and composition of potentially dangerous objects.},

  abstract     = {According to US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), we have only explored five percent of our world ocean. Among the ocean exploration tasks, underwater object detection is a multidisciplinary challenge that extends beyond engineering into fields such as oceanography, marine biology, and environmental science. Scientifically, it involves understanding the complex interactions between sound waves, light, and water, as well as the navigation dynamics within marine environments. The underwater environment presents unique physical challenges for object detection due to factors like light attenuation, turbidity, and the variability of acoustic propagation. This paper introduces a cost-effective autonomous underwater prototype for real-time detection, and localization of small underwater objects (e.g., archaeological artifacts, parts of infrastructures, wreckage debris, but also life forms like fishes, corals etc.) in shallow waters. The system combines object identification with autonomous navigation capabilities. It consists of an autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with sensors, cameras, and localization tools, as well as a ground control station for monitoring and intervention. In particular, we focus on a case study about detecting and reporting the locations of unexploded ordnance materials, contributing to the monitoring of underwater hazards in conflict-affected regions. Key contributions include the integration of a cost-effective autonomous remotely operated vehicle with sensors and software for real-time detection and localization of small underwater objects, as well as an annotated dataset of UXO images, usable as a benchmark.},

An anomaly detection solution was developed for a screw production plant, utilizing machine vision and AI to identify overlapping screws as anomalies. Two improvements are proposed to a basic solution initially relying on a laser profiler for depth images. The first improvement applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to the laser profiler's output, and the second replaces the laser profiler with a camera that captures color images, applying a CNN to its output. The first improvement was tested with real laser profiler data using YOLOv8 and Mask R-CNN segmentation models. After achieving comparable results on the real dataset, the second improvement was tested on multiple synthetic datasets, simulating different scenarios, including setups with mixed screws. Results demonstrated that model performance on color images, represented in the RGB color space (red, green, and blue), was comparable to depth images, validating color cameras as an appropriate alternative. Since color cameras are cheaper and capture images faster, they are well-suited for high-speed quality control systems, offering significant cost and performance advantages.

Therefore, developing an autonomous, rapid, and reliable method of reading, detecting, and assessing CT scans is important. However, extracting the liver region from CT scans is a bottleneck for any approach. This paper introduces a three-part automatic process. Initial processing includes noise suppression and image enhancement. Optimized Bi-lateral Filtering is used to carry it out; in this case, the process's control parameters are optimized using the Monarch butterfly optimization method. After that, automatic liver segmentation and lesion identification are performed. Mask-Region-based Convolutional Neural Network segment liver from the pre-processed images. Then a new generator network named LiverNet is used to detect tumors within the liver. Finally, an Enhanced Swin Transformer Network employing Adversarial Propagation distinguishes between malignant and benign liver lesions. Positive developments were discovered as a result of the inquiry. Expert results are associated with the consequences of segmentation and analysis. The classifier makes a relatively accurate tumour differentiation and gives the radiologist a second opinion.},

It involves detecting objects in an image and generating a segmentation mask for each object. This assortment of tasks can enhance the precision and velocity of object detection by providing more accurate object boundaries and, in some cases, eliminating the need for post-processing steps. The image segmentation module in YONET handles intermediate abstract representations and utilizes them as input for object detection.

To address how to effectively combine the complementary characteristics of visible and thermal modalities, as well as how to fully leverage the superior performance of models trained on visible light target tracking tasks, while also aiming for lower computational costs and higher tracking effectiveness, a dual-prompt complementary fusion strategy for an RGBT tracking network is proposed. Drawing on the concept of prompt learning, this network aims to extend the efficient performance of visible light target tracking to the RGBT target tracking domain. In its implementation, the prompt module inputs both visible and thermal modality information as dual prompts into the backbone network, where the network utilizes these prompts to generate new, enriched prompt information at each layer. Subsequently, an information enhancement fusion module enhances the acquired prompt information and refeeds it into the backbone network, aiming to improve the tracking accuracy and robustness. Experimental results on GTOT, RGBT234 and LasHeR datasets show that the tracking accuracy (PR) and success rate (SR) of the network reach 93.1%/76.8%, 84.4%/62.4% and 66.8%/53.8%, respectively, which is improved compared with the current mainstream RGBT target tracking network, which verifies the effectiveness of the network.},

Existing research has faced substantial challenges in low detection rates and poor generalization on multilingual generated text and short text. To fill these gaps, in this paper, we propose a generic bilingual generated text detection model to integrate semantic and statistical features, which exhibits proficiency in English and Chinese. To obtain fine-grained features, we employ the multilingual pre-trained language model xlm-RoBERTa to extract the CLS vector as overall semantic features, integrating with statistical features log rank, probability, and cumulative probability for detection. Moreover, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) serves to interpret the decision-making process. The experimental results demonstrate significant advancements over baselines, notably with the F1 score improvements exceeding 10% and 5% on the English and Chinese HC3 sentence-level datasets, respectively. Our proposed method exhibits higher generalization for advanced LLMs and out-of-domain datasets with a 91.13% F1 score, thereby providing a more robust solution for detecting generated text.},

This study introduces an advanced system utilizing the EmoBank dataset, which contains text annotated with six basic emotions from diverse sources like social media, narratives, news articles, and movie scripts, ensuring accurate labeling through automated algorithms and manual annotation. Extensive preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, lowercasing, stop words removal, stemming, lemmatization, punctuation removal, handling special characters and numbers, text normalization, and encoding, prepare the text for analysis. Data augmentation methods such as random insertion, deletion, swapping, synonym replacement, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3, BERT, and RoBERTa enrich the dataset. Feature extraction combines word embeddings with self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual and semantic information. The ANOVA-RFE Fusion technique is applied for feature selection, while the Emotion Fusion Ensemble (EFE) method enhances classification by combining Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Extra Trees, SVM, and K-NN. Systematic experimentation and hyperparameter tuning using grid search validate the system's performance. Notably, the combination of GPT-3+WE+ANOVA-RFE+EFE achieved 89% accuracy before tuning and 94% after tuning. This research underscores the critical role of integrated processing, augmentation, and ensemble learning in advancing emotion recognition, suggesting future exploration of emerging language models, novel augmentation techniques, and domain specific adaptations for developing more accurate and robust systems.},

As a major source of energy consumption in buildings, the control schemes for HVAC systems need to be optimized to improve energy efficiency. To address the above issues, a fuzzy controller was designed to regulate the HVAC system, and an improved snake optimizer (ISO) was proposed to optimize the membership function of the fuzzy controller in this study. In the ISO algorithm, the parameter Threshold of the snake optimizer (SO) was dynamically adjusted, and the snake egg-hatching formula was improved. Benchmark function tests show that the convergence speed and optimization accuracy of ISO are superior to those of the established comparison algorithms. Furthermore, simulation experiments indicate that the ISO-optimized HVAC system has a temperature error of 0 and a humidity ratio error of less than 1.5% compared to competing methods. In addition, the ISO-optimized HVAC system achieves a 40.8% reduction in annual energy consumption.},

Therefore, it can collect more comprehensive fuzzy information in decision-making issues, which makes PDHFS has a wide range of applications in practice. The distance, similarity and entropy measures (EMs) of PDHFSs were studied. Due to the particularity of PDHFS, the length of MD and NMD of two probabilistic dual hesitation fuzzy elements (PDHFEs) are often different. To define the distance measure more expediently, many current studies need to add fresh elements to ensure that the length of corresponding elements in MD and NMD are the same, which will destroy the original information of the elements. In order to overcome this disadvantage, this paper defined some novel PDHF distance measures without adding elements. Some novel PDHF similarity measures were defined through the complementary relationship between distance and similarity measures based on the newly proposed PDHF distance measures. The fuzziness of a given PDHFS can be measured by the similarity measure between it and its complement. Based on the property, some novel PDHF EMs were proposed. Finally, three numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of these novel information measures.},

  abstract     = {Recommender systems that mine users’ intentions to explore their potential interaction preferences have received increasing attention. However, the existing research on intent recommendation has some limitations. On one hand, the extant studies only consider users’ historical interaction information and the sparse interactions cannot reflect users’ potential interaction intention; on the other hand, they do not consider the changes in users’ kinematic and static intentions over time and the importance of users’ intention disentanglement representation, which makes it impossible for the general intention recommendation model to obtain a better representation of the intention. We propose a multitask recommendation model with dynamic and static intent integration and de-entanglement. The model mines users’ dynamic and static intents and then combines them with regularization to model the independence of the intents, encouraging the differences between the intents. Meanwhile, to further alleviate the data sparsity problem, this study additionally constructs user–user and item–item graphs using four different similarity measures, such as cosine similarity and mutual information, applies graph convolutional networks to learn about the three graphs, and then captures the complementarity between different graphs using a graph-level cross-attention mechanism. Extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies on three public datasets demonstrate that DSI-ID consistently outperforms all baseline methods, achieving a 3.5%–7.4% improvement in recommendation performance over the best baseline.},

The self-attention mechanism (SAM) of this model focused on the correlations among data elements of the minority class. The degree of correlation was first obtained by calculating the attention scores, which enabled the effective extraction of the distribution characteristics of the data. Subsequently, a generative adversarial network (GAN) was used to generate samples with high similarity to reduce data imbalances.

The experimental results showed that the F1-score , G-mean , and area under PRC curve ( AUPRC ) of the model were considerably better than those of the other imbalanced data classification methods.

Our method addresses the problem of reducing object pose uncertainty by using two complementary particle filters over a series of actions: one to estimate contact location (CPFGrasp) and another to estimate object poses (SCOPE). Our method addresses uncertainty in both robot proprioception and force-torque measurements, which is important for estimating in-hand object pose in the real world. We implement and evaluate our approach on simulated and real-world single-arm and dual-arm robotic systems.

  abstract     = {Scaling to arbitrarily large bundle adjustment problems requires data and compute to be distributed across multiple devices. Centralized methods in prior works are only able to solve small or medium size problems due to overhead in computation and communication. In this paper, we present a fully decentralized method that alleviates computation and communication bottlenecks to solve arbitrarily large bundle adjustment problems. We achieve this by reformulating the reprojection error and deriving a novel surrogate function that decouples optimization variables from different devices. This function makes it possible to use majorization minimization techniques and reduces bundle adjustment to independent optimization subproblems that can be solved in parallel. Moreover, an efficient closed-form warm start strategy has been presented that always improves bundle adjustment estimates. We further apply Nesterov’s acceleration and adaptive restart to improve convergence while maintaining its theoretical guarantees. Despite limited peer-to-peer communication, our method has provable convergence to first-order critical points under mild conditions. On extensive benchmarks with public datasets, our method converges much faster than decentralized baselines with similar memory usage and communication load. Compared to centralized baselines using a single device, our method, while being decentralized, yields more accurate solutions with significant speedups of up to 953.7x over C e r e s and 174.6x over D e e p L M .

However, these approaches have been limited to learning simple behaviors in current real-world manipulation benchmarks, such as pushing or pick-and-place. To enable more complex, long-horizon behaviors of an autonomous robot, we propose to focus on real-world furniture assembly, a complex, long-horizon robotic manipulation task that requires addressing many current robotic manipulation challenges. We present FurnitureBench, a reproducible real-world furniture assembly benchmark aimed at providing a low barrier for entry and being easily reproducible, so that researchers across the world can reliably test their algorithms and compare them against prior work. For ease of use, we provide 200+ hours of pre-collected data (5000+ demonstrations), 3D printable furniture models, a robotic environment setup guide, and systematic task initialization. Furthermore, we provide FurnitureSim, a fast and realistic simulator of FurnitureBench. We benchmark the performance of offline RL, IL, and offline-to-online RL algorithms on our assembly tasks and demonstrate the need to improve such algorithms to be able to solve our tasks in the real world, providing ample opportunities for future research.},

  abstract     = {Computing optimal, collision-free trajectories for high-dimensional systems is a challenging and important problem. Sampling-based planners struggle with the dimensionality, whereas trajectory optimizers may get stuck in local minima due to inherent nonconvexities in the optimization landscape. The use of mixed-integer programming to encapsulate these nonconvexities and find globally optimal trajectories has recently shown great promise, thanks in part to tight convex relaxations and efficient approximation strategies that greatly reduce runtimes. These approaches were previously limited to Euclidean configuration spaces, precluding their use with mobile bases or continuous revolute joints. In this paper, we handle such scenarios by modeling configuration spaces as Riemannian manifolds, and we describe a reduction procedure for the zero-curvature case to a mixed-integer convex optimization problem. We further present a method for obtaining approximate solutions via piecewise-linear approximations that is applicable to manifolds of arbitrary curvature. We demonstrate our results on various robot platforms, including producing efficient collision-free trajectories for a PR2 bimanual mobile manipulator.},

  abstract     = {Learning from demonstration (LfD) seeks to democratize robotics by enabling non-experts to intuitively program robots to perform novel skills through human task demonstration. Yet, LfD is challenging under a task and motion planning (TAMP) setting, as solving long-horizon manipulation tasks requires the use of hierarchical abstractions. Prior work has studied mechanisms for eliciting demonstrations that include hierarchical specifications for robotics applications but has not examined whether non-roboticist end-users are capable of providing such hierarchical demonstrations without explicit training from a roboticist for each task. We characterize whether, how, and which users can do so. Finding that the result is negative, we develop a series of training domains that successfully enable users to provide demonstrations that exhibit hierarchical abstractions. Our first experiment shows that fewer than half (35.71%) of our subjects provide demonstrations with hierarchical abstractions when not primed. Our second experiment demonstrates that users fail to teach the robot with adequately detailed TAMP abstractions, when not shown a video demonstration of an expert’s teaching strategy. Our experiments reveal the need for fundamentally different approaches in LfD to enable end-users to teach robots generalizable long-horizon tasks without being coached by experts at every step. Toward this goal, we developed and evaluated a set of TAMP domains for LfD in a third study. Positively, we find that experience obtained in different, training domains enables users to provide demonstrations with useful, plannable abstractions on new, test domains just as well as providing a video prescribing an expert’s teaching strategy in the new domain.},

  abstract     = {This paper reports a novel result: with proper robot models based on geometric mechanics, one can formulate the kinodynamic motion planning problems for rigid body systems as exact polynomial optimization problems. Due to the nonlinear rigid body dynamics, the motion planning problem for rigid body systems is nonconvex. Existing global optimization-based methods do not parameterize 3D rigid body motion efficiently; thus, they do not scale well to long-horizon planning problems. We use Lie groups as the configuration space and apply the variational integrator to formulate the forced rigid body dynamics as quadratic polynomials. Then, we leverage Lasserre’s hierarchy of moment relaxation to obtain the globally optimal solution via semidefinite programming. By leveraging the sparsity of the motion planning problem, the proposed algorithm has linear complexity with respect to the planning horizon. This paper demonstrates that the proposed method can provide globally optimal solutions or certificates of infeasibility at the second-order relaxation for 3D drone landing using full dynamics and inverse kinematics for serial manipulators. Moreover, we extend the algorithms to multi-body systems via the constrained variational integrators. The testing cases on cart-pole and drone with cable-suspended load suggest that the proposed algorithms can provide rank-one optimal solutions or nontrivial initial guesses. Finally, we propose strategies to speed up the computation, including an alternative formulation using quaternion, which provides empirically tight relaxations for the drone landing problem at the first-order relaxation.},

How an accurate model can be developed automatically and efficiently from raw sensory inputs (such as images), especially for complex environments and tasks, is a challenging problem that hinders the broad application of model-based reinforcement learning in the real world. In this work, we propose a sensing-aware model-based reinforcement learning system called SAM-RL. Leveraging the differentiable physics-based simulation and rendering, SAM-RL automatically updates the model by comparing rendered images with real raw images and produces the policy efficiently. With the sensing-aware learning pipeline, SAM-RL allows a robot to select an informative viewpoint to monitor the task process. We apply our framework to real world experiments for accomplishing three manipulation tasks: robotic assembly, tool manipulation, and deformable object manipulation.

  abstract     = {We present a comprehensive framework for studying and leveraging morphological symmetries in robotic systems. These are intrinsic properties of the robot’s morphology, frequently observed in animal biology and robotics, which stem from the replication of kinematic structures and the symmetrical distribution of mass. We illustrate how these symmetries extend to the robot’s state space and both proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensor measurements, resulting in the equivariance of the robot’s equations of motion and optimal control policies. Thus, we recognize morphological symmetries as a relevant and previously unexplored physics-informed geometric prior, with significant implications for both data-driven and analytical methods used in modeling, control, estimation and design in robotics. For data-driven methods, we demonstrate that morphological symmetries can enhance the sample efficiency and generalization of machine learning models through data augmentation, or by applying equivariant/invariant constraints on the model’s architecture. In the context of analytical methods, we employ abstract harmonic analysis to decompose the robot’s dynamics into a superposition of lower-dimensional, independent dynamics. We substantiate our claims with both synthetic and real-world experiments conducted on bipedal and quadrupedal robots. Lastly, we introduce the repository MorphoSymm to facilitate the practical use of the theory and applications outlined in this work.},

Nonetheless, these learning systems exhibit brittle generalization and require excessive training data for practical tasks.

In this framework, partially autonomous robots are tasked with handling a major portion of decision-making where they work reliably; meanwhile, human operators monitor the process and intervene in challenging situations. Such a human–robot team ensures safe deployments in complex tasks. Further, we introduce a new learning algorithm to improve the policy’s performance on the data collected from the task executions. The core idea is re-weighing training samples with approximated human trust and optimizing the policies with weighted behavioral cloning. We evaluate Sirius in simulation and on real hardware, showing that Sirius consistently outperforms baselines over a collection of contact-rich manipulation tasks, achieving an 8% boost in simulation and 27% on real hardware than the state-of-the-art methods in policy success rate, with twice faster convergence and 85% memory size reduction.

However, collecting large real-world datasets is intractable due to high operational costs. For robot learning to generalize despite these challenges, it is essential to leverage sources of data or priors beyond the robot’s direct experience. In this work, we posit that image-text generative models, which are pre-trained on large corpora of web-scraped data, can serve as such a data source. These generative models encompass a broad range of real-world scenarios beyond a robot’s direct experience and can synthesize novel synthetic experiences that expose robotic agents to additional world priors aiding real-world generalization at no extra cost. In particular, our approach leverages pre-trained generative models as an effective tool for data augmentation. We propose a generative augmentation framework for semantically controllable augmentations and rapidly multiplying robot datasets while inducing rich variations that enable real-world generalization. Based on diverse augmentations of robot data, we show how scalable robot manipulation policies can be trained and deployed both in simulation and in unseen real-world environments such as kitchens and table-tops. By demonstrating the effectiveness of image-text generative models in diverse real-world robotic applications, our generative augmentation framework provides a scalable and efficient path for boosting generalization in robot learning at no extra human cost.},

We benchmark Diffusion Policy across 15 different tasks from 4 different robot manipulation benchmarks and find that it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art robot learning methods with an average improvement of 46.9%. Diffusion Policy learns the gradient of the action-distribution score function and iteratively optimizes with respect to this gradient field during inference via a series of stochastic Langevin dynamics steps. We find that the diffusion formulation yields powerful advantages when used for robot policies, including gracefully handling multimodal action distributions, being suitable for high-dimensional action spaces, and exhibiting impressive training stability. To fully unlock the potential of diffusion models for visuomotor policy learning on physical robots, this paper presents a set of key technical contributions including the incorporation of receding horizon control, visual conditioning, and the time-series diffusion transformer. We hope this work will help motivate a new generation of policy learning techniques that are able to leverage the powerful generative modeling capabilities of diffusion models.

  abstract     = {Search and exploration capabilities are essential for robots to inspect hazardous areas, support scientific expeditions in extreme environments, and potentially save human lives in natural disasters. The variability of scale in these problems requires robots to reason about time alongside their dynamics and sensor capabilities to effectively assess and explore for information. Recent advances in ergodic search methods have shown promise in supporting trajectory planning for exploration in continuous, multiscale environments with dynamics consideration. However, these methods are still limited by their inability to effectively reason about and adapt the time to explore in response to their environment. This ability is crucial for adapting exploration to variable-resolution information-gathering tasks. To address this limitation, this paper poses the time-optimal ergodic search problem and investigates solutions for fast, multiscale, and adaptive robotic exploration trajectories. The problem is formulated as a minimum-time problem with an ergodic inequality constraint whose upper bound specifies the amount of coverage needed. We show the existence of optimal solutions using Pontryagin’s conditions of optimality, and we demonstrate effective, minimum-time coverage numerically through a direct transcription optimization approach. The efficacy of the approach in generating time-optimal search trajectories is demonstrated in simulation under several nonlinear dynamic constraints, and in a physical experiment using a drone in a cluttered environment. We find that constraints such as obstacle avoidance are readily integrated into our formulation, and we show through an ablation study the flexibility of search capabilities at various scales. Last, we contribute a receding-horizon formulation of time-optimal ergodic search for sensor-driven information-gathering and demonstrate improved adaptive sampling capabilities in localization tasks.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, there is a growing demand for versatile robotic grippers that facilitate adaptive grasping across a range of objects, characterized by diverse attributes such as shapes, sizes, and mechanical properties. This research introduces a new soft gripper, denoted as ROSE ( RO tation-based S queezing Gripp E r), dedicated to the torsional buckling phenomenon to achieve its grasping capability. The inherent gripping pattern, formed through a single rotational actuation, enables ROSE to dynamically accommodate various objects (relatively smaller than the diameter of ROSE), even in challenging environments like an oil container, without a complicated controller. Experimental tests demonstrate that ROSE exhibits substantial gripping force, reaching up to more than 300 N in the specific setup, and a remarkable payload-to-weight ratio. Especially, ROSE can maintain mechanical integrity through long-term open-close operation cycles in a specific condition. In this paper, we also introduce non-linear simulations for the elaboration of behaviors of ROSE concerning different morphologies, encompassing geometry configurations and material properties. The findings highlight a significant correlation between morphological features and grasping performance, leading to the refinement of a dependable version of ROSE. This refined version was subsequently assessed through experimental trials in crop harvesting tasks, where ROSE demonstrated high success rates in picking both individual and clustered crops, regardless of their soft or stiff characteristics.

  abstract     = {In monocular visual-inertial navigation, it is desirable to initialize the system as quickly and robustly as possible. A state-of-the-art initialization method typically constructs a linear system to find a closed-form solution using the image features and inertial measurements and then refines the states with a nonlinear optimization. These methods generally require a few seconds of data, which however can be expedited (less than a second) by adding constraints from a robust but only up-to-scale monocular depth network in the nonlinear optimization. To further accelerate this process, in this work, we leverage the scale-less depth measurements instead in the linear initialization step that is performed prior to the nonlinear one, which only requires a single depth image for the first frame. Importantly, we show that the typical estimation of all feature states independently in the closed-form solution can be modeled as estimating only the scale and bias parameters of the learned depth map. As such, our formulation enables building a smaller minimal problem than the state of the art, which can be seamlessly integrated into RANSAC for robust estimation. Experiments show that our method has state-of-the-art initialization performance in simulation as well as on popular real-world datasets (TUM-VI, and EuRoC MAV). For the TUM-VI dataset in simulation as well as real-world, we demonstrate the superior initialization performance with only a 0.3 s window of data, which is the smallest ever reported, and validate that our method can initialize more often, robustly, and accurately in different challenging scenarios.},

Utilizing the MobileNetV2 architecture, this research leverages its efficiency and lightweight nature, making it suitable for mobile and embedded applications. Key techniques such as depthwise separable convolutions, linear bottlenecks, and inverted residuals help reduce the number of parameters and computational load while maintaining high performance in feature extraction. Additionally, the study employs comprehensive data augmentation methods, including horizontal and vertical flips, grayscale transformations, hue adjustments, brightness adjustments, and noise addition to enhance the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.53%∼100% with nearly perfect precision, recall of 95.7%, and F1-score of 94.6% for both “orange_good” and “orange_bad” classes, significantly outperforming previous models which typically achieved accuracies between 70% and 90%. While the classification performance was near-perfect in some aspects, there were minor errors in specific detection tasks. The confusion matrix shows that the model has high sensitivity and specificity, with very few misclassifications. Finally, this study highlights the practical applicability of the proposed model, particularly its easy deployment on resource-constrained devices and its effectiveness in agricultural product quality control processes. These findings affirm the model in this research as a reliable and highly efficient tool for agricultural product classification, surpassing the capabilities of traditional models in this field.},

  abstract     = {The Gaussian Q-function (GQF) is widely used in various scientific and engineering fields, especially in telecommunications and wireless communication. However, the lack of a closed-form expression for this function has led to considerable research efforts to achieve more accurate approximations. This study introduces a new approximate method that provides high accuracy for the boundaries of the GQF. The proposed approach utilizes parametric functions for both the lower and upper bounds of the GQF. The parameters of these functions are estimated using the Wild Horse Optimization (WHO), a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, with the aim of minimizing the distance between the proposed functions and the actual GQF. The optimization process targets the minimization of the maximum absolute error and the mean absolute error, ensuring that the proposed bounds provide a tight and accurate approximation of the GQF. Numerical experiments and comparisons with existing bounds demonstrate the superior accuracy of the proposed method. The new lower and upper bounds achieve significantly lower maximum absolute error and mean absolute error values compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, the study evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed bounds in estimating the symbol error probability (SEP) for various digital modulation schemes, showing that the new bounds provide more accurate estimates of the SEP compared to the existing bounds. The results highlight the practical significance of the proposed method in enhancing the reliability of error probability estimation in communication systems.},

The present study deals with the movement of the fluid containing tri-hybrid nanoparticles on an excessively large stagnation point area on a smooth plate in a permeable medium. Additionally, the leading partial differential equations of the proposed model are converted to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by incorporating similarity variables, and the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method is then used to solve these. To find the missing initial conditions of first-order ODEs, a shooting technique is also used. Furthermore, the consequences of heat transmission rate in the form of graphs and tables are explored. It is noticed that by enhancing the strength of the solid volume fraction the skin friction along the x-axis ( f ″ ( 0 ) or C F X ) increases as γ ∈ ( − 2 , 10 ] and decreases for the values of γ ∈ [ − 10 , 2 ) . But the converse of this behavior is true for g ″ ( 0 ) = C F Y .

Furthermore, a fuzzy adaptive strategy is developed to adjust the PD controller gain based on real-time errors. This article uses discrete Lyapunov iterative stability to analyze the global asymptotic stability of the robot closed-loop system. The experimental results verify that the DBO-fuzzy-PD controller is superior to the original PD controller. The ISE value is reduced from 3.4140 to 0.0384, and the IAE value is reduced from 1.9876 to 0.1843. The DBO-fuzzy-PD controller has better tracking accuracy and response speed than traditional PD.

While recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as LSTM and GRU have shown promise in modeling sequential dependencies, they often suffer from limitations like vanishing gradients and high computational cost when handling long sequences. To overcome these issues, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), particularly the Inception architecture, have emerged as powerful alternatives due to their ability to capture multiscale local patterns efficiently. In this study, we propose InceptionResNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates the residual learning mechanism of ResNet into the InceptionTime architecture. By replacing the fully convolutional network (FCN) shortcut module in InceptionFCN with ResNet-50, the model gains deeper representational capacity and improved gradient flow during training. We conduct extensive experiments on the UCR-85 benchmark dataset, comparing our model against state-of-the-art approaches, including InceptionTime, InceptionFCN, ResNet, FCN, and MLP. The results show that InceptionResNet achieves superior accuracy on 49 of 85 datasets, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in handling diverse and complex time series data.

  abstract     = {The nonnegative representation-based classification (NRC) method has attracted increasing attention in the field of face recognition. Building upon collaborative representation (CR), NRC incorporates a nonnegative constraint on the representation coefficients, thereby reducing the contribution of irrelevant training samples and enhancing overall classification performance. Despite these improvements, NRC inherits the same decision-making mechanism as the CR method, resulting in a decoupling of the representation and classification stages. This separation limits the method’s classification effectiveness. Furthermore, the presence of multicollinearity in the nonnegative representation may introduce inaccuracies in classification estimates, further undermining performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the competitive-collaborative nonnegative representation (CCNR) model. CCNR integrates two regularization terms: A competitive constraint and a collaborative constraint. The competitive constraint adopts a residual-based strategy during the classification stage, thereby strengthening the connection between representation and classification. This approach enables training samples from different classes to compete in representing the query sample, significantly improving classification performance. In parallel, the collaborative constraint applies an ℓ 2 -norm regularization to the representation coefficients, enhancing the stability of the model’s solution. Moreover, the CCNR model has been effectively deployed in smart campus environments. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on publicly available face datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, consistently demonstrating its competitive performance.

  abstract     = {Effective proportional–integral–derivative controller tuning is critical for attaining high-performance operation in direct current motor systems, especially when traditional approaches fail under nonlinear or uncertain dynamics. This study conducted a statistically robust comparative analysis of seven evolutionary algorithms for proportional–integral–derivative gain tuning: genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimisation, shuffled frog leaping algorithm, firefly algorithm, artificial bee colony, simulated annealing and invasive weed optimisation algorithm. Simulations were performed in MATLAB/Simulink using two different tuning scenarios: Case 1 (conservative bounds) and Case 2 (aggressive bounds), with the integral time absolute error serving as the primary performance metric. Analysis of variance, Tukey's honestly significant difference and Cohen's d were employed to ensure statistical validity. The results revealed distinct trade-offs among the algorithms. Particle swarm optimisation achieved the best overall performance, with a minimal integral time absolute error mean of 190.54 in Case 2, low volatility and a moderate execution time of 1200.19 s. The invasive weed optimisation algorithm was the fastest algorithm, with execution times of 285.76 and 371.43 s in Cases 1 and 2, respectively, but it exhibited higher integral time absolute error variability. Simulated annealing and the firefly algorithm yielded the lowest integral time absolute error means (158.74 and 160.22, respectively) in Case 1, but they required the highest computational time (up to 20,567.84 s for simulated annealing). In contrast, the artificial bee colony performed the worst, with a Case 2 integral time absolute error mean of 422.38 and significant gain inconsistency. Statistical analysis with analysis of variance, Tukey's honestly significant difference and Cohen's d revealed the significance of the differences. This work provides evidence-based guidance for selecting evolutionary algorithms in proportional–integral–derivative tuning based on system priorities. A hybrid invasive weed optimisation algorithm–particle swarm optimisation framework is proposed as a promising future direction, combining the rapid global search of invasive weed optimisation algorithm with the reliable convergence of particle swarm optimisation for real-time, high-precision control. DC motors power many everyday systems, from robots to electric vehicles. To control them effectively, engineers use PID controllers, but tuning these controllers can be difficult. This study compared seven computer algorithms inspired by natural processes to find the best way to tune PID settings. Results showed that Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) gave the most reliable overall performance, while Invasive Weed Optimisation (IWOA) was fastest but less consistent. The study provides practical guidance on choosing the right method based on priorities.},

  abstract     = {The concept of smart cities is becoming increasingly popular, driven by the goal of improving residents’ overall quality of life. Effective thermal management is a crucial component of smart cities, especially in light of significant changes in global weather patterns. These changes pose challenges for individuals seeking indoor comfort, particularly in workplaces and schools. Occupants often struggle with extreme temperatures, leading to increased energy consumption due to excessive use of air conditioners and heaters. In this work, we propose a novel edge machine learning-based smart controller for air conditioners to maintain user-preferred thermal comfort levels while minimizing energy consumption. The trained long short-term memory model is embedded in a mobile application designed to predict the predicted mean vote (PMV) based on temperature setpoints and the PMV index. Through this mobile application, personalized parameters such as clothing insulation, metabolic rate, and other environmental factors are communicated to the controller. The performance of the smart controller in maintaining PMV-based temperature setpoints for cooling is compared with fixed setpoints. The results reveal that by utilizing PMV-based setpoints for male occupants, the smart controller reduces energy consumption by 38.14% compared to a fixed setpoint of 26°C and by 60.68% compared to 25°C, while maintaining the user-preferred thermal comfort level.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing development of applications in smart homes, healthcare, and personal fitness, a broad scientific community has identified human activity recognition (HAR) as a critical study issue. This paper introduces a unique hybrid deep learning architecture for efficient human activity identification that combines multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The suggested CNN–MLP model provides a robust solution for HAR problems by leveraging the feature extraction capabilities of CNNs and the classification prowess of MLPs. Four different datasets were employed to comprehensively assess the model’s performance: WISDM, PAMAP2, and UCI HAR datasets for smartphone-based HAR, and the CASAS Aruba dataset that provided a novel perspective on activity detection in a home context, based on smart homes, while the smartphone-based UCI HAR, WISDM, and PAMAP2 datasets offered a variety of activity data. Across all datasets, our hybrid design outperformed all previous benchmarks, achieving high accuracy rates. These results underscore the model’s adaptability and efficiency in handling diverse sensor data types and activity scenarios. Furthermore, the model’s robustness and generalizability, demonstrated by its consistent performance across multiple datasets, establish it as a significant contribution to the field of HAR.},

  abstract     = {Virtual education (online education or e-learning) is a form of education where the primary mode of instruction is through digital platforms and the Internet. This approach offers flexibility and accessibility, making it attractive to many students. Many institutes also offer virtual professional courses for business and working professionals. However, ensuring the reachability of courses and evaluating students’ attentiveness presents significant challenges for educators teaching virtually. Various research works have been proposed to evaluate students’ attentiveness using facial landmarks, facial expressions, eye movements, gestures, postures, etc. However, no method has been proposed for real-time analysis and evaluation. This paper introduces a multi-modal student attentiveness detection (MMSAD) model designed to analyze and evaluate real-time class videos using two modalities: facial expressions and landmarks. Using a lightweight deep learning model, the model analyzes students’ emotions from facial expressions and identifies when a person is speaking during an online class by examining lip movements from facial landmarks. The model evaluates students’ emotions using five benchmark datasets, achieving accuracy rates of 99.05% on extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+), 87.5% on RAF-DB, 78.12% on Facial Emotion Recognition-2013 (FER-2013), 98.50% on JAFFE, and 88.01% on KDEF. The model identifies individuals speaking during the class using real-time class videos. The results from these modalities are used to predict attentiveness, categorizing students as either attentive or inattentive.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing application of construction robots on construction sites, autonomous path planning in unstructured and uneven construction sites has become an urgent challenge. Current path planning approaches face several issues, including prolonged computation times, low efficiency, and redundant nodes, often resulting in impractical paths for robots. Addressing these concerns, this study introduces a global path planning method based on an enhanced A* algorithm to ensure safe and robust navigation of construction robots in such challenging environments. The Improved A* algorithm initially incorporates a bidirectional alternating search strategy to expedite computational speed. Subsequently, it employs path node filtering to mitigate issues associated with bidirectional search and reduce the number of critical nodes, thereby enhancing search efficiency. Furthermore, the introduction of slope constraints decreases the robot's climbing and tilting angles, augmenting the safety of the planned paths. Finally, the paths are smoothed using Bézier curve fitting, facilitating better motion control for the robots. The efficacy of the improved algorithm was validated through experiments on elevation maps with varying terrain and obstacle densities. Simulation results indicate that, compared to the traditional A* algorithm, the Improved A* algorithm reduced computation time by 71.05% to 82.90% and the number of critical nodes by 51.94% to 70.53%, while only increasing the path length by 14.6% to 37.84%. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in climbing and tilting angles, and the paths have become smoother. Therefore, this method not only improves efficiency while generating safe and reliable paths in unstructured and uneven construction sites, but also enables robots to adapt to complex environments, and promotes automation and intelligent construction processes.},

This study uses mobile phone data, point-of-interest data, and publicly available socioeconomic indicators to present an integrated analysis of individual socioeconomic and behavioral profiles in Lisbon. To effectively segment users and identify mobility patterns, we employ multiple clustering techniques tailored to different data types: varied density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (VDBSCAN) detects meaningful places by identifying clusters of varying densities in mobile phone data, while K-Means and K-Modes cluster numerical and categorical data, respectively, to determine socioeconomic status (SES) and categorize work environments. Our analysis identifies four primary groups of individuals, each distinguished by different SES and behavioral tendencies, ranging from practical and family-oriented to lifestyle-driven patterns. The results show that SES strongly influences mobility behaviors and interactions with urban spaces, revealing disparities in housing access, services, and work environments between different population segments. These findings highlight the interaction between mobility, social habits, and economic conditions, offering key insights for urban planning and strategies to mitigate the impacts of gentrification. The proposed methodology can be applied to other cities to support inclusive policymaking, transportation planning, and spatial equity strategies, fostering more accessible and equitable urban environments.},

By using the projection technique, more discriminant information can be retained and better classification performance can be obtained, which can effectively deal with linearly inseparable problems. Furthermore, it only needs to solve a pair of systems of linear equations, which not only improves the computational efficiency but also ensures the generalization ability of the model. Hence WLPTELM can handle large-scale binary classification problems simply and efficiently.

Panel data fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is utilized in the study to identify how these components combine and contribute to economic resilience. The findings reveal three primary configurations, classified as either platform-dominated or network-dominated. The platform-dominated configuration is favored in the eastern economic zone, while the network-dominated configuration is more prevalent in the central economic zone. Additionally, since the COVID-19 pandemic, innovation platforms and networks have become increasingly important in stimulating economic resilience. This study makes several contributions to the literature: (1) responding to the need for further exploration of economic resilience, especially in the post-epidemic era; (2) improving the theoretical comprehension of how innovation ecosystem components combine and interact to better illustrate economic resilience; (3) offering several innovation combinations that can enhance economic resilience through the application of panel data fsQCA methodology.},

  abstract     = {Multi energy systems can flexibly adjust different energy supply ratios to meet real-time energy demand changes, optimize the demand side response of multi energy systems, and improve energy utilization efficiency. Therefore, a power demand side active response efficiency optimization method based on discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed. This method deeply analyzes the inherent characteristics of residential demand response and industrial demand response, and designs targeted optimization strategies in combination with the active response structure on the power demand side. Its core goal is to minimize the total cost of electricity demand side response and maximize its demand response capability, thereby achieving a dual improvement in economy and efficiency. In order to ensure the effectiveness and feasibility of the optimization process, a series of constraints have been set to ensure the applicability of the solution in practical operation. In the solving process, an improved discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm was adopted, which not only inherits the global search ability of traditional particle swarm optimization algorithms, but also makes it more suitable for solving power demand side response problems through discretization processing. The innovation of this method is mainly reflected in the following aspects: firstly, a targeted objective function is designed based on the actual characteristics of the power demand side; Secondly, an improved discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm was introduced to improve the efficiency and accuracy of optimization solutions; Finally, by comprehensively considering the total cost and maximum demand response capability, the comprehensive optimization of power demand side response efficiency was achieved. The experimental results show that after optimization, the demand side can actively and timely participate in the peak shaving of the distribution network, achieving load reduction; Improved the electrical, thermal, and gas responses of the power system; The loss results are all less than 0.41 MW; The annual response cost is less than 2.52 million yuan; The voltage deviation index of each node is less than 5.56%, which is at least 4% lower than other methods.},

  abstract     = {Sustainable agriculture revolves around soil organic carbon (SOC), which is essential for numerous soil functions and ecological attributes. Farmers are interested in conserving and adding additional soil organic carbon to certain fields in order to improve soil health and productivity. The relationship between soil and environment that has been discovered and standardized throughout time has enhanced the progress of digital soil-mapping techniques; therefore, a variety of machine learning techniques are used to predict soil properties. Studies are thriving at how effectively each machine learning method maps and predicts SOC, especially at high spatial resolutions. To predict SOC of soil at a 30 m resolution, four machine learning models—Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Adaptive Boosting, and k-Nearest Neighbour were used. For model evaluation, two error metrics, namely R 2 and RMSE have been used. The findings demonstrated that the calibration and validation sets’ descriptive statistics sufficiently resembled the entire set of data. The range of the calculated SOC content was 0.06 to 1.76%. According to the findings of the study, Random Forest showed good results for both cases, i.e., evaluation using cross validation and without cross validation. Using cross validation, RF confirmed highest R 2 as 0.5278 and lowest RMSE as 0.1683 for calibration dataset while without cross validation it showed R 2 as 0.8612 and lowest RMSE as 0.0912 for calibration dataset. The generated soil maps will help farmers adopt precise knowledge for decisions that will increase farm productivity and provide food security through the sustainable use of nutrients and the agricultural environment.},

Several Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) procedures have been adopted by decision makers over the past years to identify the best cloud services, however these approaches suffer from rank reversal and inconsistent results. For addressing these challenges, we introduced a framework integrating the Full Consistency Method (FUCOM) and Method based on the removal effects of criteria (MEREC) for weight estimation and TOmada de Decisao Interativa Multicriterio (TODIM) for ranking the alternatives in a pentagonal neutrosophic environment to determine the optimal cloud service. Comparative study and sensitivity analysis are done to check the efficacy and robustness of our model.

  abstract     = {Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has become more crucial in intelligent human-computer contact systems in recent years. The complexity and confusion of target emotions lead to low accuracy of FER. This study proposes an attentional residual network based spatial transformer mechanism for FER to establish an effective emotion recognition model. First, the learnable module Spatial Transformer Network (STN) was introduced to actively transform the feature map in order to learn the feature map's more general distortion invariance. Second, the parameters and structure of ResNet18 were adjusted, and it was connected to the STN in an end-to-end manner. Finally, by introducing the Squeeze and Excitation (SE) block, which replaces the ReLu function with the Mish function, we improved the stability and precision of the channel weight adjustment. The verification was carried out on three public datasets FER2013, CK+, and JAFFE. Among them, the FER2013 dataset is separated into three sections, training set, public validation set, and private validation set. The ten-fold cross-validation approach was used for the sparse CK + and JAFFE datasets. On the FER2013, CK+, and JAFFE datasets, accuracy rates of 73.25%, 99.18%, and 97.10% were attained, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Named entity recognition is a highly relevant research topic in the field of natural language processing owing to its widespread application, which mainly involves three types of nested entities, discontinuous entities and flat named entities. Notably, nested named entities are characterized by one entity containing multiple sub-entities, ambiguous boundary definitions, and flexible structural formats. These features give rise to challenges such as semantic ambiguity, slow decoding efficiency, error propagation, and information loss. Therefore, to effectively address these issues and enhance classification performance, it is critical to integrate information sources such as internal markers, neighbouring word pairs, first and last word pairs, labels, and related spans. This is achieved in the present study via a newly proposed nested named entity recognition model based on triple cross affine attention. The proposed model encodes the input text using the BERT model and Bi-LSTM before extracting relevant features from the input text by applying DCNN. The extracted feature sequences are used as input into the triple cross affine attention module which computes the scores, allowing the model to classify and predict the outputs using the MLP layer. The experimental results demonstrate that the precision, recall, and F1 value metrics of the proposed method outperform other existing benchmark algorithmic models when applied to the ACE2004, ACE2005, and GENIA standard datasets. Additionally, it exhibits superior recognition performance in nested named entity recognition.},

  abstract     = {Traditional vision SLAM, which assumes a static environment, is unable to handle dynamic objects in dynamic environments. The presence of dynamic feature points decreases the localization accuracy and robustness of SLAM. In light of this, we propose YER-SLAM, a dynamic SLAM system employing object detection and region-growing algorithm, which fully utilizes the semantic and geometric information contained in images to identify and eliminate dynamic features in the environment. Firstly, we use YOLOv5 object detection to classify the image into static, dynamic, and potentially dynamic regions to generate a semantic mask that incorporates a priori knowledge. Secondly, we utilize a dynamic object detection algorithm that tightly couples object detection with epipolar constraints to initially identify dynamic features in the scene. Subsequently, we propose a novel strategy for the elimination of dynamic feature points, which integrates the acquired dynamic point with a region-growing algorithm to generate a mask for the dynamic region, thereby enabling the exclusion of the region’s feature points in the tracking process. Finally, the experimental results from the TUM dataset reveal that our algorithm achieves a 94.71% reduction in the average absolute trajectory error in highly dynamic environments, compared to ORBSLAM2. YER-SLAM presented in this paper effectively improves localization accuracy in dynamic environments.},

There are ways to identify its presence before it seriously harms the body because it affects all bodily parts and organs. Diabetes also affects the retina of the eyes, rupturing blood vessels there and ultimately leading to irreversible blindness due to complications. This study suggests an enhanced activation function for diagnosing DR using fundus images automatically lowers processing time and loss. In this work, the proposed system design is constructed using a stacking-based Explainable AI model. The increased activation process within the various CNN models was trained and tested using the “Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society 2019 Blindness Detection” (APTOS 2019) dataset. The pre-processing phase following data collection revealed data segmentation and augmentation. The deep learning prediction approach is used in the recommended work. Robust stacked model is generated by applying CNN, VGG, and custom-versed model methods. The classification of DR and the operation of explainable AI algorithms are explained in this recommended section. The LIME and SHAP approaches shape the stages of doctoral education. Based on the profile-rated, moderate, and severe phases of DR, the suggested figure illustrates the procedures. The accuracy of the current model was 76.78%. The study contributes by proposing a novel hybrid-stacked model architecture tailored for diabetic retinopathy detection. The future scope for this study could be the integration of additional explain ability techniques such as attention mechanisms or saliency maps to provide more detailed insights into the model's decision-making process.},

  abstract     = {Stock market plays a vital role in country's economy. The estimation of stock market trends and price is important for the investors. Stock forecasting has piqued the interest of investors worldwide. Investors are looking for a forecasting model that is accurate and reliable enough to account for volatile and nonlinear market behavior. The problem of stock price prediction becomes a complicated one due to multiple inputs like technical indicators, financial factors, trends of international markets, and social media data. This research seeks to collect and correlate multiple inputs to analyse their impact on the stock market and improve stock price prediction accuracy. Researchers are attempting to refine effective indicators to aid in stock market forecasting by taking the advantage of ever-growing world wide web. Effective indicators like stock-related events and public sentiment towards the stock plays a significant role in stock volatility, hence can be used in improving prediction accuracy. The paper provides an efficient framework for optimizing the error in short-term stock market prediction with diverse data sources, based on a novel Mayfly Adam Optimization Algorithm (MAOA) and Deep Residual Network (DRN). This novel approach uses Deep Q Network (DQN) with dice coefficient similarity for feature fusion and DRN for prediction. We have considered historical stock market prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL), commodity time-series dataset, news articles and reviews on social media to evaluate the model's effectiveness. The proposed technique accuracy is found to be 96%, with average accuracy of 98.27%. The existing techniques like, Deep Neural Network (DNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Random Forest (RF) models provided accuracy of 82.4%, 85.5%, 88.8%, and 92.39%, respectively. This shows that the proposed model is 13.6% better than DNN, 10.5% better than ANN, 7% better than LSTM and 3.61% better than RF in terms of accuracy.},

Due to its decentralized and unchangeable nature, blockchain technology has shown potential in this sector. However, the efficiency and scalability of conventional Blockchain systems are constrained. It is suggested an Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) storage and retrieval system on the Blockchain using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for file encryption, Access Control Lists (ACLs) for data access management, a Name Server for decentralized naming, Layered Radix Tree with Adaptive Hashing (LRT-AH) for indexing and Proof of Fair Chance (PoFC) consensus mechanism to overcome these restrictions. Before storing the data on the IPFS network, the system encrypts it using ECC-AES and uses ACLs to restrict access to only approved users. The Name Server offers a practical method of accessing the saved information without jeopardizing user privacy. PoFC is a fair and effective consensus process since the PoFC algorithm, a revolutionary approach, guarantees that each user has an equal probability of being chosen as the next block minor. LRT-AH provides a scalable and adaptive indexing structure, optimizing data storage and retrieval operations in blockchain environments. The proposed system has demonstrated 50% improvement in efficiency for both insertion and retrieval times over traditional blockchain systems and those utilizing only IPFS. The system performance is analyzed along with scalability and efficiency, proving that it is appropriate for applications requiring massive amounts of data storage and retrieval.},

Unlike most previous works on information diffusion, the structural dynamics of the networks takes center-stage in this work. The proposed work identifies fundamental network structural properties that affect diffusion and generates a corpus of synthetic networks similar to a standard dynamic social network interactions dataset, using a random-rewiring strategy. The work uses machine learning models built for multi-target regression to model and predict the diffusion process on a network, given the structural evolution of a network. This modeling is done based on the data captured at three granularity levels: snapshot-wise, based on an evolution window of 100 snapshots, and an end-to-end evolution. The generated synthetic network corpus is validated using a graph kernel based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test for similarity with respect to the selected baseline dataset, and the multi-target regression models’ performance is analyzed based on standard metrics. The proposed model successfully learns from information flow patterns to reveal the complex relationships between network structure evolution and information propagation. The findings highlight the complex relationship between network structure and information movement in dynamic social networks. The multi-target regression models demonstrate robust predictive power, as indicated by the R 2 scores, which quantify the accuracy of the model’s ability to capture the underlying patterns of information diffusion in dynamic social networks.},

  abstract     = {Online marketplaces such as Amazon and Tmall have been expanding services to boost the growth of their ecosystems. One is information service on sharing privately gathered massive consumer data that is unavailable to their sellers, and the other is financing service, e.g., Amazon Lending and Ant Financial, aiming to provide accessible and affordable financial support for small and medium-sized sellers. This paper develops a game-theoretical model to examine the interplay between information sharing and financing services on a retail platform, particularly when sellers are financially constrained. The results show that while the information-sharing service always makes the platform less likely to provide an attractive financing service, the financing service also makes the information-sharing service less likely to be provided under certain conditions. These conditions depend on the structure of capital market and the seller’s initial working capital. We find that such misalignment between these two services can be resolved by charging a fixed payment for the information service, leading to improved operational efficiency and social welfare. We finally extend our analytical results and managerial insights to general settings, demonstrating the robustness of our findings. Our findings could provide useful guidance for platform practitioners in designing integrated information-sharing and financing services.},

  abstract     = {Platform firms are increasingly investing in value-added services (VAS), believing these investments in VAS universally contribute to their success. Although many studies have examined platform firms’ core services (e.g., intermediation), systematic analyses of VAS provision strategies remain limited. In this article, we develop a game-theoretic model to analyze (1) the conditions under which platform firms benefit from providing VAS and (2) to which side(s) platform firms should provide VAS. We offer several insights. First, variable service costs are a critical yet previously neglected factor in governing platform firms’ VAS provision. Second, a comparison of equilibrium outcomes across three VAS provision strategies—one-sided unidirectional, two separate unidirectional, and bidirectional—reveals that the optimal strategy is jointly determined by variable service costs, cross-network externalities, and the asymmetry in the benefits of bidirectional VAS to the two platform sides. Specifically, when asymmetry is low, bidirectional VAS is optimal. When asymmetry is high, platform firms should provide unidirectional VAS to one side, considering the second side only when variable service costs are low or cross-network externalities are significant. Third, we explore the implications of VAS provision strategies for platform firms’ investment and pricing decisions. For example, when platform firms provide two separate unidirectional VAS, these investments are complementary. VAS could incentivize platform firms to offer price subsidies to one side of the platform. Finally, optimal VAS provision strategies do not always increase consumer surplus.},

However, most user-generated content, such as text and images, is unstructured, making it difficult to analyze how individuals impact the creation of such data as existing models primarily focus on the numerical aspects of behavioral data. In this article, we propose a method to identify influential users who significantly affect others’ interest in content topics, with a specific focus on text and images. Our study introduces a new variant of the topic model, incorporating a hierarchical structure and a vector auto-regressive approach. This method accounts for both the evolution of topic distribution and the social influence among users on their interest in content topics. The empirical application of our model to image-sharing social media data demonstrates that our model outperforms conventional topic models in terms of predictive accuracy and topic interpretability. Moreover, we illustrate how visualizing the estimated social influence within the network can provide valuable insights for seeded marketing campaigns and data-driven product development by identifying influential users in various content areas. This approach also offers a deeper understanding of evolving trends in content, preferences, and demand.},

  abstract     = {Challenges faced by call centers in managing capacity, efficiency, service speed and quality, training, emotional labor, and turnover are intrinsically intertwined. Call center agents are considered frontline workers, and as such, they often deal with hostile behavior from rude customers. However, they are expected to suppress their feelings and maintain a courteous demeanor despite rude customer behavior, which results in emotional dissonance. Such working environments, where the frontline workers experience emotional dissonance, are termed emotional labor environments. Emotional dissonance, if sustained over a long period of time, can lead to an erosion of organizational identification (OID) among agents, unless they perceive adequate protection and support from the management. A low OID can lead to high employee turnover, which in turn results in high recruitment and training costs as well as loss of experience and compromised service quality. In this study, we examine how employee protection policies and leadership style manifest in mitigating the erosion of OID. We develop a research framework to understand the mediating role of agents’ perception of the efficacy of the firm's policies to protect them from rude customers and the relevant aspects of the servant leadership style of supervisors in mitigating the erosion of agents’ OID caused by the cumulative emotional dissonance over their tenure duration. For this study, we partner with a major multinational firm in Korea in the insurance industry. We find that the perceived organizational support for protection from rude customers and supervisors’ servant leadership style are positively related to agents’ OID. The agent's OID decreases with their tenure duration, unless mediated by the agent's perception of the efficacy of protection from rude customers. We provide insights for the retention of agents with implications for capacity and service quality for the call centers. These insights may be extended to frontline workers in other emotional labor environments.},

  abstract     = {We explore retail supply chains in emerging markets in which a manufacturer can reach consumers by selling its product through very small independent stores (nanostores) and/or through a supermarket. Nanostores offer consumers the advantage of proximity, but supermarkets offer the advantage of bulk buying. We explore the competition between the supermarket and nanostores and examine the manufacturer’s role in shaping the retail market structure for its product through wholesale price contracts. We model and analyze a multi-party supply-chain game in which a manufacturer can sell its product to spatially distributed, utility-maximizing, price-sensitive consumers through nanostores and a supermarket. Consumers can buy in bulk at the supermarket, optimizing their purchase quantity, and hence visit frequency, in an economic order quantity type approach, or they can purchase from a nanostore (frequently due to store storage-space limitations). We fully solve for the equilibrium market structure and the associated retail and wholesale prices, establishing that the manufacturer’s desired channel strategy is governed by three factors: the manufacturer-nanostore supply chain cost, the manufacturer-supermarket supply chain cost, and the supermarket bargaining power. If the supply chain efficiencies are somewhat similar, then the manufacturer should (typically, but not always) use both retail formats to avail of the nanostore advantage in serving proximate consumers and the supermarket advantage in serving distant customers. The specifics of how the manufacturer should use the retail formats will depend on the supermarket power. Among other results, we establish that aggregate nanostore demand and profit can decrease in nanostore density and that the presence of a high-power supermarket can increase consumer surplus because the manufacturer induces strong price competition.},

We appeal to a real options framework to predict that firms delay layoff decisions and the issuance of WARN notices until the resolution of political uncertainty. Using establishment-level data on layoffs disclosed in WARN notices and state elections occurring between 1994 and 2022, we document that the likelihood of issuing WARN notices declines during the election quarter but increases in the subsequent quarter. Cross-sectional findings show that political uncertainty plays a significant role in the timing of WARN notices during election periods while other factors, including partisanship, economic conditions, union strength, and firm visibility, may also play a role. Further, firms that delay WARN notices do not experience a significant deterioration in their medium-term financial performance. Overall, our findings provide evidence that firms delay labor adjustment decisions and the announcements of such decisions in response to political uncertainty.},

We consider a dynamic setting with uncertain patient arrival and use of the emergency department. This problem is formulated as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process model. Since we cannot solve large-sized instances via conventional approaches, we hybridize this model with a neural network to simplify feasibility constraints while respecting all assumptions. Given the curse of dimensionality, we use an affine approximation architecture to estimate the value function. An equivalent linear programing model is solved through column generation in order to compute approximate optimal policies and derive two easy-to-implement scheduling policies. Simulation results demonstrate that the approximate optimal policy and heuristics outperform alternative scheduling policies. Finally, we demonstrate that the application of our methodology can enhance performance metrics in a large ambulatory care center in Canada. We show that a template-based scheduling rule can result in high resource utilization but poor scheduling decisions. However, an efficient scheduling policy equips a booking clerk with intelligent scheduling rules that are difficult for her to predict in real-time and work well in comparison to scheduling templates.},

  abstract     = {Social advertising platforms and search engines employ the so-called quality score to favor certain advertisers in ad auctions. These scores typically consider several factors including ad relevance, click-through rate (CTR), and landing page quality. While quality scores are often justified as a mechanism to enhance ad rank and reduce cost per click for high-quality ads, this study examines their broader role in incentivizing advertisers with varying investment costs to improve landing page quality and explores the implications for advertisers’ profits and the platform’s revenue in a setting where landing page quality is an endogenous decision made by advertisers. The results suggest that a quality score function in excess of the CTR incentivizes advertisers to invest in page quality in a non-monotonic way. These incentives have dual effects on auction dynamics: While advertisers can lower their cost per click by improving quality, such incentives also increase advertisers’ competitive pressure to maintain their quality advantage and secure the discount per click, particularly for those in higher positions. Our findings reveal that the former effect dominates, leading to increased advertiser profits with higher rewards. However, the intensified competition slows the profit growth for the top-position advertiser when the bottom-position advertiser invests. For platform revenue, which comprises both auction revenue and benefits derived from user experience, a quality score in excess of CTR is recommended when the user experience benefits are substantial enough to compensate for auction revenue losses. In a scenario where page quality is capped, our results show that a quality score in excess of CTR can generate higher platform revenue, even in the absence of user experience benefits.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a decision support system used by an agricultural cooperative in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to optimize the purchase, blending, sale, and storage of groundnuts for maximum profit. The cooperative buys raw groundnuts (input commodity) from member farmers and processes them into multiple grades of groundnut seeds (output commodity). These may then be blended to create intermediate grades to exploit arbitrage opportunities. The cooperative sells part of the output on the spot market while storing the rest for future periods. A key challenge is the random supply of input commodity—driven by the cooperative’s obligation to accept all member produce—and the option to blend the output. Unlike prior work, this study examines blending across a multiperiod planning horizon, a novel aspect in operations management literature. The problem is modeled as a dynamic program over a harvest season. We analyze the structure of the optimal value function and decisions and find that the function is not separable in input and output inventories, which complicates the identification of optimal solution. However, in special cases such as when blending is disallowed, the function simplifies. An efficient computational procedure is developed for the general case. Using real cooperative data, we demonstrate that multiperiod blending significantly boosts profits—by 100–900%, or Indian National Rupees 1.94–17.46 million annually—highlighting the value of this approach.},

  abstract     = {The financial industry is plagued with account-based fraudulent transactions in which perpetrators surreptitiously siphon away money from customer accounts. To address this recurrent problem, service operations teams at financial institutions (e.g., the fraud detection and mitigation teams) spend millions yearly identifying perpetrators, attributing blame, and averting customer churn. However, in the vast majority of cases, the service operations teams cannot trace fraudulent transactions back to the perpetrators, and hence, it remains unclear whether they should continue to expend significant resources into investigating account-based fraud and attributing blame. Employing a wide range of econometric and machine learning techniques on a rich dataset from a US bank and an experiment, we attempt to offer the first empirical assessment of the association between blame attribution, or lack of it, in response to customer-identified account-based fraud and customer churn. The results indicate that relative to the customers that did not experience fraud, those that did and received a resolution lacking blame attribution have 40.69 %Lift (95% confidence interval (CI) = [24.41 %Lift , 56.97 %Lift ]) in churn rate. However, customers that experienced fraud and received a resolution involving blame attribution have −62.45 %Lift (95% CI = [−31.22 %Lift , −93.68 %Lift ]) in churn rate, making them less likely to churn than those that did not experience fraud. The latter result offers one of the first field evidence of the well-known service recovery paradox. Additionally, we observe significant heterogeneity in the findings based on customer tenure and the number of customer-firm interactions and document the long-term effects of attributing and not attributing blame. These insights can assist service operations teams in their postservice failure efforts to mend customer-firm relationships. Overall, the results underscore the importance of blame attribution during service recovery for service operations teams and inform a topical debate on a banking reform proposed by the US Department of Treasury.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we explore the impact of implementing an algorithmic supervisor, a data analytics tool that offers real-time feedback to employees, on their overall performance. We collaborate with a leading service company that initiated the transition from human supervisors to an algorithmic supervisor for managing call agents in their outbound call center on September 18, 2019. We collect data for 220,085 calls over a span of 6 months—that is, 3 months before and 3 months after the introduction of the algorithmic supervisor. We find that the introduction of the algorithmic supervisor improved the agents’ service quality in terms of customer satisfaction; however, this came at the expense of quantity as fewer customers were served. In particular, the adoption of the algorithmic supervisor resulted in a 15.80% reduction in the number of served customers, accompanied by a 14.91% increase in the number of satisfied customers. Moreover, our study uncovers a gender-related dimension to the impact of the algorithmic supervisor. Before its adoption, male agents outperformed their female counterparts. However, after its adoption, female agents exhibited an 11.52% increase in the number of served customers, and a remarkable 14.00% increase in the number of satisfied customers as compared to their male counterparts. Our results suggest that the adoption of the algorithmic supervisor strikes a new economic balance between service quality and service quantity and generates a social impact in differently affecting service performance of female and male employees.},

Using a sample of 9,745 Chinese firm-year observations spanning 2018–2021, we find that the likelihood of suppliers’ blockchain technology adoption in supply chain management is negatively associated with major customer concentration. The negative relation is reduced when supplier firms possess greater bargaining power and demonstrate governance mechanisms against information leakage, and when major customers have less incentive to engage in opportunistic behaviors, and have fewer concerns regarding information leakage by suppliers. Our findings suggest that major customers tend to discourage supplier firms from adopting blockchain due to the concerns regarding competitive advantages and information leakage risk.},

  abstract     = {Purchasing new experience products or services often involves significant quality uncertainty for both consumers and firms. Social learning through online reviews helps reduce this uncertainty but exacerbates strategic waiting, as consumers delay purchases to gain more information. This paper examines the impact of social learning on firms’ pricing policies in the presence of strategic consumers under two widely adopted schemes: Contingent pricing and price guarantee. We find that while social learning always benefits the firm, it enables the price guarantee scheme to outperform contingent pricing in terms of profitability for highly patient consumers, which would not be possible without social learning. Notably, social learning drives a range of pricing patterns, even making price skimming optimal under price guarantee for highly patient consumers, as high initial prices combined with markdowns effectively alleviate strategic waiting, enhancing review outcomes and the firm’s profitability. Additionally, social learning always enables the firm to extract greater consumer surplus for impatient consumers under price guarantee. In contrast, social learning under contingent pricing consistently benefits consumers and can achieve win-win outcomes when consumers are moderately patient. Our extensions validate the robustness of these findings under different assumptions, including fully rational consumers and partially forward-looking firms. In particular, a partially forward-looking firm can achieve win-win outcomes with social learning under price guarantee, expanding its practical applicability. This study provides novel insights into the role of social learning in shaping pricing strategies, highlighting its implications for firm profitability and consumer welfare in markets influenced by review dynamics and strategic consumers.},

  abstract     = {This article examines how the composition of managerial teams influences the information and competitive landscapes in which firms operate. Specifically, the impact of teams depends on the task environment under which they operate and the extent of competition the firm faces in the product markets. Under a substitute task environment, team heterogeneity better facilitates firm learning, whereas, under a complementary task environment, team homogeneity enhances learning. However, more learning is not always optimal, as this accentuates adverse selection concerns, which leads the firm's rival to counter by becoming more aggressive in competition. This, in turn, forces the firm to cede some of its information advantage through disclosures. In effect, when designing teams to manage information, the firm must balance its learning needs with its rival's competitive threats. Consequently, in a substitute task environment, team heterogeneity is only optimal for the firm when competition is not fierce, and homogeneity is desirable otherwise. In a complementary task environment, the preference for teams as a function of competition is reversed. Additionally, any inherent heterogeneity in the level of competition in the product markets in which the firm operates diminishes the demand for team heterogeneity. The article also derives the firm's optimal team composition when the markets are characterized by Bertrand or Cournot competition, when the available managerial pool for the firm is constrained or unconstrained, when tasks are market-specific or firm-specific, and when the task environment is generalized.},

  abstract     = {To mitigate information asymmetry, Expert Review Programs, in which experts evaluate products on multiple dimensions, have gained traction on platforms. However, the role of multidimensional expert reviews and how they affect consumer behaviors remain unknown. Using an empirical opportunity on an automobile review platform, we investigate how multidimensional expert reviews affect subsequent consumer ratings and the underlying mechanism. Our findings first reveal that expert reviews tend to be neutral and more critical than consumer ratings. We then find that consumers provide reviews with higher ratings following expert reviews due to the information disclosure effect. Decomposing the effect by expert reviews’ multidimensional characteristics, we find the effect is attenuated by multidimensional expert rating valence and multidimensional rating discrepancy between experts and consumers but amplified by multidimensional expert rating variance. Natural language processing of consumer review texts unveils a positive impact of multidimensional expert reviews on consumer satisfaction and a negative impact on consumer disappointment, which speaks to the underlying mechanism behind the information disclosure effect. Lastly, we find that the effect varies with expert characteristics, product characteristics, and information channels, diminishes when multidimensional expert reviews are posted sooner after product launch, and decays over time but persists in the long run. These findings not only advance information theories in understanding expert reviews and multidimensional rating systems but also provide valuable insights for stakeholders, such as platforms, firms, and expert reviewers, to improve review program operations and consumer engagement.},

We analyze more than 55,000 papers published by more than 54,000 unique authors during this period to document four sets of findings. First, our analysis suggests that Operations Management and Multidisciplinary areas experienced significant publication growth from 2008 to 2022, increasing their publication and citation share in FT 50 journals, even after accounting for the relative handicap in terms of number of journals in the FT 50 list. Second, the growth in publications of the Operations Management discipline is driven by significant growth in Production and Operations Management and Manufacturing and Service Operations Management . The Journal of Business Ethics is a notable outlier, it alone published nearly 10% of the papers published in the FT 50 list, more than the number of papers published by the five disciplines each: Accounting, Marketing, Multidisciplinary, Operations Management, and Information Systems. Third, we find that the most prolific authors in Management and Organizations, Operations Management, Economics, and Marketing had a higher number of publications during the 2008–2022 period than the most prolific authors of other disciplines. Finally, our analyses of the most prolific 150 worldwide universities published in the FT 50 list suggest that the list is dominated mostly by about a dozen countries that include North American countries (the USA and Canada), European countries (Netherlands, Germany, the UK, France, and Spain), China (including Hong Kong), Australia, and Singapore.

  abstract     = {Relation prediction in knowledge graphs (KGs) aims to anticipate the connections between entities. While both transductive and inductive models are incorporated for context comprehension, we need to focus on two primary issues. First, these models only collate relations at each layer of the subgraph, overlooking the potential sequential relationship between different layers. Second, these methods overlook the homogeneity of subgraphs, thus impeding their ability to effectively learn the importance of relationships within the subgraphs. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and homogenous subgraph learning model for KG relation prediction (HiHo). Specifically, we adopt a subgraph-to-sequence mechanism to learn the potential semantic associations between layers in the subgraph of a single entity, and thus model the hierarchy of the subgraph. Then, we implement a common preference inference mechanism that assigns higher weights to co-occurrence relations while learning the importance of each relation in the subgraphs of two entities, and thus models the homogeneity of the subgraph. In our study, we sequentially employ induction on each layer of subgraphs pertaining to the two entities for relation prediction. To assess the efficacy of our method, we perform experiments on five publicly available datasets. The results of our experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art baselines in both transductive and inductive settings.},

While event extraction is a well-studied problem in natural language processing (NLP), there remains a gap in semantic event extraction methods that leverage event ontologies for capturing multifaceted events in knowledge graphs. In this article, we aim to compare two paradigms to address this task of semantic event extraction: the fine-tuning of traditional transformer-based models versus the use of large language models (LLMs). We exemplify these paradigms with two newly developed approaches: T-SEE for transformer-based and L-SEE for LLM-based semantic event extraction. We discuss their complementary strengths and shortcomings to understand the needs and solutions required for semantic event extraction. For comparison, both approaches employ the same dual-stage architecture; the first stages focus on multilabel event classification, and the second on relation extraction. While T-SEE utilises a span prediction transformer model, L-SEE prompts an LLM for event classification and relation extraction, providing the potential event classes and properties. We assess the performances of T-SEE and L-SEE on two novel datasets sourced from DBpedia and Wikidata, and we perform an extensive error analysis. Our work makes substantial contributions to (i) the integration of Semantic Web technologies and NLP, particularly in the underexplored domain of semantic event extraction, and (ii) the understanding of how LLMs can further enhance semantic event extraction and what challenges need to be considered in comparison to traditional approaches.},

  abstract     = {Established in 2012 by members of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the Global Soil Partnership (GSP) is a global network of stakeholders promoting sound land and soil management practices towards a sustainable world food system. However, soil survey largely remains a local or regional activity, bound to heterogeneous methods and conventions. Recognising the relevance of global and trans-national policies towards sustainable land management practices, the GSP elected data harmonisation and exchange as one of its key lines of action. Building upon international standards and previous work towards a global soil data ontology, an improved domain model was eventually developed within the GSP, the basis for a Global Soil Information System (GloSIS). This work also identified the Semantic Web as a possible avenue to operationalise the domain model. This article presents the GloSIS web ontology, an implementation of the GloSIS domain model with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Thoroughly employing a host of Semantic Web standards (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator ontology (SOSA), Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS), GeoSPARQL, QUDT), GloSIS lays out not only a soil data ontology but also an extensive set of ready-to-use code-lists for soil description and physico-chemical analysis. Various examples are provided on the provision and use of GloSIS-compliant linked data, showcasing the contribution of this ontology to the discovery, exploration, integration and access of soil data.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in declarative knowledge graph generation have introduced multiple mapping languages and engines, causing a shift in studies towards optimizing the knowledge graph generation process. Although these engines commonly generate the knowledge graphs from heterogeneous data sources, sharing the optimization techniques and features remains challenging due to the lack of formal operational semantics. To address this, we propose a set of algebraic mapping operators that define operational semantics for general mapping processes. This algebra, based on the SPARQL algebra, enables reuse of established definitions and strengthens the link between knowledge graph generation and query engines. To evaluate language independence we translated mapping languages ShExML and the RDF Mapping Language (RML) into our algebraic mapping plan. Our completeness evaluation shows that our algebraic operators cover the operational semantics of RML and partially support ShExML. Additional analysis is required to cover additional features of ShExML such as joining data from two input sources. For performance evaluation, our proof-of-concept algebraic mapping engine exhibits consistent and low memory usage across workloads, getting second place in the Knowledge Graph Construction Workshop's performance challenge. Algebraic mapping operators decouple mapping engines from specific languages, enabling multilingual mapping engines and allowing optimization techniques to be applied independently of the mapping process. This work lays the foundation for theoretical analysis of complexity and expressiveness of mapping languages and enforces consistency in execution semantics of mapping engines. Furthermore, aligning our algebra with SPARQL opens the door to advanced methods such as virtualization for querying heterogeneous data sources.},

  abstract     = {The increasing digitisation that we have witnessed in the past few years has resulted in increased information and communications technology (ICT) hardware manufacturing, which is not sustainable due to the growing demand for critical materials and the greenhouse emissions associated with it. A solution is transitioning to a circular economy (CE). To facilitate this, boost the data economy and digital innovation, the European Union has introduced digital product passports (DPPs), which should provide information about a product’s lifetime to bring more transparency into supply chains. However, several challenges, namely the lack of findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable ICT and materials data and tools to support its interpretation for decision-making, are present. Utilising ontologies and knowledge graphs is a possible solution. Although the ontology work in the ICT and materials domains has been on the rise, there is a lack of a unified semantic model that can capture the complex, heterogeneous cross-domain data needed for building DPPs of ICT devices such as laptops and data servers. Motivated by this, we present the RePlanIT ontology for ICT DPPs, which captures knowledge on several levels – ICT device, hardware components, materials and the CE itself. RePlanIT’s specification is based on a literature survey, interviews and inputs from domain experts from both industry and academia. The ontology, its utilisation for building a knowledge graph of DPPs of laptops and data servers and its application have been successfully validated in a real-world case focusing on supporting more sustainable ICT procurement in government.},
