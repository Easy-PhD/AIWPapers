  abstract     = {The proliferation of interval type-2 fuzzy sets in domains characterized by substantial uncertainty, particularly natural language processing and intelligent decision-making systems, has highlighted the critical need for efficient and accurate similarity assessment methodologies. However, evaluating similarity between interval type-2 fuzzy sets presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the computational inefficiencies associated with traditional similarity measurement techniques. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a computational approach aimed at enhancing the efficiency of similarity assessments between interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy sets. The core of proposed approach lies in leveraging the geometric properties of trapezoids to determine the closed polygon that results from the intersection of two non-normal type-1 trapezoidal fuzzy sets. The proposed method eliminates the need for complex sequential condition evaluations and intricate flowcharts traversal common in existing methods. A key contribution of this work is the novel handling of infeasible intersection points, ensuring computational efficiency without sacrificing precision. The implementation incorporates the Shoelace algorithm for polygon area computation, further enhancing computational efficiency. Numerical analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach provides a streamlined and computationally efficient solution for similarity assessment between interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy sets, optimizing both precision and algorithmic performance.},

  abstract     = {Food waste, characterized by its high perishability, odor emission, and environmental impact under high temperatures, necessitates storage at low or normal temperatures. Traditional cooling methods, such as air conditioning, consume substantial energy. To address this, we designed an evaporative cooling dustbin. Given the strong influence of external environmental factors on cooling efficiency, we collected experimental data and trained three neural network models to improve the accuracy of bin temperature prediction and regulation. We enhanced the conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm with neural networks, developing three distinct control strategies. Model performance was evaluated based on prediction accuracy and control efficacy. Results indicated that augmented with feature encoding, the long short-term memory (LSTM) model achieved the highest prediction accuracy with a mean error of ±0.3°C. The fan speed prediction model also demonstrated a strong correlation, with an R² value of 0.9804. Optimal fan speed control was achieved using a fuzzy PID model informed by the LSTM algorithm. Validation tests during operational hours showed temperature errors of 0.45°C and 0.54°C for two different periods. These results highlight the ability of the enhanced LSTM model to accurately predict bin temperature, while the optimized PID strategy effectively stabilizes temperature fluctuations. Additionally, two working modes—performance and economic—were established, both of which can maintain the average temperature of the garbage box at 25 ± 0.3°C. In the performance mode, the overshoot time of the system cooling is at least 46 s, and the response is rapid and has high stability. This work advances precise prediction and control methods for nonlinear temperature systems in energy-efficient cooling applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel Multi-Objective Optimization based Fuzzy Switching Median Filter (MOOFASMF) to remove high density Random Valued Impulse Noise (RVIN), “Salt & Pepper” Impulse Noise (SPIN) and Mixed Impulse Noise (MIN). In this work, multi-objective optimization technique is used to find out the fuzzy switching median filter threshold values for accurate detection of corrupted pixels. The proposed multi-objective framework uses Decomposition based Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA/D) to obtain optimized fuzzy switching median filter drives the threshold values with the objectives Mean Square Error (MSE) and inverse of Structural Similarity Index Metrics (SSIM) as optimization objectives. Even though the MSE and SSIM are not closely related parameters, the optimized threshold value gives better results in terms of both PSNR and SSIM. The advantages of the proposed framework are that it works effectively on RVIN, SPIN, and MIN-affected images. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is outstanding for high-density RVIN, SPIN, and MIN, which makes it more advantageous over other existing methods. Experimental results in terms of visual and quantitative metrics such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Square Error (MSE), Structural Similarity Index Metrics (SSIM), and Edge Preservation Index (EPI) clearly demonstrates the better performance of the proposed algorithm over the state of art techniques. The proposed framework performed 6.02% and 32.11% better than the best existing methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM for the mixture of 40% SPIN & 50% RVIN affected image.},

This paper explores the field of human-directed AI solutions with particular emphasis on newspaper summarization, a useful tool in today's busy world. Utilizing comprehensive models (LLMs), we explore extractive and abstractive summarization methods. To maximize the LLM performance, our strategy entails creating a customized news dataset enhanced with human-centric summaries and using cutting-edge data preparation techniques. To improve the accuracy assessment, we present a modified evaluation metric called Sem-rouge, which augments established units of measurement. In a comparative analysis, it was noticed that the proposed metric can highlight both syntactic and semantic similarities; hence, the metric is suitable for both extractive and abstractive summarization methods. We highlight the significance of dataset selection, data processing methods, and assessment criteria in fine-tuning auto-generated summaries using rigorous comparison analysis. Further studies will focus on improving semantic similarity techniques, integrating advanced models such as The BERT algorithm or Generative Pre-trained Transformer algorithm, and overcoming challenges such as overfitting. Finally, our study emphasizes the importance of meticulously training models and modifying them frequently to enhance automated summarization skills.},

  abstract     = {The use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) as a key technology for controlling and monitoring a range of applications has been accepted. Heterogeneous WSNs involve nodes with different functions, for instance, nodes with sensing, fusion, and routing duties. To maximize the performance of a heterogeneous WSN, an optimized tree construction and clustering-based data aggregation approach is proposed in this paper. The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is used to construct an optimized spanning tree with minimum energy consumption. Clusters are then formed in a distributed manner, and data aggregation is performed among the clusters. The suggested strategy is effective, as shown by the simulation results, and adding a reliable optimization method greatly lowers energy usage and enhances network performance. The research provides a clustering-based data aggregation strategy meant to maximize data delivery from heterogeneous WSNs with low-power nodes. The employed technique combines two clustering algorithms, k-means, and fuzzy c-means, to ensure fast and reliable data forwarding among WSNs. The proposed FFA obtained 95.86% energy efficiency, 87.21% QoS, 95.25% transmission rate, 90.13% PDR, 8.86% delay, 96.21% network lifetime, 91.22% throughput, 89.42% scalability and 96.58% Fault Tolerance. The proposed method can significantly reduce energy consumption and communication overhead, improving network efficiency and utilization.

  abstract     = {Developing an accurate model for severe nonlinear chemical processes presents a significant challenge, as it directly impacts profitability and optimal control strategies. The main aim of this work is to find an optimal model architecture capable of presenting all system modes and subsequently reducing control effort. Improving model accuracy while considering computational burden is identified as the most effective approach for achieving this goal. In this paper, the reactor is treated as a black-box model, and a new optimized model for bioreactors is proposed based on the combination of the Bee Colony Algorithm and Wavelet Neural Network (WNN). Input-output data for training and validation of the identified model are generated by applying a persistently exciting signal. A salient feature of the suggested hybrid Bee-WNN algorithm is the application of a global searching technique for optimizing the initial weights of the neural network, instead of stochastic selection through the Bee Colony approach. Additionally, the wavelet neural network algorithm is utilized to update the optimal weighting via the Levenberg Marquardt training method, thereby enhancing exploitation search abilities. To assess the usefulness of the demonstrated procedure in identification and modeling, a practical fermentation bioreactor is selected as a source of data. Furthermore, two methods, BP-ANN and ABC-WNN, which have already been presented in the research, are applied to equivalent datasets, and the obtained results are compared with those produced by the proposed methodology of the paper. Based on the results, the new extracted model improves the accuracy of the identified model more than 10 times compared to the previous training algorithm. Moreover, from a statistical perspective, the goodness of model fitting is enhanced by 0.03.},

In addressing limitations observed in N -soft topology ( N -ST), particularly in handling multi-argument approximate functions, N -HST offers a comprehensive framework. The study delves into various operators within the N -HST framework, including closure, interior, exterior, and boundary operators, elucidating their interrelationships and providing a deeper understanding of the structural components. Furthermore, this manuscript explores the practical implications of N -HST in multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM), showcasing its applicability in real-world decision scenarios. In addition to its specific applications in MCGDM, N -HST offers generic aspects that contribute to its versatility and efficacy in decision-making processes. By accommodating multiple opinions and handling complex evaluation factors, N -HST emerges as a superior framework for addressing diverse decision-making challenges.

  abstract     = {Accurate detection of 3D obstacles is crucial in autonomous vehicles and intelligent traffic systems. The multi-modal fusion of cameras and LiDAR in 3D object detection can fully leverage the advantages of both sensors, to improve the accuracy and robustness of target detection and make it become a core component of the perception system in autonomous vehicles. However, due to the inherent differences in sensor data, the difficulty of data fusion in 3D object detection still faces numerous challenges. To effectively address this issue, a 3D object detection algorithm based on multi-scale feature-weighted point-by-point fusion is proposed. By establishing correspondences between camera images and lidar point clouds on a point-wise basis, we employ the ResNet50 network model to obtain multi-scale semantic features from images. The importance of different channels in image features is reasonably assigned weights, enhancing point features with image semantic information. This approach proves beneficial in tackling the challenge of matching image and point cloud fusion, which is hindered by disparate data structures. It fully leverages the complementary nature of multi-modal information. Experimental results on the KITTI object detection benchmark dataset show that the proposed 3D object detection algorithm achieves an average detection accuracy of 80.95%, a 1.34% improvement compared to previous multi-modal algorithms, demonstrating superior 3D object detection performance.},

  abstract     = {To achieve energy conservation and emission reduction, the scope of the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP) has been broadened to address the green flexible job-shop scheduling problem (GFJSP). However, solely focusing on scheduling doesn't adequately achieve green production. Furthermore, dynamic events in the job-shop necessitate rescheduling to resume production. Considering these, this paper proposes a scheduling optimization method for a GFJSP under dynamic events (DGFJSP). Firstly, the method introduces an optimization model that considers the switching on/off strategy of machines in idle and the electric power cost under time-of-use pricing. Secondly, the method employs a multi-objective genetic algorithm based on variable neighborhood search (MOGV), which introduces an adaptive elite retention strategy based on external archive and adaptive operators. The efficiency and competitiveness of the MOGV are verified by the benchmark instance, and the MOGV is applied to rescheduling. Ultimately, the method introduces the green flexible job-shop rescheduling metrics: productivity, energy conservation, robustness, and stability as the decision-making basis of the combined rescheduling method. Total rescheduling based on MOGV reduces the value of the comprehensive indicators by 5.931% when machine breakdown and by 6.033% when order insertion or defective return compared to right-shift rescheduling.},
