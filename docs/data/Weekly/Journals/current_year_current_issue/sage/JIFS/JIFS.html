  abstract     = {Information accessibility has been transformed in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in natural language processing (NLP), owing to the widespread use of technologies such as ChatGPT. This paper explores the field of human-directed AI solutions with particular emphasis on newspaper summarization, a useful tool in today's busy world. Utilizing comprehensive models (LLMs), we explore extractive and abstractive summarization methods. To maximize the LLM performance, our strategy entails creating a customized news dataset enhanced with human-centric summaries and using cutting-edge data preparation techniques. To improve the accuracy assessment, we present a modified evaluation metric called Sem-rouge, which augments established units of measurement. In a comparative analysis, it was noticed that the proposed metric can highlight both syntactic and semantic similarities; hence, the metric is suitable for both extractive and abstractive summarization methods. We highlight the significance of dataset selection, data processing methods, and assessment criteria in fine-tuning auto-generated summaries using rigorous comparison analysis. Further studies will focus on improving semantic similarity techniques, integrating advanced models such as The BERT algorithm or Generative Pre-trained Transformer algorithm, and overcoming challenges such as overfitting. Finally, our study emphasizes the importance of meticulously training models and modifying them frequently to enhance automated summarization skills.},

  abstract     = {The use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) as a key technology for controlling and monitoring a range of applications has been accepted. Heterogeneous WSNs involve nodes with different functions, for instance, nodes with sensing, fusion, and routing duties. To maximize the performance of a heterogeneous WSN, an optimized tree construction and clustering-based data aggregation approach is proposed in this paper. The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is used to construct an optimized spanning tree with minimum energy consumption. Clusters are then formed in a distributed manner, and data aggregation is performed among the clusters. The suggested strategy is effective, as shown by the simulation results, and adding a reliable optimization method greatly lowers energy usage and enhances network performance. The research provides a clustering-based data aggregation strategy meant to maximize data delivery from heterogeneous WSNs with low-power nodes. The employed technique combines two clustering algorithms, k-means, and fuzzy c-means, to ensure fast and reliable data forwarding among WSNs. The proposed FFA obtained 95.86% energy efficiency, 87.21% QoS, 95.25% transmission rate, 90.13% PDR, 8.86% delay, 96.21% network lifetime, 91.22% throughput, 89.42% scalability and 96.58% Fault Tolerance. The proposed method can significantly reduce energy consumption and communication overhead, improving network efficiency and utilization. This work has the potential to significantly impact the design and operation of wireless sensor networks in various applications.},

  abstract     = {Accurate detection of 3D obstacles is crucial in autonomous vehicles and intelligent traffic systems. The multi-modal fusion of cameras and LiDAR in 3D object detection can fully leverage the advantages of both sensors, to improve the accuracy and robustness of target detection and make it become a core component of the perception system in autonomous vehicles. However, due to the inherent differences in sensor data, the difficulty of data fusion in 3D object detection still faces numerous challenges. To effectively address this issue, a 3D object detection algorithm based on multi-scale feature-weighted point-by-point fusion is proposed. By establishing correspondences between camera images and lidar point clouds on a point-wise basis, we employ the ResNet50 network model to obtain multi-scale semantic features from images. The importance of different channels in image features is reasonably assigned weights, enhancing point features with image semantic information. This approach proves beneficial in tackling the challenge of matching image and point cloud fusion, which is hindered by disparate data structures. It fully leverages the complementary nature of multi-modal information. Experimental results on the KITTI object detection benchmark dataset show that the proposed 3D object detection algorithm achieves an average detection accuracy of 80.95%, a 1.34% improvement compared to previous multi-modal algorithms, demonstrating superior 3D object detection performance.},
