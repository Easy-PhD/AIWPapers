  abstract     = {This paper proposes a twin-type extreme learning machine based on the weighted linear loss function and projection technique called the weighted linear loss projection twin extreme learning machine (WLPTELM). By introducing the weighted linear loss function, the proposed WLPTELM balances the impact of each sample point on the model performance. By using the projection technique, more discriminant information can be retained and better classification performance can be obtained, which can effectively deal with linearly inseparable problems. Furthermore, it only needs to solve a pair of systems of linear equations, which not only improves the computational efficiency but also ensures the generalization ability of the model. Hence WLPTELM can handle large-scale binary classification problems simply and efficiently. Numerical experiments on artificial datasets and a number of benchmark datasets demonstrated the practicability and validity of the proposed WLPTELM.},

This study employs symbiotic theory to clarify and better comprehend the role of innovation ecosystems in economic resilience. To this end, it identifies five essential components of innovation ecosystems and proposes a conceptual model. Panel data fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is utilized in the study to identify how these components combine and contribute to economic resilience. The findings reveal three primary configurations, classified as either platform-dominated or network-dominated. The platform-dominated configuration is favored in the eastern economic zone, while the network-dominated configuration is more prevalent in the central economic zone. Additionally, since the COVID-19 pandemic, innovation platforms and networks have become increasingly important in stimulating economic resilience. This study makes several contributions to the literature: (1) responding to the need for further exploration of economic resilience, especially in the post-epidemic era; (2) improving the theoretical comprehension of how innovation ecosystem components combine and interact to better illustrate economic resilience; (3) offering several innovation combinations that can enhance economic resilience through the application of panel data fsQCA methodology.},

The optimization model, developed under fuzzy conditions, utilized the fuzzy order function method. The NSGA-II meta-heuristic algorithm was employed to solve the model, and its results were compared against fuzzy optimization model's solution quality. FMEA results highlighted human resources’ carelessness or inaccuracy as the most critical risk based on Risk Priority Scores (RPN).

  abstract     = {Multi energy systems can flexibly adjust different energy supply ratios to meet real-time energy demand changes, optimize the demand side response of multi energy systems, and improve energy utilization efficiency. Therefore, a power demand side active response efficiency optimization method based on discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed. This method deeply analyzes the inherent characteristics of residential demand response and industrial demand response, and designs targeted optimization strategies in combination with the active response structure on the power demand side. Its core goal is to minimize the total cost of electricity demand side response and maximize its demand response capability, thereby achieving a dual improvement in economy and efficiency. In order to ensure the effectiveness and feasibility of the optimization process, a series of constraints have been set to ensure the applicability of the solution in practical operation. In the solving process, an improved discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm was adopted, which not only inherits the global search ability of traditional particle swarm optimization algorithms, but also makes it more suitable for solving power demand side response problems through discretization processing. The innovation of this method is mainly reflected in the following aspects: firstly, a targeted objective function is designed based on the actual characteristics of the power demand side; Secondly, an improved discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm was introduced to improve the efficiency and accuracy of optimization solutions; Finally, by comprehensively considering the total cost and maximum demand response capability, the comprehensive optimization of power demand side response efficiency was achieved. The experimental results show that after optimization, the demand side can actively and timely participate in the peak shaving of the distribution network, achieving load reduction; Improved the electrical, thermal, and gas responses of the power system; The loss results are all less than 0.41 MW; The annual response cost is less than 2.52 million yuan; The voltage deviation index of each node is less than 5.56%, which is at least 4% lower than other methods.},

Farmers are interested in conserving and adding additional soil organic carbon to certain fields in order to improve soil health and productivity. The relationship between soil and environment that has been discovered and standardized throughout time has enhanced the progress of digital soil-mapping techniques; therefore, a variety of machine learning techniques are used to predict soil properties. Studies are thriving at how effectively each machine learning method maps and predicts SOC, especially at high spatial resolutions. To predict SOC of soil at a 30 m resolution, four machine learning models—Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Adaptive Boosting, and k-Nearest Neighbour were used. For model evaluation, two error metrics, namely R 2 and RMSE have been used. The findings demonstrated that the calibration and validation sets’ descriptive statistics sufficiently resembled the entire set of data. The range of the calculated SOC content was 0.06 to 1.76%. According to the findings of the study, Random Forest showed good results for both cases, i.e., evaluation using cross validation and without cross validation. Using cross validation, RF confirmed highest R 2 as 0.5278 and lowest RMSE as 0.1683 for calibration dataset while without cross validation it showed R 2 as 0.8612 and lowest RMSE as 0.0912 for calibration dataset. The generated soil maps will help farmers adopt precise knowledge for decisions that will increase farm productivity and provide food security through the sustainable use of nutrients and the agricultural environment.},

The complexity and confusion of target emotions lead to low accuracy of FER. This study proposes an attentional residual network based spatial transformer mechanism for FER to establish an effective emotion recognition model. First, the learnable module Spatial Transformer Network (STN) was introduced to actively transform the feature map in order to learn the feature map's more general distortion invariance. Second, the parameters and structure of ResNet18 were adjusted, and it was connected to the STN in an end-to-end manner. Finally, by introducing the Squeeze and Excitation (SE) block, which replaces the ReLu function with the Mish function, we improved the stability and precision of the channel weight adjustment. The verification was carried out on three public datasets FER2013, CK+, and JAFFE. Among them, the FER2013 dataset is separated into three sections, training set, public validation set, and private validation set. The ten-fold cross-validation approach was used for the sparse CK + and JAFFE datasets. On the FER2013, CK+, and JAFFE datasets, accuracy rates of 73.25%, 99.18%, and 97.10% were attained, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Named entity recognition is a highly relevant research topic in the field of natural language processing owing to its widespread application, which mainly involves three types of nested entities, discontinuous entities and flat named entities. Notably, nested named entities are characterized by one entity containing multiple sub-entities, ambiguous boundary definitions, and flexible structural formats. These features give rise to challenges such as semantic ambiguity, slow decoding efficiency, error propagation, and information loss. Therefore, to effectively address these issues and enhance classification performance, it is critical to integrate information sources such as internal markers, neighbouring word pairs, first and last word pairs, labels, and related spans. This is achieved in the present study via a newly proposed nested named entity recognition model based on triple cross affine attention. The proposed model encodes the input text using the BERT model and Bi-LSTM before extracting relevant features from the input text by applying DCNN. The extracted feature sequences are used as input into the triple cross affine attention module which computes the scores, allowing the model to classify and predict the outputs using the MLP layer. The experimental results demonstrate that the precision, recall, and F1 value metrics of the proposed method outperform other existing benchmark algorithmic models when applied to the ACE2004, ACE2005, and GENIA standard datasets. Additionally, it exhibits superior recognition performance in nested named entity recognition.},

The presence of dynamic feature points decreases the localization accuracy and robustness of SLAM. In light of this, we propose YER-SLAM, a dynamic SLAM system employing object detection and region-growing algorithm, which fully utilizes the semantic and geometric information contained in images to identify and eliminate dynamic features in the environment. Firstly, we use YOLOv5 object detection to classify the image into static, dynamic, and potentially dynamic regions to generate a semantic mask that incorporates a priori knowledge. Secondly, we utilize a dynamic object detection algorithm that tightly couples object detection with epipolar constraints to initially identify dynamic features in the scene. Subsequently, we propose a novel strategy for the elimination of dynamic feature points, which integrates the acquired dynamic point with a region-growing algorithm to generate a mask for the dynamic region, thereby enabling the exclusion of the region’s feature points in the tracking process. Finally, the experimental results from the TUM dataset reveal that our algorithm achieves a 94.71% reduction in the average absolute trajectory error in highly dynamic environments, compared to ORBSLAM2. YER-SLAM presented in this paper effectively improves localization accuracy in dynamic environments.},

There are ways to identify its presence before it seriously harms the body because it affects all bodily parts and organs. Diabetes also affects the retina of the eyes, rupturing blood vessels there and ultimately leading to irreversible blindness due to complications. This study suggests an enhanced activation function for diagnosing DR using fundus images automatically lowers processing time and loss. In this work, the proposed system design is constructed using a stacking-based Explainable AI model. The increased activation process within the various CNN models was trained and tested using the “Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society 2019 Blindness Detection” (APTOS 2019) dataset. The pre-processing phase following data collection revealed data segmentation and augmentation. The deep learning prediction approach is used in the recommended work. Robust stacked model is generated by applying CNN, VGG, and custom-versed model methods. The classification of DR and the operation of explainable AI algorithms are explained in this recommended section. The LIME and SHAP approaches shape the stages of doctoral education. Based on the profile-rated, moderate, and severe phases of DR, the suggested figure illustrates the procedures. The accuracy of the current model was 76.78%. The study contributes by proposing a novel hybrid-stacked model architecture tailored for diabetic retinopathy detection. The future scope for this study could be the integration of additional explain ability techniques such as attention mechanisms or saliency maps to provide more detailed insights into the model's decision-making process.},

  abstract     = {Stock market plays a vital role in country's economy. The estimation of stock market trends and price is important for the investors. Stock forecasting has piqued the interest of investors worldwide. Investors are looking for a forecasting model that is accurate and reliable enough to account for volatile and nonlinear market behavior. The problem of stock price prediction becomes a complicated one due to multiple inputs like technical indicators, financial factors, trends of international markets, and social media data. This research seeks to collect and correlate multiple inputs to analyse their impact on the stock market and improve stock price prediction accuracy. Researchers are attempting to refine effective indicators to aid in stock market forecasting by taking the advantage of ever-growing world wide web. Effective indicators like stock-related events and public sentiment towards the stock plays a significant role in stock volatility, hence can be used in improving prediction accuracy. The paper provides an efficient framework for optimizing the error in short-term stock market prediction with diverse data sources, based on a novel Mayfly Adam Optimization Algorithm (MAOA) and Deep Residual Network (DRN). This novel approach uses Deep Q Network (DQN) with dice coefficient similarity for feature fusion and DRN for prediction. We have considered historical stock market prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL), commodity time-series dataset, news articles and reviews on social media to evaluate the model's effectiveness. The proposed technique accuracy is found to be 96%, with average accuracy of 98.27%. The existing techniques like, Deep Neural Network (DNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Random Forest (RF) models provided accuracy of 82.4%, 85.5%, 88.8%, and 92.39%, respectively. This shows that the proposed model is 13.6% better than DNN, 10.5% better than ANN, 7% better than LSTM and 3.61% better than RF in terms of accuracy.},

  abstract     = {There is a rising need for secure and effective ways to store and retrieve data as data privacy takes on more significance. Due to its decentralized and unchangeable nature, blockchain technology has shown potential in this sector. However, the efficiency and scalability of conventional Blockchain systems are constrained. It is suggested an Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) storage and retrieval system on the Blockchain using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for file encryption, Access Control Lists (ACLs) for data access management, a Name Server for decentralized naming, Layered Radix Tree with Adaptive Hashing (LRT-AH) for indexing and Proof of Fair Chance (PoFC) consensus mechanism to overcome these restrictions. Before storing the data on the IPFS network, the system encrypts it using ECC-AES and uses ACLs to restrict access to only approved users. The Name Server offers a practical method of accessing the saved information without jeopardizing user privacy. PoFC is a fair and effective consensus process since the PoFC algorithm, a revolutionary approach, guarantees that each user has an equal probability of being chosen as the next block minor. LRT-AH provides a scalable and adaptive indexing structure, optimizing data storage and retrieval operations in blockchain environments. The proposed system has demonstrated 50% improvement in efficiency for both insertion and retrieval times over traditional blockchain systems and those utilizing only IPFS. The system performance is analyzed along with scalability and efficiency, proving that it is appropriate for applications requiring massive amounts of data storage and retrieval.},

The condition of C -class functions is used to establish some strong coupled proximal point (SCPP) results under the CCPTF-contraction mappings. The concept of closeness and the triangular condition of fuzzy metric is considered to prove our main results. We establish an illustrative example to support our work. In addition, we present an application of nonlinear integral equations (NIEs) to unify our work. This new concept of best proximal coupled fixed point results on FM-spaces with application will play a very best role for researchers in the theory of fixed point.},

  abstract     = {Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is an effective tool for classification prediction. In a text classification task, the text is constructed as a word-document graph. However, existing methods only make document category predictions based on document nodes in the word-document graph, neglecting the auxiliary role of word nodes in classification. Based on this, this paper proposes a novel GCN structure based on Token-Task Learning (TTL) for text classification. This paper performs part of speech (POS) tagging or Named Entity Recognition (NER) as auxiliary tasks for text classification. By establishing the relationship between token classification and text classification, text category prediction can take into account the information implied by word nodes, thereby enhancing the accuracy of text classification. In addition, this paper replaces Relu in TextGCN with Mish to enhance data fitting capability of GCN. The experiments are carried out on five text classification datasets, and the experimental results show that the proposed method effectively improves the accuracy of text classification while outperforming the comparison methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates information diffusion on online social networks with an emphasis on the network evolution perspective. Unlike most previous works on information diffusion, the structural dynamics of the networks takes center-stage in this work. The proposed work identifies fundamental network structural properties that affect diffusion and generates a corpus of synthetic networks similar to a standard dynamic social network interactions dataset, using a random-rewiring strategy. The work uses machine learning models built for multi-target regression to model and predict the diffusion process on a network, given the structural evolution of a network. This modeling is done based on the data captured at three granularity levels: snapshot-wise, based on an evolution window of 100 snapshots, and an end-to-end evolution. The generated synthetic network corpus is validated using a graph kernel based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test for similarity with respect to the selected baseline dataset, and the multi-target regression models’ performance is analyzed based on standard metrics. The proposed model successfully learns from information flow patterns to reveal the complex relationships between network structure evolution and information propagation. The findings highlight the complex relationship between network structure and information movement in dynamic social networks. The multi-target regression models demonstrate robust predictive power, as indicated by the R 2 scores, which quantify the accuracy of the model’s ability to capture the underlying patterns of information diffusion in dynamic social networks.},
