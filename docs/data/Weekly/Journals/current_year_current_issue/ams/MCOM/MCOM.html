The dual variety $X_Z^\vee$ of a variety $X$ relative to a subvariety $Z$ is the set of hyperplanes tangent to $X$ at a point of $Z$. We also introduce the concept of polar classes of $X$ relative to $Z$. We explore the duality of varieties of low rank matrices relative to special linear sections. In this framework, we study the critical points of the Euclidean Distance (ED) function from a data point to $X$, lying on $Z$. The locus where the number of such conditional critical points is positive is called the ED data locus of $X$ given $Z$. The generic number of such critical points defines the conditional ED degree of $X$ given $Z$. We show the irreducibility of ED data loci, and we compute their dimensions and degrees in terms of relative characteristic classes.},

The second family, available only for the Frobenius endomorphism, is based on a formula expressing the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius as a reduced norm in a central simple algebra.},

Our idea is to exploit the fact that at least half of the possible generating vectors yield nearly the optimal rate of the worst-case error in the deterministic setting. By randomly choosing generating vectors $r$ times and comparing their corresponding worst-case errors, one can find one generating vector with a desired worst-case error bound with a very high probability, and the (small) failure probability can be controlled by increasing $r$ logarithmically as a function of the number of points.

When looking at contractivity properties of a one-layer weight-tied neural ODE $\dot {u}(t)=\sigma (Au(t)+b)$ (with $u,b \in \mathbb {R}^n$, $A$ is a given $n \times n$ matrix, $\sigma : \mathbb {R}\to \mathbb {R}$ denotes an activation function and for a vector $z \in \mathbb {R}^n$, $\sigma (z) \in \mathbb {R}^n$ has to be interpreted entry-wise), we are led to study the logarithmic norm of a set of products of type $D A$, where $D$ is a diagonal matrix such that $diag(D) \in \sigma ’(\mathbb {R}^n)$. Specifically, given a real number $c$ (usually $c=0$), the problem consists in finding the largest positive interval $\mathrm {I}\subseteq \mathbb [0,\infty )$ such that the logarithmic norm $\mu (DA) \le c$ for all diagonal matrices $D$ with $D_{ii}\in \mathrm {I}$. We propose a two-level nested methodology: an inner level where, for a given $\mathrm {I}$, we compute an optimizer $D^\star (\mathrm {I})$ by a gradient system approach, and an outer level where we tune $\mathrm {I}$ so that the value $c$ is reached by $\mu (D^\star (\mathrm {I})A)$. We extend the proposed two-level approach to the general multilayer, and possibly time-dependent, case $\dot {u}(t) = \sigma ( A_k(t) \ldots \sigma ( A_{1}(t) u(t) + b_{1}(t) ) \ldots + b_{k}(t) )$ and we propose several numerical examples to illustrate its behaviour, including its stabilizing performance on a one-layer neural ODE applied to the classification of the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.},

The main idea behind our approach is to divide the time interval into $N$ sub-intervals and derive the Feynman-Kac formula within each time sub-interval. Then, we develop a fully discretized parallel scheme using the implicit-explicit technique for temporal discretization, followed by applying a novel walk-on-sphere method to obtain the numerical solution. Notably, the proposed method takes advantage of the Poisson kernel associated with the stochastic processes to accommodate the full discretization of the classical and fractional semi-linear PDEs in a single framework. Moreover, we rigorously analyze the error bound for the proposed scheme that is totally explicit with respect to the number of simulation paths $M$ and the time step size $\Delta t$. As a by-product, we prove the maximum principle of the proposed schemes for fractional Allen Cahn equation with double well potential and provide an error estimate by using the established maximum principle. Extensive numerical experiments in two and three-dimensional spaces are presented to verify our theoretical results and to show the robustness and accuracy of our method.},

Without a magnetic field and with suitable initial conditions, these vortices interact, in the singular limit $\varepsilon \to 0$, through an explicit Hamiltonian dynamics. Using this analytical framework, we develop and analyze a numerical strategy based on the reduced-order Hamiltonian system to efficiently simulate the infinite-dimensional GP equation for small, but finite, $\varepsilon$. This method allows us to avoid numerical stability issues in solving the GP equation, where small values of $\varepsilon$ typically require very fine meshes and time steps. We also provide a mathematical justification of our method in terms of rigorous error estimates of the error in the supercurrent, together with numerical illustrations.},

Instead, we derive novel quantitative stability estimates that extend the theory of shifts, and in particular, the framework for proving stability first developed by the second author and Vasseur. This is the first time this methodology has been used for quantitative estimates. We work entirely within the context of the theory of shifts and $a$-contraction, techniques which adapt well to systems.

In isogeometric analysis, the critical time step is constrained by so-called “outlier” frequencies, representing the inaccurate high frequency part of the spectrum. Removing or dampening these high frequencies is paramount for fast explicit solution techniques. In this work, we propose mass lumping and outlier removal techniques for nontrivial geometries, including multipatch and trimmed geometries. Our lumping strategies provably do not deteriorate (and often improve) the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition of the original problem and are combined with deflation techniques to remove persistent outlier frequencies. Numerical experiments reveal the advantages of the method, especially for simulations covering large time spans where they may halve the number of iterations with little or no effect on the numerical solution.},

  abstract     = {A singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problem posed on the unit square in $\mathbb {R}^2$ is solved numerically by a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) finite element method. Typical solutions of this class of 2D problems exhibit boundary layers along the sides of the domain; these layers generally cause difficulties for numerical methods. Our LDG method handles the boundary layers by using a Shishkin mesh and also introducing the new concept of a “layer-upwind flux”—a discrete flux whose values are chosen on the fine mesh (which lies inside the boundary layers) in the direction where the layer weakens. On the coarse mesh, one can use a standard central flux. No penalty terms are needed with these fluxes, unlike many other variants of the LDG method. Our choice of discrete flux makes it feasible to derive an optimal-order error analysis in a balanced norm; this norm is stronger than the usual energy norm and is a more appropriate measure for errors in computed solutions for singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problems. It will be proved that the LDG method is usually convergent of order $O((N^{-1}\ln N)^{k+1})$ in the balanced norm, where $N$ is the number of mesh intervals in each coordinate direction and tensor-product piecewise polynomials of degree $k$ in each coordinate variable are used in the LDG method. This result is the first of its kind for the LDG method applied to this class of problem and is optimal for convergence on a Shishkin mesh. Its sharpness is confirmed by numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {We propose and analyze a conforming finite element method for a nonisothermal fluid-membrane interaction problem. The problem consists of a Navier-Stokes/heat system, commonly known as the Boussinesq system, in the free-fluid region, and a Darcy-heat coupled system in the membrane. These systems are coupled through buoyancy terms and a set of transmission conditions on the fluid-membrane interface, including mass conservation, balance of normal forces, the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman law, and continuity of heat flux and fluid temperature. We consider the standard velocity-pressure-temperature variational formulation for the Boussinesq system, along with a dual-mixed scheme coupled with a primal formulation for the Darcy and Heat equations in the membrane region. The latter yields the introduction of the trace of the porous medium pressure as a suitable Lagrange multiplier. For the associated Galerkin scheme, we employ Bernardi-Raugel and Raviart-Thomas elements for velocities, piecewise constant elements for pressures, continuous piecewise linear functions for temperatures, and continuous piecewise linear functions for the Lagrange multiplier on a partition of the interface. We prove well-posedness for both the continuous and discrete schemes and derive corresponding error estimates. Finally, we present numerical examples to confirm the predicted convergence rates and demonstrate the performance of the method.},

  abstract     = {In this work we study the stability, convergence, and pressure-robustness of discretization methods for incompressible flows with hybrid velocity and pressure. Specifically, focusing on the Stokes problem, we identify a set of assumptions that yield inf-sup stability as well as error estimates which distinguish the velocity- and pressure-related contributions to the error. We additionally identify the key properties under which the pressure-related contributions vanish in the estimate of the velocity, thus leading to pressure-robustness. Several examples of existing and new schemes that fit into the framework are exhibited, and extensive numerical validation of the theoretical properties is provided.},
