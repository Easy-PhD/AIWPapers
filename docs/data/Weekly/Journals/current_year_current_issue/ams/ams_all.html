It is followed by an introduction to compact transformation groups in Section 2. Then we show by examples how classification problems lead to the study of orbits of algebraic groups in Section 3. In order to explain and formulate Luna’s Slice Theorem, we need some basics from algebraic transformation groups and algebraic geometry; this is done in Sections 4 and 5. The paper ends with some striking applications in Section 6.},

Our approach is to establish a stronger identity of infinite series of $GL_l$ characters involving Schur Catalanimals ; these were recently shown by the authors to represent Schur functions $s_{\mu }[-MX^{m,n}]$ in subalgebras $\Lambda (X^{m,n})\subset \mathcal {E}$ isomorphic to the algebra of symmetric functions $\Lambda$ over $\mathbb {Q} (q,t)$, where $\mathcal {E}$ is the elliptic Hall algebra of Burban and Schiffmann. We establish a combinatorial formula for Schur Catalanimals as weighted sums of LLT polynomials, with terms indexed by configurations of nested lattice paths called nests , having endpoints and bounding constraints controlled by data called a den . The special case for $\Lambda (X^{m,1})$ proves the Loehr-Warrington conjecture, giving $\nabla ^m s_{\mu }$ as a weighted sum of LLT polynomials indexed by systems of nested Dyck paths. In general, for $\Lambda (X^{m,n})$ our formula implies a new $(m,n)$ version of the Loehr-Warrington conjecture. In the case where each nest consists of a single lattice path, the nests in a den formula reduce to our previous shuffle theorem for paths under any line. Both this and the $(m,n)$ Loehr-Warrington formula generalize the $(km,kn)$ shuffle theorem proven by Carlsson and Mellit (for $n=1$) and Mellit. Our formula here unifies these two generalizations.},

The key tool is a microlocal interpretation of Whittaker coefficients. We establish various exactness properties in the geometric Langlands context that may be of independent interest. Specifically, we show Hecke functors are $t$-exact on the category of tempered $D$-modules, strengthening a classical result of Gaitsgory (with different hypotheses) for $GL_n$. We also show that Whittaker coefficient functors are $t$-exact for sheaves with nilpotent singular support. An additional consequence of our results is that the tempered, restricted geometric Langlands conjecture must be $t$-exact. We apply our results to show that for suitably irreducible local systems, Whittaker-normalized Hecke eigensheaves are perverse sheaves that are irreducible on each connected component of $\operatorname {Bun}_G$.},

  abstract     = {We develop a general technique for realising full closed subsets of the complex plane as wandering sets of entire functions. Using this construction, we solve a number of open problems. We construct a counterexample to Eremenko’s conjecture , a central problem in transcendental dynamics that asks whether every connected component of the set of escaping points of a transcendental entire function is unbounded. We prove that there is a transcendental entire function for which infinitely many Fatou components share the same boundary. This resolves the long-standing problem whether Lakes of Wada continua can arise in complex dynamics, and answers the analogue of a question of Fatou from 1920 concerning Fatou components of rational functions. We answer a question of Rippon concerning the existence of non-escaping points on the boundary of a bounded escaping wandering domain, that is, a wandering Fatou component contained in the escaping set. In fact, we show that the set of such points can have positive Lebesgue measure. We give the first example of an entire function having a simply connected Fatou component whose closure has a disconnected complement, answering a question of Boc Thaler. In view of (3), we introduce the concept of maverick points : points on the boundary of a wandering domain whose accumulation behaviour differs from that of internal points. As noted in (3), the set of such points may have positive planar Lebesgue measure, so it may be rather large. On the other hand, we prove that this set has harmonic measure zero when viewed from the wandering domain.},

In this framework, we study the critical points of the Euclidean Distance (ED) function from a data point to $X$, lying on $Z$. The locus where the number of such conditional critical points is positive is called the ED data locus of $X$ given $Z$. The generic number of such critical points defines the conditional ED degree of $X$ given $Z$.

The first family of algorithms relies on the correspondence between Drinfeld modules and Anderson motives, reducing the computation to linear algebra over a polynomial ring. The second family, available only for the Frobenius endomorphism, is based on a formula expressing the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius as a reduced norm in a central simple algebra.},

We introduce a new randomized rank-1 lattice rule with a randomly chosen number of points, which avoids the need for component-by-component construction in the search for good generating vectors while still achieving nearly the optimal rate of the randomized error. Our idea is to exploit the fact that at least half of the possible generating vectors yield nearly the optimal rate of the worst-case error in the deterministic setting. By randomly choosing generating vectors $r$ times and comparing their corresponding worst-case errors, one can find one generating vector with a desired worst-case error bound with a very high probability, and the (small) failure probability can be controlled by increasing $r$ logarithmically as a function of the number of points. Numerical experiments are conducted to support our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel methodology to solve a key eigenvalue optimization problem which arises in the contractivity analysis of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). When looking at contractivity properties of a one-layer weight-tied neural ODE $\dot {u}(t)=\sigma (Au(t)+b)$ (with $u,b \in \mathbb {R}^n$, $A$ is a given $n \times n$ matrix, $\sigma : \mathbb {R}\to \mathbb {R}$ denotes an activation function and for a vector $z \in \mathbb {R}^n$, $\sigma (z) \in \mathbb {R}^n$ has to be interpreted entry-wise), we are led to study the logarithmic norm of a set of products of type $D A$, where $D$ is a diagonal matrix such that $diag(D) \in \sigma ’(\mathbb {R}^n)$. Specifically, given a real number $c$ (usually $c=0$), the problem consists in finding the largest positive interval $\mathrm {I}\subseteq \mathbb [0,\infty )$ such that the logarithmic norm $\mu (DA) \le c$ for all diagonal matrices $D$ with $D_{ii}\in \mathrm {I}$. We propose a two-level nested methodology: an inner level where, for a given $\mathrm {I}$, we compute an optimizer $D^\star (\mathrm {I})$ by a gradient system approach, and an outer level where we tune $\mathrm {I}$ so that the value $c$ is reached by $\mu (D^\star (\mathrm {I})A)$. We extend the proposed two-level approach to the general multilayer, and possibly time-dependent, case $\dot {u}(t) = \sigma ( A_k(t) \ldots \sigma ( A_{1}(t) u(t) + b_{1}(t) ) \ldots + b_{k}(t) )$ and we propose several numerical examples to illustrate its behaviour, including its stabilizing performance on a one-layer neural ODE applied to the classification of the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an implicit-explicit Monte Carlo method (IMEX-MCM) for solving semi-linear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) driven by $\alpha$-stable Lévy process on bounded domains, also known as semi-linear PDEs involving integral fractional Laplacian operator (i.e., $\alpha \in (0,2)$) and classical Laplacian operator (i.e., $\alpha =2$). The main idea behind our approach is to divide the time interval into $N$ sub-intervals and derive the Feynman-Kac formula within each time sub-interval. Then, we develop a fully discretized parallel scheme using the implicit-explicit technique for temporal discretization, followed by applying a novel walk-on-sphere method to obtain the numerical solution. Notably, the proposed method takes advantage of the Poisson kernel associated with the stochastic processes to accommodate the full discretization of the classical and fractional semi-linear PDEs in a single framework. Moreover, we rigorously analyze the error bound for the proposed scheme that is totally explicit with respect to the number of simulation paths $M$ and the time step size $\Delta t$. As a by-product, we prove the maximum principle of the proposed schemes for fractional Allen Cahn equation with double well potential and provide an error estimate by using the established maximum principle. Extensive numerical experiments in two and three-dimensional spaces are presented to verify our theoretical results and to show the robustness and accuracy of our method.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the numerical simulation of the Gross–Pitaevskii (GP) equation, for which a well-known feature is the appearance of quantized vortices with core size of the order of a small parameter $\varepsilon$. Without a magnetic field and with suitable initial conditions, these vortices interact, in the singular limit $\varepsilon \to 0$, through an explicit Hamiltonian dynamics. Using this analytical framework, we develop and analyze a numerical strategy based on the reduced-order Hamiltonian system to efficiently simulate the infinite-dimensional GP equation for small, but finite, $\varepsilon$. This method allows us to avoid numerical stability issues in solving the GP equation, where small values of $\varepsilon$ typically require very fine meshes and time steps. We also provide a mathematical justification of our method in terms of rigorous error estimates of the error in the supercurrent, together with numerical illustrations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop reliable a posteriori error estimates for numerical approximations of scalar hyperbolic conservation laws in one space dimension. Our methods have no inherent small-data limitations and are a step towards error control of numerical schemes for systems. We are careful not to appeal to the Kruzhkov theory for scalar conservation laws. Instead, we derive novel quantitative stability estimates that extend the theory of shifts, and in particular, the framework for proving stability first developed by the second author and Vasseur. This is the first time this methodology has been used for quantitative estimates. We work entirely within the context of the theory of shifts and $a$-contraction, techniques which adapt well to systems. In fact, the stability framework by the second author and Vasseur has itself recently been pushed to systems (see G. Chen, S. G. Krupa, and A. F. Vasseur [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 246 (2022), pp. 299–332]). Our theoretical findings are complemented by a numerical implementation in MATLAB and numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Mass lumping techniques are commonly employed in explicit time integration schemes for problems in structural dynamics and both avoid solving costly linear systems with the consistent mass matrix and increase the critical time step. In isogeometric analysis, the critical time step is constrained by so-called “outlier” frequencies, representing the inaccurate high frequency part of the spectrum. Removing or dampening these high frequencies is paramount for fast explicit solution techniques. In this work, we propose mass lumping and outlier removal techniques for nontrivial geometries, including multipatch and trimmed geometries. Our lumping strategies provably do not deteriorate (and often improve) the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition of the original problem and are combined with deflation techniques to remove persistent outlier frequencies. Numerical experiments reveal the advantages of the method, especially for simulations covering large time spans where they may halve the number of iterations with little or no effect on the numerical solution.},

  abstract     = {A singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problem posed on the unit square in $\mathbb {R}^2$ is solved numerically by a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) finite element method. Typical solutions of this class of 2D problems exhibit boundary layers along the sides of the domain; these layers generally cause difficulties for numerical methods. Our LDG method handles the boundary layers by using a Shishkin mesh and also introducing the new concept of a “layer-upwind flux”—a discrete flux whose values are chosen on the fine mesh (which lies inside the boundary layers) in the direction where the layer weakens. On the coarse mesh, one can use a standard central flux. No penalty terms are needed with these fluxes, unlike many other variants of the LDG method. Our choice of discrete flux makes it feasible to derive an optimal-order error analysis in a balanced norm; this norm is stronger than the usual energy norm and is a more appropriate measure for errors in computed solutions for singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problems. It will be proved that the LDG method is usually convergent of order $O((N^{-1}\ln N)^{k+1})$ in the balanced norm, where $N$ is the number of mesh intervals in each coordinate direction and tensor-product piecewise polynomials of degree $k$ in each coordinate variable are used in the LDG method. This result is the first of its kind for the LDG method applied to this class of problem and is optimal for convergence on a Shishkin mesh. Its sharpness is confirmed by numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {We propose and analyze a conforming finite element method for a nonisothermal fluid-membrane interaction problem. The problem consists of a Navier-Stokes/heat system, commonly known as the Boussinesq system, in the free-fluid region, and a Darcy-heat coupled system in the membrane. These systems are coupled through buoyancy terms and a set of transmission conditions on the fluid-membrane interface, including mass conservation, balance of normal forces, the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman law, and continuity of heat flux and fluid temperature. We consider the standard velocity-pressure-temperature variational formulation for the Boussinesq system, along with a dual-mixed scheme coupled with a primal formulation for the Darcy and Heat equations in the membrane region. The latter yields the introduction of the trace of the porous medium pressure as a suitable Lagrange multiplier. For the associated Galerkin scheme, we employ Bernardi-Raugel and Raviart-Thomas elements for velocities, piecewise constant elements for pressures, continuous piecewise linear functions for temperatures, and continuous piecewise linear functions for the Lagrange multiplier on a partition of the interface. We prove well-posedness for both the continuous and discrete schemes and derive corresponding error estimates. Finally, we present numerical examples to confirm the predicted convergence rates and demonstrate the performance of the method.},
