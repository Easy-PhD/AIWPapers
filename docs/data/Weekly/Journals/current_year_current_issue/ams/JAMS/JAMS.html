We introduce a general strategy for proving $C^\infty$ local rigidity of algebraic actions. As a consequence, we show $C^\infty$ local rigidity for a broad class of parabolic algebraic actions on homogeneous spaces of semisimple Lie groups. This is the first time in the literature that (strong) local rigidity for these actions is addressed.},

  abstract     = {We prove and extend the longest-standing conjecture in ‘$q,t$-Catalan combinatorics,’ namely, the combinatorial formula for $\nabla ^m s_{\mu }$ conjectured by Loehr and Warrington, where $s_{\mu }$ is a Schur function and $\nabla$ is an eigenoperator on Macdonald polynomials. Our approach is to establish a stronger identity of infinite series of $GL_l$ characters involving Schur Catalanimals ; these were recently shown by the authors to represent Schur functions $s_{\mu }[-MX^{m,n}]$ in subalgebras $\Lambda (X^{m,n})\subset \mathcal {E}$ isomorphic to the algebra of symmetric functions $\Lambda$ over $\mathbb {Q} (q,t)$, where $\mathcal {E}$ is the elliptic Hall algebra of Burban and Schiffmann. We establish a combinatorial formula for Schur Catalanimals as weighted sums of LLT polynomials, with terms indexed by configurations of nested lattice paths called nests , having endpoints and bounding constraints controlled by data called a den . The special case for $\Lambda (X^{m,1})$ proves the Loehr-Warrington conjecture, giving $\nabla ^m s_{\mu }$ as a weighted sum of LLT polynomials indexed by systems of nested Dyck paths. In general, for $\Lambda (X^{m,n})$ our formula implies a new $(m,n)$ version of the Loehr-Warrington conjecture. In the case where each nest consists of a single lattice path, the nests in a den formula reduce to our previous shuffle theorem for paths under any line. Both this and the $(m,n)$ Loehr-Warrington formula generalize the $(km,kn)$ shuffle theorem proven by Carlsson and Mellit (for $n=1$) and Mellit. Our formula here unifies these two generalizations.},

  abstract     = {Given a perfectoid field, we find an elementary extension and a henselian defectless valuation on it, whose value group is divisible and whose residue field is an elementary extension of the tilt. This specializes to the almost purity theorem over perfectoid valuation rings and Fontaine-Wintenberger. Along the way, we prove an Ax-Kochen/Ershov principle for certain deeply ramified fields, which also uncovers some new model-theoretic phenomena in positive characteristic. Notably, we get that the perfect hull of ${\mathbb {F}}_p(t)^h$ is an elementary substructure of the perfect hull of ${\mathbb {F}}_p(\!(t)\!)$.},

  abstract     = {We prove that cuspidal automorphic $D$-modules have non-vanishing Whittaker coefficients, generalizing known results in the geometric Langlands program from $GL_n$ to general reductive groups. The key tool is a microlocal interpretation of Whittaker coefficients. We establish various exactness properties in the geometric Langlands context that may be of independent interest. Specifically, we show Hecke functors are $t$-exact on the category of tempered $D$-modules, strengthening a classical result of Gaitsgory (with different hypotheses) for $GL_n$. We also show that Whittaker coefficient functors are $t$-exact for sheaves with nilpotent singular support. An additional consequence of our results is that the tempered, restricted geometric Langlands conjecture must be $t$-exact. We apply our results to show that for suitably irreducible local systems, Whittaker-normalized Hecke eigensheaves are perverse sheaves that are irreducible on each connected component of $\operatorname {Bun}_G$.},

  abstract     = {We develop a general technique for realising full closed subsets of the complex plane as wandering sets of entire functions. Using this construction, we solve a number of open problems. We construct a counterexample to Eremenko’s conjecture , a central problem in transcendental dynamics that asks whether every connected component of the set of escaping points of a transcendental entire function is unbounded. We prove that there is a transcendental entire function for which infinitely many Fatou components share the same boundary. This resolves the long-standing problem whether Lakes of Wada continua can arise in complex dynamics, and answers the analogue of a question of Fatou from 1920 concerning Fatou components of rational functions. We answer a question of Rippon concerning the existence of non-escaping points on the boundary of a bounded escaping wandering domain, that is, a wandering Fatou component contained in the escaping set. In fact, we show that the set of such points can have positive Lebesgue measure. We give the first example of an entire function having a simply connected Fatou component whose closure has a disconnected complement, answering a question of Boc Thaler. In view of (3), we introduce the concept of maverick points : points on the boundary of a wandering domain whose accumulation behaviour differs from that of internal points. As noted in (3), the set of such points may have positive planar Lebesgue measure, so it may be rather large. On the other hand, we prove that this set has harmonic measure zero when viewed from the wandering domain.},
