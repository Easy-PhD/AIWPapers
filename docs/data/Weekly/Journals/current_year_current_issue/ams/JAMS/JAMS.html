  abstract     = {Building on To√´n‚Äôs work on affine stacks, we develop a certain homotopy theory for schemes, which we call ‚Äúunipotent homotopy theory.‚Äù Over a field of characteristic $p>0$, we prove that the unipotent homotopy group schemes $\pi _i^{\mathrm {U}}(\,\cdot \,)$ introduced in our paper recover the unipotent Nori fundamental group scheme (see M. V. Nori [Compositio Math. 33 (1976), pp. 29‚Äì41]), the $p$-adic √©tale homotopy groups (see M. Artin and B. Mazur [ Etale homotopy , Springer-Verlag, Berlin-New York, 1969]), as well as certain formal groups introduced by Artin and Mazur [Ann. Sci. √âcole Norm. Sup. (4) 10 (1977), pp. 87‚Äì131]. We prove a version of the classical Freudenthal suspension theorem as well as a profiniteness theorem for unipotent homotopy group schemes. We also introduce the notion of a formal sphere and use it to show that for Calabi‚ÄìYau varieties of dimension $n$, the group schemes $\pi _i^{\mathrm {U}}(\,\cdot \,)$ are derived invariants for all $i \ge 0$; the case $i=n$ is related to recent work of Antieau and Bragg [Algebr. Geom. 9 (2022), pp. 364‚Äì399] involving topological Hochschild homology. Using the unipotent homotopy group schemes, we establish a correspondence between formal Lie groups and certain higher algebraic structures.},

  abstract     = {Sen‚Äôs theorem on the ramification of a $p$-adic analytic Galois extension of $p$-adic local fields shows that its perfectoidness is equivalent to the non-vanishing of its arithmetic Sen operator. By developing $p$-adic Hodge theory for general valuation rings, we establish a geometric analogue of Sen‚Äôs criterion for any $p$-adic analytic Galois extension of $p$-adic varieties: its (Riemann-Zariski) stalkwise perfectoidness is necessary for the non-vanishing of the geometric Sen operators. As the latter is verified for general Shimura varieties by Pan and Rodr√≠guez Camargo, we obtain the perfectoidness of every completed stalk of general Shimura varieties at infinite level at $p$. As an application, we prove that the integral completed cohomology groups vanish in higher degrees, verifying a conjecture of Calegari-Emerton for general Shimura varieties.},

As a consequence, we show that for every odd prime $p$, every integer $n\geq 3$, and every field $F$ containing a primitive $p$-th root of unity, there exists a continuous $n$-dimensional mod $p$ representation of the absolute Galois group of $F(x_1,\dots ,x_p)$ which does not lift modulo $p^2$. This answers a question of Khare and Serre, and disproves a conjecture of Florence.},

  abstract     = {In this paper and its sequel, we develop a technique for finding the distribution of $\ell ^{\infty }$-Selmer groups in degree $\ell$ twist families of Galois modules over number fields. Given an elliptic curve $E$ over a number field satisfying certain technical conditions, this technique can be used to show that $100%$ of the quadratic twists of $E$ have rank at most $1$. Given a prime $\ell$ and a number field $F$ not containing $\mu _{2\ell }$, this method also shows that the $\ell ^{\infty }$-class groups in the family of degree $\ell$ cyclic extensions of $F$ have a distribution consistent with the Cohen‚ÄìLenstra‚ÄìGerth heuristics. For this work, we develop the theory of the fixed point Selmer group, which serves as the base layer of the $\ell ^{\infty }$-Selmer group. This first paper gives a technique for finding the distribution of $\ell ^{\infty }$-Selmer groups in certain families of twists where the fixed point Selmer group is stable. In the sequel paper, we will give a technique for controlling fixed point Selmer groups.},
