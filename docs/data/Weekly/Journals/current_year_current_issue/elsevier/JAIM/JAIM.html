  abstract     = {We prove that Real topological Hochschild homology can be characterized as the norm from the cyclic group of order 2 to the orthogonal group O ( 2 ) . From this perspective, we then prove a multiplicative double coset formula for the restriction of this norm to dihedral groups of order 2 m . This informs our new definition of Real Hochschild homology of rings with anti-involution, which we show is the algebraic analogue of Real topological Hochschild homology. Using extra structure on Real Hochschild homology, we define a new theory of p -typical Witt vectors of rings with anti-involution. We end with an explicit computation of the degree zero D 2 m -Mackey functor homotopy groups of THR ( Z _ ) for m odd. This uses a Tambara reciprocity formula for sums for general finite groups, which may be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the 1920's seminal work of Major MacMahon, Amdeberhan–Andrews–Tauraso recently introduced an infinite family of q -series U t ( a ; q ) : = ∑ 1 ≤ n 1 < n 2 < ⋯ < n t q n 1 + n 2 + ⋯ + n t ( 1 + a q n 1 + q 2 n 1 ) ( 1 + a q n 2 + q 2 n 2 ) ⋯ ( 1 + a q n t + q 2 n t ) and proved that these functions are linear combinations of quasimodular forms. In this paper, we study a broader family of q -series that contains the collection { U t } t ∈ N . Using the theory of quasi shuffle algebras, we show that this extended family also lies in the algebra of quasimodular forms. Moreover, we determine the precise weights and levels of these functions, thereby making Amdeberhan–Andrews–Tauraso's result sharp. We further investigate the limiting behavior of these functions. In particular, we demonstrate that the sequence of quasimodular forms { U t ( 1 ; q ) } t ∈ N gives an approximation for the ordinary partition function. We also establish infinitely many closed formulas for reciprocals of certain infinite products in terms of U t ( a ; q ) .},

At first, we prove that these entropies are well-defined for non-intersecting intervals. This is accomplished by an inequality of Alexander V. Sobolev. Then we compute this entropy using a trace formula for Wiener–Hopf operators by Harold Widom. For intersecting intervals, we discuss an extended entropy formula of Casini and Huerta and support this with a proof for polynomial test functions (instead of entropy).},

For the stationary discrete Schrödinger equation we deduce that, under a vanishing condition at infinity on the solution u , then u ≡ 0 . In order to obtain such results, we demonstrate suitable quantitative upper and lower estimates for the L 2 -norm of the solution within a spatial lattice ( h Z ) d . These estimates manifest an interpolation phenomenon between continuum and discrete scales, showing that close-to-continuum and purely discrete regimes are different in nature.},

We compare the structure of elements of Sp 2 ( A , σ ) with Manin matrices over general noncommutative rings; this naturally leads to a quantization Sp 2 ( A , σ ) q . In contrast to the usual definition of the quantum group as a deformation of the ring of matrix functions on SL 2 ( R ) , this quantization produces a group of matrices over a new noncommutative ring with involution. We finish the comparison by constructing a generalization of a Hopf algebra structure on the noncommutative ring of matrix functions of our quantum group. Finally, we use the noncommutative surface-type cluster algebras of Berenstein and Retakh to give a geometric interpretation of our Hopf algebra structure and to produce noncommutative generalizations of Markov numbers over many rings with involution including the complex numbers, dual numbers, matrix rings, and group rings.},

  abstract     = {By a pointed vertex operator algebra (VOA) we mean one whose modules are all simple currents (i.e. invertible), e.g. even positive definite lattice VOAs. This paper systematically explores the interplay between their orbifolds and tensor category theory. We begin by supplying an elementary proof of the Dijkgraaf–Witten conjecture, which predicts the representation theory of holomorphic VOA orbifolds. We then apply that argument more generally to the situation where the orbifold group G (a subgroup of the automorphism group of the VOA) fixes all VOA modules, and relate the result to recent work of Mason–Ng and Naidu. Here our results are complete. We then turn to the other extreme, where the automorphisms act fixed-point freely on the modules, and realize any possible finite nilpotent group as such a G . This affords a considerable generalization of the Tambara-Yamagami categories. We conclude by considering some hybrid actions. In this way we use tensor category theory to organize and generalize systematically several isolated examples and special cases scattered in the literature. Conversely, we show how VOA orbifolds can be used to construct broad classes of braided crossed fusion categories and modular tensor categories.},
