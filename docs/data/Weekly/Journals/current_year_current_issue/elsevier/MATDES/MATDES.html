  abstract     = {Selective Laser Melting (SLM) holds great promise for fabricating high-precision aluminum alloy components with complex geometries and lightweight structures. However, producing high-strength aluminum alloys with excellent mechanical properties remains hindered by poor printability and complex microstructural control. In this study, an Al-4.79 Mg-1.3Si-0.51Sc-0.27Zr-0.47Mn (wt.%) alloy was developed and processed via SLM. The SLM process-structure-property relationship of this alloy was investigated. Crack-free samples were achieved across a broad process window, indicating excellent crack resistance and adaptability. Good printability and high relative density over 99.5 % can be achieved at a laser power of 200-230 W and scanning speed of 1050 and 1150 mm/s, corresponding to a volumetric energy density (VED) of 60 J/mm 3 -73 J/mm 3 . The increase in the laser energy density promoted the formation of columnar grains and the widening of subgrain structures, and made the Mg 2 Si phase transformed from continuous to discontinuous morphology. The as-printed alloy exhibited 439 MPa tensile strength and 11.3 % elongation, attributed to grain refinement, reduced porosity, and the formation of the high dislocation density, 9R phase, and nanotwin. After aging, strength increased to 483 MPa and elongation decreased to 6.5 %. This study defines the process window and demonstrates a balance between high specific strength and cost efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In this study, an innovative three-dimensional Negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) chiral structure was designed based on a 2D staggered rib architecture. This design integrates horizontally oriented chiral alternating ribs and vertically oriented Z-shaped configurations. Two optimized architectures, namely the wave-optimized structure (W-NPR) and the node-enhanced structure (N-NPR), were proposed and compared with the original folded structure (F-NPR). Characterization analysis revealed that the N-NPR structure exhibited superior formability, making it suitable for Digital Light Processing (DLP) fabrication. A parametric study on the mechanical performance of the N-NPR structure demonstrated that an increased volume fraction enhances the mechanical properties at the expense of structural compliance. Uniaxial tensile testing along the XY-plane and Z-axis confirmed the anisotropic Young’s modulus. Experimental and finite element simulations further revealed anisotropic behavior and a unique two-stage rotation-torsion compressive deformation mechanism of N-NPR, which enables advanced mechanical designs by enhancing the degree of freedom for deformation mode conversion. This work proposes a novel method for designing 3D NPR structures and elucidates its mechanical deformation mechanism, enabling transformative advances in aerospace, personalized healthcare, and adaptive wearable technologies.},

The evolution of the microstructure, defects, and hardness was investigated using grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoindentation tests. The GIXRD results showed that diffraction peaks shifted towards lower 2θ values, indicating that lattice swelling was caused by irradiation-induced defects after irradiation at elevated temperatures. According to the TEM observations, the size of the dislocation loops remained nearly constant, while their number density decreased with an increase in irradiation temperature. The precipitation of Cr was not observed in the W-0.3Cr alloy after irradiation at 773 K. In contrast, it was significant in the samples irradiated at temperatures of 1073 and 1273 K, showing increases in both the size and number density of the precipitates. Irradiation hardening was observed in all samples, primarily attributed to the presence of dislocation loops. The hardness change was estimated with the dispersion barrier hardening model by taking into account the contributions of dislocation loops and Cr precipitates. The values evaluated with the model were significantly larger than those obtained with the nanoindentation tests. This difference was ascribed to the depletion of solute Cr atoms from the W matrix by precipitation.},

Thermodynamic calculations guided nitrogen adjustment in the shielding gas to control solidification and develop high-performance microstructures. Thermodynamic–kinetic modeling predicted nitrogen uptake from the arc plasma, enabling gas composition selection to promote a shift from δ-ferrite to γ-austenite as the primary solidification phase. Nitrogen content analysis and Scheil simulations confirmed a transition to austenite-first solidification at approximately 0.7 wt% nitrogen. Electron Backscatter Diffraction and optical microscopy revealed that nitrogen-enriched (HN) samples exhibited a continuous γ-austenitic matrix with finely dispersed δ-ferrite, whereas nitrogen-lean (LN) samples had a δ-ferritic matrix with isolated γ-austenite islands. HN samples showed greater grain orientation spread, indicating increased internal misorientation. Despite pronounced crystallographic texture, the HN samples demonstrated nearly isotropic tensile behavior along with enhanced yield strength, tensile strength, ∼11 % higher hardness, and improved elongation. These findings demonstrate that melt chemistry control via gas-phase alloying enables phase-engineered microstructures with superior mechanical performance without modifying the filler wire.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel strategy to overcome the limitations of solid resin prepregs (SRPs) − namely the inability to drape at room temperature and hindered gas evacuation during vacuum-bag-only (VBO) processing − by 3D-printing a regular, uncured solid epoxy resin (SR) pattern on a dry woven textile. The locally patterned resin distribution preserves dry textile regions, enabling room temperature drapeability and more robust VBO-processing due to improved gas evacuation. By adjusting pattern parameters such as element geometry and coverage, the draping behaviour can be controlled to adapt to a desired draping condition. In order to be able to design the right pattern for given draping conditions, the influence of these parameters on bending and shearing was studied. Manual draping showed that bending radii down to 4 mm were achievable, governed only by the element length in bending direction, while coverage had no significant effect. In contrast, picture-frame-tests showed that the shearing is mainly influenced by the coverage and that a maximal shearing angle of 30° can be achieved. These results show that the SRPs bending and shearing can be independently influenced through pattern design. The derived structure–drapeability relationships enable targeted design of SRPs for robust, autoclave-free composite manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {Silver (Ag) sputtering targets are crucial in electronic information materials, particularly with the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has further increased their demand. However, the extremely high reflectivity and poor laser absorption of pure Ag in the infrared range make it challenging to process using conventional laser-based Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems, limiting its wide application. In this study, a novel hatch spacing-to-scanning speed ratio ( h / v )-centered low-energy–density strategy was proposed to overcome this challenge and enable high-quality additive manufacturing of pure Ag. By optimizing the ( h / v ) value to 1.0E-04, we successfully fabricated dense, low-defect Ag sputtering targets without increasing energy input. The results demonstrated that this method significantly shortened the manufacturing cycle and produced high-performance Ag targets with refined grains (3–7 μm), high density (≥99.8 %), a smooth surface (Ra = 11.5 μm), and stable sputtering performance (sputtering rate = 31.8 nm/min). Furthermore, the hardness increased by 45.1 % compared to Ag targets prepared by traditional methods. This work offers a practical pathway for applying laser-based AM in the production of highly reflective metal sputtering targets, advancing their industrialization in thin-film electronics, while also contributing to the understanding of AM process–structure relationships in metallic materials.},

Enhancing OPD performance requires optimizing key layers such as the electron transport layer (ETL) using low-temperature processes to prevent thermal degradation. This study explores the use of low-temperature electron beam annealing (EBA) to improve the performance of Al-doped ZnO (AZO)-based ETLs. The impact of EBA irradiation time (1–8 min) on the structural, morphological, and electrical properties of AZO films was systematically analyzed. EBA effectively modulated oxygen vacancies and reduced surface roughness, lowering trap density and leakage current while enhancing charge transport. An OPD with an ETL treated by 8 min of EBA exhibited superior detectivity (2.22 × 10 13 Jones at 0 V) and significantly reduced leakage current compared to a device with conventionally annealed ETLs. Importantly, the low-temperature EBA process preserved the amorphous state of AZO, making it suitable for heat-sensitive and flexible substrates. These findings demonstrate that EBA is a powerful, scalable method for ETL optimization in OPDs and offers a pathway toward high-performance, energy-efficient, and flexible optoelectronic devices.},

NADES not only enhances the extraction efficiency but also preserves the structural integrity of the biopolymers.

By optimizing the NADES extraction conditions, high-purity chitin (98.58 %) and chitosan (98.69 %) were achieved, surpassing the purity levels achieved by traditional chemical methods. NADES-extracted chitosan exhibited a remarkable degree of deacetylation (DD) of up to 94.22 %, and a crystallinity index (CrI) of up to 61.77 %, highlighting its enhanced functionality for biomedical applications. Moreover, the NADES-derived biopolymers showed excellent biocompatibility with L929 fibroblast cells.

A sequence involving silane coupling prior to laser ablation was employed, enabling dual-mode enhancement of the interfacial geometric configuration and chemical bonding. Mechanical interlocking was ensured in laser-ablated zones, whereas the chemical bonding capacity in unablated regions was enhanced. The tensile–shear strength and cross-tension strength of the joints were measured at 32.6 MPa and 3.2 MPa, respectively. Detailed microstructural characterization revealed that mechanical interlocking occurred in the laser-ablated zones of the PA66 resin and that synergistic physicochemical reinforcement was achieved via covalent Al‒O‒Si bonds coupled with molecular chain entanglement/hydrogen bonding in unablated regions. Defect-free continuous interfacial transitions were confirmed through the penetration of nanolamellar structures by amorphous silane films.

We review the mechanistic basis of these technologies, their translational potential in overcoming the limitations of conventional therapies, and ocular-specific challenges such as optimizing bioavailability and intraocular target selectivity. Central to this discussion is the role of advanced linker engineering in achieving spatio-temporal control of degradation activity. While barriers to ocular biodistribution and sustained delivery remain, targeted protein degradation represents a paradigm shift in ophthalmology, offering durable therapeutic effects that could significantly improve clinical outcomes and patient compliance through reduced dosing frequency.},

  abstract     = {The regeneration of long-segment peripheral nerve defects remains a critical and challenging clinical problem. The key step in nerve regeneration involves the dedifferentiation of Schwann cells into a repair phenotype, followed by their orderly migration to form Büngner bands that guide axonal elongation. However, due to the lack of bioactive factors for stimulation, the repair of current nerve conduits is generally slow. In this study, we designed a bioactive glass microspheres-embedded nerve conduit. The ions released from these microspheres activate c-Jun to induce Schwann cell dedifferentiation. Meanwhile, the microspheres coated onto the conduit surface provide physical anchoring sites, which accelerate integrin- β 1-mediated Schwann cell adhesion and orderly migration to facilitate Büngner bands assembly. This study confirms that dual-function bioactive glass microspheres promote nerve regeneration through ion-regulated dedifferentiation and particle-anchored migration, offering a novel approach for the design of nerve conduits.},

This study explored the radio wave propagation, gamma-ray shielding efficiency, and electrical resistivity of alkali-activated blast furnace slag (BFS-AAM) compared to hydrated Portland cement (PC). BFS-AAM demonstrated superior relative permittivity (ε r ≈ 7.6 at 2.4 GHz) and loss tangent (∼0.33) at lower radio frequencies (0.02–10 GHz), leading to enhanced signal attenuation compared to PC (ε r ≈ 5.6, loss tangent ≈ 0.07). BFS-AAM showed similar performance to PC at frequencies between 10–20 GHz, while its characteristics below 10 GHz make it suitable for secure signal environments. In terahertz spectrum (0.2–2 THz), relevant for 6G wireless communication, both materials displayed comparable permittivity (∼5.3 and ∼4.2) and loss tangent (∼0.09 and ∼0.04), indicating compatibility with residential and commercial applications. Simulations at 0.7, 2.4, and 6.0 GHz confirmed higher signal attenuation by BFS-AAM. Additionally, BFS-AAM exhibited higher resistivity (26–110 Ω·m), greater compressive strength (60 MPa), and lower porosity (∼11 %), contributing to its favorable dielectric properties. Although BFS-AAM demonstrated slightly lower gamma-ray shielding efficiency (at 0.661 MeV) than PC, its multifunctional properties position it as promising material for advanced electromagnetic and radiation shielding technologies.},

Results show that γ′ phases exhibit spherical, cubic, or lath-like morphologies, and their average size increases from ∼ 180  nm to ∼ 450  nm after thermal exposure; and superalloys with higher volume fraction of γ′ phase gradually precipitate topologically close-packed (TCP) phase. The compressive properties display pronounced anisotropy, governed by both microstructure and loading direction. For superalloys with lower volume fraction of γ′ phase, yield strength decreases from 670  MPa to 505 MPa and ultimate compressive strength from 4690  MPa to 4240 MPa as the γ′ phase coarsens. In contrast, for superalloys with higher volume fraction of γ′ phase, ultimate compressive strength initially decreases and then increases, accompanied by rise in failure strain from 22 % to 46 % after thermal exposure. With increasing loading angle, ultimate compressive strength initially decreases and then rises, whereas yield strength, failure strain and hardening modulus exhibit more complex trends. These variations are closely related to γ′ and TCP phase, and microstructure and loading direction collectively affect mechanical behavior.},

  abstract     = {Processing Cu-Zn alloys (brass) using fusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) techniques presents significant challenges due to volatile elements and the inherently high thermal conductivity of these alloys. Addressing these issues often demands increased energy input, modifications to laser systems, and compositional adjustments to mitigate zinc loss. However, such solutions are complex and remain in the early stages of development. In contrast, Additive friction stir deposition (AFSD), a solid-state AM technique, offers a promising alternative to overcome these limitations. This study represents a pioneering effort to deposit dual-phase brass (Cu-40Zn) using a closed-loop temperature-controlled AFSD. The influence of processing temperature (ranging from 0.38 to 0.61 T p /T m ) on microstructural evolution and mechanical performance was systematically investigated along the build and longitudinal direction. The resulting microstructure was predominantly governed by dynamic recrystallization and post-dynamic recrystallization (P-DRX) due to repeated thermal cycles. The as-deposited brass exhibited a balanced strength-ductility combination, with yield strength ranging from 215 to 437 MPa and elongation from 34 % to 67 %. Tensile properties in longitudinal and build directions revealed that grain boundary strengthening was the primary mechanism for improving the mechanical performance. The as-deposited properties were comparable to those of wrought counterparts, thus highlighting the potential of AFSD for fabricating high-performance brass components.},

Creep viscoelastic behavior is activated at higher temperatures due to complicated interactive coordination between grain interiors and grain boundaries. This study investigated the tensile creep behaviors at different generations of SiC fibers under conditions of various stress and temperatures. The creep recovery behaviors after unloading exhibits the viscoelastic nature, which comes from the possible motion of amorphous phase near massive grain boundaries. It is driven by the release of elastic energy of the grain boundary, evidenced by frequency shifts in Raman spectroscopy. Then classical diffusion creep theory is modified to a viscoelastic model incorporating physical parameters such as the elasticity, viscosity, and threshold stress for SiC fibers. The proposed equations have been well supported by creep test results. The viscosity and elasticity parameters decrease with increasing temperature, the latter being more sensitive. 3rd generation fiber exhibits higher viscosity and elasticity, explaining better creep resistance. The model can evaluate the elastic and plastic contributions and predict creep results at higher temperatures. This work helps to understand high-temperature SiC fiber creep, and to guide optimizing fiber-reinforced composites.},

Ultrasonic temperature sensors (UTS) are widely used in high-temperature sensing due to their extreme operating temperature close to the melting point of the waveguide materials. In this work, YAG single-crystal fibers (SCF) with spatially distributed acoustic reflection microstructures have been successfully fabricated via the laser-heated pedestal growth (LHPG) method and employed as acoustic waveguides. Herein, anisotropic acoustic waveguide behaviors were revealed in YAG SCF, where the [110]-oriented YAG SCF demonstrates enhanced unit sensitivity with the S-wave polarization direction of [ 1 1 ¯ 0 ], primarily attributed to the lower acoustic velocity and the more substantial velocity variations with temperature. Furthermore, quasi-distributed ultrasonic temperature sensing in the range of 30-1800℃ has been achieved based on the [110]-oriented YAG SCF with two discrete sensing units, reaching the maximum unit sensitivities of 47.18 ns·℃ -1 ·m - 1 and an optimal temperature resolution of 5.04℃ at 1800℃. Superior acoustic waveguide characteristics, a wide working temperature range, and the positive temperature-dependent sensor performance suggest that the [110]-oriented microstructured YAG SCF is an ideal candidate for distributed high-temperature sensing in harsh environments.},

In recrystallization–controlled regime of TMCP, successive rolling passes facilitate microstructural refinement through dynamic and static restoration mechanisms. This work illustrates static recrystallization (SRX) characteristics and kinetics in three ASS alloys designed by varying N, Mn and Nb contents. Interrupted (double–hit) compression tests were conducted to characterize the flow behaviour and microstructural evolution across different deformation conditions. SRX kinetics were formulated using a fractional–softening framework, where the time to 50 % recrystallization was correlated with strain, strain rate, temperature, and initial grain size. While the exponents of strain (−3.1) and strain rate (−0.3) were consistent across all compositions, the apparent activation energies of SRX varied in the range 251.5–298 kJ·mol −1 , with 7 wt% Mn showing a more noticeable effect in comparison with 0.1 wt% Nb. Detailed metallographic analysis confirmed the accuracy of the derived models. Suitable semi-empirical relations were established enabling prediction of statically recrystallised grain size across various processing conditions. These results define the processing windows needed to design TMCP schedules for advanced ASSs for LH 2 and cryogenic environments.},

Moreover, a dataset to train a Convolutional Neural Network for monitor healing over time was developed. As proof of concept, this algorithm was tested on a cancer cell line stimulated by TGF-β, a drug stimulating cell migration.

This study systematically investigates a strategy to enhance thermal transport properties by engineering the interlayer bonding via platinum atomic layer deposition (Pt-ALD) and compares it with conventional high-temperature annealing (1873 K). The Pt-ALD-modified graphene aerogel (GA-ALD) exhibited a 199 % increase in thermal conductivity, significantly surpassing the 113 % enhancement from heat treatment. SEM, Raman, XRD, XPS, and FTIR data explicitly indicate that Pt-ALD forms covalent Pt O C bonds that bridge adjacent graphene layers while preserving the original porous morphology. Owing to the synergistic effect of enhanced solid-phase thermal conductivity and efficient convective heat transfer through the preserved porous structure, the GA-ALD sample achieved a total thermal resistance comparable to that of an equal-sized aluminum heat sink under identical forced-convection conditions, while weighing only ∼12 % of its aluminum counterpart. Moreover, cyclic compressive tests confirmed GA-ALD durability, retaining 99.5 % height and 94.7 % stress after 1000 cycles.

We introduce a category of high strength, defect-resistant octonary CoNi-based high entropy superalloy (CoNi-HESA), comprising roughly equal parts of Co and Ni, along with Cr, Al, V, Ti, Ta, and W. This alloy exhibits as-printed tensile strength exceeding 1 GPa and tensile ductility exceeding 30 % at room temperature. Furthermore, compression tests demonstrate that the as-printed parts maintain a yield strength of about 1 GPa at room temperature up to 700 °C, which decreases to 0.9 GPa and 0.7 GPa as the test temperature reaches 800 °C and 900 °C, respectively. With a careful combination of laser powder and scan speed, the developed HESA is well-suited for crack-resistant, high-density component production through L-PBF. Alloy design principles are elucidated through CALPHAD calculations based on the high entropy alloy (HEA) database, including the structure and properties of L-PBF processed CoNi-HESA.},

  abstract     = {Strengthening in refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) can be achieved through the formation of “compositional heterogeneity” at the atomic scale. Here, we chose Zr 45 Ti 15 Nb 20 Ta 20 alloy with a single-phase body-centered cubic (BCC) structure as a matrix and added a small amount of Al to promote a unique spinodal decomposition. The results show that the introduction of Al-X negative mixing enthalpy induces the RHEAs spinodal decomposition to form a nanocubic structure in the form of a basket-like fabric morphology with a characteristic periodicity of 12 nm. Nanocubic structures consist of (Nb, Ta)-rich cubes and Zr-rich channels as well as generate strong localized strain fields at the interfaces. Spinodal decomposition strengthening enables the as-cast RHEA to achieve a yield strength of 1405 MPa. Periodically distributed nanostructures make dislocations move slowly, causing plugging and cross-slip, facilitating dislocation interactions, multiplication, and accumulation. In summary, the chemical heterostructure produced by spinodal decomposition has been remarkably effective in improving the strength of RHEAs.},

  abstract     = {Eutectic high-entropy alloys (EHEAs) have attracted considerable interest due to their superior multifunctional performance. However, the inherent tendency of stress concentration at irregular phase boundaries frequently leads to premature fracture. This study presents a facile hot-rolling strategy to achieve synergistic strength-ductility enhancement in AlCoCrFeNi 2.1 EHEA via constructing a hierarchical hetero-lamellar structure (HHLS). Through controlled per-pass rolling reduction (PPRD), we induce strain-partitioning-mediated microstructural refinement in the hot-rolled EHEA and activate synergistic deformation mechanisms including stacking faults, Lomer-Cottrell locks, and deformation twinning. The resultant HHLS (aligned FCC/B2 lamellae, partially recrystallized FCC regions, and intragranular B2 precipitates) triggers pronounced hetero-deformation-induced (HDI) strengthening. Consequently, the EHEA with HHLS exhibits exceptional properties: yield strength of 1202 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 1489 MPa, and uniform elongation of 11.5 %, which are 112 %, 45 %, and 6 % higher than those of the as-cast alloy, respectively. The superior properties originate from HDI effect and FCC phase-mediated deformation mechanisms, which enable the EHEA to maintain exceptional work-hardening rate despite high dislocation density, effectively delaying plastic instability. These findings not only establish a readily implementable thermomechanical processing strategy for EHEAs, but also provide a novel paradigm for improving mechanical properties, paving the way for their application in high-performance structural materials.},

Current strategies rely on bone grafts with antibiotics, but prolonged use promotes resistance. Here, we developed a 3D-printed magnesium peroxide (MgO 2 )–doped calcium phosphate silicate (CSP) scaffold to address both structural and antibacterial demands. The MgO 2 –CSP scaffold exhibited cancellous bone-like strength (∼7.95 MPa) and an interconnected macroporous structure conducive to cell migration and healing. In vitro , the 14 wt% MgO 2 scaffold (B14M) inhibited 80.4 % of Gram-negative bacteria and 74.6 % of MRSA via Mg 2+ and H 2 O 2 release, while both B0M (no MgO 2 ) and B14M promoted BMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. In vivo , the B14M scaffold markedly enhanced bone regeneration in rat tibial defects, achieving a BV/TV of ∼73.09 % versus ∼29.84 % for B0M at 8 weeks. These findings highlight MgO 2 –CSP scaffolds as a promising strategy to promote osteogenesis while combating MRSA-associated infections in RTKA.},

This study provides insights into how different ball milling techniques and elemental compositions used in Ti 3 AlC 2 MAX phase synthesis affect the O incorporation into the lattice structure, which directly impacts the MAX phases’ and the resulting MXenes’ thermal stability. The unit cell lattice parameters (LPs) of a MAX phase are well-established indicators in determining the degree of O substitution. The presence of O reduced the a and c LPs of the MAX phase unit cell. However, the corresponding MXenes exhibited similar a LP ( a = 3.05 Å) values regardless of the LP values of their MAX phases. The LP observations are validated by correlative thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) carried out in air atmosphere. With the decreasing O incorporation in the MAX phase, an increase in the oxidation temperature was observed from 450 °C to 780 °C. However, the corresponding MXenes showed an average oxidation onset around 460 °C.

Current research is hindered by the lack of robust physiological models to evaluate the mechanical interactions between catheter materials and urethral tissue during intermittent catheterisation. This study introduces the first ex vivo porcine urethral model to investigate tribological performance and material-tissue interactions during intermittent catheter (IC) use, enabling more informed catheter design. We examined four commercial hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated ICs and a coating-free integrated amphiphilic surfactant (IAS) IC. ICs were inserted into porcine urethras using a texture analyser, held for two minutes, and withdrawn while measuring force and work done. Post-catheterisation, urethras were examined for microtrauma. Three of four PVP-coated catheters required significantly greater withdrawal force compared to the IAS catheter, correlating with increased urethral transitional membrane damage post-catheterisation. Ex vivo findings suggest that IAS catheters may lower the risk of complications compared with PVP-coated catheters in intermittent catheterisation. This study provides a new platform for comprehensive evaluation of IC-tissue interactions. It underscores the importance of tribological design in medical devices, aiding future innovation in device design and ultimately improve the QOL of patients undergoing intermittent catheterisation.},

  abstract     = {Gradient-index (GRIN) phononic crystals (PnCs) enable energy harvesting (EH) by focusing elastic waves into electrical energy. Efficient EH requires maximizing focused wave intensity, typically achieved by tuning the GRIN PnCs unit-cell shape. However, existing designs often exhibit energy concentration near the GRIN lens boundary and incorporate narrow gaps and sharp corners, making them susceptible to manufacturing errors and limiting their practical applicability. Understanding the potential performance changes caused by manufacturing errors is important because geometrical alterations can compromise wave-focusing performance. Therefore, this study aims to optimize the unit-cell shape toward maximum focused intensity at the desired locations for EH devices. To assess manufacturability, the effects of minor geometric variations on the focal position and focused intensity are evaluated via a sensitivity analysis. The optimal shape is derived using a deep neural network (DNN) surrogate model trained to predict focal position and focused intensity. This model accelerates a genetic algorithm (GA) used to perform the optimization. Our optimized designs exhibit 1.5 to 2.0 times higher focused intensity across the target focal positions compared with the conventional design. Thus, these optimal shapes, along with their sensitivity analysis results, provide practical guidelines for defining manufacturing tolerances and achieving consistent, efficient EH performance.},

Here, we explored how to efficiently utilize interstitial oxygen to enhance the mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V. The copper oxide (CuO) was innovatively employed as a precursor to completely dissolve into Ti6Al4V matrix, interstitial O and substitutional Cu atoms were simultaneously utilized to strengthen the primary α-phase (α p ) while inducing the abundant secondary-α (α s ) nanoprecipitates. Surprisingly, the introduction of Cu element facilitated control of lattice distortion and redistributed oxygen between α p and β-transformed (β trans ) structure, resulting in the Ti6Al4V-2.5CuO (wt.%) alloy with high oxygen tolerance (0.62 wt%) and an ultra-high ultimate strength of ∼ 1635 MPa and a favorable ductility of ∼ 5.3 %.

Since fundamental mechanics is well-known, a miniaturized notched bending specimen geometry incorporating a pore was selected to investigate the application potential for parts manufactured via multi-photon lithography. The size regime is representative of the smallest available objects and requires in situ SEM testing, which was completed with finite element modeling based on crack path prediction through analyzing the local crack driving force. The high dimensional repeatability of the process allowed for testing reliably reproduced specimens with variation of crack to pore distance only. The prediction represented the actual crack paths well, underlining successfully facilitated crack path alteration. The toughness was mainly increased by crack trapping within the pore, where deflection had a quantitatively negligible effect.},

Herein, we developed a biomaterial-based acupoint activation strategy for pain management. Adhesive polydopamine-coated hydrogel microspheres were fabricated using microfluidic techniques for accurate attachment and activation of acupoints. Adhesive hydrogel microspheres loaded with adenosine can slowly release exogenous adenosine at the ST36 acupoint to simulate the analgesic effect of acupuncture. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that single-dose administration of adhesive microspheres can effectively target acupoints, elevate mechanical pain thresholds, and provide systemic anti-inflammatory effects for up to 7 days.

By depositing material only where it's needed, it drastically reduces waste material and energy use, obtaining a sustainability advantage that is further enhanced on larger scale. However, a deeper understanding of material recycling is critical to achieving the next milestone in sustainability. In this work, a methodology was proposed that uses both molds and final parts, manufactured in acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene reinforced with short glass fibers (ABS-GF), which had reached the end of their useful life to be used as feedstock. It is observed that recycling reduces fiber length by 47.3%, which directly impacts the mechanical properties in the longitudinal printing direction, resulting in around a 9% decrease in maximum tensile stress. However, this reduction falls to 5.1% in the transverse direction to the printing, and in some cases, the recycled material even surpasses the virgin material due to improved interlayer adhesion. An analysis on the adhesion reveals that the shorter monomer chains obtained during recycling allow better interlacing between layers. These results suggest that the reuse of the molds is viable and by adjusting the printing parameters we can obtain properties suitable for demanding applications.},

This paper addresses both characteristics in the design process of cellular material architectures by expanding upon the Nozzle Constrained Topology Optimization algorithm and experimentally validating the results against a typical baseline. An experimental method of deriving bond region material properties is detailed. A direct toolpath generation method from topology optimized results is proposed. Comparisons are made with conventional topology optimization design methods and performance is measured both experimentally and numerically against theoretical bounds. At relative densities ≤ 70 % , designs with nozzle constraints were able to more closely align numerical and experimental results for both performance and design fidelity (measured by relative density). In contrast, conventional topology optimized designs had higher overall performance, but little alignment between intended design and resultant experimental result.

An integrated predictive framework combines classical plate theory for initial deformation estimates, explicit dynamic finite element simulations for elastic-plastic analysis, and Kriging-based response surface modeling to map geometric, material, and process parameters to performance metrics. A large-scale simulation campaign across eight isotropic material models and 42,669 configurations identifies the arch rise-to-radius ratio as the dominant factor in post-forming thickness evolution, with non-uniform profiles causing up to deviations in rupture pressures and altering failure modes compared to uniform assumptions. Modal, buckling, and rupture analyses highlight significant impacts on natural frequencies, critical loads, and mechanisms. Experimental validation on 36 Monel Alloy 400 rupture discs achieves high accuracy, with thickness root-mean-square error of (maximum mean absolute percentage error ) and rupture pressure errors below , supported by uncertainty analysis (expanded uncertainties at confidence). The generalizable framework, extensible to non-metallic isotropic shells and non-arched geometries, enables enhanced prediction, optimization, and reliability by linking forming outcomes to structural integrity.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical anodization creates titania nanopores (TNPs) on Ti implants with distinctive micro-nano geometries to enhance their surface bioactivity, showing the potential to improve soft-tissue integration at varied transmucosal regions. However, understanding how topography regulates TNP dimensions under voltage, and the clinical feasibility of diverse TNP geometries was limited. More crucially, existing research predominantly focused on nanopore diameter, neglecting other geometric characteristics (alignment, texture/roughness) on soft-tissue cells that impeded optimized TNPs design for ideal soft-tissue integration. This study showed nanopore dimensions were voltage-dependent on micro-patterned Ti but remain stable on smooth counterparts. Varied TNPs with similar diameters but different alignment/roughness were selected and identified with similar chemistry/hydrophilicity, but their protein adhesion and stability were length-dependent, showing their feasibility as implant devices. Finally, human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and HaCaT epithelial cells functions on varied selected TNPs reflected that nanopores inherently promoted cell responses, but hybrid microgroove-nanopores dramatically enhanced HGF’s collagen and fibronectin secretion, while irregular textured nanopores significantly improved HaCaT adhesion. By addressing the gaps in understanding topographical regulation and the influence of overlooked geometric features beyond diameter, this work advances spatially optimized implant designs for improved epithelial sealing and connective tissue integration at different transmucosal zones for improved implant health.},

  abstract     = {Metal-based Directed Energy Deposition (DED) is considered one of the variations of additive manufacturing with the highest potential, particularly for space industry and in-orbital manufacturing. The technology however still faces various challenges, many of which can be traced back to poor control and understanding of the powder delivery. Velocity distribution of powder particles at the DED nozzle outlet has a key influence on the results of any predictive model of powder stream and yet remains largely disputed. Certain numerical studies highlighted a possible influence of powder particle size on the velocity condition at the nozzle exit, yet no experimental studies confirmed this effect. The experimental campaign described in this paper quantifies this relation between powder particle size and velocity distribution at the nozzle outlet and a strong decrease of particle speed with particle size is observed. Moreover, smaller particles are observed to travel at speeds higher than the mean carrier gas speed suggesting powder particle segregation within the nozzle as one of the mechanisms driving speed differences at the nozzle outlet.},

  abstract     = {Pressurized gyration allows the scaled-up production of polymeric fibre under the simultaneous application of pressure and rotation. This study investigates the influence of orifice design on fibre formation and production rate in pressurized gyration, aiming to optimize the technique for industrial-scale applications. Transparent vessels with varying orifice heights (7.5 mm, 15 mm, and 22.5 mm), orifice numbers (24 and 48), and dual-level orifice distributions were fabricated and tested under pressures of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 MPa. Morphological analysis showed that fibre diameter decreased from 2.2 µm to 1.8 µm when pressure was raised from 0.1 to 0.3 MPa when increasing the number of orifices to 48. Two-level orifice designs yielded mixed diameter distributions, enabling tunable fibre architectures. High-speed imaging revealed that the 7.5 mm orifice height achieved fluid ejection 7.5 % faster than 22.5 mm at 0.1 MPa and increasing pressure from 0.1 to 0.2 MPa reduced ejection time by up to 33 %. Production rate increased with more orifices (48 compared to 24), by 9.8 % at 0.2 MPa, and declined at higher pressure for vessels with dual-level designs. Overall, the findings provide quantitative insights into how vessel geometry influences fibre morphology and throughput in pressurized gyration systems.},
