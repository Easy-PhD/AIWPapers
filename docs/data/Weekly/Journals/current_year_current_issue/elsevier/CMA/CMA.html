  abstract     = {In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) time-fractional mobile/immobile (MIM) transport equation, which incorporates the Caputo time-fractional derivative of order α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , is taken into consideration. The space derivatives are discretized using the compact finite difference approximation, and the Caputo time-fractional derivative is estimated by employing the averaged L1 formula. Combining with corresponding alternating direction implicit (ADI) algorithms, the overall computational cost is reduced significantly. Using the discrete energy analysis methodology, we demonstrate that the suggested method possesses temporal second-order convergence and spatial fourth-order convergence under the regularity assumption. Numerical experiments demonstrate that ADI techniques is effective in computing 3D problems.},

  abstract     = {We study an American option pricing problem with liquidity risks and transaction fees. As endogenous transaction costs, liquidity risks of the underlying asset are modeled by a mean-reverting process. Transaction fees are exogenous transaction costs and are assumed to be proportional to the trading amount, with the long-run liquidity level depending on the proportional transaction costs rate. Two nonlinear partial differential equations are established to characterize the option values for the holder and the writer, respectively. To illustrate the impact of these transaction costs on option prices and optimal exercise prices, we apply the alternating direction implicit method to solve the linear complementarity problem numerically. Finally, we conduct model calibration from market data via maximum likelihood estimation, and find that our model incorporating liquidity risks outperforms the Leland model significantly.},

The proposed model bifurcates into a system of elliptic and hyperbolic equations depending on waveguide parameters. The proposed model leads to a stable first-order system of equations, distinguishing itself from the canonical nonlinear Schrödinger equation. We have employed the space-time discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin finite element method to discretize the first-order system of equations. We present a stability analysis for both the elliptic and hyperbolic systems of equations and demonstrate the stability of the proposed model through several numerical examples on space-time meshes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose and analyze an efficient, linearized, fully discrete scheme for the nonlinear, strongly damped Klein-Gordon equation on polygonal meshes. The numerical scheme uses a conforming virtual element method for spatial discretization and a modified leapfrog (central finite difference) scheme for time discretization, with the nonlinear term | u | p − 1 u is treated semi-implicitly. We first prove that the proposed scheme is energy dissipative in the sense of discrete energy, and then the stability of the numerical solution in the H 1 -norm is established using mathematical induction, which plays an important role in handling the nonlinear term. By applying the boundedness of the numerical solution and the Sobolev embedding inequality, we derive the optimal H 1 error estimate of order O ( h k + τ 2 ) without imposing any ratio restrictions between the time step τ and the mesh size h . Additionally, we remark that the leapfrog virtual element scheme can be applied to some more complex nonlinear damped wave equations. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to confirm the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Many multiphysics processes of fluid-solid interaction within a porous medium can be described by the Biot-Brinkman model to account for the effects of viscosity in fluid flow. By introducing the auxiliary variables, we can transform the original problem into two generalized Stokes equations. The generalized Stokes equations incorporate a built-in mechanism to circumvent the Poisson locking for the continuous Galerkin method. Subsequently, we establish an energy law and provide a priori estimates for the reformulated problem. Well-posedness is demonstrated using the standard Galerkin method in conjunction with a compactness argument. After that, we develop stable mixed finite element algorithms for the reformulated problem. Influenced by Lamé constant λ , we design three finite element pairs for the proposed algorithms and present the corresponding error estimates. Numerical tests are conducted to validate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Weather derivatives are financial tools that use a weather index as the underlying asset to provide protection against non-catastrophic weather events. In this article, we propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach for pricing weather derivatives associated with two standard processes: the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with jump-diffusions. PINNs are a scientific machine learning method specifically designed to address problems related to partial differential equations (PDEs). To apply the PINN technique for jump-diffusion, we convert the partial integro-differential equation into a PDE using integral discretization. We randomly select training data points within the domain and utilize the transformed PDE along with the initial and boundary conditions to construct the loss function. For the neurons in the hidden layer, we employ the hyperbolic tangent function (tanh) as the activation function. The weights of the network connection are optimized using the L-BFGS algorithm. We will conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed technique. Additionally, we compare our method with conventional numerical approaches to show that our technique serves as an effective alternative to existing pricing methods for weather derivatives. Finally, we will examine a real-world case study where the model's parameters are determined using precipitation data.},
