  abstract     = {By using the L 2 gradient flow method, we derive a phase-field model for tumor growth from the free energy. The scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method is employed to handle the nonlinear energy potential. Based on the second-order backward differentiation formula (BDF2) and the finite element method, we construct an unconditionally stable, linear, and decoupled fully discrete numerical scheme. We rigorously prove the unconditional energy stability of the proposed scheme and the optimal L 2 -norm error estimates for Ï• and c . Numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical results and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and the scheme.},

  abstract     = {Space two dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations are directly changed into the Hamiltonian system with infinite dimensional space by the variational formula, which can be discretized into finite dimensional Hamiltonian system by Fourier pseudo-spectral method. The average vector field formulas with second and fourth order accuracy in time are utilized to compute the finite dimensional Hamiltonian system. In order to improve computation velocity of these formulas, the fast computation algorithm of these formulas is proposed by decomposing the spectral matrix. Solitary wave evolution of the equations is analyzed with different initial conditions by these new computational formulas. Energy invariant property, accuracy and computation efficiently of these new formulas are also investigated.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel fundamental solution neural networks method (FSNNs) to solve inverse Cauchy problems, which combines the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) with the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To optimize the distribution of source points, the method starts by partitioning the interval into equal segments, determined by the number of the source points. The coordinate system is situated at the center of the computational domain. The resulting angles as network inputs for the FSNNs and the intermediate variable as outputs, which is subsequently substituted into a length function to obtain the final length. The coordinates of the source points are then determined, and the MFS is employed to approximate the numerical solutions. The loss function is formulated based on the boundary conditions on the accessible boundary, and the training is employed to optimize the network parameters in the FSNNs and source point intensities in the MFS. The introduction of the PINNs overcomes the challenge of source point selection in the MFS and effectively addresses the ill-posedness of inverse problems. In summary, the proposed scheme is a machine learning-based semi-analytical meshless method which is simple, accurate and easily implemented, making it highly suitable for the numerical solution of inverse problems. Four numerical experiments, including the Laplace and biharmonic equations, validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed FSNNs.},
