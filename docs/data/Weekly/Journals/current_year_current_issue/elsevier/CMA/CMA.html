  abstract     = {In this study, we propose a new data-driven algorithm for the Perona-Malik image despeckling problem. The advantage of the proposed algorithm over neural network-based methods is that it does not need any noisy and clean image data pair for training. The proposed algorithm is implemented using a three-dimensional convolution neural network (ConvNet) architecture. We compare its output with results obtained from several existing methods, including the operator splitting RBF collocation method, the finite difference method (FDM), and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, simulations are carried out using grayscale images that have been artificially corrupted with different levels of speckle noise. Using the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) as the evaluation metric, we observed that the proposed algorithm outperforms these existing methods, demonstrating superior image quality with the same numerical scheme and the same discretization. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of physics-inspired convolutional neural network for PDE-based image despeckling model.},

The model is formulated by four coupled partial differential equations, which represent the evolution of tumor growth, the density of cancer cell sub-populations arising from mutations, the density of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and the concentration of matrix-degrading enzymes (MDE). A semi-implicit backward Euler finite element framework has been developed for this model. Unconditional error estimates have been established for all variables, and the unconditional stability of the solutions has also been demonstrated.

  abstract     = {Approximating the solution of stiff differential equations, which exhibit abrupt changes in certain regions, using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is challenging. Typically, training PINNs involves using a larger number of samples concentrated around regions of rapid changes to resolve the sharp gradients. However, this strategy leads to data imbalance, resulting in slower convergence and reduced solution quality. Here, we propose Re-spacing layer (RS-layer) to mitigate these challenges. RS-layer is a pre-trained encoding layer designed to map the skewed distribution of sampling points onto a uniform distribution, maintaining the desirable statistical properties of the input data for effective PINN training. We demonstrate that RS-layer improves PINN training by regularizing the solution gradient in the transformed space. The efficacy of our method is validated through numerical experiments on one-dimensional singularly perturbed equations, the ROBER problem, and the Akzo Nobel problem. Our results show that RS-layer not only accelerates convergence, but also enhances accuracy.},

Furthermore, for solutions exhibiting weak singularities in time, exponential convergence in terms of the total number of temporal degrees of freedom is proven using the hp -refinement strategy.

The problem involves determining the shape and location of the unknown source's geometrical support from boundary measurements of its associated potential. Firstly, we prove the uniqueness of the inverse problem. In the second phase, we propose a novel reconstruction method that utilizes the coupled complex boundary method (CCBM) to solve the identification problem. The main idea of this method is to approximate the overdetermined problem to a complex boundary value problem with a complex Robin boundary condition coupling the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Next, we utilize the imaginary part of the solution throughout the domain to construct a shape cost function, which we then minimize with respect to ball-shaped sources by using a Newton-type topological derivative method to reconstruct the geometrical support of the unknown source.},

The space derivatives are discretized using the compact finite difference approximation, and the Caputo time-fractional derivative is estimated by employing the averaged L1 formula. Combining with corresponding alternating direction implicit (ADI) algorithms, the overall computational cost is reduced significantly.

As endogenous transaction costs, liquidity risks of the underlying asset are modeled by a mean-reverting process. Transaction fees are exogenous transaction costs and are assumed to be proportional to the trading amount, with the long-run liquidity level depending on the proportional transaction costs rate. Two nonlinear partial differential equations are established to characterize the option values for the holder and the writer, respectively. To illustrate the impact of these transaction costs on option prices and optimal exercise prices, we apply the alternating direction implicit method to solve the linear complementarity problem numerically. Finally, we conduct model calibration from market data via maximum likelihood estimation, and find that our model incorporating liquidity risks outperforms the Leland model significantly.},

We first prove that the proposed scheme is energy dissipative in the sense of discrete energy, and then the stability of the numerical solution in the H 1 -norm is established using mathematical induction, which plays an important role in handling the nonlinear term. By applying the boundedness of the numerical solution and the Sobolev embedding inequality, we derive the optimal H 1 error estimate of order O ( h k + τ 2 ) without imposing any ratio restrictions between the time step τ and the mesh size h . Additionally, we remark that the leapfrog virtual element scheme can be applied to some more complex nonlinear damped wave equations.

In this article, we propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach for pricing weather derivatives associated with two standard processes: the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with jump-diffusions. PINNs are a scientific machine learning method specifically designed to address problems related to partial differential equations (PDEs). To apply the PINN technique for jump-diffusion, we convert the partial integro-differential equation into a PDE using integral discretization. We randomly select training data points within the domain and utilize the transformed PDE along with the initial and boundary conditions to construct the loss function. For the neurons in the hidden layer, we employ the hyperbolic tangent function (tanh) as the activation function. The weights of the network connection are optimized using the L-BFGS algorithm. We will conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed technique. Additionally, we compare our method with conventional numerical approaches to show that our technique serves as an effective alternative to existing pricing methods for weather derivatives. Finally, we will examine a real-world case study where the model's parameters are determined using precipitation data.},
