  abstract     = {This paper establishes a sector stabilization criterion for a nonlinear flexible marine riser system that incorporates lateral and transverse coupling vibrations, derived from Hamilton’s principle. This criterion, grounded in the sector-bounded condition, encompasses a wide range of linear and nonlinear feedback control laws applied to the transverse and lateral directions at the top boundary of the flexible marine riser, respectively. In the analysis, the nonlinear semigroup theory is utilized to establish the well-posedness of the resulting closed-loop coupled system. Notably, the solution demonstrates continuous dependence on the initial conditions. Furthermore, the exponential stability of the closed-loop coupled system is achieved by employing a generalized Gronwall-type integral inequality and the integral multiplier method, which involves the innovative development of an energy-like functional. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controls, numerical simulations utilizing the finite element method are presented.},

  abstract     = {Unknown inputs related to, e.g., sensor aging, modeling errors, or device bias, represent a major concern in wireless sensor networks, as they degrade the state estimation performance. To improve the performance, unknown-input observers (UIOs) have been proposed. Most of the results available to design UIOs are based on explicit system models, which can be difficult or impossible to obtain in real-world applications. Data-driven techniques, on the other hand, have become a viable alternative for the design and analysis of unknown systems using only data. In this context, a novel data-driven distributed unknown-input observer (D-DUIO) for unknown continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems is developed, which requires solely some data collected offline, without any prior knowledge of the system matrices. In the paper, first, a model-based approach to the design of a DUIO is presented. A sufficient condition for the existence of such a DUIO is recalled, and a new one is proposed, that is prone to a data-driven adaptation. Moving to a data-driven approach, it is shown that under suitable assumptions on the input/output/state data collected from the continuous-time system, it is possible to both claim the existence of a D-DUIO and to derive its matrices in terms of the matrices of pre-collected data. Finally, the efficacy of the D-DUIO is illustrated by means of numerical examples.},

Particularly, by developing the boundary threshold triggering strategy, the performance boundaries would be updated adaptively once the distance between the tracking error and the performance boundaries is smaller than the given threshold. Moreover, compared with the existing works, the transient behaviors are improved, and the limitation imposed on the initial conditions is removed attributed to the construction of novel performance functions and error transformation. Then, an adaptive fault-tolerant control scheme with self-regulating spatiotemporal performance is designed for a class of nonlinear systems with non-parametric uncertainties. It is shown that both the boundedness of the closed-loop signals and the satisfactory performance constraints are guaranteed in the presence of unpredictable actuator failure. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation.},

To accommodate the dynamic joining and leaving behaviors of the players, a status estimation mechanism, which is capable of estimating in a finite time whether the players are active or inactive, is introduced. Based on the status estimation mechanism, a gradient play based algorithm is developed for distributed Nash equilibrium seeking in the dynamic environment. It is shown that under strongly connected communication graphs, players’ actions are convergent to a small neighborhood of the new Nash equilibrium linearly every time the player set changes. Moreover, the convergence accuracy and convergence rate can be adjusted by suitably tuning the step-size. To cover more general communication scenarios, strongly connected graphs are further relaxed to be B-jointly connected graphs, under which the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm are analytically studied. Furthermore, the upper bound of the average tracking error is quantified to evaluate the dynamic performance of the proposed algorithm. In the last, a simulation study on energy consumption games is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Then, by convex duality, the obtained optimization problems are equivalently transformed into convex optimization (CO) problems, and a data-model-hybrid-driven composite controller is designed. The design method of this composite controller avoids the potential numerical stiffness problems, and does not need complete system dynamics information while ensuring the steady-state output tracking error converges to zero.

In this work, we show how to acquire an alternative, computationally attractive feedback. Given a nominal CLF and a nominal state feedback, we say that a different positive definite function is a Sub-control Lyapunov function (SCLF) if its Lyapunov derivative is negative-definite and bounded above by the Lyapunov derivative of the nominal function with the nominal control. It turns out that if we consider a family of basis functions, then an SCLF can be computed by linear programming, with an infinite number of constraints. The idea is that although the offline computational burden to achieve the new controller and solve the linear program is considerable, the online computational burden is drastically reduced. Comprehensive simulations and experiments on drone control are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the study.},

On this basis, two novel data-driven parallel Q-learning algorithms are proposed. The advantages of the proposed method are threefold: (i) it does not require precise knowledge of the system dynamics; (ii) it learns the optimal disturbance attenuation level; (iii) it yields Nash equilibrium control strategies.

This scheme integrates event-triggered optimal coordinators, high-order filters, and tracking controllers. To handle the interaction between optimal coordinators and filters, we incorporate a new compensation term into the updating law for the coupling weight of each edge. Moreover, we design a novel adaptive distributed dynamic event-triggering mechanism that ensures that the inter-event times of each agent are lower bounded by a positive constant. Asymptotic convergence of agents’ outputs to the optimal point is proved by constructing a composite Lyapunov function. The proposed control scheme does not depend on global topology information.

A positive constant scaling is applied to the primal variable, while a positive increasing scaling function is applied to the dual variable. We prove that the proposed dynamic achieves a fast convergence rate for both the objective residual and the feasibility violation, with the decay rate potentially reaching O ( e − μ t ) . Additionally, we show that the dynamic is robust under small perturbations. By discretizing the proposed continuous-time dynamic, we develop an accelerated linearized augmented Lagrangian method for strongly convex composite optimization with linear constraints, where the objective function has a nonsmooth + smooth composite structure. The proposed algorithm achieves a fast convergence rate that matches the one of the continuous-time dynamic. We also consider an inexact version of the proposed algorithm, which can be viewed as a discrete version of the perturbed continuous-time dynamic.

However, communication channels in modern technological systems are not always reliable and can be attacked by malicious external agents. In that case, the plant observations obtained by the supervisor may not be deterministic, e.g., due to delays and losses, or external attacks. This paper considers a unified supervisory control framework with set-valued (nondeterministic) observations and proposes a simplified version of nondeterministic observability, together with a generalized normality.

  abstract     = {Stabilizing a reference trajectory of a nonlinear system is a recurrent, non-trivial task in control engineering. A common approach is to linearize the dynamics along the trajectory, thus deriving a linear-time-varying (LTV) model, and to design a model predictive controller (MPC), which results to be computationally efficient, since only convex programs need to be solved in real time, while retaining constraint handling capabilities. Building on recent developments in gain-scheduling control design, where linearization errors and tracking error bounds are considered, a new approach to derive such LTV-MPC controllers is presented. The method addresses the systematic derivation of a suitable terminal cost. The resulting MPC law is tube-based, exploiting the co-designed auxiliary gain-scheduled controller. Computational and implementation aspects are discussed as well, and the resulting hierarchical method is demonstrated both in simulation and in experiments with a small drone with fast dynamics and limited embedded computational capacity.},

We first recast the distributed constrained optimization as a constrained saddle-point problem. Subsequently, two distributed stochastic algorithms via optimistic gradient descent ascent (SOGDA) and extragradient (SEG) methods are developed with constant step sizes, in which the variable sample-size technique is incorporated to reduce the variance of the sampled gradients. We present the explicit selection criteria of the constant step size, under which the developed algorithms achieve almost sure convergence to an optimal solution. Moreover, the convergence rate is O ( 1 / k ) for merely convex cost functions, which matches the optimal rate of its deterministic counterpart. Finally, a numerical example is provided to reflect the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {The stability of nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) relies significantly on stabilizing factors such as the terminal region and cost. A larger terminal region not only expands the region of attraction for the closed-loop system but also contributes to reducing online computation costs. However, existing methods in the literature often impose limitations on the degrees of freedom available for characterizing terminal ingredients. This limitation arises from the reliance on either a predetermined linear local controller or a preset control Lyapunov function. This paper introduces an innovative approach to terminal ingredient characterization leveraging value-based reinforcement learning (RL). This method provides ample degrees of freedom for expanding the terminal region. To achieve this, a deep neural network is employed to learn the parametric state value function, serving as the terminal cost for MPC. The local controller adopts a one-step MPC instead of a predetermined linear or nonlinear feedback controller. Subsequently, a terminal set sequence is constructed iteratively through the one-step set expansion. The proposed approach’s effectiveness is validated through simulations.},

  abstract     = {Systems modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs) are at least as ubiquitous as those by nature finite-dimensional and modeled by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). And yet, systematic and readily usable methodologies, for such a significant portion of real systems, have been historically scarce. Around the year 2000, the backstepping approach to PDE control began to offer not only a less abstract alternative to PDE control techniques replicating optimal and spectrum assignment techniques of the 1960s, but also enabled the methodologies of adaptive and nonlinear control, matured in the 1980s and 1990s, to be extended from ODEs to PDEs, allowing feedback synthesis for systems that are uncertain, nonlinear, and infinite-dimensional. The PDE backstepping literature has since grown to hundreds of papers and nearly a dozen books. This survey aims to facilitate the entry into this thriving area of overwhelming size and topical diversity. Designs of controllers and observers, for parabolic, hyperbolic, and other classes of PDEs, in one or more dimensions, with nonlinear, adaptive, sampled-data, and event-triggered extensions, are covered in the survey. The lifeblood of control are technology and physics. The survey places a particular emphasis on applications that have motivated the development of the theory and which have benefited from the theory and designs: flows, flexible structures, materials, thermal and chemically reacting dynamics, energy (from oil drilling to batteries and magnetic confinement fusion), and vehicles.},

Reverse sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the most suitable measurable parameter for obtaining the electrolyte lithium concentration at the boundaries, which is used in the design of the electrolyte-phase observer. Subsequently, enhanced observers for the solid-phase lithium concentration in the negative and positive electrodes are developed. The proposed solid-phase observer enables more accurate State-of-Charge (SoC) estimation by leveraging the closed-loop electrolyte-phase observer.

First, a dichotomy of equilibria is identified: either a unique non-consensus equilibrium point or multiple consensus points, depending on whether the intersection of the constraint intervals is empty or not. Then, the set of equilibria is proven to be a global attractor. Structural stability of such a system is also proven based on real-analysis methods, showing that the equilibria have continuous dependence on changes of the constraint intervals.

In this paper we propose Closed-loop Data-enabled Predictive Control (CL-DeePC), a framework that unifies different approaches to address this challenge. To this end, CL-DeePC incorporates instrumental variables (IVs) to synthesize and sequentially apply consistent single or multi-step-ahead predictors. Furthermore, a computationally efficient CL-DeePC implementation is developed that reveals an equivalence with Closed-loop Subspace Predictive Control (CL-SPC). Time marching simulations of DeePC and CL-DeePC are conducted using Hankel matrices of past data that are updated at every time step to induce potentially troublesome closed-loop correlations between inputs and noise. Compared to DeePC, CL-DeePC simulations demonstrate superior reference tracking, with a sensitivity study finding a 48% lower susceptibility to noise-induced reference tracking performance degradation.},

Then the cloud broadcasts the current global model to all the agents. Agent-based fused GPR refines local predictions by fusing the received global model with that of the agent-based local GPR.

Such simulation is essential for a variety of system and control problems such as system identification and performance analysis of (control) systems. Ideally, the simulated model response should be identical to the system response. However, this is typically not the case in practice, even when the effects of unmodelled dynamics and parametric uncertainty are excluded. Even in that scenario, a mismatch exists between the response of the system and the model due to the interface between the physical world and the digital computer, unknown disturbances, and simulation inaccuracies. For the class of continuous-time, nonlinear Lur’e-type systems, this paper analyses the mismatch between the steady-state system response and the steady-state model response computed using the so-called mixed time–frequency algorithm. Firstly, a bound on the mismatch between the steady-state system response and the computed steady-state model response based on continuous-time signals is derived. Secondly, a bound for the same mismatch is derived for a sampled version of the signals. The bounds are further decomposed into several components, each given an interpretation that can be used to reduce the bounds on the mismatch. In a numerical case study, we show that reducing the bounds also reduces the actual mismatch.},

  abstract     = {Lossless Convexification (LCvx) is a modeling approach that transforms a class of nonconvex optimal control problems, where nonconvexity primarily arises from control constraints, into convex problems through convex relaxations. These convex problems can be solved using polynomial-time numerical methods after discretization, which converts the original infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. However, existing LCvx theory is limited to continuous-time optimal control problems, as the equivalence between the relaxed convex problem and the original nonconvex problem holds only in continuous-time. This paper extends LCvx theory to discrete-time optimal control problems by classifying them into normal and long-horizon cases. For normal cases, after an arbitrarily small perturbation to the system dynamics (recursive equality constraints), applying the existing LCvx method to discrete-time problems results in optimal controls that meet the original nonconvex constraints at all but no more than n x − 1 temporal grid points, where n x is the state dimension. For long-horizon cases, the existing LCvx method fails, but we resolve this issue by integrating it with a bisection search, leveraging the continuity of the value function from the relaxed convex problem to achieve similar results as in normal cases. This paper strengthens the theoretical foundation of LCvx, extending the applicability of LCvx theory to discrete-time optimal control problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the cubic-regularized Newton method within a federated learning framework while addressing two major concerns: privacy leakage and communication bottlenecks. We propose the Differentially Private Federated Cubic Regularized Newton (DP-FCRN) algorithm, which leverages second-order techniques to achieve lower iteration complexity than first-order methods. We incorporate noise perturbation during local computations to ensure privacy. Furthermore, we employ sparsification in uplink transmission, which not only reduces the communication costs but also amplifies the privacy guarantee. Specifically, this approach reduces the necessary noise intensity without compromising privacy protection. We analyze the convergence properties of our algorithm and establish the privacy guarantee. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments on a benchmark dataset.},

The framework encompasses discretized PDEs with sampled measurements. A new scheme of distributed consensus on measurements is extended to systems evolving in L 2 spaces in order to limit the information exchange to finite-dimensional vectors. We show that, in analogy to the finite-dimensional case, at each node the variance of the estimation error tends to the one of the centralized Kalman filter for systems is L 2 when the number of consensus steps increases.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address a safe time-critical control problem using reachability analysis and design a reinforcement learning-based mechanism for learning online and in fixed-time the solution to the safe time-critical control problem. Safety is ensured by determining a set of states for which there exists an admissible control law generating a system trajectory that does not reach a set of forbidden states at a user-prescribed time instant. Specifically, we cast our safe time-critical problem as a Mayer optimal feedback control problem whose solution satisfies the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation and characterizes the set of safe states. Since the HJB equation is generally difficult to solve, we develop an online critic-only reinforcement learning-based algorithm for simultaneously learning the solution to the HJB equation and the safe set in a fixed time. In particular, we introduce a non-Lipschitz experience replay-based learning law utilizing recorded and current data for updating the critic weights to learn the value function and the safe set. The non-Lipschitz property of the dynamics gives rise to fixed-time convergence, whereas the experience replay-based approach eliminates the need to satisfy the persistence of excitation condition provided that a recorded data set is sufficiently rich. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach to the problem of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle collision avoidance.},

We propose a hybrid control law combining the two on-board measurements and discuss stability results for the closed-loop expressed in the on-board camera-based coordinates, using Lyapunov-based arguments. We prove robustness of the stability properties to uncertainties affecting the sensors and external perturbations acting on the robot. The results are illustrated via simulations.},
