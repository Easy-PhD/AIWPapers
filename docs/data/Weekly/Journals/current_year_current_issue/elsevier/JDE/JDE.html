  abstract     = {In [4] , we initiated the first study of control problems for kinetic equations arising from harmonic chains. Specifically, we developed impulsive and feedback control mechanisms for harmonic chains coupled with a point thermostat, effectively enabling control over the boundary conditions of the corresponding kinetic equations. However, the more intricate and fundamental challenge of internal control - namely, the design of control strategies that influence the collision operators within the kinetic framework - remained open. In the present work, we address the internal control problem for stochastic lattice dynamics, with the objective of controlling the transition kernel of the limiting kinetic equation. A central innovation of our approach is the development of a novel geometric-combinatorial framework, which enables the systematic construction of control pathways within the microscopic dynamics. This methodology opens a new avenue for the internal control of kinetic equations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the existence, orbital stability/instability and regularity of bound state solutions to nonlinear Schrödinger equations with super-quadratic confinement in two and three spatial dimensions for the mass supercritical case. Such solutions, which are given by time-dependent rotations of a non-radially symmetric spatial profile, correspond to critical points of the underlying energy function restricted on the double constraints consisting of the mass and the angular momentum. The study exhibits new pictures for rotating Bose-Einstein condensates within the framework of Gross-Pitaevskii theory. It is proved that there exist two non-radial symmetric solutions, one of which is local minimizer and the other is mountain pass type critical point of the underlying energy function restricted on the constraints. Moreover, we derive conditions that guarantee that local minimizers are regular, the set of those is orbitally stable and mountain pass type solutions are strongly unstable. The results extend and complement the recent ones in [17] , where the consideration is undertaken in the mass subcritical case.},

Our model determines the evolution of a biological system characterized by the interaction between a sedentary species and a diffusive species. It can be notably applied in forest ecology and in microbiology. We prove the existence of an infinite family of discontinuous stationary solutions using a generalized Mountain Pass Theorem, and analyze the continuity of this family, through an original method based on the convergence of generalized Clarke gradients. We show that the discontinuity interface of the heterogeneous patterns is very sensitive with respect to a variation of the initial condition. Furthermore, we prove a new theorem of convergence towards discontinuous patterns, which shows that the basin of attraction of each pattern contains a non-trivial set of initial conditions.},

Moreover, we remove the smallness assumption by making use of the dissipative nature of the equation.},

  abstract     = {Any dynamical system, whether it is generated by a differential equation or a transformation map on a manifold, induces a dynamics on functional-spaces. The choice of functional-space may vary, but the induced dynamics is always linear, and codified by the Koopman operator. The eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator are of extreme importance in the study of the dynamics. They provide a clear distinction between the mixing and non-mixing components of the dynamics, and also reveal embedded toral rotations. The usual choice of functional-space is L 2 , a class of square integrable functions. A fundamental problem with eigenfunctions in L 2 is that they are often extremely discontinuous, particularly if the system is chaotic. There are some prototypical systems called skew-product dynamics in which L 2 Koopman eigenfunctions are also smooth. The article shows that under general assumptions on an ergodic system, these prototypical examples are the only possibility. Moreover, the smooth eigenfunctions can be used to create a change of variables which explicitly characterizes the weakly mixing component too.},
