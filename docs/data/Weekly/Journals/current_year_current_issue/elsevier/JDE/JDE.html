For a bounded C 2 domain Ω ⊂ R d , let u ∈ C ( R d ) be a viscosity solution of such Dirichlet problem. We obtain global Lipschitz regularity and fine boundary regularity for u by constructing appropriate sub and supersolutions coupled with a Harnack type inequality. We apply these results to obtain Hölder regularity of Du up to the boundary.},

Building on techniques developed by Bradshaw, et al. (2024) [1] , we prove the existence of mild solutions in Wiener amalgam spaces that satisfy the corresponding spacetime integral bounds. In addition, we construct global-in-time local energy weak solutions in these amalgam spaces using the framework introduced by Bradshaw and Tsai (2021) [4] . As part of this construction, we also establish several properties of local energy solutions with L uloc 2 initial data, including initial and eventual regularity as well as small-large uniqueness, extending analogous results obtained for the Navier–Stokes equations by Bradshaw and Tsai (2020) [3] .},

Notice that in the critical case T = π , the L p dual Minkowski problem is closely related to the half-period symmetry problem in convex geometry. By using Krasnosel'skii-Guo fixed point theorem and Schauder's fixed point theorem, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of positive π -periodic solutions to this equation. In addition, we employ numerical bifurcation analysis to explore the dynamical behavior of positive π -periodic solutions.},

We also apply the results to equations with state-dependent delays.},

  abstract     = {We consider the mathematical analysis and homogenization of a moving boundary problem posed for a highly heterogeneous, periodically perforated domain. More specifically, we are looking at a one-phase thermo-elasticity system with phase transformations where small inclusions, initially periodically distributed, are growing or shrinking based on a kinetic under-cooling-type law and where surface stresses are created based on the curvature of the phase interface. This growth is assumed to be uniform in each individual cell of the perforated domain. After transforming to the initial reference configuration (utilizing the Hanzawa transformation), we use the contraction mapping principle to show the existence of a unique solution for a possibly small but ε independent time interval ( ε is here the scale of heterogeneity). In the homogenization limit, we recover a macroscopic thermo-elasticity problem which is strongly non-linearly coupled (via an internal parameter called height function) to local changes in geometry. As a direct by-product of the mathematical analysis work, we present an alternative equivalent formulation which lends itself to an effective pre-computing strategy that is very much needed as the limit problem is computationally expensive.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we establish the existence of travelling wave solutions for a non-cooperative reaction-diffusion model representing glioma cell invasion. The model describes the microtube-driven migration of glioma consisting of an ODE equation describing the dynamics of the tumour bulk and a reaction-diffusion equation for the tumour microtubes. We derive an explicit formula for the minimum wave speed c ¯ based on system parameters such that travelling waves exist for speeds c ≥ c ¯ while no travelling wave solution exists for c < c ¯ . We prove the existence of travelling wave solutions by constructing upper and lower solutions and employing Schauder's fixed point theorem. We obtain non-existence for small speeds by use of the negative one-sided Laplace transform. Our result is one of the few complete results on travelling waves of a non-cooperative partially degenerate reaction-diffusion systems. The findings have implications for understanding glioma spread dynamics and potential modelling applications in predicting tumour progression based on cellular migration speeds.},
