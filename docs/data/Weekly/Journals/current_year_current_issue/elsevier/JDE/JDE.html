  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the large-time behavior of solutions toward a stationary solution for the outflow problem of the full compressible Navier-Stokes-Allen-Cahn system in the half-space R + . The model can be used to describe the motion of a mixture of two viscous compressible fluids. First, we give some sufficient conditions for the existence of stationary solution via the manifold theory and the center manifold theory. Second, by using the elementary L 2 -energy method, it is shown that the stationary solution is time-asymptotically stable provided that the initial perturbation and the strength of the stationary solution are sufficiently small. Finally, the convergence rates of solutions towards the stationary one are also established by employing a time and space weighted energy method. Our analysis is based on some new techniques which take into account the effect of the phase field variable.},

Under the condition that bounds the normal derivatives of the velocity and magnetic field uniformly in ϵ (the small Alfvén and Mach Numbers), we establish uniform estimates for the solutions in high-order conormal Sobolev norms.

Specifically, we developed impulsive and feedback control mechanisms for harmonic chains coupled with a point thermostat, effectively enabling control over the boundary conditions of the corresponding kinetic equations. However, the more intricate and fundamental challenge of internal control - namely, the design of control strategies that influence the collision operators within the kinetic framework - remained open. In the present work, we address the internal control problem for stochastic lattice dynamics, with the objective of controlling the transition kernel of the limiting kinetic equation. A central innovation of our approach is the development of a novel geometric-combinatorial framework, which enables the systematic construction of control pathways within the microscopic dynamics. This methodology opens a new avenue for the internal control of kinetic equations.},

Such solutions, which are given by time-dependent rotations of a non-radially symmetric spatial profile, correspond to critical points of the underlying energy function restricted on the double constraints consisting of the mass and the angular momentum. The study exhibits new pictures for rotating Bose-Einstein condensates within the framework of Gross-Pitaevskii theory. It is proved that there exist two non-radial symmetric solutions, one of which is local minimizer and the other is mountain pass type critical point of the underlying energy function restricted on the constraints. Moreover, we derive conditions that guarantee that local minimizers are regular, the set of those is orbitally stable and mountain pass type solutions are strongly unstable. The results extend and complement the recent ones in [17] , where the consideration is undertaken in the mass subcritical case.},

We show that the discontinuity interface of the heterogeneous patterns is very sensitive with respect to a variation of the initial condition.

We first focus on the case of one spatial dimension and a harmonic time dependence. We define the reflection coefficient R from a limiting absorption principle. We provide an exact formula for R in terms of the solution to a Volterra equation. We obtain the asymptotic limit of this coefficient in the large ℓ ω / c 0 regime as R = Γ ( α + 1 ) ( 2 i ) α + 2 ( c 0 ℓ ω ) α + lower order terms. The amplitude is proportional to ω − α , and the phase rotation behavior is obtained from the i − ( α + 2 ) factor. The proof method does not rely on representing the solution by special functions, since α > 0 is general. In the multi-dimensional layered case, we obtain a similar result where the nondimensional variable ℓ ω / c 0 is modified to account for the angle of incidence. The asymptotic analysis now requires the waves to be non-glancing. The resulting reflection coefficient can now be interpreted as a Fourier multiplier of order − α . In practice, the knowledge of the dependency of both the amplitude and the phase of R on ω and α might be able to inform the kind of signal processing needed to characterize the fractional nature of reflectors, for instance in geophysics.},

The eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator are of extreme importance in the study of the dynamics. They provide a clear distinction between the mixing and non-mixing components of the dynamics, and also reveal embedded toral rotations. The usual choice of functional-space is L 2 , a class of square integrable functions. A fundamental problem with eigenfunctions in L 2 is that they are often extremely discontinuous, particularly if the system is chaotic. There are some prototypical systems called skew-product dynamics in which L 2 Koopman eigenfunctions are also smooth. The article shows that under general assumptions on an ergodic system, these prototypical examples are the only possibility. Moreover, the smooth eigenfunctions can be used to create a change of variables which explicitly characterizes the weakly mixing component too.},

Moreover, we yield the existence and uniqueness of invariant measures as well as ergodicity of the solutions under additional conditions. In addition, the convergence rate of invariant measures is provided when distribution dependent stochastic system converges to distribution independent one.
