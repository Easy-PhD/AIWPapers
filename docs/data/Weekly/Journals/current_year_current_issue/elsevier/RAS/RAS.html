  abstract     = {Due to advances in robotics science, mobile robots are being used in more and more applications worldwide, and the autonomous navigation of these robots is an important topic in their discussion. This paper focuses on the autonomous navigation of a two-wheeled self-balancing robot (TWSBR) in an unknown environment using behavior-based control in the form of a hybrid automaton. This hybrid automaton includes the behaviors “Go To Goal” and “Avoid Obstacle,” and to avoid the Zeno phenomenon between these two behaviors, another behavior is considered in between, called “Follow Wall,” which the robot uses to move around the obstacle. However, two bugs are identified in the conventional hybrid automaton. The first bug causes the robot to not follow the optimal path. Another bug is that the Zeno phenomenon occurs between the two behaviors “Follow Wall” and “Go To Goal,” causing odometry errors in the experimental environment. The results show that the modified hybrid automaton successfully corrects the bugs and works as intended. The navigation algorithm is designed for the point mass model, so it is transformed to the unicycle model using a transformation, which can be used as input to the TWSBR controller. After linearizing the dynamic equations of the robot around its equilibrium point, the pole placement method is used to create the TWSBR controller. By adding the Luenberger observer to estimate the state variables, the non-full-state feedback system is also controlled. The results of the simulations demonstrate that the whole system is functioning properly so that the robot follows the path determined by the navigation algorithm while maintaining its equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is vital in precision agriculture to improve efficiency and resource utilization. In irregular and dispersed plantations, traditional grid-based CPP often causes redundant coverage over non-vegetated areas, leading to waste and pollution. To overcome these limitations, we propose CPP-DIP, a multi-objective CPP framework designed for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). The framework transforms the CPP task into a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and optimizes flight paths by minimizing travel distance, turning angles, and intersection counts. Unlike conventional approaches, our method does not rely on GPS-based environmental modeling. Instead, it uses aerial imagery and a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)-based approach to detect trees and extract image coordinates. A density-aware waypoint strategy is applied: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is used to reduce redundant waypoints in dense regions, while a greedy algorithm ensures complete coverage in sparse areas. To verify the generality and scalability of the framework, TSP instances of varying sizes are solved using three methods: Greedy Heuristic Insertion (GHI), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Monte Carlo Reinforcement Learning (MCRL). An object-based optimization is subsequently applied to further refine the paths. Additionally, CPP-DIP integrates ForaNav, our insect-inspired navigation method, for accurate tree localization and tracking. Experimental results show that MCRL provides a balanced solution, reducing travel distance by 16.9 % compared to ACO while maintaining comparable performance to GHI. It also improves path smoothness by reducing turning angles by 28.3 % and 59.9 % relative to ACO and GHI, respectively, and eliminates intersections. Computational resource comparisons further highlight that GHI scales efficiently with increasing waypoints, whereas ACO and MCRL incur higher computational costs. These results confirm the robustness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed CPP-DIP.},

  abstract     = {To address the challenges of detecting line segments in dynamic and geometrically complex environments, EM-LSD, a lightweight and efficient line segment detection model, is introduced. Accurate and efficient detection of line segments is critical for tasks such as environmental modeling and localization in SLAM, where the failure to extract robust line features can result in unreliable mapping and trajectory estimation. The design of EM-LSD is guided by the limitations of existing methods: traditional approaches often fail to capture multi-scale and global features in noisy scenes, while deep learning models with multi-stage architectures impose high computational costs, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. Inspired by the observation that multi-scale feature extraction is essential for handling diverse geometric structures, EM-LSD incorporates a Dense Atrous Convolution (DAC) module to effectively capture multi-scale information with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, the need for robustness against structural complexities and noise led to the integration of dual decoders with a Channel-Spatial Multi-scale Attention (CSMA) module and a Multi-scale Atrous Deformable Block (MADB), enabling adaptive feature representation. Experimental results on the Wireframe and YorkUrban datasets validate EM-LSD’s superior accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance, emphasizing its capability to support resource-constrained SLAM applications. This model not only addresses the limitations of existing methods but also enhances the reliability of environment modeling and localization, offering inspiration for the development of lightweight and efficient detection frameworks.},

However, the existing visuotactile sensing methods are far from humanoid neural information processing mechanism. To address this gap, we propose a neuromorphic visuotactile slip detection method named VT-SNN using Tactile Address-Event Representation (TAER) encoding combined with brain-inspired Spiking Neural Network (SNN) modeling in this paper. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the VT-SNN achieves slip detection accuracy of 99.59% and F1 score of 99.28%, which is comparable to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) while exhibiting significant advantages in power dissipation and inference time. Furthermore, we deployed the VT-SNN on Intel neuromorphic computing chip–Loihi and performed closed-loop slip-feedback robotic manipulation tasks such as bottle-cap tightening and loosening. Our closed-loop neuromorphic visuotactile sensing system shows significant promise for high accuracy, low latency, and low power dissipation for robotic dexterous manipulation.},

  abstract     = {Obstacle-aware configuration control represents a critical challenge in the deployment of continuum robots for advanced applications such as robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery and intelligent industrial grasping systems. At present, in order to realize the obstacle avoidance function of flexible robots, inverse kinematic calculations are usually unavoidable. The problems of large amount of computation, long solution time, and non-convergence of results make the configuration control for flexible robots still challenging. Most of the current studies use the inverse kinematics calculation of end tracking, and for flexible robots with multiple degrees of freedom, the success rate of obstacle avoidance is low and the computational cost is large. In this paper, a three-segment continuum configuration planning method based on Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is proposed, in which the rough obstacle avoidance path is obtained by RRT algorithm, then the three-segment fitting is carried out by using the second-order Bézier curve, and the length error is evaluated to meet the planning requirements. Experiments such as obstacle avoidance tests, the arrival of target endpoints at different positions and different obstacle environments show that the proposed method can effectively map the feasible solution to the actual configuration. Compared with the inverse kinematics method, the proposed approach improves the success rate of obtaining feasible solutions by at least 14.8% and reduces the solution time by at least 55%. In addition, no prior curvature information and traditional inverse kinematics calculation are needed for the configuration control.},

  abstract     = {Consider the following problem: A robot operating in a 2D environment with a limited vision range finds a path to a goal in an unknown environment containing obstacles. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to solve the problem. In some special cases, our algorithm is convergent with respect to ‖ . ‖ . The problem involves discovering the environmental map and blind alley regions, that are bounded by obstacles, and it provides no possible passage for robots except in and out of their path entry occur, the robot has to return back to some positions outside to escape from such regions such that the returned path is not longer than the path entry (Blind Alley Region problem, (BAR) problem, in short). To solve the (BAR) problem, sequences of bundles of line segments during the robot’s traveling are constructed in our algorithm. Some advantages of our algorithm are that (a) It reduces search space in blind alley regions because it only works on the sequences of bundles of the line segments built by the robot’s limited vision range. (b) Our algorithm ensures that the returned path to escape from the regions is not longer than the previous path of the robot. (c) Due to the construction of the sequences of bundles of line segments, our paths are not always “close” obstacles and the number of turns of such paths is smaller ones determined by other shortest path algorithms (e.g., A*, RRT*). Our algorithm is implemented in Python and we experience the algorithm on some autonomous robots with different vision ranges in real environment. We also compare our result with RRTX, a state-of-art local path-planning algorithm, and A ∗ , a basic one. The experimental results show that our algorithm provides better solutions than RRTX and A* results in some specific circumstances.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a robust and enhanced control strategy for a multi-quadrotor suspended payload system, which is characterized by complex nonlinear dynamics and unknown external disturbances. A precise dynamic model of the system is formulated using the Udwadia–Kalaba method. A distributed cooperative planning framework, based on graph theory, is employed to enable effective information exchange and cooperative control among multiple quadrotors. To mitigate the impact of unknown disturbances, such as wind fields and variations in payload mass, a disturbance observer is developed to estimate and compensate for these disturbances, thereby enhancing system robustness. Furthermore, an improved prescribed performance control method is proposed to address the issue of exceeding performance boundaries. The steady-state error of the system is effectively reduced by adaptively adjusting the prescribed performance boundary and combining it with integral backstepping, and real-time constraints on tracking errors and closed-loop stability are achieved. Simulation results validate that the proposed control strategy significantly enhances the control performance and disturbance rejection capability of the multi-quadrotor suspended payload system, demonstrating superior robustness.},
