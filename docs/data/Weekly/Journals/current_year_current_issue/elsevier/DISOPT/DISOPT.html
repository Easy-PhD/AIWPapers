  abstract     = {Cutting planes are frequently used for solving integer programs. A common strategy is to derive cutting planes from building blocks or a substructure of the integer program. In this paper, we focus on knapsack constraints that arise from single row relaxations. Among the most popular classes derived from knapsack constraints are lifted minimal cover inequalities. The separation problem for these inequalities is NP-hard though, and one usually separates them heuristically, therefore not fully exploiting their potential. For many benchmarking instances however, it turns out that many knapsack constraints only have few different coefficients. This motivates the concept of sparse knapsacks where the number of different coefficients is a small constant, independent of the number of variables present. For such knapsacks, we observe that there are only polynomially many different classes of structurally equivalent minimal covers. This opens the door to specialized techniques for using lifted minimal cover inequalities. In this article we will discuss two such techniques, which are based on specialized sorting methods. On the one hand, we present new separation routines that separate equivalence classes of inequalities rather than individual inequalities. On the other hand, we derive compact extended formulations that express all lifted minimal cover inequalities by means of a polynomial number of constraints. These extended formulations are based on tailored sorting networks that express our separation algorithm by linear inequalities. We conclude the article by a numerical investigation of the different techniques for popular benchmarking instances.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce an improved upper bound for the efficiency of Nash equilibria in utilitarian scheduling games on related machines. The machines have varying speeds and adhere to the shortest processing time first policy. The goal of each job is to minimize its completion time, while the social objective is to minimize the sum of completion times. Our main finding establishes an upper bound of 2 − 1 / ( 4 m − 2 ) on the price of anarchy for the general case of m machines. We improve this bound to 3/2 for the case of two machines, and to 2 − 1 / ( 2 m ) for the general case of m machines when the machines have divisible speeds, i.e., if the speed of each machine is divisible by the speed of any slower machine.},

  abstract     = {Circuit diameters of polyhedra are a fundamental tool for studying the complexity of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for finding lower bounds on combinatorial diameters. The main open problem in this area is the circuit diameter conjecture, the analogue of the Hirsch conjecture in the circuit setting. A natural question is whether the well-known counterexamples to the Hirsch conjecture carry over. Previously, Stephen and Yusun showed that the Klee-Walkup counterexample to the unbounded Hirsch conjecture does not transfer to the circuit setting. Our main contribution is to show that the original counterexamples for other variants, using monotone walks or for bounded polytopes, also do not transfer. A challenge lies in the dependence of circuit diameters on the specific realization of a polyhedron. We discuss for which realizations, in addition to the original ones from the literature, our tools resolve this question. Our results rely on new observations on structural properties of these counterexamples. To analyze the bounded case, we exploit the geometry of certain 2-faces of the polytopes underlying all known bounded Hirsch counterexamples in Santos’ work. For Todd’s monotone Hirsch counterexample, we study linear programs on spindles and prove sufficient conditions for short monotone circuit walks to exist. We then enumerate all linear programs over Todd’s polytope and find four new orientations that contradict the monotone Hirsch conjecture, while the remaining 7107 satisfy the bound. The conclusion then follows by applying these sufficient conditions to Todd’s counterexample.},
