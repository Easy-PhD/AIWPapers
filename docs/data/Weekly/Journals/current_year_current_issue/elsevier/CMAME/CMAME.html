  abstract     = {Structural transient dynamic optimization faces significant challenges stemming from material nonlinearities and geometric nonlinearities induced by large deformations. These nonlinear phenomena severely complicate gradient-based sensitivity analysis, while conventional non-gradient optimization approaches face limitations including prohibitive computational demands, suboptimal solution quality, and compromised robustness. To overcome these challenges, we present an integrated computational framework synergistically combining an autoencoder-enhanced generative adversarial network with an elitist guidance evolutionary algorithm for nonlinear dynamic optimization. The developed multi-fidelity surrogate modeling architecture achieves dual enhancement in computational efficiency and solution diversity, while the elitism-preserving mechanism in elitist guidance evolutionary algorithm ensures superior convergence characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised criterion noise rate metric for quantitatively evaluating structural performance under transient loads. Results demonstrate that the proposed method improves structural clarity and diversity by 18.56 and 21.55 times compared to conventional methods. Case studies with both cantilever and fixed-end beams across dynamic loading regimes confirm the method’s generalizability. This framework is easily transferable to other engineering fields, offering new insights for solving transient nonlinear problems.},

  abstract     = {Neurons exhibit intricate geometries within their neurite networks, which play a crucial role in processes such as signaling and nutrient transport. Accurate simulation of material transport in the networks is essential for understanding these biological phenomena but poses significant computational challenges because of the complex tree-like structures involved. Traditional approaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent properties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state parabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for computational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a Graph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is specifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in neural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent representations of the network’s geometry, velocity fields, and concentration profiles. These latent space representations are then assembled into a global graph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent space via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration of an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models with reduced training data requirements. Furthermore, the Neural ODE component effectively mitigates the issue of error accumulation commonly encountered in recurrent neural networks. The effectiveness of the GALDS model is demonstrated through results on eight unseen geometries and four abnormal transport examples, where our approach achieves mean relative error of 3 % with maximum relative error < 8 % and demonstrates a 10-fold speed improvement compared to previous surrogate model approaches.},

  abstract     = {This study develops a novel spectral-element scaled boundary perfectly matched layer (SBPML) coupled the spectral elements method (SEM) to simulate wave problems in 3D unbounded domains. The SBPML can accommodate boundary of general shapes and consider the planar physical interfaces and surfaces that extend infinitely. Furthermore, it supports direct coupling with 3D spectral elements of any orders in interior domain, leading to significantly higher computation accuracy. The spectral-element SBPML can flexibly and adaptively adjust the elements orders within the SBPML domain according to those used in the finite domain. Moreover, by generalizing the flexibility matrix, this method can model 3D transversely isotropic (TI) unbounded media, thereby enhancing its applicability to realistic geological scenarios. Firstly, quadrilateral spectral element shape functions are introduced in the circumferential direction of scaled boundary coordinates, which is compatible with 3D spectral elements of any orders of the finite domain. Subsequently, a complex coordinate stretching function is introduced along the radial direction, transforming the unbounded domain into a complex-valued space that defines the SBPML domain. This SBPML formulation employs a 2nd-order mixed unsplit-field displacement-stress form via spatial discretization of the SBPML domain. This mixed element is formulated by using shape functions of an n -th order spectral element for the displacement field and an ( n -1)-th order element for the auxiliary stress field. This method allows for the use of different interpolation orders along the radial and circumferential directions in SBPML, achieving an optimal balance between numerical accuracy and computational efficiency. Ultimately, the accuracy, convergence, and robustness of the proposed approach are validated by three wave propagation problems and two seismic response analyses of complex sites.},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) arise in diverse scientific and engineering applications but remain computationally intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. Traditional numerical methods struggle with the exponential growth in computational complexity, particularly on hypercubic domains, where the number of required collocation points increases rapidly with dimensionality. Here, we introduce Anant-Net , an efficient neural surrogate that overcomes this challenge, enabling the solution of PDEs in high dimensions. Unlike hyperspheres, where the internal volume diminishes as dimensionality increases, hypercubes retain or expand their volume (for unit or larger length), making high-dimensional computations significantly more demanding. Anant-Net efficiently incorporates high-dimensional boundary conditions and minimizes the PDE residual at high-dimensional collocation points. To enhance interpretability, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold networks into the Anant-Net architecture. We benchmark Anant-Net’s performance on several linear and nonlinear high-dimensional equations, including the Poisson, Sine-Gordon, and Allen-Cahn equations, as well as transient heat equations, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness across randomly sampled test points from high-dimensional spaces. Importantly, Anant-Net achieves these results with remarkable efficiency, solving 300-dimensional problems on a single GPU within a few hours. We also compare Anant-Net’s results for accuracy and runtime with other state-of-the-art methods. Our findings establish Anant-Net as an accurate, interpretable, and scalable framework for efficiently solving high-dimensional PDEs.

From a theoretical perspective, we rigorously prove that the fully discrete scheme preserves the maximum principle, energy decay property and unique solvability, while also establishing the optimal error estimation theory. Numerical experimental results show that this scheme not only has good convergence but also maintains the discrete energy dissipation property, verifying its effectiveness and reliability in solving the AC equation.},

The recently proposed variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) offers potential acceleration for this task by using quantum computing. However, its application faces a critical bottleneck: the costly requirement to decompose the coefficient matrix into a linear combination of unitary matrices. In this work, we propose a decomposition-free variational quantum linear solver (DF-VQLS) that eliminates this requirement, enabling direct application without matrix decomposition. The key innovation lies in proposing two vectorization techniques, which map the cost functions of VQLS to the inner product of vectors. Specifically, the vectorization techniques reshape the matrix into a vector, and only manipulations on the vector are needed to compute the cost functions, thereby eliminating matrix decomposition entirely. The convergence and accuracy of the proposed method are validated through numerical examples on a quantum simulator. Three application examples in computational mechanics, including bar, truss, and two-dimensional continuum problems, are also presented to show the potential feasibility.},

This formulation enables the direct application of existing forward-advancing time integration schemes, such as explicit Runge–Kutta methods, to achieve high-order temporal accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed schemes are generalized for arbitrary particle movement, enabling the efficient incorporation of particle shifting without requiring additional particle movement or variable corrections. By applying Runge–Kutta methods, this study presents four single- or multistage schemes referred to as RK1–RK4, corresponding to the number of stages. The validity of the proposed schemes is rigorously evaluated through numerical investigations involving four test cases and three types of particle movement (Lagrangian, Eulerian, and quasi-Lagrangian). The results reveal that the proposed RK2, RK3, and RK4 schemes achieve second-, third-, and fourth-order temporal convergence, respectively, and exhibit substantially higher accuracy than conventional first-order schemes, leading to improved volume and energy conservation.

  abstract     = {Spatiotemporally chaotic systems, such as the solutions of some nonlinear partial differential equations, are dynamical systems that evolve toward a lower dimensional manifold. This manifold has an intricate geometry with heterogeneous density, which makes the design of a single (global) nonlinear reduced-order model (ROM) challenging. In this paper, we turn this around. Instead of modeling the manifold with one single model, we partition the manifold into clusters within which the dynamics are locally modeled. This results in a quantized local reduced-order model (ql-ROM), which consists of (i) quantizing the manifold via unsupervised clustering; (ii) constructing intrusive ROMs for each cluster; and (iii) connecting the switching of local models with a change of basis and assignment functions. We test the method on two nonlinear partial differential equations, i.e., the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and 2D Navier-Stokes equations (Kolmogorov flow), across bursting, chaotic, quasiperiodic, and turbulent regimes. The local models are built via Galerkin projection onto the local principal directions, which are centered on the cluster centroids. The dynamics are modeled by switching the local ROMs based on the cluster proximity. The proposed ql-ROM framework has three advantages over global ROMs (g-ROMs): (i) numerical stability, (ii) improved short-term prediction accuracy in time, and (iii) accurate prediction of long-term statistics, such as energy spectra and probability distributions. The computational overhead is minimal with respect to g-ROMs. The proposed framework retains the interpretability and simplicity of intrusive projection-based ROMs, whilst overcoming their limitations in modeling complex, high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics.},

While IGA has demonstrated superior accuracy in smooth problems due to its high-continuity basis functions, its performance in cases with sharp transitions, such as viscoplastic flows with localized singularities, presents unique challenges. To address this, we develop a stabilized isogeometric framework for viscoplastic Stokes flow using the Variational Multiscale (VMS) method, ensuring numerical stability and preventing spurious pressure oscillations in equal-order discretizations. Additionally, we integrate an embedded boundary approach based on the Shifted Boundary Method (SBM) to efficiently handle complex geometries without the need for body-fitted meshes. The effectiveness of this high-order stabilized IGA framework is assessed through numerical benchmarks. The results confirm that high-order B-Spline bases achieve optimal convergence in smooth regions, while their performance near yield surfaces is affected by localized oscillations due to the inherent continuity of the basis functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the SBM-IGA formulation successfully enforces boundary conditions in embedded domains while preserving high-order accuracy. These findings provide valuable insights into the role of basis smoothness, stabilization techniques, and embedded formulations in non-Newtonian flow simulations, offering a foundation for future advancements in isogeometric methods for complex fluids.},

Both types of coils are thermally separated, as the main coils are cryogenically cooled within a cryostat whilst gradient coils operate at room temperature. Externally generated floor-borne vibrations (FBV) can induce relative motion between radiation shields and coils, generating eddy currents in the shields. These in turn produce parasitic magnetic fields that compromise field homogeneity and degrade image quality. This paper presents a high-fidelity computational framework for simulating the magneto-mechanical effects of FBV in axisymmetric MRI scanners to inform the manufacturing design workflow. The approach introduces three key advancements: first , a nonlinear, fully coupled magneto-mechanical formulation solved using h p -Finite Element Methods ( h p -FEM) in the open-source NGSolve framework, with a focus on optimal interpolation order p and time step size; second , explicit mechanical modelling of both main and gradient coils, moving beyond idealised Biot-Savart type current sources; and third , the use of realistic axisymmetric geometries with structural connectivity between coils and radiation shields in order to inform preliminary designs in Industry.

In addition to the classical terms, contributions from the second gradient of deformation, electro-mechanical coupling and flexoelectricity are incorporated into the free energy density of these materials. Furthermore, starting from a variational framework, a nonlinear finite element formulation in the material setting is developed to provide numerical solutions for various problems. By neglecting the electrical and flexoelectric effects, the present formulation can reflect the deformation of purely mechanical gradient shells. Conversely, by disregarding the gradient and flexoelectric effects, the present formulation is greatly capable of modeling the deformation of electro-active shells. The midsurface displacement and director difference vectors are interpolated using C 1 shape functions, while C 0 -continuous interpolation functions are used for the thickness stretching and voltage parameters. Several numerical examples are solved to evaluate performance and robustness of the proposed formulation. The results show that the present formulation yields excellent agreement with those available in the literature. Moreover, the proposed formulation effectively captures the flexoelectric response of both initially flat and initially curved thin structures experiencing finite deformations.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the numerical approximation of the linearized shallow water equations using hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods, leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the evolution system. First, we propose an equivalent formulation of the equations by introducing an auxiliary variable. Then, we discretize the space variables using HDG methods, resulting in a semi-discrete scheme that preserves a discrete version of the Hamiltonian structure. The use of an alternative formulation with the auxiliary variable is crucial for developing the HDG scheme that preserves this Hamiltonian structure. The resulting system is subsequently discretized in time using symplectic integrators, ensuring the energy conservation of the fully discrete scheme. We present numerical experiments that demonstrate optimal convergence rates for all variables and showcase the conservation of total energy, as well as the evolution of other physical quantities.},

  abstract     = {Most model reduction methods reduce the state dimension and then temporally evolve a set of coefficients that encode the state in the reduced representation. In this paper, we instead employ an efficient representation of the entire trajectory of the state over some time interval of interest and then solve for the static coefficients that encode the trajectory on the interval. We use spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) modes, which are provably optimal for representing long trajectories and substantially outperform any representation of the trajectory in a purely spatial basis (e.g., POD). We develop a method to solve for the SPOD coefficients that encode the trajectories for forced linear dynamical systems given the forcing and initial condition, thereby obtaining the accurate prediction of the dynamics afforded by the SPOD representation of the trajectory. The method, which we refer to as spectral solution operator projection (SSOP), is derived by projecting the general time-domain solution for a linear time-invariant system onto the SPOD modes. We demonstrate the new method using two examples: a linearized Ginzburg-Landau equation and an advection-diffusion problem. In both cases, the error of the proposed method is orders of magnitude lower than that of POD-Galerkin projection and balanced truncation. The method is also fast, with CPU time comparable to or lower than both benchmarks in our examples. Finally, we describe a data-free space-time method that is a derivative of the proposed method and show that it is also more accurate than balanced truncation in most cases.},

  abstract     = {In conventional phase-field cohesive fracture methods, an upper bound on the phase-field length scale parameter is typically imposed to ensure the convexity of the energy degradation function. However, this constraint can result in substantial computational costs when analyzing large-scale structures, geological fractures, or fractures in high-strength materials. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel field variable that guarantees the convexity of the energy degradation function is always satisfied, thereby eliminating the physical constraint on the phase-field length scale parameter. Based on this innovation, a new class of phase-field cohesive fracture models is formulated using a variational approach, and the intrinsic relationship between the characteristic function and the cohesive law is established through the one-dimensional analytical solution. Both implicit and explicit dynamic algorithms are developed for the numerical implementation of the model. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulations of several typical fracture problems. The results indicate that the model can efficiently and accurately address large-scale fracture and high-strength material failure analyses, while maintaining insensitivity to the phase-field length scale parameter in both static and dynamic cases. These findings highlight the model’s potential for broad application in the computational analysis of complex fracture phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Porous structures, with their outstanding mechanical properties, play a crucial role in engineering applications and are an important consideration in material distribution optimization for structural dynamic performance. Recently, Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) has gained significant interest due to precise geometric representation, high-order continuity, and flexible topology evolution capabilities. Hence, this study proposes a novel infill design approach through a periodic constraint strategy in multiple Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) patches for two dynamic topology optimization problems, namely eigenfrequency maximization and dynamic compliance minimization. By coupling multiple NURBS patches in a conforming mesh, the complexity of the structural design domain is effectively enhanced. The Nitsche-type dynamic formulation is introduced within the IGA framework, and the theoretical analysis of the stabilization condition is performed. Furthermore, the periodic constraint strategy is imposed onto NURBS patches within the specified parameter direction, which controls the sensitivity update values of the objective function across these patches to generate a gradient porous structure. The global topology is described by the Density Distribution Function (DDF) to achieve full-scale topology optimization. The Multi-frequency Quasi-Static Ritz Vector (MQSRV) method is used to reduce the computational cost associated with dynamic problems. The mathematical models for the dynamic compliance minimization and the eigenfrequency maximization are established, where the sensitivity analysis is derived in detail. Finally, the optimized results produced by the work are fully applicable to complex structural design domains and exhibit well-defined boundaries and smooth gradient distributions. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-patch isogeometric topology optimization infill design method.},

  abstract     = {The strong form Direct Collocation Method (DCM) with Reproducing Kernel (RK) shape function is hindered in its development due to its computational complexity and low efficiency in derivative calculations. Furthermore, the nonlinear large deformation governing equations in strong form, which involve intricate derivative terms, introduce additional challenges for discretization and iterative solutions. This paper proposes a novel efficient and superconvergent Gradient Smoothing Stabilized Collocation Method (GSSCM) using RK shape function. Based upon the divergence theorem, the proposed method converts traditional subdomain integration in the Stabilized Collocation Method (SCM) into subdomain boundary integration by gradient smoothing, which reduces the order of derivatives and simplifies the discretized terms of governing equations. This allows RK shape function with low-order basis functions like the linear basis functions, and enhances computational efficiency. GSSCM ensures exact integration using low-order Gaussian quadrature and improves solution stability. Both conforming and non-conforming smoothing domain are constructed for the gradient smooth. The incremental Newton-Raphson iteration approach is employed to solve the nonlinear discrete equations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superconvergent rates when odd RK basis functions are used. The GSSCM can also outperform traditional DCM, SCM and Superconvergent Gradient Smoothing Meshfree Collocation (SGSMC) method with gradient smoothing of shape function in terms of computational efficiency under the same accuracy. Moreover, GSSCM-II with conforming integration subdomains generally outmatches GSSCM-I and SCM with non-conforming subdomains in accuracy, efficiency and stability. The advantages of GSSCMs hold significant promise for nonlinear solid mechanics and engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Designs generated by topology optimization are often geometrically too complex for conventional manufacturing techniques. While additive manufacturing holds promise for producing such complex designs, several manufacturability constraints must be addressed, including overhang and overheating. Unlike the well-studied overhang constraints, which can be described geometrically, overheating lacks a straightforward and reliable geometric characterization and therefore requires thermal process simulations to identify regions prone to it. However, these simulations are computationally expensive and thus unsuitable for topology optimization, which involves numerous design evaluations. This paper proposes a computationally efficient alternative for detecting zones prone to overheating. The key idea is to estimate local thermal conductivity—and thereby potential overheating—by analyzing the local material distribution. This geometric approach provides a physically motivated approximation of thermal behavior. The method is then integrated into topology optimization, resulting in optimized structures that exhibit clear heat conduction paths to the baseplate. Comparisons with high-fidelity thermal simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in mitigating overheating in topology optimization.},

The square phase field crystal equation models such pattern formation on atomic length and diffusive time scales. The governing equation, derived from a conserved gradient flow of a free energy, involves sixth-order spatial derivatives and Laplacian-gradient type nonlinear term, which result in severe stability restriction on the time stepsizes and difficulty in theoretical analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel unconditionally energy stable, third-order adaptive BDF scheme. The convex-splitting and a multistep stabilization are leveraged to maintain energy stable with arbitrary time stepsizes, and the adaptive time-stepping control based on evolution rate is applied to efficiently obtain high-resolution results. We strictly prove optimal error estimate in the variable-step setting under a mild step ratio constraint by enhancing the discrete kernel framework proposed recently. Numerical tests in 2D/3D demonstrate the square pattern evolution in crystallization process from random or supercooled liquid initial states over a long time. The adaptive algorithm reduces computation time by 95 % while capturing details of phases, confirming the effectiveness of our method. This is the first systematic work on adaptive high-order structure-preserving method for square phase field crystal.},

The framework rigorously links manufacturing conditions to the mechanical performance of the final product by integrating process-induced residual stresses, interfacial crystallinity, and polymer interpenetration into a cohesive zone model whose fracture properties evolve dynamically. Unlike existing approaches, which rely on phenomenological models or decoupled analyses, our formulation provides predictive capability grounded in continuum thermodynamics and validated by experimental observations. This enables not only the detection of manufacturing-induced interfacial defects but also virtual process optimization through simulation.

The novel framework is built on the premise that the irreversible evolution of material responses, governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data. We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby overcoming the self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone, HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To further enhance its ability to capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale feature extraction. Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities and discretization-invariant design, HANO provides an effective and flexible data-driven surrogate for simulating a broad class of inelastic materials.},

This paper proposes a mixed-depth physics-informed neural network ( md -PINN) for solving the complex PDEs, aiming to improve the efficiency of network structure and activation function. The contributions are two aspects: (1) the md -PINN includes the various mixed-depth blocks, each of which contains parallel connected deep sub-network and shallow sub-network. The deep sub-network captures complex physical features, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the system; while the shallow sub-network focuses on the basic physical features, facilitating the stable training; (2) the md -PINN introduces a new nest-tanh (.) activation functions with nested mechanism in shallow sub-networks to enable efficient extraction of complex features using fewer hidden layers, reducing reliance on deep networks. By incorporating mixed-depth structures, md -PINN enables more efficient information sharing across different layer, leading to faster convergence and improved training efficiency. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that md -PINN avoids suboptimal convergence with appropriate initialization. The proposed approach is validated across multiple PDEs, including heat transfer scenarios with complex boundaries, bi-material solid mechanical problems, Allen-Cahn equation, fluid dynamics, and the higher order Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. Results show that md -PINN exhibits the superior capabilities in approximating and capturing intricate system features.

  abstract     = {The constitutive model of metals is one of the most important elements in solid mechanics, as the mechanical behavior at different spatial scales is uncertain, and the constitutive model is inevitably subject to uncertainty of defects. The complexity of metal microstructure, coupled with the high cost of numerical simulation, poses a challenge in establishing the correlation between macro and micro uncertainties in metals. This article proposes a new uncertain constitutive model for hexagonal close packing (HCP) polycrystal, integrating Point defect and dislocation into micro-uncertainty analysis and developing a multiscale framework for calculating the uncertain constitutive model of metal. Building on density functional theory and microcrystalline plasticity theory, interval forms are employed as variables for micro-uncertainty, allowing for accurate quantification of uncertainties in parameters such as initial dislocation density. By constructing a surrogate model for cross-scale uncertainty propagation, the performance envelope of metals can be determined. The framework is then applied to engineering case study of α-phase pure titanium to calculate system responses.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a system non-probabilistic reliability-based design optimization (SNRBDO) framework for engineering structural systems. In view of the limitations of traditional probabilistic methods due to insufficient uncertainty information, the ellipsoidal convex model is used to quantify the uncertainty while considering the parameter correlation. The non-probabilistic credible set uncertainty method is employed to quantify the ellipsoidal uncertainty domain of uncertain parameters. A system non-probabilistic reliability index, defined as the volume ratio of safe regions to uncertainty domains, is introduced to evaluate structural safety under multiple failure modes. To enhance computational efficiency, Kriging surrogate model is utilized to replace the finite element analysis during optimization, and a localized sampling strategy is developed to refine accuracy near critical design points. The method is validated through a mathematical example and two engineering applications. The results demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency and design precision compared to conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {The immersed boundary (IB) method has become a leading approach in cardiac fluid-structure interaction (FSI) modeling due to its ability to handle large deformations and complex geometries without requiring mesh regeneration. However, the use of nonlinear, fiber-reinforced hyperelastic materials for modeling soft cardiac tissues introduces challenges in computational efficiency, particularly due to the additional projection steps required for stability in the IB framework. These steps often involve sparse matrix storage and computation, which can degrade GPU performance. In this work, we present a fully GPU-accelerated, matrix-free IB method for FSI in anatomically realistic cardiac models, which novelly integrates established components into a unified, GPU-optimized system. By employing nodal coupling, our method eliminates the need for projection operations in the finite element space. Additionally, we solve the Navier-Stokes equations using Chorin’s projection method combined with a matrix-free geometric multigrid solver, ensuring the entire FSI algorithm remains matrix-free and highly compatible with GPU acceleration. Our implementation features several GPU-specific optimizations, including the use of constant memory to store values of nodal basis functions and their derivatives at quadrature points, and texture memory to efficiently implement the semi-Lagrangian discretization of convection terms. These innovations maximize GPU utilization while preserving the complex mechanical behavior of soft cardiac tissue. Benchmark tests demonstrate that our GPU-accelerated solver achieves a 50 × − 100 × speedup compared to a 20-core CPU implementation, with comparable accuracy. Critically, this performance enables clinically viable cardiac valve FSI simulations to be completed within a few hours on a single consumer-grade GPU-an achievement that was previously infeasible using traditional CPU-based frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Accurate modeling of coupled solid-fluid systems in porous media poses intrinsic computational challenges due to the nonlinear interaction between kinematic fields and fluid transport. Although a wide spectrum of finite element formulations is documented in the literature, the majority are based on principles in which solid displacement and fluid pressure fields are treated as primary unknowns, leading to a saddle point problem, thus requiring the satisfaction of the inf-sup condition to ensure the well-posedness and stability of the mixed formulation. Furthermore, in critical scenarios, such as low permeability or small time steps, numerical instabilities, including pressure oscillations, may still occur, requiring the implementation of stabilization techniques or the adoption of high-resolution discretizations to maintain solution accuracy. The present contribution proposes a novel hybrid flux-preserving finite element formulation, designed to preserve mass flux consistency within each element, by adopting an alternative set of primary variables. An original hybrid variational principle is established, wherein the solid deformation and the mass flux fields are adopted as primary unknowns, while the fluid potential acts as a Lagrange multiplier to enforce weak continuity of mass flow across inter-element boundaries, thus avoiding the necessity of globally conforming function spaces. The resulting hybrid element is implemented within the open-source software FEAP. Its performance is assessed through classical benchmark problems in poroelasticity. In particular, the accurate resolution of the fluid pressure field highlights the advantages of the proposed formulation over classical displacement-pressure elements and shows the potential of the proposed method.},

An isochoric/volumetric decomposition is adopted, enabling the derivation of the peridynamic force state from a purely spherical, pointwise non-local deformation gradient and a deviatoric, bond-level non-local deformation gradient. This approach leads to a stable one-field, state-based peridynamic formulation that is free from zero-energy modes and capable of accurately capturing the mechanical behavior of elastic materials under large deformations, including those with low or negligible compressibility, typical of unfilled elastomers and isotropic soft biological tissues. Notably, the proposed correspondence model, based on a selective bond-associated deformation gradient, avoids the artificial stiffening commonly observed in standard displacement-based formulations near the incompressible limit. Moreover, its performance is shown to be independent of the specific compressibility ratio assumed in the hyperelastic constitutive law. The model has been successfully validated using classical polynomial strain energy functions through a series of illustrative examples involving both homogeneous and inhomogeneous finite deformations in isotropic hyperelastic solids.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have rapidly evolved since their robust capabilities of integrating physical laws into data-driven models. However, the multi-level co-optimization mechanism hidden in the collocation-type loss function in PINNs leads to conflicts between data and physical equations, as well as conflicts among pointwise residuals, which results in poor stability and conservation. In this paper, a stabilized physics-informed neural network (S-PINN) framework is proposed to alleviate these limitations. First, S-PINN incorporates local domains around collocation points for evaluating residuals of conserved quantities. These domains can be flexibly established by creating a square centered on the collocation point of the original PINN, without constructing any mesh with topological relations. During online training, S-PINN mitigates conflicts in the multi-level co-optimization by minimizing a novel loss function based on the cumulative residuals of conserved quantities in all subdomains, significantly enhancing conservation. Finally, the novel approach is applied to predict the dynamic characteristics of incompressible fluid problems, with benchmarks including the pressure Poisson equation of fluid, Burgers' equation, heat diffusion equation, and the Navier-Stokes equations. Results demonstrate notable advancements in both the conservation and accuracy of the S-PINN. While traditional PINN lays a solid foundation for model interpretability and integration of physical laws, the newly proposed S-PINN exhibits improved performances in multiples aspects compared to PINN. These improvements promote extensive applicability in solving partial differential equations integrated with observational data, which is crucial for the application of complex dynamic systems.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we apply the space–time Galerkin reduced basis (ST–GRB) method to a reduced fluid–structure interaction model, for the numerical simulation of hæmodynamics in arteries. In essence, ST–GRB extends the classical reduced basis (RB) method, exploiting a data–driven low–dimensional linear encoding of the temporal dynamics to further cut the computational costs. The current investigation brings forth two key enhancements, compared to previous works on the topic. On the one side, we model blood flow through the Navier–Stokes equations, hence accounting for convection. In this regard, we implement a hyper–reduction scheme, based on approximate space–time reduced affine decompositions, to deal with nonlinearities effectively. On the other side, we move beyond the constraint of modelling blood vessels as rigid structures, acknowledging the importance of elasticity for the accurate simulation of complex blood flow patterns. To limit computational complexity, we adopt the Coupled Momentum model, incorporating the effect of wall compliance in the fluid’s equations through a generalized Robin boundary condition. In particular, we propose an efficient strategy for handling the spatio–temporal projection of the structural displacement, which ultimately configures as a by–product. The performances of ST–GRB are assessed in three different numerical experiments. The results confirm that the proposed approach can outperform the classical RB method, yielding precise approximations of high–fidelity solutions at more convenient costs. However, the computational gains of ST–GRB vanish if the number of retained temporal modes is too large, which occurs either when complex dynamics arise or if very precise solutions are sought.},

Instead of minimizing all governing PDE residuals simultaneously, the Sharp-PINNs introduce a staggered training scheme that alternately minimizes the residuals of Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations, which govern the corrosion system. To further enhance its efficiency and accuracy, we design an advanced neural network architecture that integrates random Fourier features as coordinate embeddings, employs a modified multi-layer perceptron as the primary backbone, and enforces hard constraints in the output layer. This framework is benchmarked through simulations of corrosion problems with multiple pits, where the staggered training scheme and network architecture significantly improve both the efficiency and accuracy of PINNs. Moreover, in three-dimensional cases, our approach is 5–10 times faster than traditional finite element methods while maintaining competitive accuracy, demonstrating its potential for real-world engineering applications in corrosion prediction.},

A wide class of physical systems of interest have solutions that exhibit the formation of structures, called features, that have to be accurately captured by the assimilation framework. For example, fluids can develop features such as shock waves and contact discontinuities that need to be tracked and preserved during data assimilation. State-of-the-art data assimilation techniques are agnostic of such features. Current ensemble-based methods construct state estimates by taking linear combinations of multiple ensemble states; repeated averaging tends to smear the features over multiple assimilation cycles, leading to nonphysical state estimates. A novel feature-preserving data assimilation methodology that combines sequence alignment with the ensemble transform particle filter is proposed to overcome this limitation of existing assimilation algorithms. Specifically, optimal transport of particles is performed along feature-aligned characteristics. The strength of the proposed feature-preserving filtering approach is demonstrated on multiple test problems described by the compressible Euler equations.},

The convergence behavior in both the bulk domain fields and interfacial tractions is investigated for SIVMS and is compared to conventional methods such as the Lagrange multiplier method and Nitsche’s method. The difficulty in selecting appropriate values of parameters for Nitsche’s method is highlighted. In contrast, SIVMS provides stabilization that emanates naturally from the assumed fine-scale basis functions.

We first utilize a stable stress-displacement mixed finite element method to discretize the linear elasticity problem and then present the construction of multiscale basis functions for the displacement and the stress. The mixed formulation offers several advantages such as direct stress computation without post-processing, local momentum conservation (ensuring physical consistency), and robustness against locking effects, even for nearly incompressible materials. Theoretical analysis confirms that our method is inf-sup stable and locking-free, with first-order convergence relative to the coarse mesh size. Notably, the convergence remains independent of contrast ratios as enlarging oversampling regions. Numerical experiments validate the method’s effectiveness, demonstrating its superior performance even under extreme contrast conditions.},

However, existing probabilistic approaches struggle to balance computational efficiency with comprehensive uncertainty quantification. To this end, this paper introduces an analytical hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) framework that overcomes these limitations through utilization of complex-valued FRF data and variational inference. In particular, the proposed approach incorporates a complex Gaussian likelihood formulation directly into the HBM framework for the FRF experimental data, which allows for a more appropriate and physically consistent treatment of FRF data, particularly when both magnitude and phase information (real and imaginary parts) are essential. Additionally, the proposed approach enables the analytical HBM solution under the complex likelihood setting, improving both the accuracy of parameter estimation and the efficiency of the computation. The framework further propagates the parameter uncertainty to the response predictions and reliability assessment. Numerical and experimental validations on a simply supported beam demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results indicate that the proposed framework provides a reasonable uncertainty estimate of the model parameters as well as the response predictions. Reliability computations on the numerical example also suggest that the proposed framework provides conservative and reliable failure probability estimates, compared to the classical Bayesian modeling which often leads to unsafe engineering decisions.},

  abstract     = {The conventional peridynamic material correspondence formulation is known to suffer from issue of material instability or existence of zero-energy modes. This issue arises from the non-unique mapping between the nonlocal deformation gradient and the resulting bond force density state. Among many stabilization techniques proposed to handle this issue, a number of bond-associated models that employ bond-level deformation gradients have emerged as more effective approaches. Although initially developed from different theoretical perspectives, many of these models share underlying structural similarities. This paper aims to unify these differing approaches and introduce a generalized framework for all bond-associated peridynamic material correspondence models. On the basis of formulations proposed in the literature, a unified expression for the bond-associated deformation gradient is developed. Assuming energy equivalence with the local continuum mechanics theory, the unified bond force density state is derived using the Fréchet derivative. In addition, some properties of the bond-associated models, including linear momentum balance, angular momentum balance, and objectivity, are thoroughly examined. To assess and compare the performance of bond-associated models, a series of numerical studies are carried out, including bond mapping analysis, elastic deformation prediction, and elastic wave propagation modeling. It is found that in wave propagation modeling the use of non-constant spherical influence functions, even though this is common in peridynamic models, can lead to phase shift phenomena in certain bond-associated models. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive and unified treatment of bond-associated peridynamic material correspondence models, and it is intended to serve as a valuable reference for further development and application of bond-associated material correspondence formulations in peridynamics.},

  abstract     = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is an efficient and robust particle-based method for large deformation problems such as strongly nonlinear free interface flow and structural damage due to its meshless characteristics. However, achieving consistent high-order accuracy remains a fundamental challenge under irregular particle distributions, which often leads to significant accuracy degradation in conventional SPH interpolation schemes. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative high-order SPH framework to systematically improve the accuracy of gradient and Laplacian operators through multiple layers of Taylor expansions. An adaptive iteration strategy is introduced at each expansion layer, resulting in a recursive correction that utilizes high-order derivatives to improve low-order estimates, thereby improving consistency and robustness for inhomogeneous particle fields. To maintain accuracy near domain boundaries, a new high-order ghost particle extrapolation scheme is developed to ensure consistency of spatial derivatives. The proposed framework is validated on a series of typical incompressible viscous flow benchmarks, including Taylor-Green vortex, Lamb-Osing vortex, inviscid shear layer, Burggraf flow, and Lid driven flow. Results show that the proposed approach achieves up to fourth-order convergence even with irregular particle arrangements and improves simulation accuracy by two orders of magnitude compared to the conventional SPH formulation. By avoiding the use of high-order kernel functions and large matrix systems, this method provides a scalable approach for high-fidelity particle-based simulations.},

The method employs a dual-network collaborative architecture, utilizing two fully connected networks incorporating Fourier transformations to approximate the displacement field and the multiphase field, respectively. This approach enables a fully physics-driven optimization process throughout the entire workflow. The displacement field is approximated via the deep energy method, using the principle of minimum potential energy as the driving mechanism. Within the phase-field framework, an energy functional is constructed that incorporates the classical Ginzburg-Landau free energy, elastic strain energy and volume fraction constraints. This functional serves as the loss function that couples the displacement and phase fields, promoting the balancing of mechanical performance, interface thickness, material volume fractions, and phase repulsion during network training. Thus it achieves a deep integration of multi-material physical information. The pretraining strategy effectively reduces convergence time and enhances optimization performance. Automatic differentiation replaces traditional sensitivity analysis, enhancing computational efficiency, while appropriate control of sampling points balances training cost and accuracy. Several numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This work introduces a contact interaction methodology for an unbiased treatment of contacting surfaces without assigning surfaces as master and slave. Contact tractions between interacting discrete segments are evaluated with respect to a midplane in a single pass, inherently maintaining traction equilibrium. These tractions are based on the penalisation of true interpenetration between opposite surfaces, and the procedure of their integral for discrete contacting segments is described. A detailed examination of the possible geometric configurations of interacting 3D segments is provided to support visual understanding and better traction evaluation accuracy. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are validated against the analytical solutions of the contact patch test and Hertzian contact, demonstrating the capability to reproduce contact between flat and curved surfaces. The method passes the contact patch test with the uniform transmission of contact pressure matching the accuracy levels of finite elements. It converges towards the analytical solution with appropriate mesh refinement and a suitably high penalty factor in Hertzian contact. Dynamic problems involving elastic and inelastic collisions between two bars, as well as oblique collisions of cylinders, are also presented. The ability of the algorithm to resolve contacts between flat and curved surfaces in nonconformal meshes for both static and dynamic cases with high accuracy demonstrates its versatility for general contact problems, including self-contact.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven approaches have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional numerical methods for forecasting physical systems, offering fast inference and reduced computational costs. However, for complex systems and those without prior knowledge, the accuracy of long-term predictions frequently deteriorates due to error accumulation. Existing solutions often adopt an autoregressive approach that unrolls multiple time steps during each training iteration; although effective for long-term forecasting, this method requires storing entire unrolling sequences in GPU memory, leading to high resource demands. Moreover, optimizing for long-term accuracy in autoregressive frameworks can compromise short-term performance. To address these challenges, we introduce the Stochastic PushForward (SPF) training framework in this paper. SPF preserves the one-step-ahead training paradigm while still enabling multi-step-ahead learning. It dynamically constructs a supplementary dataset from the model’s predictions and uses this dataset in combination with the original training data. By drawing inputs from both the ground truth and model-generated predictions through a stochastic acquisition strategy, SPF naturally balances short- and long-term predictive performance and further reduces overfitting and improves generalization. Furthermore, the training process is executed in a one-step-ahead manner, with multi-step-ahead predictions precomputed between epochs-thus eliminating the need to retain entire unrolling sequences in memory, thus keeping memory usage stable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPF on the Burgers’ equation and the Shallow Water benchmark. Experimental results demonstrated that SPF delivers superior long-term accuracy compared to autoregressive approaches while reducing memory consumption. This positions SPF as a promising solution for resource-constrained environments and complex physical simulations.},

The formulation is physically frame-invariant, applicable to large deformations, and relevant to fluidic surfaces such as soap films, capillary menisci and lipid membranes, which are complex and inherently unstable physical systems. It is applied here to area-incompressible surface flows using a stabilized pressure-velocity (or surface tension-velocity) formulation based on quadratic finite elements and implicit time integration. The unknown ALE mesh motion is determined by membrane elasticity such that the in-plane mesh motion is stabilized without affecting the physical behavior of the system. The resulting three-field system is monolithically coupled, and fully linearized within the Newton-Rhapson solution method. The new formulation is demonstrated on several challenging examples including shear flow on self-evolving surfaces and inflating soap bubbles with partial inflow on evolving boundaries. Optimal convergence rates are obtained in all cases. Particularly advantageous are C 1 -continuous surface discretizations, for example based on NURBS.},

  abstract     = {Accurately capturing the nonlinear dynamic behavior of structures remains a significant challenge in mechanics and engineering. Traditional physics-based models and data-driven approaches often struggle to simultaneously ensure model interpretability, noise robustness, and estimation optimality. To address this issue, this paper proposes an Adaptive Physics-Informed System Modeling with Control (APSMC) framework. By integrating Kalman filter-based state estimation with physics-constrained proximal gradient optimization, the framework adaptively updates time-varying state-space model parameters while processing real-time input–output data under white noise disturbances. Theoretically, this process is equivalent to real-time tracking of the Jacobian matrix of a nonlinear dynamical system. Within this framework, we leverage the theoretical foundation of stochastic subspace identification to demonstrate that, as observational data accumulates, the APSMC algorithm yields state-space model estimates that converge to the theoretically optimal solution. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through numerical simulations of a Duffing oscillator and the seismic response of a frame structure, as well as experimental tests on a scaled bridge model and real wind turbine health monitoring data. Experimental results show that, under noisy conditions, APSMC successfully predicts 19 consecutive 10-second time series using only a single initial 10-second segment for model updating, achieving a minimum normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 0.398 %. Furthermore, APSMC achieves the best performance among classical time-domain algorithms on measured wind turbine acceleration data. These findings demonstrate that the APSMC framework not only offers superior online identification and denoising performance but also provides a reliable foundation for downstream applications such as structural health monitoring, real-time control, adaptive filtering, and system identification.

The GraphGPS framework combines the benefits of positional encodings, local message-passing of graphs, and global contextual awareness, and we explore the latter two components through an ablation study. Furthermore, we modify the aggregation step of message-passing such that it is aware of shocks and discontinuities, resulting in sharper reconstructions of these features. Additionally, we modify message-passing such that information flows strictly from known nodes only, which results in computational savings, better training convergence, and no degradation of reconstruction accuracy.

These algorithms are integrated into the worker phase of the NMRA. A new stagnation phase is introduced in WIFN to minimize the effect of local optima stagnation. To add self-adaptivity, five new mutation/inertia weight strategies are added to the parameters of WIFN. To assess its performance, four data sets are used: classical benchmarks, CEC 2014, CEC 2017 and CEC 2019. An experimental study is carried out using i) five constrained engineering design problems and ii) 15 real-world constrained problems from the CEC 2020 benchmark dataset to analyze the applicability of WIFN for computationally expensive problems. In addition, WIFN is applied to multilevel image thresholding with type-II fuzzy sets. It is tested using a real image set that features different histogram distributions for three different threshold numbers. Experimental results suggest that WIFN perform significantly better than the existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of quality metrics, viz. mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity index (SSIM).

As a proof of concept, the present work relies on synthetic data generated through virtual experiments. To generate input data for our approach, an experiment with full-field measurement has to be conducted to gather testing force and corresponding displacement field of the sample. Then, in the first step of the dual-stage framework, a new finite strain Data-Driven Identification (DDI) formulation is applied. This method enables to identify tuples consisting of stresses and strains by only prescribing the applied boundary conditions and the measured displacement field. In the second step, the data set is used to calibrate a Physics-Augmented Neural Network (PANN), which fulfills all common conditions of hyperelasticity by construction and is very flexible at the same time. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by several descriptive examples. Two-dimensional synthetic data are exemplarily generated in virtual experiments by using a reference constitutive model. The calibrated PANN is then applied in 3D Finite Element simulations. In addition, a real experiment including noisy data is mimicked.},
