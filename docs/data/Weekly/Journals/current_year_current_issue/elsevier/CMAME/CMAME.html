  abstract     = {Accurate free energy density representations are crucial for understanding phase dynamics in materials. We employ a scale-bridging approach to incorporate atomistic information into our free energy density model by training a neural network on DFT-informed Monte Carlo data. To optimize sampling in the high-dimensional Monte Carlo space, we present an active learning framework that integrates space-filling sampling, uncertainty-based sampling, and physics-informed sampling. Additionally, our approach includes methods such as hyperparameter tuning, dynamic sampling, and novelty enforcement. These strategies can be combined to reduce the mean squared error-either globally or in targeted regions of interest-while minimizing the number of required data points. The framework introduced here is broadly applicable to Monte Carlo sampling of a range of materials systems.},

  abstract     = {Random vibration analysis of high-dimensional dynamical systems is a fundamental problem in science and engineering, yet it remains challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. While dimension-reduced formulations have been developed for differential-type equations governing time-variant probability density, such as the Fokker-Planck equation, no equivalent formulation has been established for the integral-type Chapman-Kolmogorov (CK) equation, despite its theoretical importance and computational advantages. In this paper, a novel dimension-reduced Chapman-Kolmogorov (DRCK) equation is established governing the transient probability density function (PDF) of any quantity of interest in high-dimensional Markov systems. The derivation is conducted based on the projection of the full Chapman-Kolmogorov equation onto the dimension-reduced space. It is established that the intrinsic transition probability density (TPD) of the DRCK equation is the conditional expectation of the original TPD. Further, the short-time approximate intrinsic TPDs under both Gaussian and Poisson white noise excitations are derived analytically, enabling practical numerical implementation. The proposed DRCK equation provides a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient framework for high-dimensional stochastic systems. Numerical examples are developed to demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness. The DRCK equation thus provides a new tool for reliability assessment and uncertainty quantification in complex engineering applications.},

The VEM framework is based on the projection of unknown basis functions onto polynomial spaces, allowing for flexible discretization with arbitrary polyhedral meshes. While most existing VEM formulations for 3D mechanical problems are discretized using first-order formulations, higher-order schemes offer improved precision, especially for nonlinear problems. However, conventional second-order VEM formulations introduce additional degrees of freedom (DOFs), such as body and surface moments, which complicate the implementation and reduce computation efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a novel 3D second-order serendipity VEM that avoids any extra moment-related DOFs. This is the first application of a serendipity VEM to 3D static and dynamic problems in hyperelasticity. Furthermore, by integrating advanced mesh generation techniques, the proposed method enables hybrid simulations that combine second-order serendipity VEM and FEM to efficiently handle complex geometries.},

This study presents a stabilized explicit MPM framework that integrates dual high-order B-spline volume averaging to address these challenges. The proposed dual averaging technique simultaneously smooths deformation gradients and pressure fields using cubic B-spline basis functions to eliminate cell-crossing errors and reduce volumetric locking. A blended APIC/FLIP mapping scheme is developed to enhance energy conservation and stability at coarse grid resolutions. The framework is further enhanced by seamlessly integrating various complementary techniques such as Î´ -correction, pressure smoothing, and specialized boundary handling for more robust and effective modeling of free-surface and FSI problems. The framework is rigorously validated through benchmark cases, including 1D elastic wave propagation, Poiseuille flow, lid-driven cavity flow, water sloshing, dam break, and water impact on elastic obstacles. The simulation results demonstrate a remarkable reduction in pressure oscillations and improved particle distribution uniformity compared to prior MPM approaches. The proposed method establishes a robust and efficient tool for large-deformation FSI problems and bridges gaps in accuracy and stability for industrial-scale applications.},

However, the integration of advanced models of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) transport in the lumen and across the endothelium with agent-based models (ABMs) of plaque growth remains underexplored. Furthermore, patient-specific applications are lacking. This study introduces a novel agent-based modeling framework for atherosclerosis, integrating hemodynamics and LDL transport in the lumen through computational fluid dynamics simulations, a three-pore model of trans-endothelial LDL migration, and an ABM of lipid and cellular dynamics. For the first time, the framework was applied to a patient-specific coronary artery and validated against 1-year follow-up data. Furthermore, it was used to explore potential plaque evolution over 5 years and under elevated LDL concentration. The calibrated model predicted the 1-year variation in wall area in two patient-specific coronary cross-sections with an error of less than 10%. Simulated scenarios indicated that variations in blood LDL concentrations can result in distinct plaque morphologies, from localized to diffuse patterns. This study provided an innovative, advanced multiscale model of atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression. As the first patient-specific application of a multiscale agent-based modeling framework for atherosclerosis with initial validation, this study underscored the potential of the approach for deciphering the mechanobiological pathways driving coronary plaque progression. The developed model provided valuable insights into how the interplay between LDL transport and hemodynamics influences arterial wall cellular dynamics in a patient-specific context.},

To construct the multiscale space, we solve linear fine-scale problems on small local subdomains, for which we consider two different linearization techniques.

  abstract     = {This paper extends the isogeometric MITC shell formulation proposed by Mi and Yu (2021) for linear analysis to address geometric nonlinear shell problems. Built on the Reissner-Mindlin shell theory, the original linear formulation employs the Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial Components (MITC) technique to alleviate shear and membrane locking. The present nonlinear extension retains the MITC framework while incorporating a mixed Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS)-Lagrange interpolation strategy to address the additional complexities induced by geometric nonlinearity. The interpolatory nature of the Lagrange basis functions is leveraged to simplify the construction of director vectors and assumed strain fields. The nonlinear problem is formulated in a total Lagrangian setting and solved using Newton-Raphson iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a comprehensive set of numerical examples, including both standard benchmarks and a collection of geometric nonlinear shell problems, which features challenging behaviors such as large rotations and the development of local creases. Through BÃ©zier extraction, the method is further evaluated using T-spline and U-spline basis functions. The numerical results confirm that the MITC technique effectively suppresses shear and membrane locking, and the proposed shell formulation exhibits high accuracy and robust convergence, even for coarse and severely distorted meshes. However, it is also observed that the high inter-element continuity inherent in splines-based discretization can inhibit large deformations, introducing a new form of locking. This issue is successfully mitigated using BÃ©zier extraction to reduce the inter-element continuity. Overall, the proposed formulation offers a general and reliable isogeometric framework for geometrically nonlinear analysis, applicable across a wide range of shell geometries, loading conditions, and boundary constraints.},

  abstract     = {The homogenized constrained mixture theory has been implemented in different Finite-Element software packages for almost ten years to simulate growth and remodeling in soft biological tissues. In these models, it is essential to determine the pre-stresses of each constituent of the mixture in the reference configuration. However, no efficient numerical solution has been proposed so far to solve this problem. We propose to address this lack with a new algorithm based on the concept of anisotropic thermal contraction. In this algorithm, the pre-stretch tensor is incrementally updated by applying a series of anisotropic thermal contractions to each representative volume element of the model to restore its reference configuration. These contractions are proportional to the inverse of the local right stretch tensor, obtained through the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient. We implemented the algorithm in the Abaqus Finite-Element package through a UMAT subroutine and verified it on examples including growth and remodeling of a patient-specific aorta. We demonstrate that the model captures the residual stresses in good agreement with experimental results. To highlight the potential clinical relevance of the proposed algorithm, we expanded our model predictions to investigate the influence of the aortic axial pre-stretch on morphological and microstructural evolutions of the aorta under hypertensive conditions. Our simulations show that loss of axial tension, induced by hypertension, increases aortic length and may lead to pathological deformations such as aortic tortuosity. These findings highlight the importance of efficiently determining pre-stresses for simulating long-term vascular growth and remodeling.},

  abstract     = {Seismic structural response is a critical indicator for assessing collapse resistance and ensuring post-earthquake functionality. Therefore, accurate and rapid prediction of these responses is essential, with Deep Learning (DL) models offering a robust alternative to finite element methods due to their computational efficiency and capability to model nonlinear dynamic responses of structures. However, prevailing DL approaches predominantly focus on unidirectional seismic excitations, often neglecting the complex effects of bidirectional seismic excitations on real-world structures. Furthermore, while the development of the physics-informed neural network effectively enhances interpretability under limited data, most existing approaches incorporate physical constraints solely into the loss function, potentially leading to optimization conflicts and slow convergence rates. To bridge these gaps, this study introduces a novel physics-guided hybrid deep learning framework, the Physical Residual Long Short-term Memory network-KolmogorovâArnold network model (Phy-RLK), for real-time bidirectional seismic structural response prediction. The proposed DL architecture embeds the Newmark- Î² numerical integration scheme as a physical residual within LSTM cells. Simultaneously, the adaptive basis functions of the KAN enhance the feature extraction capability from bidirectional seismic inputs, enabling real-time correction of acceleration, velocity, and displacement predictions at each time step, thereby ensuring improved accuracy and physical consistency. The effectiveness of the proposed model is initially verified on a six-story Reinforced Concrete (RC) frame structure, determining optimal hyperparameters in the process. An ablation study further confirms the necessity of both the physics-residual LSTM cell and KAN layer. The model is subsequently implemented on a five-story RC frame structure to verify accuracy and applicability. The experimental results demonstrate that the Phy-RLK provides superior predictive accuracy and robustness, and significantly higher computational efficiency compared to finite element simulations.},

  abstract     = {The need for accurate and fast scale-resolving simulations of fluid flows, where turbulent dispersion is a crucial physical feature, is evident. Large-eddy simulations (LES) are computationally more affordable than direct numerical simulations, but their accuracy depends on sub-grid scale models and the quality of the computational mesh. In order to compensate related errors, a data assimilation approach for LES is devised in this work. The presented method is based on variational assimilation of sparse time-averaged velocity reference data. Working with the time-averaged LES momentum equation allows to employ a stationary discrete adjoint method. Therefore, a stationary corrective force in the unsteady LES momentum equation is iteratively updated within the gradient-based optimization framework in conjunction with the adjoint gradient. After data assimilation, corrected anisotropic Reynolds stresses are inferred from the stationary corrective force. Ultimately, this corrective force that acts on the mean velocity is replaced by a term that scales the velocity fluctuations through nudging of the corrected anisotropic Reynolds stresses. Efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated for turbulent flow over periodic hills and around a square cylinder. Coarse meshes are leveraged to further enhance the speed of the optimization procedure. Time- and spanwise-averaged velocity reference data from high-fidelity simulations is taken from the literature. Our results demonstrate that adjoint-based assimilation of averaged velocity enables the optimization of the mean flow, vortex shedding frequency (i. e., Strouhal number), and anisotropic Reynolds stresses. This highlights the superiority of scale-resolving simulations such as LES over simulations based on the (unsteady) Reynolds-averaged equations.},

  abstract     = {Continuous fiber reinforced composites (CFRCs) are composite materials with exceptional mechanical properties to enhance structural mechanical performance. In comparison with traditional three-axis 3D printing (also referred to as 2.5D printing), multi-axis 3D printing simultaneously moves the nozzle and rotates the build platform during the printing process, making it particularly suited for fabricating spatial structures made of CFRCs due to better alignment between the fiber depositions and principal stress directions. In this research, we propose a Derivable Geodesics-coupled Topology Optimization (DGTO) method for design of CFRCs given the manufacturing scheme of multi-axis 3D printing. A prominent feature of DGTO is the introduction of two geodesic fields to achieve curved layer generation and continuous fiber path planning. The heat diffusion equation and Poisson equation are solved to produce the geodesic fields, and hence, all objective functions and constraints related to the slices and paths are derivable, making them perfectly suitable to be integrated with topology optimization. Hence, the proposed method concurrently optimizes the density field and the auxiliary geodesic fields, simultaneously tuning the material distribution and spatial fiber distribution, thereby attaining optimal performance while fulfilling the manufacturing constraints of multi-axis printing, i.e., self-support of structure and overlap/gap-free of continuous fibers. Four numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, especially showing outstanding performances than designs for traditional three-axis 3D printing.},

  abstract     = {Reliability analysis is crucial for ensuring structural integrity, yet it requires repeated, time-consuming evaluations of responses and multivariate limit state functions, while struggling to provide full-field estimations efficiently. Therefore, we propose an active evolutionary reduced Gaussian Process framework ( AER-GP ) for fast and large-scale full-field reliability analysis and critical domain prognosis, utilizing only a few initial samples. In which we first define a novel probability indicator of erroneously evaluating the sign of the minimum of the full-field limit state function. Based on this, we then develop an efficient convergence criterion that relies on the expected error in failure probability estimates. Furthermore, we advance the dual order-reduced Gaussian process coupled Monte Carlo methods to accurately predict the large-scale full-field stochastic response under material and load uncertainty. Where the preliminary design of experiments starts from a significantly small number of sets (e.g.,5), and is progressively added by those samples containing the most information to distinguish the failure boundary. More importantly, we propose a novel mechanism for structural critical domain prognosis mechanism based on the failure probability of each single material point within the entire field, and make accurate critical domain prognosis. Real-world examples, including a car wheel hub and a single-tower cable-stayed bridge, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves high prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness in large-scale structural reliability analysis and critical domain prognosis. It consistently outperforms widely used methods such as AK-MCS, EFF-MCS, ERF-MCS, and H-MCS. Notably, the proposed AER-GP method requires only a small number of initial DoE samples (fewer than 40), and through adaptive learning, it can reliably produce results with very low errors (typically less than 2%).},

  abstract     = {Wave propagation is considered in a two-dimensional (2D) elastic structure, which includes a relatively small region whose behavior is fully 2D and a long and slender region whose bending behavior is like that of a Timoshenko beam. To save in computational effort, the latter region is reduced to a genuinely one-dimensional (1D) Timoshenko beam. The mathematical and computational problem posed then involves the coupling of the two regions, such that a well-posed, accurate, numerically stable and efficient hybrid 2D-elastic-Timoshenko-beam model is formed. The appropriate interface conditions are derived, and the well-posedness of the time-dependent problem is proved. A new computational coupling method is proposed, where the shape functions associated with the axial degrees of freedom on the interface of the elastic solid are modified in a special manner, to allow for the rotation continuity. The method results in a symmetric, positive and stable finite element formulation. Numerical examples are presented which demonstrate the performance of the scheme.},

  abstract     = {We present a computational framework that combines a variable stiffness boundary condition (VSBC) with a phase-field model to evaluate the effective fracture toughness of heterogeneous materials. It is built on the so-called surfing boundary condition (SBC) that applies nonuniform displacement at the remote boundary to stabilize crack-propagation in a heterogeneous medium. Unlike SBC, VSBC is easily implementable in traditional universal testing machines and commercial software packages. The VSBC passively translates a simple, uniform remote displacement into a non-uniform load via an engineered stiffness gradient, enabling the stable, natural propagation of cracks along energetically favorable paths. The framework is validated on homogeneous materials, where the calculated J -integral precisely matches the prescribed fracture toughness. When applied to heterogeneous domains, the VSBC method successfully quantifies the increase in effective toughness due to stiffness and toughness contrasts and captures the critical transition from crack penetration to deflection. Experimental validation using 3D-printed samples confirms the modelâs predictive capability. The VSBC framework provides a robust easily accessible tool for investigating fracture in complex materials and guide the design of advanced, fracture-resistant composites.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate models for the rapid inference of nonlinear boundary value problems in mechanics are helpful in a broad range of engineering applications. However, effective surrogate modeling of applications involving the contact of deformable bodies, especially in the context of varying geometries, is still an open issue. In particular, existing methods are confined to rigid body contact or, at best, contact between rigid and soft objects with well-defined contact planes. Furthermore, they employ contact or collision detection filters that serve as a rapid test but use only the necessary and not sufficient conditions for detection. In this work, we present a graph neural network architecture that utilizes continuous collision detection and, for the first time, incorporates sufficient conditions designed for contact between soft deformable bodies. We test its performance on two benchmarks, including a problem in soft tissue mechanics of predicting the closed state of a bioprosthetic aortic valve. We find a regularizing effect on adding additional contact terms to the loss function, leading to better generalization of the network. These benefits hold for simple contact at similar planes and element normal angles, and complex contact at differing planes and element normal angles. We also demonstrate that the framework can handle varying reference geometries. However, such benefits come with high computational costs during training, resulting in a trade-off that may not always be favorable. We quantify the training cost and the resulting inference speedups on various hardware architectures. Importantly, our graph neural network implementation results in up to a hundred- to thousand-fold speedup on GPU, and twenty- to two hundred-fold speedup on CPU for our benchmark problems at inference.},

  abstract     = {We present a personalized multiscale mechanics model of the left atrium (LA) to simulate its deformation throughout the cardiac cycle and drive blood flow. Our patient data-driven model tightly integrates 3D structural mechanics of the LA myocardium, incorporating both passive and active components, with a 0D closed-loop lumped parameter network (LPN)-based circulatory system model. A finite element (FE) model of LA tissue is constructed from the patientâs images, assuming uniform thickness and employing rule-based fiber directions. We then adopted a multi-step personalization approach, in which the LPN parameters with a surrogate LA model are first optimized to match cuff-based blood pressures and cardiac lumen volumes derived from time-resolved 3D gated computed tomography angiography (CTA) images. The surrogate LA pressure during passive expansion is used to estimate myocardial passive mechanics parameters and the reference unloaded configuration using an inverse finite element analysis (iFEA) framework. Finally, a robust multiscale coupling is applied between the iFEA-optimized FE model and the tuned 0D LPN model to characterize LA contraction. This effectively captures the physiological LA pressure-volume curve and reasonably aligns with the image-based cavity volumes and deformation. We then imposed the resulting simulation-predicted deformation as a moving-wall boundary condition to model atrial hemodynamics. We analyzed the model sensitivities to various simplifications to demonstrate its robustness and versatility and discussed potential future improvements. Overall, this comprehensive digital twinning platform could be applied to study LA biomechanics in health and disease and assist in devising personalized treatment plans.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a quantum machine learning-assisted approach to accelerating density-based topology optimization using quantum neural network (QNN), a class of trainable models based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). The proposed framework extracts key features from classical data, starting by encoding the corresponding finite element analysis results, i.e., strain energy, sensitivity, and design variables from early design iterations obtained using the standard optimizer. Then, the PQCs are fine-tuned using minimization of the binary cross-entropy loss function, enabling the model to learn the mapping between input features and optimal design. Specifically, the framework consists of two main stages. First, an offline training stage where the QNN is calibrated using precomputed iterative results from a relatively coarse mesh obtained through the standard optimizer, establishing pattern recognition between input features and the final design variables. The second is an online stage where the trained QNN model is integrated with the standard optimizer to accelerate the final design. Numerical results show that QNN requires only a small number of qubits, and once trained on coarse meshes with several different boundary conditions, can effectively integrate with standard optimizers to predict target designs across various configurations, including different resolutions, volume constraints, and loading conditions. Furthermore, the proposed QNN-assisted framework significantly reduces computational time compared to standard iterative approaches, laying the groundwork for solving large-scale problems with near-term quantum computers.},

Recent advances in generative modeling aim to address these issues by providing uncertainty quantification and correction. However, the quality of generated simulation remains heavily dependent on the choice of conditioning prior. In this work, we present an efficient generative framework for nonlinear dynamics emulation, connecting principles of turbulence with diffusion-based modeling: Cohesion. Our method estimates large-scale coherent structure of the underlying dynamics as guidance during the denoising process, where small-scale fluctuation in the flow is then resolved. These coherent prior are efficiently approximated using reduced-order models, such as deep Koopman operators, that allow for rapid generation of long prior sequences while maintaining stability over extended forecasting horizon. With this gain, we can reframe forecasting as trajectory planning, a common task in reinforcement learning, where conditional denoising is performed once over entire sequences, minimizing the computational cost of autoregressive-based generative methods. Numerical evaluations on chaotic systems of increasing complexity, including Kolmogorov flow, shallow water equations, and subseasonal-to-seasonal climate dynamics, demonstrate Cohesion superior long-range forecasting skill that can efficiently generate physically-consistent simulations, even in the presence of partially-observed guidance.},

However, the low symmetry of most tensegrity units has hindered the analysis of realistic 3D structures. As a result, tensegrity-based modeling in cell mechanics has been mainly focused on single cells or monolayers. In this paper, we propose a 3D tensegrity model based on the finite element method for simulating 3D cell mechanics. We show that the proposed model not only captures the nonlinearity of a single cell in an indentation test and a monolayer in stretch test but also the non-uniform stress distribution in multicellular spheroids upon non-uniform prestress design.

Traditional methods for multi-configuration lattice optimization employ extreme strategies of complete fusion or separation, leading to a trade-off between optimality and scalability that has not been fully addressed in the existing literature. The paper suggests decomposing the lattice library into pairs of lattices, through which multi-configuration lattice optimization is decoupled into the concurrent optimization of iso-value, combination category, and ratio within combination. A novel hybrid interpolation scheme is proposed to describe the effective mechanical behavior of the configuration-decoupled lattices. In this approach, polynomial models are employed to characterize the performance of individual lattice combinations, while the Uniform Multiphase Materials Interpolation model is used to integrate the contributions of all combinations. Benchmark experiments, including full-scale simulations, are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the framework. The proposed method enables rapid convergence to configuration layouts that align with the principal stress orientations. Compared to single- and dual-configuration designs, it achieves compliance reductions of 61.0 % and 26.2 %, respectively, approaching the performance of density-based topology optimization. Extended numerical experiments reveal the joint influence of resolution and configuration count on the overall performance. This method achieves a better trade-off between optimality and extensibility, enabling more flexible utilization of large lattice databases in practical engineering fields.},

Random-walk Metropolis Methods (also known as Metropolis-Hastings (MH)), in particular, are highly popular for their simplicity, flexibility, and ease of implementation. However, most MH algorithms suffer from significant limitations when attempting to sample from distributions with multiple modes (particularly disconnected ones). In this paper, we present Intrepid MCMC - a novel MH scheme that utilizes a simple coordinate transformation to significantly improve the mode-finding ability and convergence rate to the target distribution of random-walk Markov chains while retaining most of the simplicity of the vanilla MH paradigm. Through multiple examples, we showcase the improvement in the performance of Intrepid MCMC over vanilla MH for a wide variety of target distribution shapes. We also provide an analysis of the mixing behavior of the Intrepid Markov chain, as well as the efficiency of our algorithm for increasing dimensions. A thorough discussion is presented on the practical implementation of the Intrepid MCMC algorithm. Finally, its utility is highlighted through a Bayesian parameter inference problem for a two-degree-of-freedom oscillator under free vibration.},

These normals and relative surface positions are updated each time step according to particle deformation. The tractions are converted to cohesive forces using the nodal areas and mapped back to particles using the same reference shape function mappings. These forces are then remapped by conventional particle-to-grid interpolation as external forces using the current-configuration shape-function mappings. This allows highly compliant cohesive zones to function over jump displacements larger than a grid cell. Upon damage, these interfaces can revert to conventional multi-field contact surfaces. This approach is general and readily applies to two and three dimensions as well as being compatible with damage-field gradient partitioning offering exceptional computational flexibility. The framework for this method enables other capabilities, such as improved contact precision using explicitly defined surface normals and positions, and a method to mitigate spurious material damage at weak discontinuities between stiff brittle materials and soft or compliant materials.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this work is to construct and analyze two-level overlapping additive Schwarz (OAS) preconditioners for isogeometric discretizations of the acoustic wave equation with absorbing boundary conditions. Both Collocation and Galerkin isogeometric methods are employed for space discretization, while time advancing is performed by means of a Newmark implicit scheme. The linear systems to be solved at each time step are ill conditioned, especially in case of highly regular splines, thus their solution requires the use of effective preconditioners. Two-level OAS solvers consist of partitioning the domain into overlapping subdomains, solving independent local problems on each subdomain and an additional coarse problem associated with the subdomain mesh. Several two-dimensional numerical results validate our theoretical estimates, showing the scalability and quasi-optimality of the algorithms proposed. We also investigate numerically the robustness of the OAS preconditioners with respect to the spline polynomial degree, the spline regularity and the overlap parameter.},

  abstract     = {Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to science and engineering. Since solving them is computationally expensive, a lot of effort has been put into approximating their solution operator via both traditional and recently increasingly Deep Learning (DL) techniques. In this paper, we propose an autoregressive and data-driven method using the analogy with classical numerical solvers for time-dependent, parametric and (typically) nonlinear PDEs. We present how Dimensionality Reduction (DR) can be coupled with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) in order to learn the solution operator of arbitrary PDEs accounting both for (continuous) time and parameter dependency. The idea of our work is that it is possible to map the high-fidelity (i.e., high-dimensional) PDE solution space into a reduced (low-dimensional) space, which subsequently exhibits dynamics governed by a (latent) Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). Solving this (easier) ODE in the reduced space allows avoiding solving the PDE in the high-dimensional solution space, thus decreasing the computational burden for repeated calculations for e.g., uncertainty quantification or design optimization purposes. The main outcome of this work is the importance of exploiting DR as opposed to the recent trend of building large and complex architectures: we show that by leveraging DR we can deliver not only more accurate predictions, but also a considerably lighter and faster DL model compared to existing methodologies.},

  abstract     = {This contribution proposes a new and significantly enhanced extension of a recently-introduced hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based reduced-order modeling approach for the numerical solution of time-dependent partial differential equations on non-parametric finite element meshes. Building upon previous proof-of-concept work, this more generalized framework presents a number of key novelties: tight integration of graph-based learning with physical information via direct imposition of finite element operators as node and edge level features; introduction of a Grassmannian subspace distance measure as a dedicated training objective; incorporation of a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for a more efficient and lightweight architecture; hybridization with other Galerkin-based reduced-order methods such as the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD); and a first treatment of nonlinear problems. A novel, on-the-fly enrichment mechanism, modified from a classical Proper General Decomposition (PGD) and dubbed âBoosted PGDâ, is additionally introduced to improve prediction accuracy at low computational cost via additional greedy corrective modes. The efficacy of the overall methodology is assessed on two challenging datasets featuring significant geometric and topological variations that include highly heterogeneous spatial discretizations. A variety of performance studies demonstrate very competitive accuracy and computational cost in simulating highly-dynamic behavior when compared to conventional full-order finite element models, including a remarkable capacity to generalize to configurations well outside of the topological scope of the original training and validation sets. Results imply that solvers constructed from such an approach may enable more scalable and robust mechanical simulations for complex, real-world engineering applications related to iterative design.},

  abstract     = {Interface failure plays a critical role in the degradation of heterogeneous materials, often governing structural integrity across a range of applications from fiber-reinforced composites to polycrystalline rocks. This paper introduces a novel model reduction frameworkâthe Weighted Eigenseparation-based Residual (WER) approachâfor efficiently simulating interface failure using cohesive zone models. Two variants of the WER are developed: a force-based formulation that weakly enforces equilibrium equations at the interface at the modal level and a separation-based formulation that weakly enforces contact conditions at the modal level. These formulations are supported by precomputed influence functions within representative volume elements (RVEs), significantly reducing computational cost while preserving accuracy. The separation-based variant, in particular, demonstrates broad applicability across microstructures with interface junctions. Numerical examples in two and three dimensionsâincluding fiber composites and geological microstructuresâdemonstrate the effectiveness, convergence behavior, and computational advantages of the WER over direct numerical simulations. The results show that high-fidelity predictions can be obtained even with coarsely discretized interface modes, confirming the robustness and versatility of the WER methodology.},
