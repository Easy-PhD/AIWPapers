  abstract     = {Powder-scale simulation of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is increasingly vital for understanding, predicting, and controlling metallurgical defects. However, the complex multi-physics and multi-material interactions involved, along with high computational demands, pose significant challenges. This study presents the first multiphase smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation framework for LPBF under both low and high evaporation regimes, incorporating a multi-resolution particle strategy and ray tracing (RT). An adaptive particle refinement (APR) method, compatible with multiphase SPH and optimized for GPU acceleration, is developed to enhance computational efficiency of the multiphase model. The RT model is also optimized and integrated with the APR-GPU architecture, further improving performance. A physics-based wetting force model is introduced, along with a novel method for improving normal vector accuracy near the contact line. The proposed framework is validated through three benchmark cases and applied to simulate LPBF processes. The results demonstrate that the framework achieves high accuracy and efficiency in resolving key LPBF phenomena, including melt pool dynamics and keyhole formation.},

  abstract     = {The need for accurate and fast scale-resolving simulations of fluid flows, where turbulent dispersion is a crucial physical feature, is evident. Large-eddy simulations (LES) are computationally more affordable than direct numerical simulations, but their accuracy depends on sub-grid scale models and the quality of the computational mesh. In order to compensate related errors, a data assimilation approach for LES is devised in this work. The presented method is based on variational assimilation of sparse time-averaged velocity reference data. Working with the time-averaged LES momentum equation allows to employ a stationary discrete adjoint method. Therefore, a stationary corrective force in the unsteady LES momentum equation is iteratively updated within the gradient-based optimization framework in conjunction with the adjoint gradient. After data assimilation, corrected anisotropic Reynolds stresses are inferred from the stationary corrective force. Ultimately, this corrective force that acts on the mean velocity is replaced by a term that scales the velocity fluctuations through nudging of the corrected anisotropic Reynolds stresses. Efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated for turbulent flow over periodic hills and around a square cylinder. Coarse meshes are leveraged to further enhance the speed of the optimization procedure. Time- and spanwise-averaged velocity reference data from high-fidelity simulations is taken from the literature. Our results demonstrate that adjoint-based assimilation of averaged velocity enables the optimization of the mean flow, vortex shedding frequency (i. e., Strouhal number), and anisotropic Reynolds stresses. This highlights the superiority of scale-resolving simulations such as LES over simulations based on the (unsteady) Reynolds-averaged equations.},

  abstract     = {Continuous fiber reinforced composites (CFRCs) are composite materials with exceptional mechanical properties to enhance structural mechanical performance. In comparison with traditional three-axis 3D printing (also referred to as 2.5D printing), multi-axis 3D printing simultaneously moves the nozzle and rotates the build platform during the printing process, making it particularly suited for fabricating spatial structures made of CFRCs due to better alignment between the fiber depositions and principal stress directions. In this research, we propose a Derivable Geodesics-coupled Topology Optimization (DGTO) method for design of CFRCs given the manufacturing scheme of multi-axis 3D printing. A prominent feature of DGTO is the introduction of two geodesic fields to achieve curved layer generation and continuous fiber path planning. The heat diffusion equation and Poisson equation are solved to produce the geodesic fields, and hence, all objective functions and constraints related to the slices and paths are derivable, making them perfectly suitable to be integrated with topology optimization. Hence, the proposed method concurrently optimizes the density field and the auxiliary geodesic fields, simultaneously tuning the material distribution and spatial fiber distribution, thereby attaining optimal performance while fulfilling the manufacturing constraints of multi-axis printing, i.e., self-support of structure and overlap/gap-free of continuous fibers. Four numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, especially showing outstanding performances than designs for traditional three-axis 3D printing.},

  abstract     = {Reliability analysis is crucial for ensuring structural integrity, yet it requires repeated, time-consuming evaluations of responses and multivariate limit state functions, while struggling to provide full-field estimations efficiently. Therefore, we propose an active evolutionary reduced Gaussian Process framework ( AER-GP ) for fast and large-scale full-field reliability analysis and critical domain prognosis, utilizing only a few initial samples. In which we first define a novel probability indicator of erroneously evaluating the sign of the minimum of the full-field limit state function. Based on this, we then develop an efficient convergence criterion that relies on the expected error in failure probability estimates. Furthermore, we advance the dual order-reduced Gaussian process coupled Monte Carlo methods to accurately predict the large-scale full-field stochastic response under material and load uncertainty. Where the preliminary design of experiments starts from a significantly small number of sets (e.g.,5), and is progressively added by those samples containing the most information to distinguish the failure boundary. More importantly, we propose a novel mechanism for structural critical domain prognosis mechanism based on the failure probability of each single material point within the entire field, and make accurate critical domain prognosis. Real-world examples, including a car wheel hub and a single-tower cable-stayed bridge, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves high prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness in large-scale structural reliability analysis and critical domain prognosis. It consistently outperforms widely used methods such as AK-MCS, EFF-MCS, ERF-MCS, and H-MCS. Notably, the proposed AER-GP method requires only a small number of initial DoE samples (fewer than 40), and through adaptive learning, it can reliably produce results with very low errors (typically less than 2%).},

  abstract     = {Surrogate models for the rapid inference of nonlinear boundary value problems in mechanics are helpful in a broad range of engineering applications. However, effective surrogate modeling of applications involving the contact of deformable bodies, especially in the context of varying geometries, is still an open issue. In particular, existing methods are confined to rigid body contact or, at best, contact between rigid and soft objects with well-defined contact planes. Furthermore, they employ contact or collision detection filters that serve as a rapid test but use only the necessary and not sufficient conditions for detection. In this work, we present a graph neural network architecture that utilizes continuous collision detection and, for the first time, incorporates sufficient conditions designed for contact between soft deformable bodies. We test its performance on two benchmarks, including a problem in soft tissue mechanics of predicting the closed state of a bioprosthetic aortic valve. We find a regularizing effect on adding additional contact terms to the loss function, leading to better generalization of the network. These benefits hold for simple contact at similar planes and element normal angles, and complex contact at differing planes and element normal angles. We also demonstrate that the framework can handle varying reference geometries. However, such benefits come with high computational costs during training, resulting in a trade-off that may not always be favorable. We quantify the training cost and the resulting inference speedups on various hardware architectures. Importantly, our graph neural network implementation results in up to a hundred- to thousand-fold speedup on GPU, and twenty- to two hundred-fold speedup on CPU for our benchmark problems at inference.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a quantum machine learning-assisted approach to accelerating density-based topology optimization using quantum neural network (QNN), a class of trainable models based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). The proposed framework extracts key features from classical data, starting by encoding the corresponding finite element analysis results, i.e., strain energy, sensitivity, and design variables from early design iterations obtained using the standard optimizer. Then, the PQCs are fine-tuned using minimization of the binary cross-entropy loss function, enabling the model to learn the mapping between input features and optimal design. Specifically, the framework consists of two main stages. First, an offline training stage where the QNN is calibrated using precomputed iterative results from a relatively coarse mesh obtained through the standard optimizer, establishing pattern recognition between input features and the final design variables. The second is an online stage where the trained QNN model is integrated with the standard optimizer to accelerate the final design. Numerical results show that QNN requires only a small number of qubits, and once trained on coarse meshes with several different boundary conditions, can effectively integrate with standard optimizers to predict target designs across various configurations, including different resolutions, volume constraints, and loading conditions. Furthermore, the proposed QNN-assisted framework significantly reduces computational time compared to standard iterative approaches, laying the groundwork for solving large-scale problems with near-term quantum computers.},

Recent advances in generative modeling aim to address these issues by providing uncertainty quantification and correction. However, the quality of generated simulation remains heavily dependent on the choice of conditioning prior. In this work, we present an efficient generative framework for nonlinear dynamics emulation, connecting principles of turbulence with diffusion-based modeling: Cohesion. Our method estimates large-scale coherent structure of the underlying dynamics as guidance during the denoising process, where small-scale fluctuation in the flow is then resolved. These coherent prior are efficiently approximated using reduced-order models, such as deep Koopman operators, that allow for rapid generation of long prior sequences while maintaining stability over extended forecasting horizon. With this gain, we can reframe forecasting as trajectory planning, a common task in reinforcement learning, where conditional denoising is performed once over entire sequences, minimizing the computational cost of autoregressive-based generative methods. Numerical evaluations on chaotic systems of increasing complexity, including Kolmogorov flow, shallow water equations, and subseasonal-to-seasonal climate dynamics, demonstrate Cohesion superior long-range forecasting skill that can efficiently generate physically-consistent simulations, even in the presence of partially-observed guidance.},

Traditional methods for multi-configuration lattice optimization employ extreme strategies of complete fusion or separation, leading to a trade-off between optimality and scalability that has not been fully addressed in the existing literature. The paper suggests decomposing the lattice library into pairs of lattices, through which multi-configuration lattice optimization is decoupled into the concurrent optimization of iso-value, combination category, and ratio within combination. A novel hybrid interpolation scheme is proposed to describe the effective mechanical behavior of the configuration-decoupled lattices. In this approach, polynomial models are employed to characterize the performance of individual lattice combinations, while the Uniform Multiphase Materials Interpolation model is used to integrate the contributions of all combinations. Benchmark experiments, including full-scale simulations, are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the framework. The proposed method enables rapid convergence to configuration layouts that align with the principal stress orientations. Compared to single- and dual-configuration designs, it achieves compliance reductions of 61.0 % and 26.2 %, respectively, approaching the performance of density-based topology optimization. Extended numerical experiments reveal the joint influence of resolution and configuration count on the overall performance. This method achieves a better trade-off between optimality and extensibility, enabling more flexible utilization of large lattice databases in practical engineering fields.},

However, most MH algorithms suffer from significant limitations when attempting to sample from distributions with multiple modes (particularly disconnected ones). In this paper, we present Intrepid MCMC - a novel MH scheme that utilizes a simple coordinate transformation to significantly improve the mode-finding ability and convergence rate to the target distribution of random-walk Markov chains while retaining most of the simplicity of the vanilla MH paradigm. Through multiple examples, we showcase the improvement in the performance of Intrepid MCMC over vanilla MH for a wide variety of target distribution shapes. We also provide an analysis of the mixing behavior of the Intrepid Markov chain, as well as the efficiency of our algorithm for increasing dimensions. A thorough discussion is presented on the practical implementation of the Intrepid MCMC algorithm.

The linear systems to be solved at each time step are ill conditioned, especially in case of highly regular splines, thus their solution requires the use of effective preconditioners. Two-level OAS solvers consist of partitioning the domain into overlapping subdomains, solving independent local problems on each subdomain and an additional coarse problem associated with the subdomain mesh.

  abstract     = {Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to science and engineering. Since solving them is computationally expensive, a lot of effort has been put into approximating their solution operator via both traditional and recently increasingly Deep Learning (DL) techniques. In this paper, we propose an autoregressive and data-driven method using the analogy with classical numerical solvers for time-dependent, parametric and (typically) nonlinear PDEs. We present how Dimensionality Reduction (DR) can be coupled with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) in order to learn the solution operator of arbitrary PDEs accounting both for (continuous) time and parameter dependency. The idea of our work is that it is possible to map the high-fidelity (i.e., high-dimensional) PDE solution space into a reduced (low-dimensional) space, which subsequently exhibits dynamics governed by a (latent) Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). Solving this (easier) ODE in the reduced space allows avoiding solving the PDE in the high-dimensional solution space, thus decreasing the computational burden for repeated calculations for e.g., uncertainty quantification or design optimization purposes. The main outcome of this work is the importance of exploiting DR as opposed to the recent trend of building large and complex architectures: we show that by leveraging DR we can deliver not only more accurate predictions, but also a considerably lighter and faster DL model compared to existing methodologies.},
