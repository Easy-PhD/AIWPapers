  abstract     = {Preference-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms have attracted much attention in the area of evolutionary computation. However, there are only a few researchers incorporating performance indicators for designing preference-based evolutionary algorithm. In this paper, we propose a preference modified inverted generational distance indicator guided algorithm, named PIGA, for evolutionary multi-objective optimization. The main purpose is that decision-makers provide their preferences, ultimately identifying the portion of Pareto optimal solutions where are located in region of interest. A new preference construction strategy based on coordinate transformation is first proposed. The reference points in the whole objective space can be projected into the preference space, obtaining the preferred reference points. The non-preferred reference points remain in the original objective space, outside the specified preference region. In addition, we define the distance between the candidate solution and preferred reference points as the preference distance and the distance to non-preferred reference points as the penalty distance. Finally, a preference-based modified inverted generational distance indicator is formulated to obtain the preferred optimal solutions according to the preferences and penalty distances. The comparative results are comprehensively analyzed by comparing it with some related preference-based evolutionary algorithms on some test instances. Experimental results have validated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm under different scenarios with the given preference range.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for product customization has highlighted the importance of make-to-order (MTO) material delivery. Although manufacturers have deployed intelligent reconfigurable job shops equipped with flexible workstations and automated guided vehicles (AGVs), challenges remain due to inefficient material scheduling, delayed deliveries, and the complexity arising from diverse material types. This study proposes an active delivery strategy based on a workshop material supermarket, in which both AGV path planning and workstation layout are jointly optimized in response to dynamically changing orders. A multi-objective delivery path model is formulated to support demand splitting while minimizing material delivery costs and maximizing timeliness satisfaction. The model incorporates constraints related to AGV capacity, path feasibility, and demand alignment. To address the nonlinearity and complexity of the problem, an improved chaotic multi-verse optimizer (ICMVO) is proposed. The algorithm employs chaotic encoding to enhance population diversity and mitigate premature convergence. It further integrates gravitational and collision operators to improve global and local search capabilities and adopts adaptive orbital dynamics control to balance exploration and exploitation. A dual-population iterative strategy is employed to enable joint decision-making on workstation coordinates, path direction, and vehicle assignment. Through comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art meta-heuristics, the superiority of the ICMVO algorithm and the effectiveness of its components are demonstrated. Moreover, the proposed material delivery optimization method is implemented in a cloud–edge–terminal system and validated in practical MTO reconfigurable job shops through improvements in productivity and cost efficiency.},

An effective watermarking algorithm embeds a special mark into an image that does not change the image content but can be extracted from it even after some common post-processing operations such as cropping or compression. Many authors use metaheuristic optimization algorithms to achieve a trade-off between imperceptibility and robustness of embedding. In recent years, researchers have been interested in hybrid metaheuristics, which combine operations of individual metaheuristics in some way. However, designs and compositions of hybrid metaheuristic optimization schemes for image watermarking have not been sufficiently studied to date. In this paper, we present an experimental study of various hybrid metaheuristics including sequential, interleaved, and parallel schemes for popular bioinspired optimization algorithms including genetic algorithm, differential evolution algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm, firefly algorithm, and artificial bee colony algorithm. We evaluate the effectiveness of hybrid metaheuristics for image watermarking using an algorithm based on changing the ratio between absolute values ​​of sums of discrete cosine transform coefficient groups as an example and perform an experimental comparison of different schemes. The results of the study show that a approach to metaheuristic hybridization and a composition of hybrid scheme significantly affect the imperceptibility and robustness of the image watermarking algorithm. In particular, the interleaved hybridization type provides the best results for the algorithm under consideration.},

  abstract     = {Personnel scheduling remains a significant organizational challenge with substantial potential for cost and time savings. Despite extensive research in this domain, few studies have been successfully implemented in practice, and even fewer have gained widespread acceptance among end-users. This gap between research and application often arises from oversimplified real-world models, which may result from subjective solution evaluations or a lack of collaboration between modelers and end-users. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a machine learning-enhanced memetic algorithm (MLMA) that mimics schedules created by experts to solve a highly complex personnel scheduling problem involving multi-skilled workers and flexible shift types (irregular workforce)—a real-world challenge commonly faced in the hospitality sector. By leveraging historical scheduling preferences, the MLMA generates solutions that align with past practices, enhancing their practicality and appeal to end-users. Experiments conducted on real-life instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing real-world problems, where the workforce is predominantly part-time, possesses mixed skills, and requires flexible shifts. Furthermore, the results highlight the MLMA’s ability to identify shift patterns that closely resemble historical schedules, underscoring its potential for practical implementation and its role in bridging the gap between research and real-world application.},

First, a mixed integer linear programming model is formulized to minimize the maximum completion time, total costs, and total tardiness. Second, a learning-and-knowledge-assisted multi-population collaborative evolutionary algorithm is developed to settle the model. Genetic operators are adopted to improve the global and local search abilities. Three subpopulations with adaptive crossover and mutation probabilities are constructed to enhance the convergence and diversity of population. A Q-learning-assisted cooperative approach is adopted to realize the information communication among subpopulations in the genetic operations. The Q-learning method is used to intelligently choose parent individuals from three subpopulations by utilizing its self-learning strategies. A variable neighborhood search approach considering problem-knowledge neighborhood structures is devised to refine the excellent individuals in population. Finally, the presented algorithm is compared against three well-known intelligent optimization methods on a collection of instances.

Considering these challenges, this paper aims to reduce the makespan, cost, and total tardiness in Joint Scheduling of Virtual Machines and Prioritize Tasks (JSVPT) by a multi-objective optimization framework. We designed a novel Cluster-Based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA-CD/RLPD) framework, which includes a three-tier encoding scheme with Reinforcement Learning (RL)-guided local search, preselection, and dynamic resource allocation strategy to solve the problem. To guide the search process, we employ K-means clustering to decompose the population into diverse subgroups, promoting balanced exploration. The pre-selection mechanism uses a classifier to identify promising solutions in the decision space, which allows resources to be used effectively. Reinforcement learning adaptively selects intensification operators based on reward feedback, improving exploitation by intensifying promising regions of the search space. An Improved Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (ISPEA2) is incorporated to maintain a diverse and high-quality Pareto archive. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed on multiple test instances covering different scales and benchmarked against five state-of-the-art Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs).

  abstract     = {Most prior studies on the Distributed Assembly Flowshop Scheduling Problem (DAFSP) presume infinite buffer capacity for assembly machines. However, in practical DAFSP, assembly buffers are often limited, potentially leading to a deadlock where buffers are full of jobs yet none of them can be assembled into a product. Since the deadlock in DAFSP is caused by incorrect jobs’ sequences in assembly buffers, we formulate a Petri net to model this entry process for the first time. Based on this Petri net model and improved Banker algorithm (IBA), we develop a polynomial-complexity algorithm IDAM to ensure the deadlock-free decoding of a DAFSP solution, which is coded by job and factory permutations. The makespan of such a solution is calculated backward to maintain its deadlock-free property. Furthermore, according to the proposed coding-decoding paradigm for deadlock-free solutions, we propose a hybrid cooperative co-evolution (HCCE) algorithm for DAFSP to minimize the makespan. Notably, our HCCE algorithm incorporates an elite archive (EAR) and two subpopulations. It employs problem-specific operators for heuristic initialization and global-search procedures, and four local-search operators are successively applied to every individual in the EAR. Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed HCCE algorithm.},

  abstract     = {A high-quality ensemble strategy can effectively integrate several coefficients, mechanisms, and algorithms into a single framework. The adaptability, timing of intervention, and complementarity are the key factors to consider for the selected coefficients, mechanisms, and algorithms. In this study, two complementary variants based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), namely Modified PSO (MPSO) and Social Learning PSO (SLPSO), were selected, forming IMPSO and ISLPSO after improvements. IMPSO excels at exploration, while ISLPSO excels at exploitation. The Improved Novel Ratio Adaptation Scheme (INRAS) is employed as a selection strategy and provides the ability to abandon less-optimal particles. The Modified Nonlinear Population Size Reduction (MNLPSR) enables the extension of generations, allowing for more sufficient evolution in later stages. Due to the use of MNLPSR, an improved inertia weight and adaptive acceleration coefficients are introduced to ensure compatibility with the proposed algorithm. Additionally, an improved dynamic differential mutation strategy is designed not only to be compatible with the proposed algorithm but also to enhance particle diversity. Both the Improved Sine Cosine Algorithm (ISCA) and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP), which focus on searching near the global best particles, are incorporated into the proposed ensemble strategy. This PSO-based variant is named the Effective Combination of Mechanisms for a PSO-based Ensemble Strategy (ECM-PSOES). Ablation experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the individual coefficients and mechanisms. The novel PSO-based variant was evaluated on the CEC2017 benchmarks and compared with 14 state-of-the-art PSO-based variants and 11 non-PSO algorithms. Additionally, to evaluate the flexible and robust capability of the proposed algorithm, three real-world applications for long-term Transmission Network Expansion Planning (TNEP), Planetary Gear Train Design (PGTD), and Robot Gripper Design (RGD) were tested. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed algorithm displays superior performance compared to recently proposed PSO-based variants and most non-PSO algorithms. However, the proposed algorithm falls short of outperforming Differential Evolution (DE)-based algorithms and still requires time to match the performance of top-tier metaheuristics.

The weight optimization method based on problem transformation can effectively address LSMOPs, demonstrating superior convergence compared to most evolutionary algorithms. However, existing problem transformation methods often fail to balance convergence and diversity, leading to get trapped in local optima. In order to effectively solve this problem, we propose an adaptive weight optimization algorithm based on variable grouping (GWOEA). The algorithm optimizes weights within groups to accelerate population convergence, while the adaptive control strategy boosts diversity, avoiding local optima and ensuring a balance between convergence and diversity during the optimization process. To reduce the size of solving LSMOPs, weight optimization is performed by grouping decision variables. The weights of variables within each group are first computed, and then these weights are directly optimized instead of the decision variables. The adaptive control strategy is designed to detect whether population evolution has stagnated and to handle stagnant populations, ensuring that the population retains its ability to explore. To evaluate the effectiveness of GWOEA, comprehensive comparative experiments are conducted on benchmark test problems, including variable sizes ranging from 500 to 5000. The results show that the proposed algorithm has relatively better optimization performance.},

  abstract     = {Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are fundamental to numerous real-world applications, ranging from logistics and scheduling to resource allocation. For solving CO problems, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a widely used metaheuristic that simulates cooperative foraging behavior to iteratively construct high-quality solutions. However, traditional ACO suffers from handcrafted heuristic functions that fail to generalize across different instances and uniform pheromone initialization, which results in inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce G raph T ransformer G uided A nt C olony O ptimization- GTG-ACO , a novel approach that jointly learns both heuristic and initial pheromone matrices, enabling the model to generalize across diverse problem instances without manual tuning. Additionally, GTG-ACO employs Graph Transformer augmented with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) network as the backbone for heuristic and pheromone learner. The Graph Transformers enable adaptive representation learning by leveraging attention mechanisms to dynamically capture structural relationships in graph representation of combinatorial optimization problems. Additionally, SE networks enhance the model by recalibrating feature importance, ensuring that critical information is amplified while suppressing less relevant features. Extensive evaluations on four combinatorial optimization problems—Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), Single Machine Total Weighted Tardiness Problem (SMTWTP) and Bin Packing Problem (BPP)—demonstrate that GTG-ACO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines achieving improvements ranging from 1% to 56%. Furthermore, we validate its real-world applicability by evaluating it on benchmark datasets TSPLIB and CVRPLIB. Thus, GTG-ACO establishes itself as a powerful and generalizable framework by jointly learning heuristic and pheromone matrices, enabling more informed exploration, which leads to superior solution quality in combinatorial optimization problems.

This study comprehensively evaluates MOAs from different paradigms: swarm intelligence (CMOPSO), genetic algorithms (NSGA-II, DCNSGA-III), and decomposition-based approaches (CMOEA/D) for optimizing the gait cycle of a 25 DOF NAO humanoid robot during single support phase (SSP) and double support phase (DSP) scenarios. The algorithms’ convergence, diversity, and constraint-handling capabilities are systematically analyzed in solving the gait generation problem. The bi-objective optimization simultaneously minimizes power consumption and maximizes dynamic stability subject to eight functional constraints with 12-13 decision parameters. Through performance evaluation using running inverted generational distance (IGD) and hypervolume (HV) metrics across eleven independent runs of each algorithm, NSGA-II emerges as the most suitable algorithm, demonstrating superior convergence and solution quality, while CMOPSO shows competitive performance with faster initial convergence. DCNSGA-III exhibits moderate performance with constraint-handling difficulties, and CMOEA/D demonstrates poor convergence characteristics requiring significantly more computational resources. Two distinct knee regions emerge during both SSP and DSP, representing optimal trade-off solutions, with a systematic framework provided for practitioners to select appropriate gait parameters based on operational priorities. The running IGD metric combined with HV validation demonstrates effectiveness in providing robust algorithmic insights, enabling practitioners to select suitable algorithms for similar complex real-world optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {In multimodal optimization using Covariance Matrix Adaptation-Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), redundant restarts are caused by repeated convergence to previously explored local basins, which leads to significant computational resource waste. To address this problem, previous research proposed the concept of Repelling Restart and developed RR-CMA-ES, but issues remain regarding rigid repulsion and gradient information of local basin structures. Building on this foundation, we propose an Adaptive Landscape-aware Repelling Restart CMA-ES (ALR-CMA-ES) that enhances the original RR-CMA-ES through three key improvements: 1) A fitness sensitive dynamic exclusion mechanism that adaptively adjusts tabu region radius based on local optimality and convergence frequency, prioritizing avoidance of high-quality basins; 2) A covariance matrix mechanism preserving convergence history to geometrically align hyper-ellipsoidal exclusion regions with explored local basin landscapes; 3) A Boltzmann-like probabilistic acceptance scheme incorporating exclusion regions, permit- ting controlled exploration near tabu boundaries. Experiments on the BBOB benchmark demonstrate that ALR-CMA-ES outperforms RR-CMA-ES in 90% of tested problems spanning 2D to 50D. This method provides a practical solution for expensive black-box optimization by systematically integrating landscape topology awareness into tabu mechanisms, while proposing a new solution for multimodal optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Driven by the “dual carbon” strategic goals, the coordinated optimization of energy consumption and production efficiency has become a core issue for manufacturing industries. As an important means to promote energy structure transformation, electric substitution has made significant progress in industrial manufacturing, transportation, household electrification, and other fields. Among them, industrial production accounts for over 60% of the total electric energy substitution, becoming the largest electricity consumer. Note that the electricity price is based on time-of-use pricing (TOU), meanwhile, electric consumption is related to the machine multi-state (MM). Regarding these matters, this study focuses on determining sensible machine states and formulating reasonable production scheduling plan, to minimize both production time and power consumption. First, a novel energy-efficient flexible job shop scheduling problem is developed, which considers both the TOU strategy and the MM conditions (EFJSP-MM-TOU). Second, a self-learning classification-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (SCMOEA) is proposed to solve the EFJSP-MM-TOU. In specific, the SCMOEA enhances population diversity through a hybrid initialization strategy, adopts a dynamic selection of cross individuals based on the self-learning classification mechanism to improve the search efficiency, and designs four local search operators to increase the potential for approaching better positions. Third, by employing the MK standard dataset in EFJSP-MM-TOU, the proposed SCMOEA is compared with its three variants and five state-of-the-art algorithms to verify its optimization performance. The experimental results suggest that SCMOEA has advantages in terms of Pareto optimal solutions’ diversity and convergence. Finally, by testing in an actual enterprise case, the results further support the effectiveness of the EFJSP-MM-TOU and the significance of SCMOEA.},

  abstract     = {Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) learns policies solely from fixed pre-collected datasets, making it applicable to use-cases where data collection is expensive or risky. Consequently, the performance of these offline learners is highly dependent on the dataset used. Still the questions of how this data is collected and what dataset characteristics are needed are not thoroughly investigated. Simultaneously, evolutionary methods have reemerged as a promising alternative to classic RL, leading to the field of evolutionary RL (EvoRL), combining the two learning paradigms to exploit their supplementary attributes. This study aims to join these research directions and examine the effects of Genetic Programming (GP) on dataset characteristics in RL and its potential to enhance the performance of offline RL algorithms. A comparative approach was employed, comparing Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and GP for data collection across multiple environments and collection modes. The exploration and exploitation capabilities of these methods were quantified and a comparative analysis was conducted to determine whether data collected through GP led to superior performance in multiple offline learners. The findings indicate that GP demonstrates strong and stable performance in generating high-quality experiences with competitive exploration. GP exhibited lower uncertainty in experience generation compared to DQN and produced high trajectory quality datasets across all environments. More offline algorithms showed statistically significant performance gains with GP-collected data than trained on DQN-collected trajectories. Furthermore, their performance was less dependent on the environment, as the GP consistently generated high-quality datasets. This study showcases the effective combination of GP's properties with offline learners, suggesting a promising avenue for future research in optimizing data collection for RL.},

One of its key features is the combination of particle velocity and search direction towards the optimal position in the history and swarm. Recognizing the limitations of the particle swarm optimization algorithm, this paper proposes a new evolutionary algorithm called the multiple direction search algorithm. The algorithm integrates five different search directions, including a multi-point direction constructed using principal component analysis. The integrated direction is generated by the weighted sum of the search directions. Theoretical analysis shows that under mild conditions, the rate of convergence along the weighted direction is no worse than the rate of convergence along the best of single search directions by a positive constant, or even faster in certain cases. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated on three benchmark test suites by computer simulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms seven state-of-the-art particle swarm optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) are prevalent in practical applications, yet existing methods often struggle to handle their diverse characteristics, such as disconnected feasible regions and infeasible solutions near the true constraints Pareto front (CPF). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a constraint-tightening based adaptive two-stage evolutionary algorithm (CT-TSEA) for CMOPs, incorporating a constraint boundary tightening strategy and parameter dynamic adjustment strategy. In the first stage, a constraint boundary tightening strategy based on evaluation counts guides the population toward feasible regions. Initially, constraint boundaries are relaxed to explore the solution space thoroughly, identifying promising solutions. As evaluations increase, the search boundaries shrink, enhancing the feasibility of solutions. Additionally, a step-size adaptive adjustment method improves infeasible solutions using their information, boosting search efficiency and solution diversity. The second stage introduces a dynamic adjustment method for crossover probability and scaling factor, balancing exploration and exploitation. It better balances the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the population. The proposed method is validated via comparing with seven state-of-the-art peer competitors across 59 test instances from four benchmark suites and 21 real-world problems. The corresponding results demonstrate that CT-TSEA has the higher competitiveness in addressing complex CMOPs.},

To this end, this study introduces a novel ELA framework leveraging Graph Neural Network (GNN) upon BBOP’s surrogate model. Specifically, a neural network surrogate model is constructed whose architecture is utilized to represent BBOP in the form of graph. Then, GNN is responsible for capturing the relationships between the graph-represented BBOP and high-level features. As one of the most notable features in optimization, multimodality of multi-objective problems is to be identified for illustration. More than 99% accuracy on independent test set demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework with simultaneously avoiding the effect of problem dimensions.},

However, MARL still faces significant challenges in this domain, including low coordination efficiency and inaccurate value estimation. To address these issues, we propose MVAPO, a novel Multi-Head Joint Value Attention-based Policy Optimization algorithm that improves policy learning through enhanced value approximation and selective attention to agent contributions. The key innovation of MVAPO lies in the introduction of a joint value network augmented with a multi-head attention mechanism. In this mechanism, context-aware team rewards serve as query inputs, directing attention to the most relevant agents in different situations. This allows the model to dynamically focus on the agents that are most critical at any given time, thus improving coordination efficiency and the accuracy of value estimates. Furthermore, MVAPO incorporates feedforward and residual layers, eliminating linear and monotonic constraints, which significantly enhances its representational capacity. Extensive experiments on a multi-UAV benchmark across a variety of scenarios demonstrate that MVAPO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both reward acquisition and win rates, highlighting its superior performance and robustness.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents Dynamic Archive with Adaptive Multi-Operator Differential Evolution (DA2MODE), a new algorithm that aims to boost the performance of meta-heuristic and evolutionary methods in numerical optimization. DA2MODE introduces a Progressive Adaptive Selector with Exponential Smoothing (PASES), which dynamically updates the selection probabilities of both mutation and crossover operators. Unlike prior approaches that emphasize only mutation operators or rely on short-term success within the current generation, PASES adapts based on cumulative operator performance over time, thus favoring the best-performing operators more reliably. DA2MODE employs an Adaptive Non-Elite Archive Update (ANEAU) mechanism that injects a controlled fraction of non-elite solutions into the archive. ANEAU promotes early exploration, which is gradually reduced to strengthen exploitation. Additionally, the control parameters (crossover probability and mutation factor) are automatically tuned in DA2MODE, allowing full adaptivity of both operator selection and parameter control. Extensive experiments on the CEC2017/2018, CEC2020-2022, and 1000-dimensional CEC2013 benchmarks, along with four real-world engineering design problems, confirm that DA2MODE consistently outperforms 33 competitive algorithms, including CEC winners and recent advanced DE variants. It achieves top performance across all statistical tests, demonstrating superior convergence speed and final accuracy. These results establish DA2MODE as a robust, scalable, and reliable algorithm for solving complex numerical optimization problems.

However, single-space strategies ignore critical information in the objective space and the diversity and search efficiency are often degraded for solving multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). To address this problem, a novel large-scale optimization framework that integrates a dual-space attention mechanism is proposed in this paper. Different from building attention only with information in decision space, a dual-space Key matrix that quantifies variable importance by combining decision-variable and objective-space distributions is first designed in the framework to refine the precision of the attention. Subsequently, a cross-space clustering method is adopted to select the representative solutions by analyzing the characteristics of individuals in both spaces to construct the Query matrix. The accuracy of attention allocation is improved. Finally, A linear inverse mapping strategy is used to enhance the diversity of the population by translating promising objective-space solutions back to the decision space. Unlike existing approaches, the characteristics of decision and objective space are linked with a new attention mechanism, and the exploration and exploitation of the population are well balanced. Three types of experiments are designed on two benchmark test sets with 500-dimensional and 1000-dimensional decision variables and the voltage transformer optimization problem to demonstrate the efficacy of the AIDF framework, experimental results indicate that AIDF surpasses comparative algorithms in terms of the average performance of IGD and HV.},

In order to overcome this challenge, this work proposes a framework based on the virtualisation and control of these substances at a local scope, with the primary goal of coordinating robot swarms. This framework introduces a novel pheromone representation that enables decentralisation and decision asynchronicity, while its lightweight design ensures accessibility to resource-constrained platforms. Each robot maintains an independent virtual pheromone map in its memory, which is continuously updated through its own pheromone deposits and evaporation. Additionally, each robot’s pheromone map is also updated by aggregating information from other robots that are exploring nearby areas. Consequently, individual and independent maps eliminate the need for a centralised agent to manage and distribute pheromone information. This propagation mechanism is inspired by ants’ vibroacoustic communication, which is characterised as a form of indirect communication. The framework was evaluated using an agent-based mass simulation tool and a real-world simulation platform. Experiments were conducted to validate the framework in diverse environments, with variations in shapes, sizes, and the number of robots. Results demonstrated that this proposal can effectively perform the coordination of robot swarms, and the robots have exhibited satisfactory performance while executing the surveillance task.},
