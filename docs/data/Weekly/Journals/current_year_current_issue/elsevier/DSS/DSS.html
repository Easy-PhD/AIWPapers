  abstract     = {Translating natural language inquiries into executable Cypher queries (text-to-Cypher) is a persistent bottleneck for non-technical teams relying on knowledge graphs (KGs) in fast-changing industrial settings. Rule and template converters need frequent updates as schemas evolve, while supervised and fine-tuned parsers require recurring training. This study proposes a schema-guided prompting approach, namely text-to-Cypher with semantic schema (T2CSS), to align large language models (LLMs) with domain knowledge for producing accurate Cypher. T2CSS distils a domain ontology into a lightweight semantic schema and uses adaptive filtering to inject the relevant subgraph and essential Cypher rules into the prompt for constraining generation and reducing schema-agnostic errors. This design keeps the prompt focused and within context length limits while providing the necessary domain grounding. Comparative experiments demonstrate that T2CSS with GPT-4 outperformed baseline models and achieved 86 % accuracy in producing correct Cypher queries. In practice, this study reduces retraining and maintenance effort, shortens turnaround times, and broadens KG access for non-experts.},

  abstract     = {As generative AI continues to transform industries, including the creative sector, it has become critical to understand how it interacts with legal frameworks. This study aims to investigate the effect of the landmark ruling issued by the U.S. District Court on August 18, 2023, which declared AI-generated art uncopyrightable to provide clarity to previously ambiguous legal standards on the AI-related services in online labor markets. Our findings reveal that prices for AI-related gigs on an online freelancer platform dropped by 32.97 % following the ruling, suggesting that the lack of copyright may have reduced the perceived value by limiting clients' residual rights. Furthermore, our research indicates that both freelancer experience and communication efficiency significantly moderate the relationship between AI art non-copyrightability and project pricing. In addition, the results show that large corporate clients were more affected by the ruling than individual clients. In contrast, prices for projects commissioned by small and mid-sized corporate clients did not change significantly. This suggests that large firms are more sensitive to intellectual property uncertainties because they rely heavily on formal rights to secure control and revenue from creative assets. This research contributes to a nuanced understanding of how legal frameworks for AI may shape the gig economy's AI art-related creative services, offering valuable guidelines for more informed decision-making by freelancers, clients, platform owners, and policymakers in this evolving landscape.},

  abstract     = {Process mining has developed into one of the most important research streams in business process management. Despite its successful application to improve process performance in industry, there is still substantial potential to be realized in the coming years. One of them is the use of unstructured video data to enable the analysis of previously unobservable parts of processes. Existing approaches derive event logs from video data by extracting a predefined set of potentially relevant activities. As this set is typically determined using a process model or input from process experts, rather than the available video data, current solutions are unable to identify activities that extend beyond the presumed process behavior, limiting transparency in process analysis. Therefore, this study aims to develop a solution that enables the extraction of actual process behavior from video data, as opposed to assumed process activities. Following a design science research methodology, we developed and evaluated the Reference Architecture for Video Event Extraction (RAVEE), which enables the identification of individual process steps in an unsupervised manner. We performed several evaluation activities to ensure the completeness and applicability of the RAVEE. A prototypical instantiation of the RAVEE further demonstrates its ability to extract process-relevant events from video data on two real-world datasets.},
