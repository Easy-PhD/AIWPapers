  abstract     = {Hazardous airborne gas releases from accidents, leaks, or wildfires require rapid localization of emission sources under uncertain and turbulent conditions. Traditional gradient-based or biologically inspired strategies struggle in multi-source environments where odor cues are intermittent, aliased, and partially observed. We address this challenge by formulating multi-source plume tracing in three-dimensional fields as a cooperative partially observable Markov game. To solve it, we introduce an Action-Specific Double Deep Recurrent Q-Network (ADDRQN) that conditions on action–observation pairs to improve latent-state inference, and integrates teammate information through a permutation-invariant set encoder. Training follows a randomized centralized-training and decentralized-execution regime with host randomization, team-size variation, and noise injection. This yields a policy that is robust to agent failures (hardware malfunction, battery depletion, etc.), resilient to intermittent communication blackouts, and tolerant of sensor noise. Empirical evaluation in simulated Gaussian plume environments shows that ADDRQN achieves higher success rates and shorter localization times than non-action baselines, maintains strong performance under mid-mission disruptions, and scales predictably with team size.},

  abstract     = {The intelligent generation of traditional architectural styles faces significant challenges in structural integrity and style consistency. While existing methods can generate numerous realistic images, they lack a deep understanding of structural elements in traditional architectural decorative design. This paper proposes a Structure-aware Stable Diffusion (SSD) model, which enhances the model's comprehension of architectural features through three key innovations. First, we design a structure-aware feature injection module that adaptively fuses extracted architectural structural information with original features during the U-net upsampling phase, enhancing the model's understanding of geometric structures. Second, we introduce a dual-path text enhancement strategy that combines structural descriptions with original descriptions to provide richer textual guidance signals for the generation process. Finally, we design a progressive injection strategy that dynamically controls the injection intensity of structural information through cosine scheduling, ultimately achieving effective internalization of structural knowledge. Experimental results show that compared to existing methods, our model effectively improves both the diversity of generated traditional architectural decorations and the rationality of their structures, thus providing an effective new technical approach for traditional architectural decorative design.},

  abstract     = {Customer experience is crucial in the airline industry, as understanding passenger satisfaction helps airlines improve service quality. This study evaluates hyperparameter optimization and feature interpretability in machine learning models for predicting airline passenger satisfaction. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were tested for binary classification, labeling passengers as ‘Satisfied’ or ‘Neutral or Dissatisfied’ using a Kaggle dataset with ∼104,000 training and ∼26,000 test records. Hyperparameter tuning used grid search with 10-fold cross-validation. For SVM, the optimal setup included the RBF kernel, C = 10, and gamma = ‘auto’, achieving a mean score of 0.9606. For MLP, the best configuration used no regularization, "he" initialization, ReLU activation, 30 epochs, batch size of 32, two hidden layers with 32 neurons each, and a learning rate of 0.001, yielding a mean score of 0.9556. Performance metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, with SVM achieving a test accuracy of 0.96, precision of 0.97, and F1-Score of 0.95, slightly outperforming MLP by <1 %, though MLP was faster at 0.3 s versus SVM’s 18 s. Both models surpassed baseline models and prior studies, benefiting from robust preprocessing and a large dataset. Permutation importance analysis identified Type of Travel, Inflight Wi-Fi Service, Customer Type, and Online Boarding as key predictors, emphasizing passenger needs for digital connectivity and personalized services. These insights guide airlines to prioritize reliable Wi-Fi and efficient online boarding to enhance satisfaction, loyalty, and competitive positioning.},

  abstract     = {Validating performance is a key challenge facing the adoption of machine learning models in high risk applications. Current validation methods assess performance marginally over the entire testing dataset, which can fail to identify regions in the distribution with insufficient performance. In this paper, we propose Conformal Validation, a systems-based approach with a calibrated form of uncertainty quantification using a conformal prediction framework as a part of the validation process to reduce performance gaps. Specifically, the policy defers a subset of observations for which the predictive model is most uncertain and provides a human with informative prediction sets to make the ancillary decision. We evaluate this policy on an image classification task where images are distorted with varying levels of gaussian blur for a quantifiable measure of added difficulty. The model is compared to human performance on the most difficult observations, i.e., those where the model is most uncertain, to simulate the scenario when a human is the alternative decision-maker. We evaluate performance on three arms: the model independently, humans with access to a set of classes the model is most confident in, and humans independently. The deferral policy is simple to understand, applicable to any predictive model, and easy to implement while, in this case, keeping humans in the loop for improved trustworthiness. Conformal Validation incorporates a risk assessment that is conditioned on the prediction set length and can be tuned to the needs of the application.},

  abstract     = {Current predictive maintenance systems in construction rely on static machine learning approaches that fail to adapt to evolving operational environments, achieving only 3%–7% performance improvements over individual models and suffering 15%–25% performance degradation when transferred across domains. This research develops and validates an Adaptive Ensemble Framework that dynamically optimizes algorithm selection through real-time data assessment and performance feedback. The framework’s meta-learning architecture continuously adapts ensemble weights using data complexity measures, temporal pattern analysis, and uncertainty quantification metrics. Unlike static approaches, the system integrates scikit-learn and TensorFlow models through dynamic optimization algorithms that respond to changing conditions without manual reconfiguration. The framework provides uncertainty-aware predictions with confidence intervals essential for safety-critical construction decisions. Comprehensive evaluation across four industries using 50,000+ maintenance records from major construction firms demonstrates substantial improvements. The adaptive ensemble achieves F1-score of 0.934 in construction delay prediction, representing 15.3% improvement over individual models and 8.7% enhancement over static ensembles. Cross-industry validation reveals successful knowledge transfer with minimal performance degradation ( < 5%). This research contributes three scholarly advances: (i) the first real-time adaptive ensemble framework eliminating manual hyperparameter tuning, (ii) uncertainty quantification mechanisms for safety-critical applications, and (iii) robust cross-industry transferability through systematic domain adaptation. The framework extends beyond construction to manufacturing, energy, and transportation sectors, demonstrating computational efficiency with sub-100ms latency and linear scaling characteristics. These contributions establish new benchmarks for adaptive machine learning in industrial predictive maintenance.},

In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach that combines the strengths of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and machine learning algorithms to predict battery state parameters. We have developed an efficient prediction system that can learn from EIS data and accurately predict battery state parameters. Our approach is trained on an open dataset comprising of over 30,000 spectra, generated using an automated measurement technique that outperforms current machine learning-based models, particularly in terms of generalization across different cells and measurement setups.},

Key drivers of WACC include beta, dividend yield, and earnings per share, with Emission score also showing significant influence. This study fills gaps in insurance finance literature by introducing ML-based WACC modeling, enhancing predictive accuracy, and providing policy recommendations for regulatory reporting and Emission score disclosures. From a policy perspective, the global insurance sector is at a crucial turning point, where ESG integration in granular form is found to be vital for financial stability. By mandating standardized ESG disclosures in alignment with the ISSB and TCFD frameworks, regulators can reduce insurers’ cost of equity, enabling a balance between financial sustainability and environmental responsibility, while promoting long-term value creation for both investors and society.},

Considering the model’s output represents a probability, this paper will investigate its latent distribution assumption, i.e., its inner linear regressor unit follows a standard logistic distribution. An empirical study on five spectroscopic profiling open datasets, i.e., wine, coffee, olive oil, cheese, and milk powder, was conducted to verify this latent distribution assertion. This paper measured the GoF (Goodness of Fit) of each dataset’s latent variable from three aspects, i.e., curve fitting, P–P and Q–Q plots, and K–S test. After hyper-parameter optimization and proper training, the latent variable, as a weighted sum of the original features, has demonstrated a high level of GoF on all the five datasets. This study verifies the suitability of logistic regression in spectroscopic profiling analysis and answers why the model output can be interpreted as a conditional probability.},
