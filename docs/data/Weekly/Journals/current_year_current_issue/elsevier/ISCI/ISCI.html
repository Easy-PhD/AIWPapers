  abstract     = {Clustering users based on their interest is a critical component in personalized content delivery. This paper proposes a novel multi modal framework that integrates semantic video classification, contextualized caption generation, and user behavior patterns. The system combines visual and audio features which are computed using convolutional and transformer based encoders to robustly capture the complex contents of video description. User browsing profile is modelled using probabilistic distributions to reflect realistic browsing behavior across six interest categories. These profiles are then clustered using KMeans, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative clustering to identify the various user groups. The quality of clustering is evaluated using Silhouttee Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index, with PCA and t-SNE applied for visual validation of coherence of clusters. The simulation framework addresses the issues concerning data privacy and the scarcity of real world data by producing controllable and realistic user behavior traces. Experimental results demonstrate that KMeans provides the optimal trade-off between quality of clustering solution and computational cost. These integrated efforts bring personalized content delivery to a new perspective, i.e., fine-grained user segmentation and precise video understanding, respectively. The future work will focus on adopting real-time adaptive learning and integrating with more data types, and will further deploy on large-scale multimedia applications.},

However, end-to-end AutoML research focuses on automated machine learning pipelines consisting of algorithm selection and hyper parameter tuning, falling short in comprehensive automation of data preparation. In this paper, we propose Auto-DP, an MCTS-based framework for efficient and automated data preparation. To guide the search more effectively, a neural network is designed to estimate the subsequent maximum performance gain of each tree node. In order to reduce search space and improve system efficiency, two optimization strategies, meta-learning and accelerated training strategy, are used to determine the type and order of tasks in the data preparation process in advance, and speed up the pipeline creation process. We compare Auto-DP with the popular AutoML systems on 60 real datasets from OpenML repository. Auto-DP improves the Accuracy by up to 18.11 % on the classification task and reduces the Mse by up to 25.75 % on the regression task. Furthermore, it achieves a performance in 10 s that is better than what four popular AutoML systems achieve in 1 h.},

It addresses the growing volume of job applications and the limitations of traditional keyword-based systems, which often fail to capture contextual meaning and complex semantic relationships in job-candidate alignment. The proposed system leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically TF-IDF vectorization, cosine similarity scoring, and domain-specific keyword weighting, to interpret conceptual relevance between resumes and job descriptions, enabling more accurate and inclusive recruitment outcomes. This research developed the system in Python and evaluated it using simulated and real-world recruitment datasets. Experimental results show that the semantic model consistently outperforms keyword-based matching across diverse job domains. For instance, in simulated tests, similarity scores reached 0.74 in the Software Engineer domain, compared to just 0.35 using keyword-based methods. Real-world evaluations further confirmed the model’s effectiveness, with semantic scores of 0.83, 0.76, and 0.74 for the Hadoop, Data Science, and PMP domains, respectively. In contrast, the corresponding keyword-based scores remained below 0.17. Additionally, the system performs well in aligning generalist and specialist profiles, achieving a score of 0.88 for Data analysis roles. These findings validate the system’s robustness, scalability, and ability to interpret varied terminology across job sectors. The research presents a scalable, AI-driven framework that supports context-aware, fair, and accurate job matching, significantly advancing intelligent recruitment technology.},

Current approaches often fail to integrate strategic node behaviour with information-theoretic principles, limiting insights into network optimisation. To bridge this gap, we propose an information-entropy-driven framework for secure network evolution. First, we establish a security evolution model comprising cross-community node identification and a node strategy evolution algorithm based on strategic utility. Second, we rigorously analyse the stability and equilibrium conditions of local network dynamics driven by minimising two-dimensional structural entropy. Finally, we conduct comparative studies examining network evolution under different node strategies and node types. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that information-driven networks evolve toward fully-connected structures dominated by edge-creation strategies. Critically, this not only confirms that cross-community nodes capture global dynamics but also verifies convergence to a Secure Evolution Principle, the elimination of centralised hubs minimises structural vulnerability while maximizing participation in data sharing, ensuring node safety throughout the evolution process. This entropy-game framework reduces runtime by 80 %-90 % compared with the strategy update of the Imitate Best strategy and the Fermi Rule strategy while maintaining the security of the network structure, providing a theoretically grounded foundation for designing secure, adaptive networks.},

However, current maturity detection models still face challenges in complex planting environments including variations in fruit size, occlusion issues, diverse lighting conditions, and inadequate handling of multi-scale information. To address these challenges, an object detection model FMD-DETR (Fruit Maturity Detection-DEtection TRansformer) is proposed for robust fruit maturity detection under varying lighting and occlusion conditions. The model integrates a multi-scale feature fusion re-weighting module to improve the detection ability for fruits of different scales. A co-attention decoder is designed as a key component of the model to refine the interaction between object queries and feature representations, thereby improving detection accuracy. In addition, self-distillation and hierarchical knowledge distillation strategies are integrated into the decoder to enhance the model’s object localization ability, further improving detection accuracy. Experiments on tomato and strawberry datasets show that the model achieves an accuracy of 75.4 % on the tomato dataset, 52.7 % on the real-world tomato dataset, 41.5 % on the strawberry dataset, and 87.1 % on the FruitRipeness dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the model surpasses existing methods in detection accuracy and robustness in complex environments, providing an effective solution for automated production and harvesting.},

Specifically, by designing an innovation-based saturation mechanism that assigns smaller coefficients for unreasonably large innovations, the adverse impact of the attacks is confined. Within this framework, the consistency of all sensors’ estimates is maintained, and the error covariance matrices are ensured to be bounded. Compared with the existing extended Kalman filter-based positioning approaches, the employed cubature integral rules avoid evaluating Jacobian matrix and improve the performance of nonlinear state estimation.

By comparing model responses to 646 politically sensitive topics with those to non-politically sensitive topics, our audit unveils evidence of semantic-level information suppression in DeepSeek: sensitive content often appears within the model’s internal reasoning but is omitted or rephrased in the final output. Specifically, DeepSeek suppresses references to transparency, government accountability, and civic mobilization, while occasionally amplifying language aligned with state propaganda. This study underscores the need for systematic auditing of alignment, content moderation, information suppression, and censorship practices implemented into widely-adopted AI models, to ensure transparency, accountability, and equitable access to unbiased information obtained by means of these systems.},

  abstract     = {Salient object detection (SOD) is a crucial research direction in computer vision and has garnered significant attention. Despite notable progress, two key limitations remain: (1) Existing methods rely primarily on single-frequency domain features, limiting their ability to extract fine details in complex scenes and achieve accurate saliency recognition and segmentation; (2) Traditional frameworks face limitations in parameters, real-time performance, and storage overhead. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-path wavelet guidance framework (DWGNet) for SOD. The framework has two innovative designs: the wavelet-based encoder–decoder and a multi-feature prediction decoder (MFPD). Specifically, we first construct a dual-path encoder to extract multilevel features, comprising a spatial feature extractor and wavelet feature extractor to capture spatial and frequency domain representations, respectively. Second, the local wavelet fusion decoder is designed to integrate wavelet features across scales, generating decoding features rich in multi-wavelet information. Then, the MFPD processes multi-path outputs in batches, leveraging high-level semantic information to guide the fusion and refinement of low-level features. Finally, the weighted loss function is introduced for fully supervised saliency inference and prediction. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on nine databases show that our method excels in detecting simple targets, multiple targets, and small targets in low-contrast scenes. It achieves 0.043, 0.043, 0.034, 0.063, 0.055, 0.027, 0.027, 0.149, 0.293 on MAE metrics while retaining only 3.94 M parameters and 2.01 G FLOPs.},

Subsequently, a Global-Aware Feature Refinement (GAFR) module is designed to overcome insufficient global context integration in existing anchor-based methods, enabling adaptive feature enhancement through spatially-aware attention and selective fusion mechanisms. Finally, a Dynamic Loss Harmonizer (DLH) employs momentum-based dynamic weight adjustment to optimize multi-loss learning, improving training stability and convergence.

To address these limitations, this study proposes an innovative data-driven aviation safety risk assessment framework that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Quantum Probability Theory (QPT). Grounded in aviation safety data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the framework leverages NLP to extract potential failure modes and employs QPT to quantify the interference effects between them. The entropy weight method is used to calculate the initial weights of risk factors when failure modes are independent, whereas quantum probabilities based on QPT are applied to update these weights when interactions occur among failure modes. Furthermore, risk prioritization associated with failure modes is conducted using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). This framework breaks through the traditional isolated risk assessment framework, advancing aviation safety management from post-incident response to preemptive coupling intervention.},

  abstract     = {As the complexity of chip design continues to increase, the stacking of multiple device layers in a three-dimensional (3D) architecture has emerged as a promising approach to improve performance, power efficiency and area (PPA). The optimization of macro-module arrangement and inter-tier connections in 3D stacked chip layout is significantly influenced by the selection of the number of layers, which affects both the feasibility of the layout optimization and the final performance of the chips. In this paper, we creatively propose the Spiking Variational Graph Auto-Encoders (S-VGAE), which aim to be applied in several varieties of stacked clustering to partition the data set comprising 22 integrated circuits. By converting graph topology into spatiotemporal pulse patterns, the Spiking Graph Convolution fundamentally enhances the representational capacity of subsequent Graph Auto-Encoders. In the layout stage for all dies, we propose the Memristive-Inspired Bottom-up Left Justified Learning (MBLJL) Strategy to determine the better performance of bi-level or tri-level stacked floorplanning layout.},
