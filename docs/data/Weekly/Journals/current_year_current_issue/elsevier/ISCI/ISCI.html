  abstract     = {Cyber threats have evolved in complexity, aiming at a wide range of sectors using advanced methods and tools. This evolving threat landscape challenges existing cybersecurity frameworks, many of which lack the adaptability to counteract the complex tactics of sophisticated adversaries. Developing robust cyber defense strategies requires simulating dynamic interactions between attackers and defenders across high, moderate, and low-impact scenarios. The Flip-It cyber game serves as an intelligent framework for simulating these interactions, enabling the analysis of adaptive strategies in cybersecurity. This paper aims to address the problem of mitigating malware prevalence with full consideration of attack/defense capabilities in arbitrary network topologies. This paper proposes a sophisticated discrete-time epidemic model to characterize security state transitions over time for all three scenarios within the Flip-It game framework. On this basis, the original problem is modeled as a closed-loop control problem to seek the optimal containment strategy. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is then used to tackle the problem, generating efficient defense strategies that are well-adapted to changing cybersecurity environments. Numerical simulations based on small-world networks, scale-free networks, and router networks are then carried out to generate corresponding strategies. Additionally, we have evaluated the performance of the proposed method against the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) in terms of attack/defense objective function, control actions, number of devices under the control of the attacker and defender, stability, execution time, and scalability. This comprehensive approach integrates epidemiological modeling, game theory, and advanced machine learning to effectively tackle the complexities of contemporary cybersecurity threats.},

  abstract     = {Graph coarsening is the process of simplifying large-scale graph representations while preserving essential structural characteristics to improve computational efficiency in graph processing. Conventional techniques primarily reduce graph size through node and edge merging but often inadequately preserve both global spectral properties and local structural details. Real-world graphs exhibit inherent hierarchical complexity comprising critical global topological patterns and local structural features necessary for accurate analysis. To address these limitations, we present a Multi-Granularity Spectral Graph Coarsening (MGSGC) framework that systematically integrates spectral graph analysis with local structural preservation through multi-granularity operations. Our approach initiates with hierarchical graph decomposition, where node merging generates structurally homogeneous subgraphs. Spectral analysis of normalized Laplacian matrices guides iterative coarsening optimization, using spectral distance metrics to identify subgraphs requiring refinement. A dual-resolution mechanism preserves global spectral signatures and local connectivity patterns simultaneously, ensuring retention of both macroscopic and microscopic structural information. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGSGC outperforms recent methods, achieving higher accuracy, superior structural preservation, and strong resilience to label noise, ensuring robust performance in real-world scenarios.

  abstract     = {We investigate the identification of the Boolean algebra ℘ ( X ) of all subsets of a universe X with the set E ( X ) = { 0 , 1 } X of characteristic functions, focusing on the expression of the complement operation in three equivalent forms. Building on this, we extend the framework to fuzzy sets f : X → [ 0 , 1 ] , which form a complete distributive lattice equipped with three distinct complement operations: • the Zadeh (Kleene) complement f ′ ( x ) = 1 − f ( x ) , • the Brouwer (intuitionistic) complement f ∼ ( x ) = χ { x ∈ X : f ( x ) = 0 } , and • the anti-Brouwer complement f ♭ ( x ) = χ { x ∈ X : f ( x ) ≠ 1 } . We analyze the algebraic properties and interrelations of these complements. This leads to the study of Brouwer–Zadeh (BZ) algebras, which generalize Boolean algebras to lattices with two non-standard complements linked via a ∼ ′ = a ∼∼ , implying a ∼ ≤ a ′ . We show that any BZ algebra naturally decomposes into three non-overlapping components: a Zadeh algebra, a Brouwer algebra, and an anti-Brouwer algebra. Furthermore, we derive two significant structures from BZ algebras: • the Pawlak Rough Approximation Structure (RAS), and • the Kuratowski Abstract Topological Structure (ATS). To model information granularity and graduality, we introduce the Pawlak operator into the BZ framework, yielding the Pawlak–Brouwer–Zadeh (PBZ) lattice. This enriched structure allows us to formally distinguish between vagueness and ambiguity in RAS and to model granularity in fuzzy sets, providing an algebraic foundation for shadowed sets and related granular models.},

  abstract     = {A mathematical model is presented for a one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk, which is initiated from a quantum initial state and governed by a coin operator. When the coin operator is a flip operator, a path analysis formula is employed to compute the position probability distribution. For a general coin operator, matrix decomposition is utilized to transform it into the equivalent flip operator. When a walker undergoes n steps of evolution, it is observed that the probability of the walker occupying any given position exhibits the existence of both maximum and minimum values, irrespective of the quantum initial state. By linking these extreme positions together, a confined region is delineated, the boundary of which is designated as the envelope of the quantum walk. Remarkably, the envelope is independent of the quantum initial state. To facilitate the computation of this envelope, the relevant formulas are transformed into rational expressions, wherein both the numerators and denominators are represented by polynomials with even integer coefficients. These polynomials are classified to determine the coefficients of the numerator polynomials. An analysis is conducted to identify the location of the maximum value of the envelope, thereby examining the maximum value of the position probability distribution.},
