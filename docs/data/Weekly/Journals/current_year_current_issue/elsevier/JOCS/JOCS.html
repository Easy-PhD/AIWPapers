  abstract     = {The sampling-based method has strong environmental adaptability and probability completeness, providing an effective solution for mobile robot path planning. However, the conventional rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) algorithm often presents slow convergence and inefficient search paths. In this sense, this paper proposes a mobile robot path planning and optimization algorithm based on P-RRT* that incorporates multi-local gravitational potential fields and bias sampling, i.e., multi-local gravitational potential fields Bias-P-RRT* (MLGPFB-P-RRT*). The algorithm adds a local gravitational field between the starting point and the target point to better guide the direction of random tree growth, and directly connects the center of the last local gravitational field to the target point to accelerate the convergence of the random tree at the target point. Meanwhile, the introduction of bias sampling based on local potential fields to optimize the generation quality of random points, thereby improving the generation position of new nodes and reducing the randomness of sampling for mobile robots in the workspace. Then, a collision detection method between sampling nodes and obstacles was developed, which can quickly determine the feasibility of the sampling path. Finally, the generated path is optimized and smoothed through pruning optimization and quadratic B-spline function. A series of simulation studies and mobile robot experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.},

This paper proposes a novel multi-objective scheduling framework for hybrid microgrids aimed at minimizing operational costs while maximizing environmental benefits. To efficiently solve this complex optimization problem, we introduce a Hybrid Nutcracker Optimization Algorithm (HNOA), which combines the recently developed Nutcracker Optimization Algorithm (NOA) with the Bat Algorithm (BAT). This hybridization enhances NOA’s exploration–exploitation balance and search capability, as demonstrated by rigorous validation on 12 benchmark functions. HNOA achieves superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to several state-of-the-art metaheuristics. The proposed HNOA is then applied to solve the scheduling of a grid-connected hybrid microgrid under various scenarios to evaluate its performance. Simulation results indicate that the optimal microgrid configuration, consisting of PV/WT/turbine/diesel/battery, achieves an investment cost of 80,789.02 yuan. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for advancing renewable energy integration and promoting environmental sustainability.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of Digital Rock Physics (DRP) requires the elaboration of robust techniques for closing the gaps between different scales of rock studies (upscaling). The upscaling workflows are especially needed to support the applicability of DRP for heterogeneous rocks. Basically, DRP involves two primary stages: model construction and simulation of physical processes on the models created. For heterogeneous rocks, there is an inherent trade-off between the spatial resolution of the data and the representativeness of the model size. The primary objective of this study was to implement and test a technique for upscaling digital core models from microscale to macroscale, enabling the computation of rock properties while accounting for heterogeneity of various scales. The upscaling is based on establishing correlations between tomography data of different resolutions and transforming low-resolution tomography into a multi-class model according to the defined correlation. The convolutional neural network for high-resolution tomography data was considered as the optimal algorithm for transforming low-resolution tomography into a multi-class model. The output of the neural network was an upscaled model of lower resolution than the original tomography image. Each cell in the upscaled model belonged to one of several types of formation, whose generalized characteristics were determined on the basis of the analysis of high-resolution tomography data. To validate the upscaling technique, we constructed a digital model of a complex carbonate reservoir based on data from multi-scale microtomography ( μ CT). A Darcy-scale model has been used and validated as a multi-class model, enabling the computation of flows in pore samples of various scales. By incorporating diverse pore space structures as different classes in the Darcy-scale model, it is possible to preserve the substantial physical size of the model while enhancing its level of complexity.},

  abstract     = {Sediment transport plays a crucial role in the evolution of bed morphology through deposition and erosion. This study presents numerical simulations of two-dimensional sediment transport induced by fluid flow. The fluid-sediment interaction is governed by a capacity model, i.e., the coupled system of shallow water and Exner equations, a simplification of more physically advanced non-capacity models. The system is solved using a momentum-conserving staggered grid (MCS) scheme. Model validation is performed using the Meyer-Peter and Müller (MPM) bedload transport formula, applied to experimental data from dam-break flows in various channel configurations. The proposed method successfully reproduces trends in the evolution of the water surface and quasi-steady sediment profiles. In general, the MCS scheme provides more accurate water level predictions than the numerical benchmark schemes. Although the predictions of maximum depths of deposition and erosion are less accurate, the overall results are consistent with those obtained from non-capacity models. Furthermore, the model is applied to the Kampar River estuary to simulate sediment transport due to the tidal bore.},

  abstract     = {Small datasets often lead to poor performance of data-driven prediction models due to uneven data distribution and large data spacing. One popular approach to address this issue is to use virtual samples during machine learning (ML) model training. This study proposes a Hamiltonian Circuit Virtual Sample Generation (HCVSG) method to distribute virtual samples generated using interpolation techniques while integrating the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in model development. The Hamiltonian circuit is chosen because it doesn’t depend on the distribution assumption and provides multiple circuits that allow adaptive sample distribution, allowing the selection of circuits that produce minimum errors. This method supports improving feature-target correlation, reducing the risk of overfitting, and stabilizing error values as model complexity increases. Applying this method to three datasets in material research (MLCC, PSH, and EFD) shows that HCVSG significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to conventional KNN and eight MTD-based methods. The distribution of virtual samples along the Hamiltonian circuit helps fill the information gap and makes the data distribution more even, ultimately improving the predictive model's performance.},

  abstract     = {Accurate drug–target affinity (DTA) prediction is a cornerstone of efficient drug discovery, as it directly accelerates the screening of potential therapeutic candidates, reduces the cost of preclinical experiments, and shortens the development cycle of new drugs. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two main challenges: (I) Purely data-driven approaches struggle to capture the functional semantics of molecules, such as the role of specific functional regions and chemical element properties in binding interactions, due to the lack of integration with chemical prior knowledge, leading to unreliable predictions; (II) the integration of topological structure from graphs and long-range dependencies from sequences is insufficient, often failing to capture complementary features, limiting the model’s generalization ability, especially for novel drugs or targets commonly encountered in early drug discovery . To address these issues, we propose CKDTA , a C hemical K nowledge Enhanced framework for D rug- T arget A ffinity prediction. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a chemical knowledge-enhanced molecular modeling approach, which constructs a multi-layer molecular graph incorporating atom-level features, chemical element information, and functional regions, enabling the capture of functional semantics through a hierarchical attention mechanism, while leveraging chemical prior knowledge; (2) a co-attention module designed to optimize sequence interaction information by leveraging graph-based interaction data, compensating for the lack of spatial structural information in sequence data. This module fully exploits the topological structure of graphs and the long-range dependencies in sequences, capturing complementary features. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CKDTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, cold-start experiments validate its generalizability, highlighting its potential for drug discovery applications.},

However, due to the relatively late introduction of environmental monitoring systems, there were long consecutive missing values in early pollutant data. In this paper, we propose a decomposition-based imputation method for long consecutive missing pollution data. Firstly, wavelet coherence analysis is employed to investigate the periodic relationship between the pollution data and the relevant air data, decomposing them into periodic and non-periodic components. Then, machine learning and transfer learning are used to impute the periodic and non-periodic components, respectively. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the method is validated on artificially missing NO 2 and SO 2 concentration data from five regions of China. Comparison results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms some other imputation methods in the literature in terms of both mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error. Finally, the proposed imputation method is applied in the study of accelerated aging of polycarbonate materials. Experimental results show that the predictive accuracy of the aging model is improved when using the imputed pollutant data.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the time and cost required to obtain large datasets limit the application of data-driven machine learning in nanoscale manufacturing. Here, we focus on predicting the nanoscale damage induced by helium focused ion beams (He-FIBs) on silicon substrates. We briefly review the most relevant atomistic defects and the partial differential equations (PDEs), or rate equations, that describe the mutual creation and annihilation of the defects, eventually leading to the amorphization of the substrate and, the nucleation and early growth of helium bubbles. The novelty comes from the use of a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to simulate quantitatively the evolution of the bubbles, thus bypassing the dataset availability problem. As usual, the proposed PINN learns the underlying physics through the incorporation of the residuals of the PDEs and corresponding Initial Conditions (ICs) and Boundary Conditions (BCs) in the network’s loss function. Meanwhile, the system of PDEs poses some challenges to the PINN modeling strategy. We find that (i) hard constraints need to be imposed on the network output in order to satisfy both BCs and ICs, (ii) all the inputs and outputs of the PINN need to be cautiously normalized to ensure convergence during training, and (iii) customized weights need to be carefully applied to all the PDE loss terms in order to balance their contributions, thus improving the accuracy of the PINN predictions. Once trained, the network achieves good prediction accuracy over the entire space-time domain for various ion beam energies and doses. Comparisons are provided against previous experiments and traditional numerical simulations, which are also implemented in this study using the Finite Difference Method (FDM). While the L2 relative errors for all collocated points remain below 10%, the accuracy of the PINN decreases at lower beam energies and larger ion doses, due to the presence of higher numerical gradients.},

  abstract     = {Simulation plays a crucial role in the semiconductor chip manufacturing. In particular, process simulation is primarily used to solve the dopant diffusion dynamics, which describes the temporal evolution of doping profiles during the thermal annealing process. The diffusion dynamics constitutes a multiscale problem, formulated as a set of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) with respect to the concentration of dopants and point defects. In this paper, we demonstrate that Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) can accurately predict not only the evolution of the doping profile, but also the unknown physical parameters, specifically the diffusivities appearing as PDE coefficients. Furthermore, we propose a physics-informed calibration method, which performs PDE-constrained optimization by leveraging a pre-trained PINN model. We experimentally verify that this post-processing significantly improves the accuracy of coefficients fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an annealing simulation for the semiconductor diffusion process using a physics-informed machine learning approach. This framework is expected to enable more efficient calibration of simulation parameters based on measurement data.},

  abstract     = {The pest number trigger threshold strategy has been widely used in the control of pests in agricultural production. In this study, pest populations are managed by using an integrated nonlinear threshold function and a saturation function. The existence conditions of various equilibrium points and sliding sections in the system are derived. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results show the existence of boundary equilibrium bifurcations, tangency bifurcations and limit cycle bifurcations caused by discontinuous boundary. It is worth noting that persistence and non-smooth folding can be observed in the boundary equilibrium bifurcations. At the same time, because the nonlinear threshold control strategy is adopted in this study, the change of the sliding section of the model is more complicated. The numerical simulation results show that if there is an unstable focus in the model, a sliding homoclinic cycle will appear with the occurrence of boundary saddle point bifurcation, and then form a crossing limit cycle. The sensitivity analysis results of the system show that if the threshold level is too low, the control measures do not achieve the desired results. Too high threshold selection will cause unnecessary economic losses. Therefore, our results show that an appropriate threshold should be set to reduce economic losses while ensuring that the number of pests is in a lower stable state.},

  abstract     = {In federated learning, multiple devices compute each a part of a common machine learning model using their own private data. These partial models (or their parameters) are then exchanged in a central server that builds an aggregated model. This sharing process may leak information about the data used to train them. This problem intensifies as the machine learning model becomes simpler, indicating a higher risk for single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks, such as extreme learning machines. In this paper, we establish a mechanism to disguise the input data to a system of linear equations while guaranteeing that the modifications do not alter the solutions, and propose two possible approaches to apply these techniques to federated learning. Our findings show that extreme learning machines can be used in federated learning with an extra security layer, making them attractive in learning schemes with limited computational resources.},

  abstract     = {Datasets classification accuracy depends on their features. The presence of irrelevant and redundant features in the dataset leads to the reduction of classification accuracy. Identifying and removing such features is the main purpose in feature selection, which is an important step in the data science lifecycle. The objective of the Wrapper feature selection method is to reduce the number of selected feature (NSF) while improving the classification accuracy by working on a set of features. The feature selection is a challenging and computationally expensive problem that falls under the NP-complete category, so it requires computationally cheap and efficient algorithm to solve it. The artificial hummingbird algorithm (AHA) is a biological inspired optimization technique that mimics the unique flight capabilities and intelligent foraging tactics of hummingbirds in nature. Since feature selection is inherently a binary problem. In this paper, the binary form of the AHA meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed to show that binarizing the AHA meta-heuristic algorithm improves its performance for solving feature selection problems. The proposed method is tested on a standard benchmark dataset and compared with four state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms: Automata-based improved equilibrium optimizer with U-shaped transfer function (AIEOU), Whale optimization approaches for wrapper feature selection (WOA-CM), Ring theory-based harmony search (RTHS), and Adaptive switching gray-whale optimizer (ASGW). The results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in searching for optimal features subset. The source code for the algorithm being proposed is accessible to the public on https://github.com/alihamdipour/baha .},
