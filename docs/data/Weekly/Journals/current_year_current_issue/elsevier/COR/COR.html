  abstract     = {One of the main production-related costs in manufacturing is inventory cost since manufacturing firms allocate a vast area to raw material, semi-processed, and final products in production lines and warehouses. Reducing the volume of these inventories leads to lower production-related costs. This paper presents a novel mathematical model for zero-inventory production scheduling. In this model, the jobs arrive at fixed times and are scheduled on a set of unrelated machines. The jobs have different operations that need to be processed one by one. Since the system has zero inventory, the jobs must be processed immediately upon arrival. Also, whenever a job’s operation is complete, the following operation must instantly start (no wait time). That operation is outsourced if no machines are available to process any of the job’s operations. The jobs’ operations are dispatched to the machines from a dispatching center, and there is a latency between the dispatching center, the machines, and the outsourcing center. We present a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model to formulate this problem. Then, the MINLP model is turned into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model by linearizing its constraints. Since many production scheduling problems are known to be NP-hard, particularly those involving unrelated parallel machines, precedence constraints, and time-dependent decisions like ours, we adopt two metaheuristics to solve the problem for large-scale cases where exact methods are computationally inefficient. The first is a Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the second is a Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm. The performance of these algorithms is tested against the optimal solutions obtained from CPLEX for a set of small-scale problems. We consider a real case study, an image processing system, to validate the proposed developments (the MILP model and the GA). The results show that the presented model and algorithm can reduce the system’s total cost by about 12.57% compared to the existing online dispatching rules.},

Their performance derives from aggregating predictions of multiple decision trees, which are renowned for their interpretability properties. However, tree ensemble models do not reliably exhibit interpretable output. Our work aims to extract an optimized list of rules from a trained tree ensemble, providing the user with a condensed, interpretable model that retains most of the predictive power of the full model. Our approach consists of solving a set partitioning problem formulated through Integer Programming. The extracted list of rules is unweighted and defines a partition of the training data, assigning each instance to exactly one rule, and thereby simplifying the explanation process. The proposed method works with tabular or time series data, for both classification and regression tasks, and its flexible formulation can include any arbitrary loss or regularization functions. Our computational experiments offer statistically significant evidence that our method performs comparably to several rule extraction methods in terms of predictive performance and fidelity towards the tree ensemble. Moreover, we empirically show that the proposed method effectively extracts interpretable rules from tree ensembles that are designed for time series data.},

It enables companies to maintain competitiveness and strengthen their market share. However, environmental concerns bring reverse logistics practices into focus. A take-back policy is a strategic reverse logistics activity known to foster market share; however, it poses various challenges and uncertainties. Considering uncertain demand, we introduced an innovative adoption model with two distinct take-back policies, trade-in and credit, to address challenges in multi-generation production planning. Inspired by real-world practices of companies like Apple and Samsung, our model first examines how trade-in programs drive repeat purchases and enhance market share, with credit-based programs to attract new customers. It then captures changes in demand, production planning, recovery decisions, and internal competition among multiple product generations. Distinct from previous conclusions, this study explores how producers can strategically manage demand for new generations to slow diffusion, thereby increasing refurbishment and recycling volumes over time. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of adaptive pricing strategies and production scalability in maximizing profitability and promoting sustainability in competitive high-tech industries.},

  abstract     = {Heuristic methods provide a computationally efficient framework for addressing two-dimensional irregular packing problems, particularly in resource-constrained industrial settings. As a typical combinatorial optimization problem, irregular packing exhibits exponential growth in computational complexity with increasing workpiece counts, while the solution space dynamically reconfigures due to geometric variability among workpieces. Although heuristic algorithms can generate feasible layouts within acceptable timeframes, their reliance on fixed search rule limits adaptability to diverse scenarios, necessitating more flexible approaches. In this paper, a hyper-heuristic algorithm based on Q-Learning is proposed to solve open dimension packing problems, including one-open and two-open dimension problems. Q-Learning is adopted as the high-level strategy for its ability to optimize low-level heuristic selection through reward-driven experience accumulation. The method incorporates a mixed encoding method for solution representation, four specialized low-level heuristic operators, a linear population decline mechanism, and an elite preservation strategy to balance exploration–exploitation. The Q-Learning controller dynamically selects operators by updating the Q-table based on Bellman’s equation. The proposed algorithm is compared to some advanced algorithms in general datasets. The results show that our method has better performance and applicability.},

The integration of M&S and ML into a Hybrid M&S-ML approach leverages the unique strengths of both fields, offering enhanced model precision, improved efficiency, and more effective decision support. This review explores the increasing convergence of ML algorithms with traditional M&S methods- namely Agent-Based Modelling & Simulation, Discrete Event Simulation, and System Dynamics- in healthcare applications. Through a systematic review of 90 relevant studies, this article provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current state-of-the-art Hybrid M&S-ML in healthcare. Specifically, it examines the M&S and ML methodologies employed, associated software tools and programming languages, analyses integration patterns and data exchange mechanisms, and explores application domains, as well as the types and motivations for hybridisation. Key findings highlight prominent methodological and technical trends, as well as opportunities for combining M&S with ML to address healthcare challenges. These insights provide direction for modellers and data scientists in developing hybrid M&S–ML approaches that more effectively combine simulation capabilities with data-driven learning. The review also demonstrates the potential of such approaches to advance methodological innovation and support evidence-based decision-making in diverse healthcare contexts.},

By incorporating cost factors related to travel distance, inventory levels, and penalty terms – while adhering to delivery time windows – our approach improves both operational efficiency and vaccine allocation effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that our K-means supported RL algorithm significantly outperforms traditional solvers in tackling this NP-hard problem, particularly in large-scale scenarios. Specifically, our approach can efficiently solve CVRVD instances with up to 1,000 facilities—scenarios that are computationally intractable for exact methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive K-means supported RL algorithm using data from New Jersey, USA, where facility-level vaccination data were available through the state’s Immunization Information System. Beyond vaccine distribution, our method has broad applicability in logistics and transportation, enabling more efficient and cost-effective allocation of critical resources such as vaccines and medical supplies.},

  abstract     = {Global warming has led to declining sea-ice in the Arctic Ocean, making it easier for ice-class vessels to navigate Arctic waters for greater portions of the year. As sailing conditions in these waters improve over coming decades, these passageways are expected to open for larger portions of the year and to become increasingly viable options for unsupported transit and even open-water vessels. This paper proposes a Benders-branch-and-cut methodology for estimating changes in global maritime cargo flow patterns under future climate scenarios with declining Arctic sea ice. The model accounts for changing incident risk along Arctic passageways and corresponding ice-class vessel and icebreaker escort requirements, lower speeds, increased insurance premiums, higher accident probabilities, and constraints on path-based maximum risk exposure. The resulting mixed-integer program involves path-based, continuous decision variables. The solution technique is applied on a model of the global maritime container network including 80 ports, 76 routes, 426 links and 4,303 legs associated with the world’s largest carrier alliance. Embedded acceleration techniques and a label-correcting algorithm that employs specialized fathoming rules for a non-additive, constrained path subproblem enable solution at this global scale. The outcome is an estimate of seasonal future global maritime trade flows along key global routes and through ports predicted under six climate-related scenarios. Results illustrate that the developed model can provide support to companies, nations and regions as they prepare for a changing global landscape and climate.},

A novel state representation method that expresses state features as multi-channel images is proposed to simplify the state characterization process. Various heuristic-based priority dispatching rules (PDRs)are used to construct action space. By converting scheduling instances into images and leveraging the spatial pyramid pooling fast (SPPF) module for feature extraction, this model can handle scheduling instances of varying scales and map size-independent processing information matrix to fixed action space. Additionally, a dense reward based on a predefined scheduling region is developed to offer detailed guidance to the agent, enabling more precise and comprehensive policy assessment. Static tests are conducted on well-known benchmarks, and the experimental results indicate that our scheduling model surpasses the performance of the three latest DRL approaches on average. Compared with PDR methods, dynamic experiments demonstrate that the proposed DRL model excels in adaptability and robustness when new tasks arrive and the processing time fluctuates with uncertainty.},

Maintenance scheduling and operations-associated problems in the aviation industry can efficiently enhance competitiveness. In the maintenance and scheduling problem, aircrafts need to undergo tasks for both line (A check) and base (C check) maintenance at various hangers at MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Operations) based on resource availability (both human and material). The determination of the optimal maintenance plan, in terms of allocating the resources to the aircraft, and resource movement from one aircraft to another based on availability and licensed skills in the presence of multiple tasks and capacity constraints so as to obtain maximum utilization of resources at maintenance site and minimize the turnaround time is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first CP (Constraint Programming) based mathematical solution that jointly integrates zone, task precedence, technician-pool sharing, and multi-shift continuity for large-scale aircraft maintenance scheduling. In this article, we proposed an efficient optimization strategy that overcomes many of the drawbacks of the formulation/strategies available in literature and helps in determining efficient execution of maintenance work packages. The proposed strategy is generic, encompassing multi-aircraft, multi-skill and multi-shift scheduling capabilities and is validated on two real scenario business case studies, one each for line maintenance (A check) tasks and base maintenance (C check) tasks, as well as six large-scale synthetic scenarios with up to 20,000 tasks, demonstrating feasibility and scalable performance. The proposed strategy is demonstrated on MRO scheduling and it shows an improvement of up to 30.68% in the turn-around time by incorporating the proposed optimization strategy.},

  abstract     = {In railway systems, preventive maintenance plans are essential for ensuring the safety of train operations. However, these tasks are often subject to various disturbances (e.g., bad weather), leading to unpredictable deviations between planned and actual maintenance durations, which can further disrupt train schedules. Unlike most studies that assume constant maintenance durations, this paper introduces a data-driven, two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model for jointly optimizing train scheduling and maintenance planning. In the first stage, we determine the initial train schedule and maintenance plan. In the second stage, we allow for slight adjustments to train departure and arrival times at each station to accommodate disturbances affecting maintenance tasks. Our objective is to minimize both the expected travel time of trains and the deviation from the planned schedule under worst-case scenarios for maintenance disturbances. To capture the uncertainty of maintenance disturbances, we construct an ambiguity set using historical data and the Wasserstein metric. We show that the proposed two-stage DRO model, formulated over the Wasserstein ambiguity set, can be reformulated into an efficiently solvable equivalent form. Finally, we apply our model to a real-world case study of the Beijing–Guangzhou high-speed railway and compare it with traditional stochastic programming methods, including sample average approximation and robust optimization. The results highlight the efficiency of our approach and provide valuable insights for railway management.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose ROBIST , a simple, yet effective, data-driven algorithm for optimization under parametric uncertainty. The algorithm first generates solutions in an iterative manner by sampling and optimizing over a relatively small set of scenarios. Then, using statistical testing, the robustness of the solutions is evaluated, which can be done with a much larger set of scenarios. ROBIST offers a number of practical advantages over existing methods as it is: (i) easy to implement, (ii) able to deal with a wide range of problems and (iii) capable of providing sharp probability guarantees that are easily computable and independent of the dimensions of the problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ROBIST in comparison to alternative methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a branch-and-price algorithm for solving the Optimal Network Task Scheduling (ONTS) problem in satellite constellations. The algorithm efficiently manages both constellation tasks that can be performed by any satellite and satellite-specific tasks that must be executed by designated satellites, while considering critical energy constraints. We formulate the problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and develop a Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition that handles battery management constraints for the satellites at the master level, while addressing constellation-wide coordination requirements in the subproblems. A novel dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to solve the pricing subproblem for constellation tasks, augmented with dual stabilization techniques to improve convergence. Comprehensive computational experiments on realistic instances derived from nanosatellite operations demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. Results show that our structured formulation significantly outperforms a naive approach, particularly for large instances, while effectively balancing workload distribution and energy management across the constellation. This work provides a practical framework for optimizing task scheduling in modern satellite constellations, with direct applications in Earth observation, telecommunications, and scientific missions.},

This problem expands the integrated routing and loading problem, in which the required pallet orders are delivered to customers by a fleet of homogeneous semi-trailer trucks. Firstly, with the goal to minimize the total transportation cost, a mixed-integer linear programming model for the 2L-SDVRPTW-LB is proposed. Secondly, an exact algorithm framework based on the branch-and-cut algorithm is designed to solve the problem. In the algorithm framework, a metaheuristic algorithm is designed to obtain the upper bound. Subsequently, various classes of valid inequalities are introduced to strengthen the formulation, while the constraints ensuring load balance are applied in a lazy manner to optimize computational efficiency. Numerical experiments based on modified benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed branch-and-cut algorithm effectively solves the 2L-SDVRPTW-LB and its variant of excluding split delivery.

To solve this computationally challenging problem, we propose a learning-driven iterated local search approach that combines an effective local search procedure to find high-quality local optimal solutions and a multi-armed bandit algorithm to select removal and insertion operators to escape local optimal traps. Extensive experiments on 77 commonly used benchmark instances show that the algorithm achieves excellent results in terms of solution quality and running time. In particular, it achieves 32 new best results (improved upper bounds) and matches the best-known results for 35 other instances. Additional experiments shed light on the understanding of the algorithm’s constituent elements.

This phase also allows the identification of search zones that may contain other nondominated points. The second phase focuses on exploring these search zones to locate the remaining points, which typically accounts for most of the computational cost. Ranking algorithms are frequently employed to explore each zone individually, but this approach leads to redundancies, causing multiple visits to the same solutions. To mitigate these redundancies, we propose several strategies that group adjacent zones, allowing a single run of the ranking algorithm for the entire group. Additionally, we explore an implicit grouping approach based on a new concept of coverage. Our experiments on the Bi-Objective Spanning Tree Problem demonstrate the beneficial impact of these grouping strategies when combined with coverage.},

Drones fly between vehicles to pick up collected blood bags and deliver them to the blood center. This collaborative framework enhances the performances of the collection system and ensures the freshness of collected blood upon arrival to the blood center. We develop a novel mixed-integer linear programming model to optimally synchronize the routes and collection schedules of mobile units and drones to ensure the timely delivery of collected blood to the blood center. We also develop a rolling-horizon-based matheuristic to solve large-scale instances of the problem. This algorithm combines a rolling horizon approach, which divides the problem into manageable subproblems solved sequentially, with a local branching technique that enhances solutions by exploring promising neighborhoods. To evaluate the algorithm’s performance, we conduct a comprehensive computational study. Our results show that the proposed algorithm not only finds better solutions than those obtained by Gurobi but also outperforms other matheuristics, including the rolling horizon, relax-and-fix, and fix-and-optimize algorithms.

  abstract     = {The growing use of autonomous tractor fleets with detachable implements presents complex logistical challenges in agriculture. Current systems often rely on simple heuristics and avoid implement swapping, limiting efficiency. A central challenge is to dynamically coordinate vehicle routing and implement exchanges to enable efficient, low-intervention task execution. Due to high costs, such fleets are owned mainly by large enterprises or cooperatives, where fair task allocation and profit sharing are critical. Addressing both coordination and fairness, in this paper, we introduce the Agricultural Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem with Implements (AFVRPI). We propose a distributed model derived from a centralized formulation also presented in this paper. This model is embedded within a Distributed Multi-Agent System Architecture (DIMASA), where autonomous vehicle agents manage routing and implement use under limited fuel autonomy, while implement agents ensure compatibility and sufficient capacity to meet task demands. Our solution applies systematic egalitarian social welfare optimization to iteratively maximize the profit of the worst-off vehicle, balancing fairness with system efficiency. To enhance scalability, we use column generation in the distributed model, achieving solution quality comparable to the centralized model while significantly reducing computing time. Simulation results on new benchmark instances demonstrate that our distributed multi-agent AFVRPI approach is scalable, efficient, and fair.},

  abstract     = {Mega-events such as the Olympics and the World Championships face significant challenges in evacuating large numbers of attendees after the events conclude, which consume substantial transportation resources. Under the global pressure to reduce carbon emissions, energy conservation and emission reduction are increasingly becoming top priorities. This paper focuses on the efficient scheduling of customized buses (CB) after green mega-events, incorporating skip-stop operations and coordinated bus services to minimize energy consumption, fixed and transportation costs, and facilitate the evacuation of attendees, while accounting for practical constraints such as the availability of customized buses, vehicle capacity, time windows, and flow balance. A distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model is developed, using a novel ambiguity set to model uncertain demand via parametric interval-valued fuzzy variables. To ensure computational tractability, the model is reformulated as an integer linear programming model. To address the computational challenges of large-scale instances, an improved variable neighborhood search heuristic is designed by incorporating the reinforcement learning techniques, including the KL-UCB algorithm and a sliding window mechanism. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed heuristic. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed DRO model effectively handles uncertainty, offering robust and adaptable solutions. Compared to existing heuristics, the proposed heuristic improves performance by 6.51% on average, and incorporating reinforcement learning into VNS enhances computational efficiency by 4.88% on average. A real-life case study further validates the model, demonstrating that the skip-stop strategy significantly reduces vehicle travel time and enhances overall operational efficiency.},

While traditional network planning aimed at radial configurations, which are more similar to the typical working configuration of a network but are not fault-tolerant, modern techniques seek for meshed configurations, since these architectures are more fault-tolerant. Due to the complexity of the problem and the large size of nowadays instances, most of the techniques used for planning are based on heuristic approaches. Thus, they are usually unable to guarantee optimality and not even able to provide an assessment of the distance from the optimal solution. In this work, we address the challenge of planning a fault tolerant network through an exact approach, by introducing innovative Mixed-Integer Linear Programming models designed for the planning of meshed distribution networks with loop-feeder or open-loop topology. Differently from other techniques, our approach simplifies the formulation by avoiding the need for fault scenarios, significantly reducing the computational burden of the optimization problem. The outcomes of our approach are the generation of optimal meshed network, which effectively balance cost and reliability of the electric distribution system. Comprehensive studies on realistic test instances show the advantages of the proposed formulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) automatic ordering and producing decisions on fairness-concerned supply chains under the newsvendor model. We develop a dyadic supply chain model in which the manufacturer acts as the Stackelberg leader while the retailer serves as the follower in a push supply chain. In contrast, their roles are switched in a pull supply chain. We assume that only human decision-making leads to decision regret behavior, whereas AI-automated decision-making does not. Without adopting AI, our results show that fairness concern does not necessarily lead to a decreasing quantity in ordering or producing, which is different from most previous studies. Different from the prior findings, our work reveals that in binding equilibrium, if fairness concerns are considered, the order quantity will decrease, while in non-binding equilibrium, the order quantity may not necessarily be less than the previous results. Interestingly, when decision regret bias is considered for fairness-concerned decision-makers, we can obtain quantity coordination solutions for supply chains under specific conditions. With adopting AI, our results show that increasing fairness concerns are beneficial for improving the follower’s profit while at the expense of sacrificing the leader’s profit margins, while the leader can only benefit from AI adoption when the decision regret bias of the follower is relatively high. It is noteworthy that under certain conditions, AI automation may negatively impact the profits of both push and pull decentralized supply chains. For instance, in low-margin profit scenarios where decision-makers exhibit moderate regret bias and fairness concerns, such effects can emerge. This indicates that under specific circumstances, the human behavioral factors — regret bias and fairness concerns — may sometimes enhance the performance of decentralized supply chain members. Our research findings provide significant practical implications for the adoption of AI-automated decision-making in real-world supply chains.},

  abstract     = {Supply chain management in a global scale involves addressing numerous uncertainties, from demand fluctuations to unforeseen disruptions. Developing advanced solution approaches is critical to manage such complexities and ensure resilience. This study presents a multi-stage stochastic–dynamic model for the global supply chain, incorporating hedging policies. The aim is to identify optimal order scheduling for bill of materials, production planning, and inventory management across warehouses (i.e., materials and finished products). Due to the dynamic nature of the global supply chain (e.g., demand fluctuations, disruptions, and lead time), a multi-stage stochastic model is developed for the stochastic–dynamic supply chain network. To address dynamic factors of real-world global supply chain, an accelerated parallel stochastic dual dynamic integer programming (SDDiP) approach is proposed to deal with disruptions (e.g., political unrest, natural disasters, and pandemics), enhancing supply chain resiliency. To validate the proposed parallel SDDiP , various scenarios with different sizes are generated using the case study and compared to the SDDiP with Benders cuts and integrated stage-wise Lagrangian dual cut ( SWLDC ) (i.e., SDDiP-SWLDC ). According to the obtained results, the proposed parallel node strategy for accelerated SDDiP consistently outperforms the basic stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) and demonstrated robust CPU scalability. Evaluation across various scenario sizes shows stochastic dual dynamic integer programming-mixed integer rounding cuts ( SDDiP-MIR ) achieving faster computation and a smaller 7% optimality gap compared to SDDiP-SWLDC and SDDiP in large-size instances, highlighting its superior performance in complex supply chain settings.},
