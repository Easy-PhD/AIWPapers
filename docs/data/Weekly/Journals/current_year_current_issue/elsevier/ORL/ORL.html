  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the execution of a single task with an unknown size on a server with variable processing speed. Our goal is to analyze structural properties of the optimal energy consumption under the optimal speed profile that minimizes the expected energy consumption while meeting a hard deadline constraint. Specifically, we investigate how the task size probability distribution impacts the overall energy. Under mild assumptions, our main result shows that the expected energy consumption induced by the optimal speed profile preserves the convex increasing order with respect to the task size distribution. Then, we leverage this property to derive simple bounds and conduct a worst-case analysis. In particular, we derive a simple, general formula for the energy gap induced by the ‘best’ and ‘worst’ task size distributions, expressed in terms of the support and expectation of the task size.},

  abstract     = {In the optimal decision tree (ODT) problem, we are given m hypotheses, out of which an unknown “true” hypothesis is drawn according to some probability distribution. The task is to identify the true hypothesis by performing costly queries, each with known responses. ODT is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of ln ⁡ m , and existing O ( ln ⁡ m ) approximation algorithms are complex with large leading constants. We provide a simple algorithm and analysis for ODT, proving an approximation ratio of 8 ln ⁡ m .},

  abstract     = {We analyze the Bass and SI models for the spreading of innovations and epidemics, respectively, on homogeneous complete networks, on one-dimensional networks, and on heterogeneous two-groups complete networks. We allow the network parameters to be time dependent, which is a prerequisite for the analysis of optimal promotional strategies on networks. Using a novel top-down analysis of the master equations, we present a simple proof for the monotone convergence of these models to their respective infinite-population limits. This leads to explicit expressions for the expected adoption or infection level in the Bass and SI models with time-dependent parameters on infinite homogeneous complete and circular networks, and on heterogeneous two-groups complete networks.},
