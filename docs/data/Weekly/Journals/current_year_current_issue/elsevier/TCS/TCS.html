  abstract     = {Robots with very weak capabilities placed on the vertices of a graph are required to move toward a common vertex from where they do not move anymore. The task is known as the Gathering problem and it has been extensively studied in the last decade with respect to both general graphs and specific topologies. Most of the challenges faced are due to possible isometries observable from the placement of the robots with respect to the underlying topology. Rings, Grids, and Complete graphs are just a few examples of very regular topologies where the placement of the robots and suitable movements are crucial for succeeding in Gathering. Here we are interested in understanding what can be done in Butterfly graphs where really many isometries are present and most importantly unavoidable by any movement. We propose a Gathering algorithm for the so-called leader configurations, i.e., those where the initial placement of the robots admits the detection (and election) of one robot as the leader. We introduce a non-trivial technique to elect the leader which is of its own interest. We also prove that the proposed Gathering algorithm is asymptotically optimal in terms of synchronous rounds required.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the shape formation problem within the 3D hybrid model, where a single agent with a strictly limited viewing range and the computational capacity of a deterministic finite automaton manipulates passive tiles through pickup, movement, and placement actions. The goal is to reconfigure a set of tiles into a specific shape termed an icicle . The icicle, identified as a dense, hole-free structure, is strategically chosen to function as an intermediate shape for more intricate shape formation tasks. It is designed for easy exploration by a finite-state agent, enabling the identification of tiles that can be lifted without breaking connectivity. Compared to the line shape, the icicle presents distinct advantages, including a reduced diameter and the presence of multiple removable tiles. We propose an algorithm that transforms an arbitrary initially connected tile structure into an icicle in O ( n 3 ) steps, matching the runtime of the line formation algorithm from prior work. Our theoretical contribution is accompanied by an extensive experimental analysis, indicating that our algorithm decreases the diameter of tile structures on average.},

  abstract     = {We consider a class of finite state three-tape transducers which models the operation of shuffling and splitting words. We present them as automata over the so-called Shuffling Monoid. These automata can be seen as either shufflers or splitters interchangeably. We prove that functionality is decidable for splitters, and we also show that the equivalence between functional splitters is decidable. Moreover, in the deterministic case, the algorithm for equivalence is polynomial on the number of states of the splitter.},
