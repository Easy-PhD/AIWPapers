  abstract     = {The classical weighted essentially non-oscillatory method (WENO) performs well in solving hyperbolic conservation laws, but may encounter the numerical instability while treating multiple discontinuities due to the use of equal-width substencils. In order to overcome this problem, we propose an improved WENO finite difference method, namely WENO-rp2. The WENO-rp2 uses r + 2 candidate substencils, which can be divided into two groups, the first group S 1 consists of the classical r r-point substencils and the other group S 2 consists of 2 2-point substencils. Then by introducing a TENO-like switching mechanism, S 2 is used for the final WENO-rp2 reconstruction if the classical one can not handle the multiple discontinuities or is too biased, otherwise S 1 is used. By doing so, the WENO-rp2 maintains the optimal ( 2 r − 1 ) th order of accuracy in the smooth region, avoids the non-physical oscillation near multiple discontinuities, and is more central, but does not significantly increase the computational cost and numerical dissipation.},

  abstract     = {Gauss–Legendre (GL) curves have recently been introduced, offering a significant advancement over traditional Bézier curves. These curves exhibit remarkable properties, particularly in high-degree cases, where the GL control polygon closely approximates the resulting curve. This is in stark contrast to the much larger Bézier control polygon, which poses practical challenges for curve design. While GL curves retain the endpoint interpolation property, their control over intermediate curve points is limited, as the direct influence of the control polygon is confined to the hodograph at the nodes. To address the challenge of refining high-degree polynomial curves to pass through specific points, we propose a novel method that extends the functionality of GL control polygons to achieve point interpolation. This approach allows for simultaneous control of both the hodograph and the curve itself, ensuring that the curve passes through designated points. We describe the construction of suitable polynomials to serve as weights, facilitating the representation of a curve as a combination of control points. By utilizing these polynomials, we introduce a methodology for directly manipulating both the hodograph and the interpolation points at the nodes, thereby enhancing the precision and flexibility of polynomial curve design using GL polygons.},

  abstract     = {This research investigates the crucial concept of approximate controllability for a class of complex dynamical systems: second-order neutral non-autonomous evolution systems in Hilbert spaces. These systems, characterized by inherent memory effects (due to the neutral term) and non-smooth behavior (modeled by hemivariational inequalities), pose significant analytical challenges. We begin by rigorously establishing the existence of mild solutions for this intricate system. This crucial step relies on a powerful combination of mathematical tools, including cosine functions, a robust fixed-point technique, and the generalized Clarke’s subdifferential, which effectively handles the non-smoothness arising from the hemivariational inequalities. Building upon this foundation, we delve into the core objective: approximate controllability. This fundamental property explores the system’s ability to be arbitrarily close to any desired target state through judicious selection of control inputs. We derive sufficient conditions for approximate controllability, providing valuable insights into the system’s controllability characteristics. Finally, to underscore the practical significance of our theoretical findings, we present a concrete application demonstrating the developed theory’s efficacy in addressing real-world problems.},

  abstract     = {We extend the Couzin collective motion model with energy–dependent foraging, where agents balance two competing motivations: remaining with the group versus breaking away to refuel. While both behaviors are individually driven, they reflect different priorities–social cohesion versus physiological need. Our results bridge foraging theory with collective motion, revealing how state-dependent behavioral switching produces phase transitions with implications for collective decision-making in natural systems and autonomous swarm design. Local repulsion–orientation–attraction interactions produce group behavior, whereas refueling requires an intentional defection from this emergent cohesion. Our model explores how agents switch between these internally motivated but functionally distinct behaviors and how this switching gives rise to collective phase transitions. Environmental constraints like ground repulsion radius restrict parameter regions supporting coherent motion while preserving energy balance, showing maintained foraging performance despite spatial limitations.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel method based on Gaussian process regression for pricing American options. The variational partial differential equation (PDE) governing option prices is converted into a non-linear penalized Feynman-Kac equation (PFK). We propose an iterative algorithm to manage the non-linearity of the PFK operator. We sample state variables in the PDE’ s inner domain and on the terminal boundary. At each step, we fit a constrained regression function approximating the option price. This function matches the option payoffs on the boundary sample while satisfying the PFK PDE on the inner sample. The non-linear term in this PDE is frozen and valued with the price estimate from the previous iteration. We adopt a Bayesian framework in which payoffs and the value of the FK PDE in the boundary and inner samples are noised. Assuming the regression function is a Gaussian process, we find a closed-form approximation of option prices. In the numerical illustration, we evaluate American put options in the Heston, Black-Scholes models and in the two-factor Hull-White model.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies an adaptive fuzzy neural network-based smooth-switching gain dynamic surface control with an error-based nonlinear disturbance observer for the manipulator subject to the full-state constraints and input saturation. First, the smooth-switching gain strategy is proposed to replace the conventional static control gain. This novel strategy can dynamically update the control gains according to the tracking error and its derivative, thereby optimizing tracking performance across different response phases. Second, considering that the conventional nonlinear disturbance observer generates harmful observation peaks when there is a large tracking error, an error-based nonlinear disturbance observer is designed. This observer adaptively adjust the observer gain based on the tracking error, effectively mitigating harmful observation peaks. Furthermore, the adaptive fuzzy neural network strategy is introduced to approximate the modeling uncertainties. Finally, an auxiliary system and an asymmetric time-varying barrier Lyapunov function are established to handle the input saturation and the asymmetric time-varying full-state constraints, respectively. The comparative experiment of a two-degree-of-freedom manipulator validate that the proposed strategy can effectively constrain the state and input of the system within predefined limits. The experimental results further validate that the proposed strategy can effectively optimise the tracking performance and increase the disturbance rejection performance of the system.},

Due to limited network communication bandwidth, an event-triggered scheme, which fully considers the influence of quantization errors, is proposed in this paper. Under this event-triggered scheme, the burden of network communication can be further reduced. In addition to the event-triggered mechanism, network communication protocol is also an effective method to reduce the burden of network communication. Furthermore, data may be affected by network attacks as it is transmitted through the network channels. Therefore, this paper establishes a Round-Robin communication protocol model under the influence of stochastic hybrid attacks.
