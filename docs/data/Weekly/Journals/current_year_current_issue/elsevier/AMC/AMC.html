  abstract     = {Cooperation is a key issue attracting widespread attention across various fields. Emotions and expectations jointly participate in the decision-making process, and are key factors influencing the evolution of cooperation. Therefore, this paper proposes a game evolution model that considers the dual influences of emotions and expectations. In the model, a player’s initial strategy depends on their emotions. Subsequently, expectations influence the decision-making process, altering the player’s initial strategy to the current strategy. Specifically, high expectations lead players to maintain their initial strategy, whereas low expectations prompt them to change strategies. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner’s dilemma and the influence of expectations. Simulation results show that under high betrayal temptation, players with loneliness and defection would change their initial strategy to cooperation due to low expectations, while those players who initially gather with cooperation strategies maintain the cooperation strategies due to higher expectations, ultimately increasing the cooperation fraction and payoff of the population. Therefore, expectations effectively enhance the cooperation level and payoff of the population. When the scale of individuals changing their strategies based on expectations (ICSE) is large, the effect of expectations on enhancing cooperation and payoff is more pronounced. Frequent consideration of anticipated initial strategy changes also yields the same effect. Additionally, mechanisms of the influence of emotion on payoff, direct emotion interaction and the influence of strategy on emotion collectively contribute to enhancing the significantly evolutionary advantage of friendly emotions and cooperation strategies. This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of expectations in the evolution of emotions and cooperation, laying the groundwork for enhancing social cooperation through expectation management.},

  abstract     = {Zernike polynomials are widely used in optics and ophthalmology due to their direct connection to classical optical aberrations. While orthogonal on the unit disk, their application to discrete data or non-circular domains–such as ellipses, annuli, and hexagons–presents challenges in terms of numerical stability and accuracy. In this work, we extend Zernike-like orthogonal functions to these non-standard geometries using diffeomorphic mappings and construct sampling patterns that preserve favorable numerical conditioning. We provide theoretical bounds for the condition numbers of the resulting collocation matrices and validate them through extensive numerical experiments. As a practical application, we demonstrate accurate wavefront interpolation and reconstruction in segmented mirror telescopes composed of hexagonal facets. Our results show that appropriately transferred sampling configurations, especially Optimal Concentric Sampling and Lebesgue points , allow stable high-order interpolation and effective wavefront modeling in complex optical systems. Moreover, the Optimal Concentric Samplings can be computed with an explicit expression, which is a significant advantage in practice.},

  abstract     = {When an epidemic spreads through a population, related information also spreads concurrently, prompting individuals to adopt protective behaviours (e.g., washing hands). Collective behaviour has been shown to play a critical role in shaping the dynamics of epidemic spreading, and higher-order networks offer a natural framework to describe such group interactions in social contact networks. Yet, the interplay between epidemic and information dynamics on higher-order structures is not fully understood, further limiting our understanding of the optimal information spreading strategy for containing epidemic spreading.In this study, we first construct a higher-order multiplex network framework based on simplicial complexes. Then, a coevolutionary spreading model is proposed, integrating epidemic spreading and information spreading on simplicial complexes. The epidemic spreads through both lower-order (pairwise) and higher-order (group) interactions, while information spreads through lower-order interactions in a degree-preferential manner. Using an extended Microscopic Markov Chain Approach, we analytically derive the dynamical equations of the system and compute the basic reproduction number using the next-generation matrix method. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical simulations of the spreading process across various parameter regimes. Our results demonstrate the role of higher-order infections in promoting epidemics. Although information spreading generally suppresses the spread of most epidemics, it can paradoxically enhance the spread of certain epidemics with a very low spreading capacity. Increases in the recovery probabilities of both the disease and the information can weaken the promoting effect of higher-order infection and enhance the suppressive effect of the information. For certain epidemics with weak spreading capabilities but strong recovery capabilities, the spread of information can completely suppress the outbreak of the disease, while the enhancement of higher-order infections can promote the outbreak of these diseases. By analysing the effects of different information spreading strategies on epidemic spreading, we find that the optimal strategy for containing the epidemic is to allow information to spread without degree preference.},

We introduce the Free-Rider Game (FRG), a non-cooperative game incorporating a fairness-aware profit allocation rule based on the Robin Hood index. We show that FRG admits strong structural properties. First, making a non-zero contribution is a dominant strategy for any player. Second, a player contributes positively whenever at least one other player does so. Third, FRG admits a unique Nash equilibrium in which each player contributes the fullest, eliminating free riding. Fourth, equilibrium outcomes are proportionally fair, ensuring balanced allocation across agents. Finally, FRG guarantees full participation by embedding fairness directly into the payoff structure, differentiating it from classical public goods games, which often yield zero or partial contributions.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies on the equilibrium of binary network games have primarily focused on scenarios characterized by agent heterogeneity, where agents exhibit unique attributes but their interactions with different neighbors remain uniform. In this paper, we investigate the edge-heterogeneous binary network game, a more general framework that incorporates heterogeneity into agent interactions. We establish two sufficient equilibrium conditions under asynchronous best-response dynamics from different perspectives. The first condition requires underlying symmetry in interactions between neighboring agents, integrating and generalizing three classical convergence situations in binary network games. The second condition focuses on network balance, positing that equilibrium is achievable if the coordination value network of a game is structurally balanced. Additionally, for games meeting this condition, we develop a method to predict the final state based on initial state information. These results reveal factors that steer edge-heterogeneous binary network games towards equilibrium, providing valuable insights for controlling such highly nonlinear systems. Lastly, we extend the analysis to higher-order network games and propose an equilibrium condition for edge-heterogeneous 2-order network games.},

  abstract     = {An efficient numerical method is proposed to address a stochastic time-fractional cable equation driven by fractionally integrated additive noise. Under the reasonable assumptions, we rigorously establish for the first time, the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of the mild solution for this equation. For spatial discretization, a semi-discrete scheme is constructed employing the Galerkin FEM, and the optimal spatial error estimate is derived based on the semigroup approach. In temporal discretization, a piecewise constant function is introduced to approximate the noise, leading to the formulation of a regularized stochastic time-fractional cable equation. A detailed proof of the temporal error estimates is provided via the semigroup approach. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the temporal convergence order attains O ( τ 1 / 2 ) for initial data of either smooth or non-smooth type. The order is independent of the parameters α 1 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , α 2 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , and β ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) in the equation. These results perfectly align with the theoretical predictions.},
