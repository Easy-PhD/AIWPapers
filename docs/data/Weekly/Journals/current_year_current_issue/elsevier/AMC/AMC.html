  abstract     = {In this paper, the adaptive iterative learning design issue of fault-tolerant control (FTC) is addressed for continuous-time Markov jump piecewise-affine (PWA) system against the actuator lose efficacy faults. A novel adaptive iterative learning control strategy is designed to tackle the problems of actuator faults and effective tracking. The adaptive law is used to suppress the influence of actuator faults on system stability, while the iterative learning law can update the tracking error between the original system and the reference system in real time, and the perfect tracking effect can be realized eventually. Furthermore, sufficient conditions are established to ensure the stochastic stability of the closed-loop system with guaranteed H ∞ performance. Two corollaries are provided, covering the cases of single adaptive FTC and single iterative learning control. Finally, a practical study of tunnel diode circuit and a numerical example are provided to comprehensively validate the availability and accuracy of the designed adaptive iterative learning strategy.},

  abstract     = {A graph/multigraph G is locally irregular if endvertices of every its edge possess different degrees. The locally irregular edge coloring of G is its edge coloring with the property that every color induces a locally irregular sub(multi)graph of G ; if such a coloring of G exists, the minimum number of colors to color G in this way is the locally irregular chromatic index of G (denoted by l i r ( G ) ). We state the following new problem: given a connected graph G distinct from K 2 or K 3 , what is the minimum number of edges of G to be doubled such that the resulting multigraph is locally irregular edge colorable (with no monochromatic multiedges) using at most two colors? This problem is closely related to several open conjectures (like the Local Irregularity Conjecture for graphs and 2-multigraphs, or (2, 2)-Conjecture) and other similar edge coloring concepts. We present the solution of this problem for several graph classes: paths, cycles, trees, complete graphs, complete k -partite graphs, split graphs and powers of cycles. Our solution for complete k -partite graphs ( k > 1 ) and powers of cycles (which are not complete graphs) shows that, in this case, the locally irregular chromatic index equals 2. We also consider this problem for special families of cacti and prove that the minimum number of edges in a graph whose doubling yields an local irregularly colorable multigraph does not have a constant upper bound not only for locally irregular uncolorable cacti.},

In order to overcome this problem, we propose an improved WENO finite difference method, namely WENO-rp2. The WENO-rp2 uses r + 2 candidate substencils, which can be divided into two groups, the first group S 1 consists of the classical r r-point substencils and the other group S 2 consists of 2 2-point substencils. Then by introducing a TENO-like switching mechanism, S 2 is used for the final WENO-rp2 reconstruction if the classical one can not handle the multiple discontinuities or is too biased, otherwise S 1 is used. By doing so, the WENO-rp2 maintains the optimal ( 2 r − 1 ) th order of accuracy in the smooth region, avoids the non-physical oscillation near multiple discontinuities, and is more central, but does not significantly increase the computational cost and numerical dissipation.},

Specifically, individuals select their neighbors based not only on payoffs but also on their reputational standing relative to the environmental reputation. They then update their strategies through a compatible learning rule that incorporates both factors, moderated by a reputation intensity parameter w . We carried out Prisoner’s Dilemma Game (PDG) simulations of the model on both a square lattice network and a Barabási–Albert scale-free network. The results demonstrate that the model effectively enhances both cooperation density and group reputation. Moreover, when the reputation intensity parameter w is sufficiently large, cooperation can be maintained at a high level even under strong temptations to defect, in sharp contrast to traditional models where cooperation rapidly collapses as defection temptation increases. Our findings further indicate that in square lattice networks, increasing the reputation intensity not only elevates the cooperation density but also improves the overall payoff of the population. In Barabási–Albert scale-free networks, nodes with degrees above a certain threshold consistently emerge as high-reputation cooperators. Overall, the model performs effectively on both network types, confirming its robustness.},

  abstract     = {Gauss–Legendre (GL) curves have recently been introduced, offering a significant advancement over traditional Bézier curves. These curves exhibit remarkable properties, particularly in high-degree cases, where the GL control polygon closely approximates the resulting curve. This is in stark contrast to the much larger Bézier control polygon, which poses practical challenges for curve design. While GL curves retain the endpoint interpolation property, their control over intermediate curve points is limited, as the direct influence of the control polygon is confined to the hodograph at the nodes. To address the challenge of refining high-degree polynomial curves to pass through specific points, we propose a novel method that extends the functionality of GL control polygons to achieve point interpolation. This approach allows for simultaneous control of both the hodograph and the curve itself, ensuring that the curve passes through designated points. We describe the construction of suitable polynomials to serve as weights, facilitating the representation of a curve as a combination of control points. By utilizing these polynomials, we introduce a methodology for directly manipulating both the hodograph and the interpolation points at the nodes, thereby enhancing the precision and flexibility of polynomial curve design using GL polygons.},

These systems, characterized by inherent memory effects (due to the neutral term) and non-smooth behavior (modeled by hemivariational inequalities), pose significant analytical challenges. We begin by rigorously establishing the existence of mild solutions for this intricate system. This crucial step relies on a powerful combination of mathematical tools, including cosine functions, a robust fixed-point technique, and the generalized Clarke’s subdifferential, which effectively handles the non-smoothness arising from the hemivariational inequalities. Building upon this foundation, we delve into the core objective: approximate controllability. This fundamental property explores the system’s ability to be arbitrarily close to any desired target state through judicious selection of control inputs. We derive sufficient conditions for approximate controllability, providing valuable insights into the system’s controllability characteristics. Finally, to underscore the practical significance of our theoretical findings, we present a concrete application demonstrating the developed theory’s efficacy in addressing real-world problems.},

Our results bridge foraging theory with collective motion, revealing how state-dependent behavioral switching produces phase transitions with implications for collective decision-making in natural systems and autonomous swarm design. Local repulsion–orientation–attraction interactions produce group behavior, whereas refueling requires an intentional defection from this emergent cohesion. Our model explores how agents switch between these internally motivated but functionally distinct behaviors and how this switching gives rise to collective phase transitions.

At each step, we fit a constrained regression function approximating the option price. This function matches the option payoffs on the boundary sample while satisfying the PFK PDE on the inner sample. The non-linear term in this PDE is frozen and valued with the price estimate from the previous iteration. We adopt a Bayesian framework in which payoffs and the value of the FK PDE in the boundary and inner samples are noised. Assuming the regression function is a Gaussian process, we find a closed-form approximation of option prices. In the numerical illustration, we evaluate American put options in the Heston, Black-Scholes models and in the two-factor Hull-White model.},

First, the smooth-switching gain strategy is proposed to replace the conventional static control gain. This novel strategy can dynamically update the control gains according to the tracking error and its derivative, thereby optimizing tracking performance across different response phases. Second, considering that the conventional nonlinear disturbance observer generates harmful observation peaks when there is a large tracking error, an error-based nonlinear disturbance observer is designed. This observer adaptively adjust the observer gain based on the tracking error, effectively mitigating harmful observation peaks. Furthermore, the adaptive fuzzy neural network strategy is introduced to approximate the modeling uncertainties. Finally, an auxiliary system and an asymmetric time-varying barrier Lyapunov function are established to handle the input saturation and the asymmetric time-varying full-state constraints, respectively. The comparative experiment of a two-degree-of-freedom manipulator validate that the proposed strategy can effectively constrain the state and input of the system within predefined limits. The experimental results further validate that the proposed strategy can effectively optimise the tracking performance and increase the disturbance rejection performance of the system.},

Due to limited network communication bandwidth, an event-triggered scheme, which fully considers the influence of quantization errors, is proposed in this paper. Under this event-triggered scheme, the burden of network communication can be further reduced. In addition to the event-triggered mechanism, network communication protocol is also an effective method to reduce the burden of network communication. Furthermore, data may be affected by network attacks as it is transmitted through the network channels. Therefore, this paper establishes a Round-Robin communication protocol model under the influence of stochastic hybrid attacks. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed H ∞ guaranteed cost filtering approach is ultimately validated through comprehensive simulation analyses in this paper.},
