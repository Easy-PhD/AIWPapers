  abstract     = {This paper explores the stability issue of stochastic McKean–Vlasov equations (SMVEs) through an innovative method: stabilization via stochastic delay feedback control with discrete observation. Unlike conventional techniques, this approach leverages historical states instead of solely relying on the current state, setting it apart from traditional stochastic feedback controls. The study examines how the diffusion term contributes to enhancing system stability despite the presence of random fluctuations and delays, guaranteeing both p -th moment exponential stability and almost sure exponential stability under a specific delay threshold δ * . The primary contributions of this work include introducing a novel stability analysis framework utilizing stochastic delay feedback control, constructing Lyapunov functions that incorporate both state and distribution, and providing insights into asymptotic and moment exponential stability. Although identifying the optimal delay δ * remains a practical challenge, the theoretical foundation laid in this study offers valuable guidance for real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {The concurrent outbreak of epidemics has become a great threat to public health. An important problem is how individuals can protect themselves as the mandated protective measures are relaxed. Previous studies developed various models to investigate the correlated spreading dynamics of concurrent epidemics and the protective measures against them. However, a critical oversight remains that people’s risk perceptions on multiple epidemics are also correlated or even collaborated. In this paper, we build an SS-IS-SI-II coupled model in a multilayer network to describe two concurrent epidemics, integrating collaborated risk perception and spontaneous social distancing as individuals’ self-protection. Moreover, an adjustable coefficient is proposed to describe different levels of inter-epidemic correlations (competition/independence/cooperation). It is found that increasing the levels of inter-epidemic correlation will increase the infected density of both epidemics. Collaborated risk perception is generally more effective in reducing infections across different levels of inter-epidemic correlation, compared with independent risk perception. But its effect is dependent. For one epidemic, when its infectivity is very high or the infectivity of the other epidemic is very low, the effect of collaborated risk perception will be largely reduced. Based on the model, we further investigate the minimum social distancing required to contain epidemics under different conditions, and the priority on different layers is also explored. This research extends existing literature on co-evolutional epidemic dynamics, and lay a foundation to model correlated risk perceptions against epidemics. The results provide implications for individuals to take self-protection against concurrent epidemics.},

  abstract     = {Cooperation is a key issue attracting widespread attention across various fields. Emotions and expectations jointly participate in the decision-making process, and are key factors influencing the evolution of cooperation. Therefore, this paper proposes a game evolution model that considers the dual influences of emotions and expectations. In the model, a player’s initial strategy depends on their emotions. Subsequently, expectations influence the decision-making process, altering the player’s initial strategy to the current strategy. Specifically, high expectations lead players to maintain their initial strategy, whereas low expectations prompt them to change strategies. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner’s dilemma and the influence of expectations. Simulation results show that under high betrayal temptation, players with loneliness and defection would change their initial strategy to cooperation due to low expectations, while those players who initially gather with cooperation strategies maintain the cooperation strategies due to higher expectations, ultimately increasing the cooperation fraction and payoff of the population. Therefore, expectations effectively enhance the cooperation level and payoff of the population. When the scale of individuals changing their strategies based on expectations (ICSE) is large, the effect of expectations on enhancing cooperation and payoff is more pronounced. Frequent consideration of anticipated initial strategy changes also yields the same effect. Additionally, mechanisms of the influence of emotion on payoff, direct emotion interaction and the influence of strategy on emotion collectively contribute to enhancing the significantly evolutionary advantage of friendly emotions and cooperation strategies. This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of expectations in the evolution of emotions and cooperation, laying the groundwork for enhancing social cooperation through expectation management.},

In this work, we extend Zernike-like orthogonal functions to these non-standard geometries using diffeomorphic mappings and construct sampling patterns that preserve favorable numerical conditioning. We provide theoretical bounds for the condition numbers of the resulting collocation matrices and validate them through extensive numerical experiments. As a practical application, we demonstrate accurate wavefront interpolation and reconstruction in segmented mirror telescopes composed of hexagonal facets. Our results show that appropriately transferred sampling configurations, especially Optimal Concentric Sampling and Lebesgue points , allow stable high-order interpolation and effective wavefront modeling in complex optical systems.

  abstract     = {When an epidemic spreads through a population, related information also spreads concurrently, prompting individuals to adopt protective behaviours (e.g., washing hands). Collective behaviour has been shown to play a critical role in shaping the dynamics of epidemic spreading, and higher-order networks offer a natural framework to describe such group interactions in social contact networks. Yet, the interplay between epidemic and information dynamics on higher-order structures is not fully understood, further limiting our understanding of the optimal information spreading strategy for containing epidemic spreading.In this study, we first construct a higher-order multiplex network framework based on simplicial complexes. Then, a coevolutionary spreading model is proposed, integrating epidemic spreading and information spreading on simplicial complexes. The epidemic spreads through both lower-order (pairwise) and higher-order (group) interactions, while information spreads through lower-order interactions in a degree-preferential manner. Using an extended Microscopic Markov Chain Approach, we analytically derive the dynamical equations of the system and compute the basic reproduction number using the next-generation matrix method. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical simulations of the spreading process across various parameter regimes. Our results demonstrate the role of higher-order infections in promoting epidemics. Although information spreading generally suppresses the spread of most epidemics, it can paradoxically enhance the spread of certain epidemics with a very low spreading capacity. Increases in the recovery probabilities of both the disease and the information can weaken the promoting effect of higher-order infection and enhance the suppressive effect of the information. For certain epidemics with weak spreading capabilities but strong recovery capabilities, the spread of information can completely suppress the outbreak of the disease, while the enhancement of higher-order infections can promote the outbreak of these diseases. By analysing the effects of different information spreading strategies on epidemic spreading, we find that the optimal strategy for containing the epidemic is to allow information to spread without degree preference.},

Fourth, equilibrium outcomes are proportionally fair, ensuring balanced allocation across agents.

In this paper, we investigate the edge-heterogeneous binary network game, a more general framework that incorporates heterogeneity into agent interactions. We establish two sufficient equilibrium conditions under asynchronous best-response dynamics from different perspectives. The first condition requires underlying symmetry in interactions between neighboring agents, integrating and generalizing three classical convergence situations in binary network games. The second condition focuses on network balance, positing that equilibrium is achievable if the coordination value network of a game is structurally balanced. Additionally, for games meeting this condition, we develop a method to predict the final state based on initial state information. These results reveal factors that steer edge-heterogeneous binary network games towards equilibrium, providing valuable insights for controlling such highly nonlinear systems. Lastly, we extend the analysis to higher-order network games and propose an equilibrium condition for edge-heterogeneous 2-order network games.},

  abstract     = {With a view to addressing the optimal control problem of multiplayer game nonlinear systems, an event-triggered prescribed performance control method based on the fusion of integral reinforcement learning (IRL) and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is proposed. Firstly, an auxiliary prescribed performance function (PPF) is designed to transform the original system into an unconstrained one. Drawing on the concepts of game theory, the multi-input optimal control problem is reformulated as a mixed zero-sum (MZS) game problem. Subsequently, an IRL-based event-triggered control (ETC) method is designed with a triggering condition. In this event-triggered method, ETC is updated only when the event-triggering condition is met, which reduces unnecessary communication overhead. On the basis of IRL, a critic-only neural network (NN) is established to approximate solutions of the event-triggered Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations without using the dynamic knowledge of the system. Additionally, the Lyapunov stability theorem is employed to ensure the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the system state and neural network weights. And the Zeno behavior can be avoided. Finally, an example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper.},

  abstract     = {An efficient numerical method is proposed to address a stochastic time-fractional cable equation driven by fractionally integrated additive noise. Under the reasonable assumptions, we rigorously establish for the first time, the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of the mild solution for this equation. For spatial discretization, a semi-discrete scheme is constructed employing the Galerkin FEM, and the optimal spatial error estimate is derived based on the semigroup approach. In temporal discretization, a piecewise constant function is introduced to approximate the noise, leading to the formulation of a regularized stochastic time-fractional cable equation. A detailed proof of the temporal error estimates is provided via the semigroup approach. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the temporal convergence order attains O ( τ 1 / 2 ) for initial data of either smooth or non-smooth type. The order is independent of the parameters α 1 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , α 2 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , and β ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) in the equation. These results perfectly align with the theoretical predictions.},
