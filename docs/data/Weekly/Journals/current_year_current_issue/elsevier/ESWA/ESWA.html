  abstract     = {Technology foresight analyses technological trends and potential impacts to provide strategic guidance. However, existing methods either rely on experts to discover emerging directions leading to subjective bias or adopt machine learning to predict without explanation. We propose a Machine Learning and Weak Signal-based Technology Forecasting System (MLWS-TF), which is entirely data-driven to enhance the objectivity of technology foresight and can interpret emerging directions through weak signals. The system adopts a two-phase machine learning model (2P-ML), the first phase identifies papers related to the robotics field, while the second further classifies them into fine-grained research directions. Keywords are extracted from the papers using a Word2Vec-based approach, and a three-dimensional signal classification method (DVI) is developed to quantify the foresight value of keywords across the Diffusion, Visibility, and Impact dimensions, identifying weak signals for technology forecasting. Experiments evaluate various machine learning algorithms, and XGBoost outperforms in constructing the 2P-ML classifier. The model achieved over 90% accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying the theme of scientific documents based on textual features. For each research theme, the DVI provides a more comprehensive assessment of signal strength to detect weak signals. Finally, MLWS-TF analyses the growth potential of themes and successfully identifies critical development directions. Our approach offers a novel automated technology foresight system, which completely avoids the subjectivity and dependence on expert judgment that characterize traditional technology foresight approaches, and extends weak signal theory by introducing the Impact dimension to evaluate signal strength.},

  abstract     = {Reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDHEI) is a promising technique for multimedia cloud computing that enables the embedding of secret data into encrypted images while preserving confidentiality. However, the existing RDHEI algorithms fail to meet the high-security requirements of distributed storage systems in the cloud. Although, secret sharing based RDHEI (SS-RDHEI) may solve this problem, the current methods have weakness such as insufficient embedding capacity and unsatisfactory balance between image security and redundancy. To enhance the algorithm’s ability to carry information, this paper proposes a SS-RDHEI for embedding capacity enhancement by PDPM and auxiliary data free coding. Firstly, pixel-difference preservation based modulation (PDPM) ensures secure encryption by modifying all pixels except for a reference block, minimizing damage; moreover, an improved block-level pixel predictor enhances carrier redundancy. Secondly, auxiliary data free coding (ADFC) marks prediction errors directly in the binary sequence of the original pixel without auxiliary information while maintaining accuracy, and reduces the impact of different textures on embedding performance byselecting optimal parameters for each share image. Finally, by combining PDPM with secret sharing, it achieves independent embedding for multiple data hiders while ensuring fair information embedding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art schemes in terms of information-carrying capability.},

This work proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that explicitly addresses quadrotor attitude dynamics during autonomous navigation, a critical yet underexplored challenge in existing learning-based UAV navigation studies. In the proposed method, high-level velocity commands will be generated by a deep neural network policy and translated by a low-level control algorithm to achieve precise control of both positions and rotations of quadrotors. A specialized network structure is designed to effectively extract environmental obstacle features and quadrotor sequence features to improve navigation performance. In addition, a novel tangent path reward (TPR) calculation method is developed to adequately utilize the known contours and positions of obstacles during the training phase. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method enables quadrotors to autonomously navigate complex virtual obstacle environments with superior efficiency compared with other algorithms. Furthermore, the feasibility and adaptability of the proposed method are validated through simulations by varying obstacle density and map size, as well as replicating real-world obstacle distributions.},

  abstract     = {Subsurface lithological distribution is essential for extrapolating geological information from core to block or basin scales. Given the limited availability of core data, there is a critical need to develop a reliable method for establishing robust correlations between logging curves and lithologies in cores, thereby maximizing the value of large historical logging data. Here, we propose a novel attention-based convolutional neural network (ATT-CNN), which employs a 1D-CNN to transform six types of logging curves into high-dimensional feature space at each depth, and applies an attention mechanism to the 1D-CNN outputs along both the depth and feature dimensions. The architecture is designed to mimic human perceptual processing for lithology identification, leveraging curve combination, thresholding, and local pattern recognition within this enriched and high-dimensional feature representation. In addtion, the study employs wavelet-based preprocessing on logging curves to eliminate the impact of compaction-induced data drift on model generalization—an issue rarely considered in prior studies. The result showes that: ① The proposed ATT-CNN model demonstrates superior performance over benchmark models—the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) and an ensemble of machine learning models (En-ML)—across all evaluation metrics; ②Wavelet-based preprocessing enhances the generalization capability of both ATT-CNN and BiGRU, yielding higher metric scores and improved predictions, particularly in shallow-depth intervals; ③ For blind wells, the ATT-CNN outperforms BiGRU and En-ML in both accuracy and its ability to capture lithological variations even from low-amplitude curve deviations. The integration of ATT-CNN with wavelet-based preprocessing demonstrates significant potential for accurately characterizing subsurface lithological distribution, then provides critical support for key petroleum geology workflows, including provenance analysis, sedimentary facies mapping, and reservoir property prediction.},

The proposed approach comprises two key modules: representation learning and brain functional segmentation. To extract meaningful latent representations from high-dimensional fMRI signals while preserving temporal dependencies, we introduce the Spherical Variational Recurrent Autoencoder (SVRAE), a deep generative model built upon the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture. Unlike conventional VAEs that assume a Gaussian prior, SVRAE employs the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution to model latent variables on a unit hypersphere, which is more suitable for L 2 -normalized data. To further enhance temporal modeling, we replace standard fully connected layers with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. For the segmentation module, we adopt a Collapsed Nonparametric von Mises-Fisher Mixture Model (Co-vMFMM), formulated within a Bayesian nonparametric framework. This model automatically adapts its complexity to the input data without requiring a predefined number of clusters. An efficient variational Bayes learning algorithm is developed to perform inference in a collapsed parameter space. Extensive experiments on publicly available fMRI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in delineating functionally coherent brain sub-regions.},

  abstract     = {Liver cancer is a complex and life-threatening disease with significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Automated liver cancer detection assists radiologists in identifying tumors and their severity accurately. In recent years, several deep-learning techniques have been implemented for diagnosing liver tumors and classification. Despite advancements in deep learning for medical imaging, existing liver cancer detection approaches continue to face several critical limitations. These include suboptimal diagnostic accuracy due to inadequate feature extraction, excessive computational demands that hinder real-time deployment, significant class imbalance within medical datasets leading to biased predictions, and overfitting caused by limited annotated training data. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel and automated deep learning framework called CustomLiverNet, specifically designed for accurate and efficient liver cancer diagnosis using Computed Tomography images. The Generative Adversarial Network is introduced for generating realistic synthetic images, effectively improving the performance of the proposed technique and reducing class imbalance problems. The proposed technique integrates the strengths of Residual Networks and Vision Transformer to extract significant information from the input images and further enhance the performance of the proposed framework. The Residual Networks capture both low-level and high-level semantic features, whereas the Vision Transformer derives global and contextual feature representations from the input images. The model designs a customized fusion layer for combining the extracted features from both Residual Networks and Vision Transformer models. The classification layer predicts whether the liver tumor is benign or malignant. Further, Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Mapping is applied to highlight the critical regions of the image to enhance model transparency. The CustomLiverNet framework was trained and validated on two publicly available liver cancer datasets, including the liver tumor segmentation dataset, which contains 131 contrast-enhanced abdominal Computed Tomography scans, and the 3D image reconstruction for comparison of algorithm database, which includes 20 computed tomography scans. Experimental evaluation using standard metrics shows that CustomLiverNet achieved an accuracy of 98.79 %, precision of 98.64 %, recall of 98.58 %, and specificity of 98.35 %. These results demonstrate that the proposed model holds strong potential for enhancing early and accurate liver cancer diagnosis compared to previous studies.},

In this respect, prior studies have proposed patent-based approaches, but they are subject to several limitations: (1) insufficient consideration of technological relationships within the ecosystem, (2) simplified unit of analysis, and (3) limited organization-centric assessments. This study proposes a network embedding and text-reranking approach to explore potential intra- and inter-organizational collaboration opportunities. First, the technological knowledge ecosystem is represented as a heterogeneous patent network comprising patents, inventors, assignees, and technology classification codes. Second, inventor nodes are embedded using metapath2vec, which performs random walks along predefined metapaths to capture diverse knowledge flows within the ecosystem. Third, potential collaborators are explored through (1) screening candidates based on technological reachability, which measures the possibility of knowledge exploration based on contextual similarity within the network, and (2) reranking candidates based on technological relevance, which quantifies the possibility of knowledge exploitation based on the similarity of technological know-how and experiences. Finally, ten quantitative patent indicators are developed to assess the implications of these opportunities at both the inventor and organization levels. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a case study involving 28,888 US patents and 9,196 inventors in the field of energy storage technology. This study contributes to advancing the theoretical understanding of technological knowledge ecosystems while also serving as a supplementary tool to explore organizational collaboration opportunities.},

This study proposes a machine learning-based workflow tailored for the automated processing of microstructure images. The approach enables the autonomous measurement of key microstructural features while minimizing bias and inconsistencies among analysts. By integrating advanced image processing techniques with object detection algorithms based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the method autonomously identifies microstructural morphologies and quantifies their spacing scales. Three model types-Cell, Dendrite, and Hybrid (exhibiting both dendritic and cellular features)-were trained and validated on using a dataset of 200 images. Among them, the Cell detection model achieved the highest performance, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 78.77 %, followed by the Hybrid (75.63 %) and Dendrite (72.87 %) models.

This study investigates a bi-objective distributed reentrant flow shop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times (DRFSP-SDST). The objectives are to minimize the total energy consumption (TEC) and the maximum completion time (makespan), simultaneously. First, a bi-objective mathematical model for the DRFSP-SDST is formulated based on practical reentrant production scenarios. Second, the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and its variants are employed to solve the DRFSP-SDST. According to the characteristics of the DRFSP-SDST, six local search operators are specifically designed to enhance the performance of the proposed algorithms. For promoting greener and more energy-efficient production, two speed-scaling strategies are developed. Third, two reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, Q-learning and State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA), are integrated into the iterative process as online learning strategies to guide the selection of high-quality local search strategies during the iterations of the proposed algorithms. For each RL algorithm, two distinct selection strategies for local search operators are designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed enhancement strategies is evaluated through comprehensive numerical experiments on 36 benchmark instances. The performance of the proposed algorithms is further validated via the Friedman test. The experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the ABC algorithm enhanced by SARSA-based local search exhibits superior competitiveness in solving the DRFSP-SDST.},

While drone-based visual inspection powered by artificial intelligence (AI) offers benefits in speed, safety, and scalability, existing methods are typically limited to single defect types or uniform facade categories due to the challenges of detecting multi-scale defects in complex, heterogeneous environments. This study introduces an automated multiclass defects inspection system for building facades by integrating drone technology, an AI-driven segmentation platform, and automatic report generation. Central to the system is a segmentation AI model capable of detecting multiclass defects with orders-of-magnitude differences in scale across diverse facade backgrounds. To handle the pixel imbalance of defects ranging from fine cracks to large spalling and glass breakage, the model is built upon EfficientUNet++, trained on a carefully curated dataset and optimized using adjustable batch sizes and active learning rates to improve multi-scale feature learning and mitigate overfitting. Evaluations on validation and out-of-sample datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance across all defect classes. Real-world drone experiments further confirm the model’s practical applicability, with high recall rates in detecting spalling, water seepage, cracks, and glass breakage across different types of facades.

However, traditional assessment tools are often subjective and inefficient, while existing computer-assisted methods are limited by a narrow focus and insufficient use of natural language samples. To address these issues, this study proposes a framework for assessing children’s language abilities based on large language models (LLMs). We first preprocess the natural language samples from children and design multiple assessment dimensions and workflows. To enhance the stability of the assessment, we introduce a multi-expert voting mechanism and perform a comparative analysis of various large language models’ performance. The experimental results demonstrate a strong correlation between the framework’s assessment results and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) verbal developmental quotients, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8 ( p < 0.001). Furthermore, the results show that the multi-dimensional evaluation can accurately differentiate between ASD and typically developing (TD) children, achieving a classification accuracy of 0.98. These findings suggest that the proposed framework has significant potential for improving the accuracy of ASD identification.},

  abstract     = {Recent research has significantly mitigated the performance collapse issue in Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) by either refining architecture parameters to better reflect the true strengths of operations or developing alternative metrics for evaluating operation significance. However, the actual role and impact of architecture parameters remain insufficiently explored, creating critical ambiguities in the search process. To address this gap, we conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that the change rate of architecture parameters reflects the sensitivity of the supernet’s validation loss in architecture space, thereby influencing the derived architecture’s performance by shaping supernet training dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce the concept of a Stable Equilibrium State to capture the stability of the bi-level optimization process and propose the Equilibrium Influential ( E I ) metric to assess operation importance. By integrating these elements, we propose EQUINAS, a differentiable NAS approach that leverages the Stable Equilibrium State to identify the optimal state during the search process and derives the final architecture using the E I metric. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and search spaces demonstrate that EQUINAS achieves competitive test accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing search costs. Additionally, EQUINAS shows remarkable performance in Transformer-based architectures and excels in real-world applications such as image classification and text recognition.},

  abstract     = {Existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents suffer from severe reward instability during late-stage exploration, particularly when encountering novel states in complex continuous environments. A variety of existing studies focus on improving an agent’s reward exploration. However, they ignore the instability problem that arises when the agent faces new states in the later stages of exploration. This paper proposes a novel companion learning network (CLN) based on the idea that the guidance can accelerate human learning efficiency and reduce the risk of making mistakes. The CLN integrates a short-term partner network to intensively learn localized environmental patterns, offering adaptive action guidance for recent states. Simultaneously, a global Q-network dynamically incorporates the partner’s decaying guidance signals, balancing autonomous exploration with error mitigation. As training progresses, the partner’s influence gradually diminishes, allowing the Q-network to solidify robust policies without persistent dependence. Extensive experiments on four OpenAI Gym environments demonstrate that the CLN can significantly improve the exploration stability in most tested scenarios, achieving up to 49% reduction in late-stage reward standard deviation compared to baseline DRL methods.},

  abstract     = {User reviews reflect user preferences and item characteristics, optimizing the predictive accuracy and explanation generation of personalized recommendation systems. However, existing models face challenges due to subjective uncertainty in user feedback and a lack of transparency. Reviews often contain ambiguous emotional expressions, with the same product receiving positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. Many recommendation models assume alignment between ratings and review sentiments, but in practice, users may give high ratings while expressing dissatisfaction or vice versa. These inconsistencies complicate accurate modeling of user preferences. To address these issues, a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven sentiment-enhanced heterogeneous graph neural network framework is proposed. This framework jointly models interaction data and fuzzy sentiment information from reviews to improve both recommendation accuracy and explainability. By leveraging LLM with dual-prompt strategies, high-quality sentiment distributions and semantic insights are extracted. Review sentiments are then quantified using intuitionistic fuzzy numbers to address data sparsity and uncertainty, capturing implicit relationships between users, items, and entities in a sentiment-enhanced heterogeneous relational graph. A fuzzy sentiment-weighted graph convolutional network (FSGCN) is introduced for dynamic higher-order feature learning, adjusting sentiment weights based on user-item interactions and emotional context. The framework also integrates LLM-driven query interpretation to generate recommendations with transparent, context-aware rationales. This approach enables users to understand the reasoning behind recommendations, significantly enhancing explainability and trust.},

Optimizing dispatch paths of robots is essential for improving overall operational efficiency, yet achieving a balance among path length, feasibility, and safety margin remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a geodesic-based path planning method formulated on Riemannian manifolds. The approach jointly considers directional motion constraints, steering effort, and obstacle accessibility boundaries to construct a Riemannian metric tensor that encodes local path cost structures. This transforms the planning task into a geodesic shortest path problem, which is efficiently solved using the Geometric heat flow (GHF) method. The resulting paths naturally comply with kinematic constraints and exhibit strong obstacle-avoidance capabilities, significantly enhancing safety and executability. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments in high-density port yard environments demonstrate the practicality and robustness of the proposed method under complex spatial constraints and obstacle configurations.},

This framework simulates the transition from group decision-making (GDM) to EDM through dynamic trust/distrust propagation and aggregation mechanisms grounded in social balance theory–capturing relational scenarios such as “a friend of a friend is a friend”, “a friend of an enemy is an enemy”, “an enemy of a friend is an enemy”, and “an enemy of an enemy is a stranger”. The paradigm incorporates two core mechanisms: (1) an endogenous cognitive inertia mechanism that uses the psychological serial-positioning effect to model cognitive inertia weights, accounting for primacy, recency, and U-shaped memory effects; and (2) an exogenous mechanism that quantifies comprehensive trust/distrust degrees via opinion similarity, stability similarity, and network structure similarity. To prevent followers from falling into cognitive freezing, a cluster leader-based consensus-reaching strategy is introduced.

  abstract     = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for indoor service robots to achieve reliable navigation and mapping. While point and line features have been extensively utilized to enhance the accuracy of visual odometry (VO), current methods often overlook the rich geometric information embedded in the spatial relationships among structural lines. In particular, the parallelism and collinearity within groups of line segments are underexploited, and geometric constraints are typically applied only heuristically or post hoc, limiting robustness in low-texture and repetitive environments. To address these challenges, a robust VO system is proposed that integrates structural feature grouping with adaptive MW tracking. A unified feature extraction strategy is introduced to detect point and line features simultaneously, improving computational efficiency. To mitigate pose drift caused by unreliable line segments, a set of parallel line features is constructed based on local geometric constraints, and a novel reprojection error model is formulated to enhance pose estimation. Furthermore, a tracking strategy based on local Manhattan World (MW) structure is developed to ensure low-drift estimation across various structured indoor scenes. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets and a custom-built service robot platform demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches under dynamic lighting conditions and in environments rich in lines and planes. The system also operates at a real-time speed of 30 frames per second, meeting the requirements of practical robotic applications.},

Specifically, we introduce a hybrid imitation-reinforcement training strategy that integrates attention mechanisms into critic networks to enable dynamic agent scaling. By incorporating a safety barrier function rooted in differential game theory, we constrain agents’ action spaces and enhance policy reliability. Furthermore, we developed a DCA simulation platform supporting reinforcement learning validation and designed a novel Apollonius-based penetration strategy for attackers to improve algorithmic robustness. Experiments demonstrate that DASF-GRL adaptively adjusts defender populations across scenarios involving 20, 40, and 60 attackers, markedly outperforming baseline methods in convergence speed and defense success rates.

  abstract     = {The uneven spatial and temporal distribution of renewable energy resources poses significant challenges for multi-microgrid (MG) systems, resulting in high operational costs and low renewable energy utilization. To overcome these challenges, this work investigates a peer-to-peer electricity transaction and hydrogen-methanol-hydrogen technology-based methanol transaction among multi-MG. Besides, to realize net-zero emissions and carbon cycle utilization, the carbon capture system and hydrogen blending system are introduced into MG to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and capture and reform carbon dioxide for methanol synthesis equipment. Additionally, a cooperative operation model based on the Nash bargaining theory for multi-MGs under the transaction amount and price constraints of electricity and methanol is constructed. Due to the characteristics of non-convex and non-linear, the Nash bargaining is transformed into minimizing operation costs (sub-problem one) and maximizing payment benefits (sub-problem two). During the process of benefit allocation in sub-problem two, this work adopts a nonlinear energy sharing mapping method to quantify the comprehensive contribution rate of each MG to the multi-MG system, thereby achieving fair allocation of benefits. Finally, the alternating direction multiplier method is used to solve the model, effectively protecting the privacy of each MG. The simulation results demonstrate that a multi-MG system considering electricity and methanol transactions can effectively decrease carbon emissions and the total operational costs by 21.53% and 27.01% compared to only considering electricity transactions, respectively. Overall, the proposed electricity and methanol transactions strategy simultaneously reduces the overall system operation costs and carbon emissions, underscoring its advantages and significance.},

The offline proactive policy evaluator aims to provide a good and adaptable resource usage plan in advance, matching the predicted demand with the heterogeneous resources. The reactive execution module monitors the actual demand online and controls the resource usage to compensate for deviations from the offline prediction.

The integration of metaheuristic algorithms in path planning has proven to be remarkably efficient. This paper introduces a novel hybrid metaheuristic algorithm, Beluga Whale-Crayfish Optimization (BWCOA), for enhanced global optimization in path planning applications. While the Crayfish Optimization (COA) demonstrates superior convergence speed, its inherent probabilistic path completeness remains suboptimal. To address this limitation, we present three key innovations: a dynamic probability completion mechanism, adaptive convergence acceleration factors, and balanced exploration–exploitation trade-off parameters. The proposed BWCOA synergizes Beluga Whale Optimization (BWO)’s basin-hopping capability with COA’s swarm intelligence through parallel combined exploration strategies. To prove its powerfulness, a series of comparative analyses were conducted between BWCOA and other leading algorithms across two comprehensive test function suites. The numerical experiment results underscore the significant superiority of BWCOA over its counterparts. In the context of path planning simulations, BWCOA demonstrated notable improvements over COA within the same number of function evaluations, with average enhancement rates of 6.49 %, 7.42 %, 15.09 %, 76.42 %, and 0.73 % across five evaluation metrics. Similarly, when compared to BWO on the same set of indicators, BWCOA showed average improvement rates of 22.39 %, 27.71 %, 70.53 %, 260.86 %, and 41.22 %.

  abstract     = {With the explosive growth of global data volume, the usage of hard disk drives (HDDs) is also increasing rapidly. Consequently, the number of failed disks is continuously rising, which can affect storage service quality and even lead to data loss when failures occur.In recent years, the active fault-tolerant technology, which collects hard disks’ Self Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) data-set, predicts hard disk failure by machine learning model, and repairs near-failure disks’ data to health disks in advance, has become a common research hotspot in both academia and industry. Aiming at the existing problems such as interference characteristics, inaccurate failure time prediction, competition of system resources between data migration and front service, this paper researches the two-stage prediction model and data migration strategy based on hard disk failure time, including the two-stage hard disk information feature selection method, the two-stage prediction method of hard disk failure time, and the data migration elastic system resource allocation strategy. Feature selection is performed by combining embedding methods with visualization, and the importance of the selected features is evaluated using a random forest model. Based on the feature importance, further refinement is carried out to obtain the final feature set. Before predicting the failure time of hard drives, XGBoost is first used in a voting manner to identify drives predicted to be faulty. Then, a trained Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (Bidirectional LSTM) enhanced with a self-attention mechanism is employed to predict the exact failure time.Experimental results show that on the Backblaze dataset, the model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.24 when predicting failure times. The recall rate for predicting failures within 7 days reaches 98.79 %, the error rate is 0.30 %, the F1 score is 99.24 %, and the precision is 99.69 %. The elastic system resource allocation strategy for data migration improves business IOPS by 47.19 % and reduces latency by 38.68 %.},

  abstract     = {The time delay and Doppler shift parameters in radar system echo signals serve as effective tools for multi-target identification and localization in covert environments. However, the nonlinear characteristics of stationary targets are often masked by surrounding environmental factors, and traditional joint parameter estimation algorithms tend to suffer from high computational complexity and errors during demodulation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an acoustic-electromagnetic intermodulation detection system based on a novel atomic-paradigm algorithm, which ensures localization accuracy with minimal computational complexity and zero false alarms. Specifically, the system excites the target by introducing acoustic field energy coupling, generating discernible micromotion features. The resulting acoustically modulated signal is then modeled as a two-dimensional line spectral estimation problem, capturing the target’s time delay and Doppler shift. Furthermore, the joint parameter estimation algorithm is enhanced by relaxing dyadic constraints under sufficient conditions. In our experiments, a harmonic radar physical system is constructed to simultaneously localize and measure multiple non-clustered micromotion targets. The recognition accuracy is quantitatively evaluated using a classical neural network model, achieving 86.9 % accuracy across five classified targets. The improved algorithm’s performance in joint parameter estimation is also assessed under varying signal-to-noise ratios and demodulation error rates, with a detailed time complexity analysis provided.},

In such cases, learning algorithms often perform well in identifying the labels of majority class data points but exhibit high error rates in predicting the minority class. This paper proposes an innovative method based on the convex-hull concept to enhance classification for imbalanced and overlapping datasets. Unlike undersampling approaches that may lead to the loss of valuable information, our method focuses on preserving the data. The process begins by clustering the data points for each class separately in such a way that no points from the opposite class fall within the convex-hull of each cluster. Then, the support vector machine (SVM) is used to separate every cluster of a given class from the data points of the opposite class. Afterward, data points inside the SVM boundaries are considered as non-overlapping, while those outside the SVM boundaries are identified as overlapping data. The XGBoost algorithm is then employed to classify the data points within the overlapping region. Extensive experiments on a variety of simulated and real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of various evaluation metrics, compared to existing relevant algorithms for handling imbalanced and overlapping datasets.},

  abstract     = {Multispectral Object Detection has shown significant advantages under various lighting and weather conditions, with efficient fusion of RGB and thermal information playing a key role. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of feature fusion based on convolutional neural networks, but limited local feature interactions hinder the capture of global complementary information. To address these limitations, some methods adopt complex fusion strategies to enhance complementary feature extraction, yet fail to mitigate feature redundancy, which negatively impacts detection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Global-aware Cross-attention and Mask-guided Fusion (GCMF) module for Multispectral Object Detection, following a fusion-refinement paradigm. In the fusion stage, we first introduce Efficient Channel Attention with Weighted Max-Pooling (ECA-WM) to focus on key information within each modality and achieve implicit alignment before fusion. Subsequently, the Global-aware Cross-Attention Transformer (GCAT) effectively captures complementary cross-modal information and models global features. In the refinement stage, the Mask-guided Refinement Strategy (MRS) generates segmentation masks to distinguish target features from the background. These masks are applied before and after cross-modal interaction to highlight target-relevant information while suppressing irrelevant features, resulting in highly discriminative fused representations. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that the proposed GCMF fusion strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available FLIR, LLVIP and DVTOD datasets, with absolute improvements of 2.8 %, 4.2 % and 4.0 % over the previous methods, respectively. Moreover, the proposed strategy is general and effective, making it adaptable to various detection frameworks.},

However, challenges such as occlusion, significant object scale variations, and strict real-time requirements have made target detection in densely packed environments more challenging. This study, based on the YOLOv11 algorithm, proposes an efficient oriented bounding box detection method aimed at improving the model’s performance in feature extraction, computational efficiency, and network lightweighting to tackle target detection challenges in dense industrial settings. A Dynamic-Cross-Stage-Dual-Conv module was designed to enhance the Bottleneck section, employing a parallel dual-branch structure for local feature extraction and global context fusion. Simultaneously, a CIoU loss function with geometric perception was introduced to improve object localization accuracy and strengthen the network’s ability to handle densely stacked objects. Next, a Modulated-Deform-Conv deformable convolution module was integrated into the Backbone structure, dynamically adjusting the convolution kernel sampling positions, enabling the network to learn deformation features in dense scenes, improving adaptability to shape and scale variations while reducing computational load. Additionally, a C3K2_FasterBlock lightweight structure, utilizing partial convolutions and sparse connections, was proposed to minimize redundant calculations and optimize feature interactions. On a custom-built dense object dataset, the model achieved a 2.9 % increase in mAP@0.5 and reduced computational cost by 14 %. Finally, the improved model was deployed on the Jetson Orin Nano development board, demonstrating its practical value in robotic arm recognition and grasping tasks in dense industrial environments, offering a new paradigm for future applications.},

Multispectral detection techniques that integrate visible and infrared imagery offer a promising solution by leveraging complementary modality information. However, substantial discrepancies between these modalities hinder traditional fusion strategies, which often fail to adaptively align and integrate features, resulting in information loss and diminished detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose CrossModalNet, a novel cross-modal fusion and channel interaction framework. CrossModalNet comprises two key modules: Convolutional Attention Interaction Module (CAIM) and Bidirectional Cross-Modal Attention Module (BiCAM). CAIM enables effective cross-modal integration across varying semantic levels by employing convolutional attention mechanisms combined with pixel-wise channel guidance. In parallel, BiCAM enhances inter-modal feature complementarity by modeling channel-level interactions through bidirectional attention pathways. Extensive experiments conducted on four public multispectral datasets, FLIR, LLVIP, M3FD, and VEDAI, demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple performance metrics. Moreover, with an inference speed of 12.6 FPS on embedded platforms, the proposed model is suitable for real-time deployment.},

However, existing SA-based KT models seem to still have issues that need further investigation. Firstly, there commonly exists incorrect question-knowledge concept (Q-KC) mapping, yet most models fail to address this issue. Secondly, existing SA-based KT models suffer from high time complexity due to their extensive use of the SA mechanism. Finally, from real-world datasets, we observe that there exists a repeated attempts pattern which is often overlooked by existing KT models. Motivated by the above observations, we propose a novel Efficient Knowledge Tracing Model with Multi-task Learning (EKT-ML), an SA-based model with three crucial features. Firstly, we formulate the KT as a Multi-task Learning, with Q-task and KC-task as two tasks; by training them simultaneously and treating Q-KC mapping as shared information, the proposed EKT-ML tends to mitigate the impact of incorrect Q-KC mapping. Moreover, we propose an SVD-MLP component to replace the initial SA layers commonly used in existing SA-based KT models, thereby reducing the time complexity of EKT-ML. Finally, experimental results show that EKT-ML improves performance by up to 8.84 % across four metrics on three widely used datasets. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the EKT-ML has reduced time complexity compared with the benchmark baseline.},

  abstract     = {Edge detection is a key technique for extracting object structures and region boundaries in images, serving as an important foundation for visual tasks such as image segmentation and object recognition. However, during real-world image acquisition, various types of noise are inevitably introduced into the images. Traditional edge detection methods suffer significant performance degradation in noisy environments, often resulting in false edges or missing true edges. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel edge detection method for noisy images. The method begins by adaptively selecting an optimal fractional order p , based on the distribution characteristics of the image’s subband modulus coefficients. This order is then used to perform a p -order discrete fractional wavelet transform (DFRWT) on the noisy image. Then, within the DFRWT domain, an enhanced Canny algorithm is applied to detect edges. This algorithm improves upon the standard method by replacing the traditional gradient operator with a more robust fractional-order Sobel operator to compute the gradient magnitude. This detection process is performed on both the low- and high-frequency subbands to capture features at different scales. Finally, the edge images from the low- and high-frequency components are reconstructed to obtain the final edge detection result. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to four representative edge detection algorithms, the proposed method exhibits superior noise robustness and edge preservation capability in noisy environments.},

  abstract     = {Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) is a crucial characterisation method in materials engineering. The reliability of EBSD data is essential in the aerospace, nuclear, and automotive industries, as material performance greatly affects operational safety. While industrial practice makes perfect EBSD data difficult, with sample preparation errors, beam drift, and instrumental noise corrupting up to one-third of datasets. Automated crystallographic fidelity restoration solutions are needed because corrupted data force engineers to abandon valuable experiments or manually restore datasets at risk of errors. Current image inpainting techniques fail to maintain crystallographic constraints, resulting in restorations that violate the basic rules for crystalline materials. A novel physics-constrained framework is proposed to fill this gap. It integrates adversarial learning with graph neural networks (GNNs) for crystallographically consistent EBSD image inpainting. The proposed GTRG method consists of three elements: i ) a generative adversarial network (GAN) for reconstructing grain boundaries; i i ) a crystallography-guided graph transformer (T) that converts pixel data into orientation-boundary graphs; and i i i ) a regression graph convolutional network (RGCN) that links grain, orientation and boundaries to predict missing crystal orientations. The framework mandates a single orientation per grain and preserves grain boundary structure through structured graph representations. A strategy for creating automated EBSD datasets that incorporates realistic corruption patterns supports effective model training and evaluation.

  abstract     = {The gathering and sharing of information lay the groundwork for decision-making, while large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM) strategies address biases, promoting a more comprehensive evaluation of alternatives. Regarding information representation, incomplete multi-scale information systems (MSISs), as an application of granular computing, combine inputs from decision-makers (DMs) and tackle data gaps through multi-level analysis to foster LSGDM. Furthermore, given the interference effect among DMs, quantum social networks (SNs) and three-way decisions (TWD) are vital for effective decision-making. Quantum SNs provide a framework for modeling complex trust relationships among DMs, while TWD offers a structured approach to manage uncertainty. Therefore, this paper seeks to investigate quantum SN-guided three-way LSGDM under incomplete MSISs. First, MSISs are designed to gather information across spatial dimensions. Second, trust propagation paths within SNs are aggregated using quantum theory. Following community clustering through the Leiden algorithm, each community is further divided into core and fringe regions by three-way clustering (TWC), where core alternatives reflect the central members and fringe alternatives represent uncertain members. Third, to achieve intra-group consensus, the weights of DMs in fringe regions and those with low consensus levels are adjusted, while for inter-group consensus, the weight and decision information of community representatives with low consensus levels are modified. Fourth, alternatives are classified using the TWD method, which is grounded in the Dempster-Shafer theory and incorporates the enhanced belief Jensen-Sharma-Mittal ( E B J S M ) divergence. Finally, air quality datasets are used to validate the practicality of this method through sensitivity analysis, simulation analysis, comparative analysis, and statistical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Point clouds provide discrete representations of 3D scenes. The relative positions and directions between points collectively describe the objects. Variations in sampling angles, distances, or noises can introduce perturbations, disrupting these spatial and directional relationships. These pose significant challenges for achieving robust feature representations. However, research on the robust representation of point clouds is limited. Although advanced models achieve impressive performance, they exhibit poor robustness to perturbations. To address this issue, we propose Geometry-enhanced Directional Consistency Representation (GDCR), a novel method designed to enhance robustness. In GDCR, we introduce Statistic-based Geometric Reasoning (SGR) to achieve precise spatial geometric estimation for discrete point sets, explicitly enriching spatial geometric information. Furthermore, GDCR vectorizes features embedded with SGR information and applies feature rotation and relative direction refinement in the expanded feature space for robust directional representation. GDCR improves the flexibility and directional expressiveness of point cloud features, significantly improving robustness against perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDCR exhibits outstanding robustness while surpassing or matching the performance of state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) plays a crucial role in computer vision applications. Beyond spatial-based approaches, recent works have explored the Fourier domain. To better preserve structural details in extremely dark scenes, infrared modality has also been introduced as a robust prior for capturing scene geometry. However, existing methods suffer from limited enhancement performance due to the independent modeling of Fourier amplitude and phase, the limitations of cross-modal guidance, and the information loss in sequential feature extraction. To address these challenges, we propose APMoE-Net, a dual-stage Fourier network framework with amplitude-phase joint enhancement and spatial Mixture of Experts (MoE) compensation. Stage one performs coarse enhancement by leveraging infrared images to jointly optimize Fourier amplitude and phase, enabling mutual guidance learning between them. Subsequently, a Modality Refinement Module leverages edge information to refine infrared inputs, producing a refined modality map as a more accurate cross-modal prior for subsequent processing. The second stage employs a dual-branch design for texture refinement. Our key innovation lies in the MoE Compensation Module integrated within the Multi-scale Convolution Branch. This module employs a dynamic routing network to selectively activate specialized experts, enabling the recovery of fine-grained textures that are lost during sequential processing. Meanwhile, the Fourier Branch integrates the refined modality map to improve overall detail and contrast. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that APMoE-Net surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Notably, APMoE-Net achieves outstanding performance with a lightweight design, offering an efficient LLIE solution.},

  abstract     = {Accurate detection and identification of harmful algal bloom (HAB) images are crucial for developing effective early warning systems for HABs. However, existing edge detection models, primarily designed for natural scenes, struggle with HAB-specific challenges such as blurred cell contours and interference from impurity bubbles. To address these issues, we propose a novel edge detection approach tailored for marine HABs, integrating a diffusion probability model with Sobel convolutional inter-layer attention mechanisms. Firstly, we develop an image enhancement algorithm specifically for HABs images, significantly improving real-time dynamic sampling data by enhancing contrast, edges, and texture features. Next, we introduce the SIAnet network, which utilizes inter-layer attention and convolutional operations to generate comprehensive global information. This network enhances feature correlation by aggregating shared features across multiple layers and modeling both long-range and short-range dependencies, effectively suppressing noise and background interference. This facilitates precise extraction of algae boundaries and morphological characteristics. Additionally, an improved Sobel operator is employed to generate supplementary edge features, accelerating the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves robust performance on the HABs dataset, with an Optimal Dataset Scale (ODS) of 0.645, an Optimal Image Scale (OIS) of 0.702, and an Average Precision (AP) of 0.813. Compared to existing methodologies, our approach demonstrates strong generalization on BSDS and BIPED datasets, significantly enhancing performance and mitigating typical CNN issues of edge thickening and fragmentation. It offers essential technical support for efficient HAB early warning system development.},

  abstract     = {Inferring an individual’s BioGeographical Ancestry (BGA) through DNA analysis is a valuable tool in various fields such as forensic science, especially when traditional methods fail to identify suspects or victims. Advances in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) have revolutionized genomic data acquisition, enabling the development of comprehensive Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) panels for ancestry inference. This study assessed the effectiveness of a novel panel containing 3234 SNPs at both inter-continental and a more detailed BGA level, using various supervised Machine Learning (ML) models, including Categorical Naive Bayes, Penalized Multinomial Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and tree-based Gradient Boosting. A nested cross-validation approach was employed for model tuning and evaluation, with balanced accuracy as the main performance metric to address class imbalance. At the inter-continental level, all ML models demonstrated high balanced accuracy, confirming their reliability for BGA inference. However, performance declined at the more detailed continental level, likely due to a combination of factors including increased class imbalance, reduced sample sizes for certain populations, and the inherent complexity of distinguishing genetically and geographically proximate groups. Nonetheless, promising results were observed for South Asians, Northeast Asians, Europeans, and West Africans classes. In contrast, performance was notably lower for underrepresented classes such as Inner Asians. Misclassification patterns at both levels appeared to reflect known geographical and historical relationships, although further analysis revealed that these were often concentrated in underrepresented or genetically complex groups. These findings highlighted the potential of this SNP panel and ML approaches as valuable tools for forensic investigations.},

  abstract     = {Segmenting small regions of interest (ROIs) from abdominal CT images presents significant challenges, particularly due to class imbalance and variations in the sizes of foreground objects. A commonly adopted solution is the two-stage segmentation. However, this approach has two key limitations: i) Difficulty in balancing localization accuracy and target preservation. To reduce information loss in the first stage, existing methods typically enlarge the predicted bounding boxes, which improves coverage but compromises localization precision. ii) Independent optimization of the two stages, which lacks a collaborative mechanism. This fragmented pipeline limits the flow of information between stages, thereby constraining performance improvements. To address these limitations, we propose a reinforcement learning-based collaborative localization and segmentation (RL-CoSeg) framework, which comprises three sub-networks: localization network (LN), segmentation network, and localization-segmentation collaboration network (LSCN). The LN integrates prior knowledge and incorporates a dynamic reward mechanism to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of target detection through reinforcement learning (RL) strategies. The LSCN further introduces segmentation predictions as a reward signal, which, together with the localization reward, jointly drives policy learning. In addition, a heuristic exploration strategy is employed to avoid local optima and improve training stability. This design strengthens the information interaction and collaborative performance between the two tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior collaborative performance in small-target medical image segmentation.},

Additionly, they ignore entity type information when learning the rules. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework named Soft-Hard Rules with Entity Type Constraints (SH-ETRs) for improving the rules’ expressiveness and quality. Specifically, we first propose a Hard Entity Type Rules Module (H-ETRs) to learn entity type information and provide hard rule constraints. Then, we propose a Soft Entity Type Rule Reasoning Module (S-ETRs), which parameterizes the rule inference process and reduces error propagation during the process. Furthermore, by applying a rule consistency loss function to S-ETRs, we achieve the learning of soft rules under hard rule constraints, thereby aiming to prevent the learning of inaccurate rules during the training process. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing rule learning frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an F1 score of 74.39 and an IgnF1 score of 67.43 across three public datasets and two baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a critical technology for achieving personalized learning. It estimates learners’ knowledge states and predicts future performance using historical interaction data. Despite recent advances, two significant challenges remain. First, the accuracy of knowledge state modeling is limited by the insufficient fusion of multi-scale information across temporal and spatial dimensions. Second, a trade-off persists between improving predictive performance and enhancing interpretability. This paper proposes an interpretable knowledge tracing method based on dual-level knowledge states (DIKT) to address these challenges. From the temporal perspective, DIKT incorporates a forgetting-aware RoLinear Transformer and a semantic similarity-based review mechanism to model learners’ problem-level knowledge states. From the spatial perspective, it leverages a Knowledge Concept (KC) relational graph to propagate influence among related KCs and dynamically update learners’ concept-level knowledge states through three sequential learning phases: forgetting, aggregation, and updating. Student performance is predicted using a two-parameter Item Response Theory (IRT) model, which incorporates guess and slip parameters to account for response anomalies. We conduct extensive comparisons between DIKT and 20 state-of-the-art KT models on five widely used public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that DIKT achieves superior performance while preserving interpretability, highlighting its practical potential for real-world educational applications.

On the other hand, RASpan utilizes the prompt encoder based on the language model to encode this prompt sequence and employs a dedicated span representation module to obtain more accurate span representations. In addition, a new geo-entity prediction task is designed to learn the entire representation of each geo-entity while minimizing noise interference. Experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that our model achieves new state-of-the-art results, highlighting the effectiveness of RASpan in toponym recognition by introducing prior geo-entity knowledge.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, significant progress has been made in emotion recognition research based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, existing methods face two key limitations: on one hand, the reliance on fixed physical connections or static topological relationships makes it difficult to effectively represent the dynamic non-Euclidean spatial characteristics between EEG electrodes; on the other hand, spatiotemporal feature extraction is often conducted independently. This lack of a collaborative mechanism for spatiotemporal features results in insufficient fine-grained emotional representation capability. To address these issues, a dynamic collaborative evolutionary network (DCENet) is proposed based on graph-aware enhancement and global convolutional Transformer for EEG emotion recognition. DCENet constructs the causal relationship between electrodes by constructing the graph-aware enhancement (GAE) module, obtains spatial features with the causal relationship, and enhances key features. At the same time, DCENet constructs the global convolutional Transformer (GCT) module, which utilizes the global modeling advantage of the Transformer and the local perception ability of the convolutional operation to capture the temporal features with different scales. In addition, DCENet adaptively fuses temporal and spatial features through the local differential fusion (LDF) module to achieve cross-domain feature alignment and feature alignment of emotion categories to collaboratively evolve emotion representation features with more fine-grained information. This paper conducts experiments on the SEED, SEED-IV, and MPED datasets to validate the effectiveness of DCENet. The experimental results show that the model achieves cross-subject average accuracies of 87.55 %, 73.04 %, and 27.72 % on SEED, SEED-IV, and MPED, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {The synthesis of cross-modal medical images plays a vital role in bridging diagnostic gaps between imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, and PET. This integration enables a more comprehensive evaluation of a patient’s condition, improving diagnostic accuracy and aiding clinical decision-making. However, the performance of conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models is often hindered by pronounced structural and intensity discrepancies between modalities, as well as the inherently slow nature of the diffusion process. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Wavelet-Based Diffusion in the Difference Domain for Cross-Modality Medical Image Generation (Med-D3CG), a novel framework that transforms the synthesis process by emphasizing the difference domain. Instead of directly generating target images like conventional methods, Med-D3CG models the residual information between conditioned and target images. This strategy allows the framework to accurately capture essential structural and intensity variations between modalities, leading to more precise and realistic image synthesis. Additionally, Med-D3CG integrates the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to improve efficiency, accelerating the diffusion process while maintaining high image fidelity. On SynthRAD2023 and HMIFD datasets, state-of-the-art performance is achieved on pelvis and HMIFD using Med-D3CG , with the best Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) and competitive FID observed on brain.

  abstract     = {The neighborhood rough set model(NRSM) has shown its powerful capacity in feature selection. However, a challenge still exists in describing the diversity between the attributes deeply while avoiding the impact caused by the neighborhood parameters. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a two-stage feature selection by utilizing a three-way adaptive characteristic measure and an optimal combination search. First, we define a fitness function for applying the Stochastic Fractal Search(SFS) to design an novel adaptive neighborhood rough set model(ANRSM). To better utilize the construction characteristic of the adaptive model and reduce the computational cost, the lower and upper approximations of the SFS-based ANRSM are redefined through the fitness function. Second, based on the two approximations, we analyze the fitness function thresholds that can partition the universe into three regions and design the three-way adaptive neighborhood characteristic regions, which provide a more direct classification of samples without the inclusion and union operations. Third, we design different measures for the samples in diverse regions based on their corresponding characteristic. Afterward, a three-way adaptive characteristic measure is designed by integrating the three measures to evaluate the uncertainty of attributes. Then, we apply the measure to design a feature selection approach with greedy search. Considering that the greedy strategy may output redundant attributes, we introduce an optimal combination search approach through a novel wrapper technology to explore the potential optimal feature combinations. Compared with nine algorithms on fourteen public datasets, the experimental results show the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

This paper analyzes the traditional semi-supervised fuzzy C-means (SFCM) objective function, noting that as a labeled sample’s membership degree aligns with its prior information, the impact of this information on the deviation constraint weakens. This reduces its supervisory effect on optimizing the membership partition matrix, especially with a large regularization factor. To overcome this, we propose a novel semi-supervised fuzzy C-means method based on an asymmetric deviation constraint and develop a two-level alternating iterative optimization algorithm, supported by theoretical convergence analysis using Zangwill’s theorem and the bordered Hessian matrix. To address the slow convergence and high computational cost typical of semi-supervised fuzzy clustering, we further enhance the algorithm with affinity filtering and a membership scaling scheme for improved efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art techniques, advancing semi-supervised fuzzy C-means clustering.},

  abstract     = {In screw whirling milling, the relationship between machining quality and processing parameters exhibits highly nonlinear characteristics. The traditional multiple regression models may not be able to capture this complex relationship accurately. Therefore, it is necessary to consider more flexible and applicable algorithms to establish their connections and optimize processing parameters. It can improve the accuracy and reliability of products, and provide more scientific method guidance for screw whirling milling processing. The originality of this article lies in proposing an adaptive dynamic optimization hybrid model. This model combines improved sparrow search algorithm optimized backpropagation (ISSA-BP) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III). It can effectively adapt to dynamic data and find the optimal balance point among multiple objectives to better predict and optimize responses (cutting force, vibration, roughness, and residual compressive stress) in screw whirling milling. Firstly, a suitable network structure is identified by comparing the effects of five improvement strategies, population size, and the ratio of producers to scouters on the sparrow search algorithm. Then, an ISSA-BP prediction model is developed for four responses based on this structure. On this basis, the superiority of the established ISSA-BP model is verified by comparing prediction performance of five algorithms, and the relative prediction errors are all within 2%. The R 2 values of the models are all above 0.99, and they also perform well in indicators such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). Then, ISSA-BP model is encapsulated and embedded into the optimization algorithm as the fitness function of NSGA-III. Finally, with the processing parameters of whirling milling as constraints, the NSGA-III algorithm is used to solve the proposed model and obtain the Pareto optimal solution set. Choosing appropriate processing parameters according to different needs in actual machining can help improve the quality and efficiency of screw machining.},

While graph learning has achieved remarkable progress, real-world graph data presents a number of challenges that significantly hinder the learning process. In this survey, we focus on four fundamental data-centric challenges: (1) Incompleteness , real-world graphs have missing nodes, edges, or attributes; (2) Imbalance , the distribution of the labels of nodes or edges and their structures for real-world graphs are highly skewed; (3) Cross-domain Heterogeneity , graphs from different domains exhibit incompatible feature spaces or structural patterns; and (4) Dynamic Instability , graphs evolve over time in unpredictable ways. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to tackle these challenges by leveraging rich semantic reasoning and external knowledge. This survey focuses on how LLMs can address four fundamental data-centric challenges in graph-structured data, thereby improving the effectiveness of graph learning. For each challenge, we review both traditional solutions and modern LLM-driven approaches, highlighting how LLMs contribute unique advantages. Finally, we discuss open research questions and promising future directions in this emerging interdisciplinary field.

In this paper, we propose a region-aware prediction strategy based on shared points and multiple scales (RADMOEA) that combines global and local characteristics, aiming to enhance the algorithm’s ability to sense and adapt to POF. Firstly, the center-point movement strategy is used to move the non-dominated solution set from the previous moment to obtain the non-dominated solution set after the movement. The actual non-dominated solution set at the current moment and the non-dominated solution set after the movement share points in the objective space, and these shared points divide the non-dominated solution set at the current moment into several subregions. Within each region, all individuals are appropriately rescaled, and a local coordinate system is established. Then, within the local coordinate system, each individual is associated with the nearest post-movement non-dominated individual. Finally, new populations adapted to environmental changes are generated by combining centroid movement directions, Gaussian perturbations, and multi-scale individual association relationships. The proposed strategy is compared with six advanced algorithms, and the experimental results demonstrate that RADMOEA is effective in tracking the POF under dynamic environments.},

  abstract     = {Passive microwave remote sensing plays a vital role in Earth observation, with applications in soil moisture, ocean salinity, and atmospheric monitoring. However, improving spatial resolution at low frequencies remains challenging. Recently, combining multiple small antenna arrays into a larger one has emerged as a technological approach to enhance spatial resolution. Nevertheless, aperture synthetic radiometers formed by such combinations usually consist of non-uniform antenna arrays (one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional). Compared with regular antenna arrays, they complicate the inversion of brightness temperature (BT) images. This paper proposes NASRT, a transformer-based inversion method designed for multi-dimensional non-uniform ASRs. The network extracts and fuses spectral and UVW spatial distribution features from the visibility function (VF), and introduces a learnable position weight matrix during training to capture spatial information of the non-uniform array. Through supervised learning, NASRT effectively maps the VF to BT images. Simulations across 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D NASR scenes demonstrate that NASRT achieves higher accuracy and stability than traditional methods. In a 1-D NASR indoor experiment, the proposed method also shows improved inversion accuracy and lower sidelobes, validating its effectiveness.},

Traditional knowledge generation methods rely heavily on expert experience and are labor-intensive. Recently, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown exceptional capabilities for knowledge generation from multimodal data in many complex tasks. These models also have potential to assist knowledge mining in ocean exploration. However, two major challenges faced by the LMMs when used in ocean exploration include the scarcity of ocean instruction-following data and the degradation of underwater visual environments. In this paper, a small-scale LMM for ocean exploration, named the OceanAgent, is designed. First, a swarm-intelligence-based leaderless multi-agent collaboration framework is proposed to generate visual instruction-following data. Subsequently, we present a visual-language connector to simultaneously extract multi-scale features. It is formed by integrating a multi-scale residual network with a multi-layer perceptron, which can enhance the model’s performance on severely low-quality images. Experiments show that the proposed method for constructing visual instruction-following datasets improves both the textual quality and visual dialogue. When severely degraded ocean visual data are processed using the trained OceanAgent, the image description accuracy and image comprehension are improved by 23.6 % and 21.6 %, respectively, compared to existing models. Additionally, the model demonstrates superior domain expertise, with a 95.7 % win rate in dialogue quality assessments.},

  abstract     = {Graph anomaly detection(GAD) plays a critical role in fields such as fraud detection and network security. Although existing graph anomaly detection methods have achieved promising performance, most graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on the homophily assumption, which presumes that connected nodes share similar labels. However, real-world graphs frequently exhibit pronounced heterophily. Owing to class imbalance, normal nodes tend to have lower heterophily while anomalous nodes display higher heterophily. Furthermore, feature inconsistency induced by node camouflage exacerbates the detection challenge, rendering many existing approaches ineffective. To overcome these limitations, we propose SPS-GAD, a spectral-spatial graph structure learning framework specifically designed for detecting anomalous nodes in heterophilic graphs. First, to alleviate the feature inconsistency resulting from node camouflage, we develop a node reconstruction module that learns intermediate node representations to mitigate camouflage-induced bias, and applies spectral filters to extract the graph’s inherent structural features. Second, to address the heterophily disparities arising from class imbalance, we introduce a subgraph-type-aware spectral filtering module that leverages edge scores generated by an edge partitioner to segregate the graph into homophilic, ambiguous, and heterophilic subgraphs. Distinct spectral filters are subsequently applied to capture features across various frequency bands. Additionally, we integrate a neighbor-type-aware graph attention module that employs edge scores within an attention mechanism to guide the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing spatial representation learning. Experimental evaluations on six real-world datasets reveal that SPS-GAD significantly outperforms all baseline methods in key metrics such as F1-Macro and AUC, thereby confirming its effectiveness in graph anomaly detection.

  abstract     = {Under the dual pressure of explosive growth in cross-border e-commerce demand and increasing timeliness requirements from overseas customers, cross-border logistics service providers are compelled to establish logistics facilities and deploy fleets across multiple regions to ensure rapid response. However, during freight transportation, the lack of effective management over these complex and heterogeneous fleets—particularly in terms of fleet composition and routing decisions—has led to high transportation costs and low operational efficiency. This study is grounded in the practical operational context of cross-border logistics in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area and models a multi-level, multi-node cross-border transportation network. To minimize the overall operational cost, the problem is addressed from two interrelated decision-making perspectives: fleet composition at the strategic level and routing planning at the operational level. Thus, a bi-level programming model is proposed to systematically capture the hierarchical structure and the logical relationship between these two decision layers. Furthermore, the model incorporates cost differences among trucks with different functional capabilities to reflect the significant disparity in logistics cost structures between domestic and overseas operations. To address the above multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, a tailored Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (MNSGA-II) is developed. Several key components of the algorithm are modified and enhanced to improve its search efficiency and solution quality in handling the problem’s complexity. Comparative experiments against classical algorithms demonstrate the superior solution quality and robustness of the proposed approach. The influence of cost differentials on composition and scheduling decisions is further analyzed, providing practical insights for the strategic planning of cross-border logistics systems.},

Due to the existence of multiple roots, such problems often exhibit complex and multimodal characteristics. Although numerous differential evolution-based algorithms have been developed to solve NESs, most of them employ only a single mutation operator, which is not adaptable to different problem scenarios. To this end, a diversity-based niching differential evolution with neighborhood competition (DNDE) is proposed to solve NESs. First, a control mechanism that takes into account population diversity and the evolutionary stage is proposed to adaptively assign appropriate mutation strategies to each subpopulation (niche), thereby enhancing the efficiency of root-finding. Second, a neighborhood priority competition mechanism is proposed to reduce cross-peak competition between populations, which ensures local convergence while improving global convergence. Finally, a reinitialization strategy based on opposition learning is introduced to guide the population toward more promising areas of the search space. Experimental results on 18 complex NESs and two real-world engineering problems show that DNDE outperforms many advanced algorithms in both root rate and success rate, demonstrating its effectiveness and value in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {RGB-D salient object detection achieves salient region localization in complex scenes by fusing RGB images and depth images. Existing methods typically employ two-stream networks to extract features separately followed by cross-modal fusion. However, differences between heterogeneous modalities can easily lead to feature degradation during cross-modal fusion, while the inherent noise interference in low-quality depth maps may generate cumulative effects during multi-stage propagation, severely constraining detection performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a texture-enhanced guided network. The core innovations lie in three aspects: during the feature encoding stage, a texture-enhanced module is constructed to utilize high-frequency texture information from RGB images through attention mechanisms for hierarchical optimization of depth features; in the feature fusion stage, a dual-path adaptive interaction module is designed to establish cross-modal semantic correlations via channel-spatial cooperative driving mechanisms, effectively suppressing redundant feature interference; for the decoding reconstruction stage, a dynamic hierarchical guidance mechanism is proposed to drive progressive calibration of low-level spatial details by high-level semantic features through learnable cross-scale transformation modules. Extensive experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to other approaches.},

  abstract     = {Deepfake, as a generative technology, has opened up new avenues for the development of the film, television, and art industries. However, its abusive use has triggered serious social security threats, such as infringement of portrait rights and the spread of misinformation, which has drawn widespread attention to research on deepfake detection techniques. Current deep learning-based face forgery detection methods face critical challenges: 1) insufficient focus on common forgery traces leads to poor generalization performance on datasets generated by unknown forgery methods; 2) traditional spatio-temporal feature fusion mechanisms struggle to balance the representational weights of spatial details and temporal dynamics, and exhibit inadequate robustness against post-processing operations like compression and cropping. To address these issues, this paper first designs a phase consistency edge artifact mining module is designed to extract common forgery traces from edge textures by leveraging the deep-phase information of images, significantly enhancing the model’s generalization ability. Second, a multi-frame synthesis strategy is designed to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features while balancing the network’s attention to these two feature domains. Third, a visual state-space model based on 3D scanning is designed, which for the first time employs the Mamba model to analyze spatio-temporal forgery patterns, notably improving the robustness of the model against unknown perturbations. Experimental results on standard benchmarks–FaceForensics++, Celeb-DFv2, WildDeepfake and DFDC(Preview)–demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in three core dimensions: detection accuracy, cross-dataset generalization, and robustness against perturbations.},

First, we introduce a progressive spatiotemporal sampling module that sparsely samples long-range frames and densely samples short-range frames. Second, we design a spatiotemporal alignment encoder module to extract frame-level temporal and spatial pixel features. Finally, We propose a long short-term feature aggregation module that employs a dynamic query generator to derive adaptive queries by implicitly modeling motion relationships among short-term frames, and guides a cascaded fusion of aggregated features from long-term, short-term, and current frames to fuse temporal information. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our LSTT achieves absolute gains of 1.4 % and 2.1 % in detection precision on VisDrone-VID and UAVDT datasets, respectively.},

  abstract     = {One significant challenge in deep learning is the inability to effectively generalize to new data whose distribution differs from that of the training data. Hence, domain generalization has received increasing attention in related fields. Classical methods aim to identify an invariant predictor that can recognize invariant representations across all the training domains. However, these methods limit the model to rely solely on invariant representations, which hinders the learning of important finer details. To address this challenge, we propose a Scale-invariant Information Bottleneck (SIB) method to identify both invariant and scale-invariant features. We subsequently introduce a tractable loss function derived from the variational analysis. This novel method captures more detailed information, including fine textures and unique characteristics, while also eliminating irrelevant or spurious representations by using information bottleneck. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on Rotated MNIST, Colored MNIST, Colored Fashion-MNIST, PACS, Office-Home and Camelyon17-WILDS validate the effectiveness of our SIB method in addressing the domain generalization problems. Notably, our approach outperforms 14 existing methods with an average improvement of 4.74 %. More significantly, it surpasses 6 recent, related methods by an average of 2.21 %. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of our method through the analysis of hidden feature maps and representations.},

  abstract     = {Scientific and rational prices are determinant for the success of transfer of development rights (TDR). Nevertheless, previous studies largely overlook the multifaceted impacts of risks on pricing, hampering market participation and value revelation. This is especially relevant in the context of China’s inter-provincial construction land quota trading due to its broader scope and dynamic complexities. This study addresses this gap by proposing an integrated decision-making framework to identify TDR risk factors and determine the optimal pricing for TDR under risk sharing. Results show that among 28 identified risk factors across the trading lifecycle, pre-transaction (remediation application and remediation acceptance) risk factors exhibit lower weights (0.017 and 0.218) but demand greater responsibility from quota-sending governments (80.5% and 73.0%); quota transfer risk factors hold the highest weight (0.306), with nearly balanced responsibility sharing between trading parties; while post-transaction (remediation acceptance and post monitoring) risk factors (weighted at 0.215 and 0.218) should be borne mainly by quota-receiving governments (64.1% and 60.9%). A paradigmatic trading case study between Muli and Jiashan Counties empirically reveals that risk factors elevate the optimal price to 621171.89 yuan/mu—24.23% above the current national standard price—by increasing costs, reducing profits, decreasing the supply–demand ratio, and complicating ecological compensation. These findings underscore the importance of risk responsibility management and risk-based pricing mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Curbside lanes are valuable spatial assets, with on-street parking, driving, and other travel modes competing for the space. Autonomous vehicle (AV) transport is expected to park at the curbside for diverse purposes, raising conflicts between driving and parking in the city centre. This study presents a framework to determine on-street parking configurations under different traffic flow and parking supply scenarios for the downtown region. The main contribution stems from solving the macro-level parking configuration problem using customised metaheuristics while considering microscopic AV operations. We tested the framework using a road network comprising a downtown central business district and adjacent urban areas. Among the considered metaheuristics, the discrete particle swarm optimisation outperformed the genetic algorithm in minimising network-level travel delays but at the cost of higher computational time. Three main empirical findings are derived. First , parking lanes are more likely to be assigned to edges in downtown areas or those with lower traffic and driving speeds. Second , high parking supply negatively affects the macroscopic fundamental diagram by increasing congestion and reducing flow efficiency, but such an effect diminishes in congested networks. Third , there exists an optimal parking supply level (40 % in the case study) for most flow rate conditions that can help reduce congestion. The proposed framework was validated through a case study in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. This study provides valuable insights for urban and transportation agencies to manage on-street parking lane assignments to balance parking and driving demands in the AV transport era. The approach has broader applicability as it is transferable to human-driven vehicles and mixed autonomy scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In recommender systems, due to device privacy restrictions, sometimes we can only obtain anonymous users’ interaction behavior within a single session. This type of recommendation is called session-based recommendation. Modeling users’ interest based on session data is one of the core issues in session-based recommendation. However, most existing methods only model users’ interest within individual sessions, neglecting information propagation across sessions. This paper addresses this challenge by designing a contrastive learning module based on clustering to model inter-session information propagation. Specifically, in addition to propagating information within sessions using hypergraph convolution, a cluster algorithm is applied to group all nodes across sessions. Then a contrastive learning loss is designed based on the clustering results to facilitate information propagation across sessions, thereby explicitly modeling the semantic similarity of similar items across different sessions. We call our model Clustering Hypergraph Neural Network (CluHNN). CluHNN explicitly learns the correlation between similar items across different sessions, improving the quality of item representations and, consequently, yielding better interest representations through cross-session information propagation. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed CluHNN. For example, in terms of MRR@20, CluHNN achieves significant improvements of 1.3 % and 2.0 % relative gains over the strongest baseline, respectively.},

  abstract     = {As a burgeoning theme in optical remote sensing image (ORSI) analysis, salient object detection (SOD) plays a vital role in traffic monitoring, agriculture, disaster management, and other fields. However, the existing ORSI-SOD methods are all single-modal (RGB images primarily), which suffer from performance drop when facing complex scenes (e.g., intricate backgrounds, low contrast scenes, and similar objects). To address this challenge, we introduce estimated depth map to complement RGB image in ORSI-SOD for the first time, which provides 3D geometric cues to improve detection accuracy in complex scenes, thus advancing ORSI-SOD from single-modal to multi-modal. Furthermore, we design a novel pretraining framework: multi-modal reconstructed image pretraining (MMRIP) to pretrain SOD model in multi-modal ORSI-SOD. MMRIP initially utilizes a masked autoencoder (MAE) to restore the masked RGB image; subsequently, it feeds the restored RGB image and clean depth map to the SOD model to generate the saliency map, which can help SOD model more effectively integrate cross modal information and extract better feature. Besides, we present a simple RGB-D SOD model, namely SimSOD, which is pretrained by MMRIP for ORSI-SOD. SimSOD has two major components: DFormer (encoder) and MLP head (decoder). Specifically, we first input RGB image and depth data into the encoder to generate four multi-scale features, then use the decoder to fuse these features and yield the prediction result. Without bells and whistles, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three public ORSI-SOD datasets. The code can be accessed at: https://github.com/Voruarn/MMRIP .},

Existing approaches for handling measurement data often overlook the correlation between local time–frequency variations caused by FDIA nodes and global spatial information in analyzing measurement data, leading to inaccurate localization. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: a multilevel wavelet spatio-temporal map embedded FDIA localization method. Initially, a multi-resolution time–frequency signal decomposition model is utilized to separate the time–frequency mutation signals induced by FDIA from the measurement data using fast wavelet transform. Subsequently, a multi-channel time–frequency feature extraction technique is developed to capture the mutation characteristics of FDIA in time–frequency signals. This involves extracting detailed features of the time–frequency signals pre and post-attack via a multi-channel convolution operation encompassing “temporal-local-global” aspects. Finally, we propose an FDIA localization model based on multi-level graph wavelet embedding. The model embeds spatio-temporal information into time–frequency features via graph wavelet convolution and builds a spatio-temporal dependency map through multi-level neighborhood sampling. To mitigate measurement loss and noise, graph smoothing regularization and graph dropout are introduced during training. A graph attention mechanism further captures spatio-temporal dependencies among nodes, enabling accurate FDIA localization. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Traditional recommendation models primarily rely on display feedback and typically utilize a single type of user-item interaction data, which often results in significant data sparsity issues. In contrast, multi-behavioral recommendation models leverage various behaviors such as browsing, favoriting, and other interactions. These additional behaviors help improve the prediction of user-item interactions. Existing multi-behavioral recommendation methods often overlook the potential factors influencing multi-behavioral interactions and the differences between various behavior types. In this study, we introduce a multi-behavioral recommendation algorithm utilizing decoupled graph convolution (MBR-DGC), which effectively mitigates the data sparsity of the target behaviors and improves recommender system performance by capturing the differences between the semantics of different behaviors. Specifically, we construct multiple non-overlapping independent isomorphic graphs and separate potential factors affecting the interactions among users, items, and behaviors using decoupled convolutional networks to reconstruct the node features of users in different behaviors. Afterwards, multi-behavioral features of users are aggregated using contrastive learning to achieve personalized multi-behavioral information aggregation. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that MBR-DGC effectively leverages multi-behavioral data, significantly enhancing recommendation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The swarm intelligence aggregation system represents a key capability in current-generation UAV swarm, demonstrating robust collective intelligence. Currently, leveraging Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) offers a promising approach for building UAV swarm intelligence aggregation systems. However, the MADRL methods are difficult to cope with the challenge of exponential increase in computation when facing the collaboration problem of large-scale swarms, and the agents also have the problem of partial observability of the environment. This paper proposes an Information Aggregation Decision Method for UAV swarm based on Joint Communication and Proximal Strategy (IADM-JCPS). This method designs a communication information aggregation (CIA) network to enable UAVs to gather observation information from neighbor UAVs, and uses the attention mechanism to screen important information. Then, the aggregated information is used as part of the input of the policy network to increase the information diversity of the decision-making process. Finally, the gradient clipping mechanism is used to trim the policy gradient to enhance the stability of the training process. A UAV swarm multi-target tracking (MTT) mission scenario is designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed IADM-JCPS algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the baseline algorithm in terms of task collaboration and scalability.},

  abstract     = {Reliable assessment of precipitation is crucial for incorporating meteorological and hydrological research into industrial and agricultural applications. Accurately estimating precipitation is a challenging task. In addressing this problem, we propose to develop AERO-Net, a novel deep learning framework designed to correct spatial, temporal, and amplitude biases in WRF-ROMS precipitation data. The integration of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) makes it a valuable tool for precipitation forecasting. AERO-Net incorporates autoencoders (AEs) for handling fluctuation and generalizing latent space representations, a latent module (LM) for transforming WRF-ROMS data into bias-corrected representations, a residual module (RM) for error minimization via boost, and a calibration module (CM) for improving near-zero precipitation. Empirical results show that AERO-Net achieves a balanced error reduction across precipitation cohorts grouped by intensity, reducing the macro-averaged root mean square error (macro RMSE) by 3.6 mm/day and the macro-averaged mean absolute deviation (macro MAD) by 0.68 mm/day compared to the original WRF-ROMS. AERO-Net is seen to improve the correlation coefficient (CC) by 26.32 %, increasing it from 0.38 to 0.48, in comparison to the original WRF-ROMS. These findings underscore its potential as an effective solution for enhancing precipitation estimates in high-resolution modeling systems.},

First, a Convolutional Spatial Gating module processes batched RGB and depth inputs, suppressing extraneous background noise while isolating fine-grained segmentation and structural features and unifying channel representation. Subsequently, a Deep Surrounding-Awareness Localization module and a Contour-Guided Integrity Aggregation module collaboratively refine and merge multi-level features, focusing on the global form of camouflaged objects while iteratively enhancing segmentation detail. Finally, a Guided Residual Channel Attention module further refines low-layer structural cues.

  abstract     = {In the field of adversarial example generation and defense, compared to restricted attacks with L p -norm constraints, unrestricted attacks without L p -norm constraints emanate better visual imperceptibility. Existing unrestricted attacks typically manipulate the semantic content of examples (e.g. texture or color) to generate adversarial examples. However, current works usually ignore multifaceted features or loss optimization strategy, which limits attack performance. In this paper, we draw inspiration from stable diffusion model and propose a unrestricted attack method called Feature Truncation Unrestricted Attack (FTUAttack) to achieve both better transferability and imperceptibility. Specifically, we promote the performance of unrestricted attacks from the perspectives of both diffusion principle and feature truncation for the first time. Firstly, we propose a Global Deep Feature Extractor (GDFE) module to truncate global feature for the subsequent diffusion denoising process. Secondly, to further boost the transferability, we design a novel Critical Latent Feature Extractor (CLFE) module to obtain critical local feature that need to be truncated during the denoising process and investigate the influence of the different segmentation ways on critical local feature. Thirdly, we propose Multi-Loss Fusion (MLF) strategy to balance the conflict between perturbations and examples’ quality by guiding the optimization direction. Extensive experiments on various model structures and datasets demonstrate the superiority of our attack over the existing attack methods.},

  abstract     = {The difficulty of labeling Electrocardiogram (ECG) has prompted researchers to use self-supervised learning to enhance diagnostic performance. Masked autoencoders (MAE) are a mainstream paradigm where models learn a latent representation of the signal by reconstructing masked portions of the ECG. However, existing methods lack a specific design for the spatial–temporal characteristics of ECG. Specifically, leads represent spatial projections of cardiac activity, while timestamps capture temporal patterns, and the two correspond to different axes of information. Existing MAE frameworks tend to unify them prematurely, potentially weakening critical local dependencies. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Hierarchical Decoupled Masked Autoencoder (STHD-MAE). This framework decouples ECG into isolated leads or time steps in the shallow layer to capture local dependencies with different views, then aligns spatial–temporal representations and re-establishes global dependencies in the deep layer to comprehensively represent pathological information. We also design a medical report fusion module during pre-training, which uses cross-attention to align the ECG report text encoded by a medical language model with the signal’s latent representation, thereby guiding the encoder to focus on pathological information through implicit cross-modal learning. We validate the effectiveness of STHD-MAE on multiple downstream classification and reconstruction tasks. The results show that STHD-MAE outperforms existing self-supervised learning methods by approximately 2% in F1-scores for both coarse-grained and fine-grained classification performance, and its reconstruction quality also exceeds the baseline generative model.},

The main purpose of critical node detection is to detect a set of nodes that cause the greatest damage to the network connectivity, and it has been applied in many fields such as social network analysis and traffic network management. As a classic non-deterministic polynomial time complete problem, critical node detection faces enormous challenges with the continuous expansion of network size. The existing methods are difficult to achieve a good balance between effectiveness and efficiency, especially when the scale of complex networks becomes larger. To this end, this paper proposes a dual population based critical node detection method (DPCND) to effectively and efficiently obtain a set of critical nodes, which utilizes the co-evolution of auxiliary population generated from reduced graph and main population generated from original graph to find the optimal solution. In the proposed algorithm, a dual population interaction mechanism consists of influence and expansion strategies is proposed for information exchange, where the influence strategy transfers candidate good solutions from the auxiliary population to the main population to improve search efficiency, and the expansion strategy provides node information of the main population to guide the expansion of search space for the auxiliary population. Finally, the experimental results on 20 real-world complex networks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm comparing to the state-of-the-arts.},

  abstract     = {The successful simulation of constrained differential evolution (CDE) algorithm for solving phase equilibrium calculation has first verified that heuristic optimization algorithms are effective ways to solve this kind of problems. Their insensitivity to initial values overcomes the limitations associated with two kinds of traditional methods, i.e., direct solution methods based on Newton’s method and indirect solution methods based on thermodynamic principles. This article proposes a constrained quadratic interpolation optimization algorithm (CQIO) for obtaining the satisfactory solutions of phase equilibrium calculation under given volume, temperature, and moles (NVT-flash). The proposed CQIO regards the total Helmholtz free energy of a NVT-flash problem as its objective function, while the moles vector and volume of a certain phase as its decision variables. The consistency between the four cases’ experimental results of CQIO and those of published articles demonstrates the effectiveness of CQIO in solving NVT-flash problems. Then the computational overhead and algorithmic stability of CQIO were analyzed. In Cases 1, 2 and 3, the average CPU time of CQIO compared to CDE has increased by 46.98 % , 54.56 % and 21.02 % respectively. The Std values of CQIO are significantly smaller than those of CDE in all cases except for Example 2. The proposed CQIO greatly promotes the application of heuristic algorithm in the field of phase equilibrium calculation.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses a novel VRP variant integrating seasonal demand fluctuations, heterogeneous vehicle sources, and multi-endpoint constraints, focusing on the distribution of seasonal products in a steel parts enterprise. It tackles the complex vehicle routing problem with time windows involving heterogeneous fleets, which encompass different vehicle sources (owned and rented), types (fuel-powered and electric), capacities, ranges, and endpoints. To balance enterprise profitability, greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental quality, we develop a mathematical model centered on optimizing distribution costs, greenhouse gas emissions, and vehicle utilization. Drawing inspiration from ancient competitive activities, we propose a novel Huashan Swords Algorithm (HSSA). Through simulations using real enterprise data, we demonstrate the HSSA’s effectiveness, with comparative experiments against existing advanced algorithms highlighting its superiority. Applying the algorithm to design logistics distribution schemes, we conduct in-depth tests considering different customer groups and fuel station distributions. Analyzing the results from the perspectives of profitability, emissions, and environmental quality, we offer targeted operational suggestions for the enterprise based on its situation, geographical characteristics, and fiscal policies. Moreover, we provide recommendations to local governments on fuel station construction and vehicle subsidy policies, contributing practical solutions to both enterprise operations and regional development.},

  abstract     = {Predicting gold prices through the analysis of key economic indicators such as inflation rates, Government Bond Yields, and the U.S. Dollar Index, alongside historical Gold Prices, is crucial for enabling investors to better understand market dynamics and make vital decisions to maximize returns. However, previous studies have faced challenges in extracting hidden factors related to gold price prediction from diverse economic indicators, and the comprehensive exploration of gold price data is yet to be fully achieved. To address this, the present study introduces a mid to long-term gold price prediction model named DPformer. This model utilizes a patching strategy to investigate the relationships between different economic indicators and Gold Prices. It also employs a decomposition approach to discover the mid to long-term trend characteristics and yearly seasonal patterns of Gold Prices. The core of the model integrates a Transformer module, which is solely based on an Encoder structure, and enhances it with multiple attention mechanisms and convolutions. This enhancement allows the improved Transformer model to more effectively capture the long-term dependencies of Gold Prices. The empirical results demonstrate that DPformer consistently outperforms a suite of advanced models widely adopted in terms of mid to long-term forecasting accuracy, including LSTM, GRU, Transformer, DLinear, and PatchTST. Notably, for the 30-step gold price prediction task, DPformer achieves a 21.78 % reduction in Mean Squared Error compared to PatchTST. Moreover, by quantitatively analyzing how various economic indicators influence gold price forecasts, this study provides substantial support for investors in making informed decisions at critical moments.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a systematic mapping of machine learning in class imbalance scenarios, offering a broad overview of key challenges, promising emerging techniques, and established methodologies across various application domains. The investigation stands out by employing a hybrid search and selection protocol that combines methodological rigor with technical innovation. The adopted strategy integrated manual searches in reference sources with automated processes based on machine learning, semantic embeddings, and graph-based ranking algorithms. To enhance selection quality, the Quasi-Golden Set (QGS) method was used to build a reference set from manually selected articles – a critical foundation for calibrating and evaluating automated search strings. This combination ensured broad coverage of the topic while improving sensitivity and precision in identifying relevant studies. The initial analysis reviewed 25,593 publications. After screening and applying eligibility criteria, 468 articles were included in the final dataset. The results indicate that 55 % of the studies address multiple domains, with a strong predominance of tabular data ( 84 % ). SMOTE and hybrid approaches were among the most common techniques, present in 61 % of the studies. In terms of evaluation metrics, ROC-AUC was the most frequently used, followed by F1-score and accuracy – the latter noted for limitations in highly imbalanced scenarios. Building on these findings, we derive an empirically grounded taxonomy that links problem context, solution algorithms, and scenario-appropriate evaluation metrics, and we provide a minimal selection guideline table to support applied use. While sampling-based methods remain prevalent, deep learning approaches such as convolutional neural networks and graph-based models are increasingly adopted. Additionally, federated, contrastive, and semi-supervised learning are emerging as relevant paradigms, particularly suited for privacy-aware or low-label environments. This study consolidates current knowledge, identifies methodological and application gaps, and highlights trends that are likely to shape future research. It contributes both a comprehensive synthesis of the field and strategic insights for advancing machine learning techniques in the presence of class imbalance.},

This paper tackles the Multi-Product Process Planning Problem (MPPP), optimizing both individual process plans and their sequencing. We propose a 0–1 LP model, the model is relaxed by fixing the product sequencing variables and implemented in a Normal-Boundary Intersection method (NBI-es), the method uses a function for iteratively updating β values. Three metaheuristics are also developed: NSGA-II, and two variants of MOEA/D, one enhanced by Opposition-based learning (OBL). Computational experiments show that the update function enhances the performance of NBI over simple Normalized-Weighted Sum (NWS) method. Additionally, NBI-es performs better in HV metric for small size instances if it is given enough CPU times, while MOEA/D significantly outperforms NSGA-II on larger instances on most convergence and spread based metrics. OBL further enhances solution diversity for MOEA/D, albeit with less convergence. A special case of the MPPP is investigated, involving identical products: the Multi-Unit Process Planning (MUPP). An integrated approach was compared with a sequential separated approach. Results indicate that the integrated approach outperforms the separated method for smaller problem instances. Moreover, the analysis of high-quality MUPP solutions revealed a tendency towards diverse process plan combinations rather than repetitive identical ones.},

The processing times of remanufacturing jobs are uncertain due to unpredictable status, leading to certain impacts on scheduling performance. Therefore, we address a flexible job-shop scheduling problem with new and remanufacturing jobs to minimize makespan. To solve this problem, a slack-based two-stage improved particle optimization algorithm is proposed. The first stage aims to yield a solution set with minimum makespan, while the second stage aims to search the best robust solution with maximum total slack from the set. Both stages are executed alternately to optimize makespan and total slack. Moreover, a position updating mechanism with genetic operators and a tabu search inspired local search strategy are implemented to improve algorithmic performance. Computational experiments are conducted using adapted benchmark problems and an industrial case to validate the proposed algorithm.},

This study innovatively proposes a three-stage network SBM model to resolve the “black box” limitation of conventional DEA approaches, while a DEA-ML model is developed to achieve enhanced prediction accuracy. The results reveal that GEE in Chinese cities remains low, with the eastern region leading and the western region trailing. However, efficiency has improved since 2016, primarily driven by advancements in environmental governance. Regional disparities, largely attributed to interregional differences, are gradually decreasing. Among forecasting models, the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) delivers the highest accuracy, predicting sustained leadership in the east, strong growth in the northeast, and a reduction in national disparities. This study offers a comprehensive framework for evaluating and predicting GEE, providing valuable insights for sustainable development policies.},

  abstract     = {A hybrid algorithm integrating a couple of individual evolutionary algorithms (sub-algorithms) is widely recognized as an effective approach to enhance both robustness and optimization performance. Nevertheless, such integration often destroys the structure of the sub-algorithm and makes it difficult to incorporate additional evolutionary algorithms. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel framework, the Heterogeneous Alternating Evolutionary Algorithm (HAEA), designed to integrate multiple evolutionary algorithms while enabling the flexible addition, removal, and replacement of internal sub-algorithms. To facilitate the integration of a broad spectrum of sub-algorithms, this study draws inspiration from the particle swarm optimization algorithm to devise a suite of information indicators for the transmission of optimization information between sub-algorithms with disparate structures. Furthermore, HAEA is endowed with an adaptive mechanism that dynamically modifies the selection probabilities of its sub-algorithms based on their long-term and short-term performance throughout the evolutionary process. We conducted a comparative analysis of HAEA against all its sub-algorithms across three widely recognized function test sets: CEC2013, CEC2017, and CEC2022. Meanwhile, we applied the HAEA separately to basic metaheuristic algorithms and advanced evolutionary algorithms in recent years and conducted two comparative experiments. Both experimental results show that HAEA outperforms all sub-algorithms in terms of robustness and optimization performance. Its distinctive flexibility allows for the incorporation of additional superior evolutionary algorithms in the future, thereby enhancing its overall performance.},

Based on higher-dimension algebra multiplication rules, the studied FOHDVNN are directly decomposed into the eight or four subsystems in real-valued field. Subsequently, free quadratic coefficients are taken into the establishment of two types of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) which is newer and more general. Then, mainly based on the very recent lemmas and Lyapunov theories, the flexible criteria are generally acquired for the global Mittag-Leffler synchronization (MLSY) problem of FOHDVNN. The final criteria have the advantage in being easily calculated and widely used. It is worth noting that the optimal solutions of these criteria can be obtained through the genetic algorithm and the synchronization performance can be improved by optimizing the quadratic coefficients.

  abstract     = {The core challenge for multimodal multi-objective problem (MMOP) resolution lies in maintaining synergistic interactions between convergence and diversity. However, the existing algorithms usually consider convergence-first, which neglect to consider both diversity and convergence into account during the evolutionary process. Likewise, the optimization methods tend to gravitate toward locally optimal regions rapidly, leading to lose diversity for the local PS. This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning-guided multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with a serial-parallel mechanism (DRLMMEA) to investigate the impact of different operator selection on the performance of MMEAs, which greatly helps to balance the convergence and diversity. DRLMMEA utilizes Q-Network to select the operator with the highest reward to enhance the population’s search ability. An improved sorting method (ISM) based on neighborhood dominance updates the population by sorting individuals according to their convergence quality, thereby enhancing convergence performance in the objective space. Moreover, this study proposes a series-parallel mechanism, a series structure enhances the diversity in the decision space, while the parallel structure reduces the computational burden of the algorithm evidently. The proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning-assisted operator selection mechanism, which enables effective balance between diversity and convergence, and an improved crowding distance approach that enhances convergence performance. DRLMMEA undergoes comprehensive testing against 6 contemporary approaches using MMF and IDMP benchmark problems, achieving supremacy in 4 principal performance metrics according to experimental findings. The multimodal gearbox parameter optimization is addressed using the proposed DRLMMEA, which demonstrates superior performance against 6 algorithms in comparative evaluations. It has demonstrated a significant role in solving the MMOPs with the imbalance between convergence and diversity.},

  abstract     = {In multitasking optimization, knowledge transfer between tasks through subspace generation has been widely employed to enhance the convergence performance of algorithms. However, this approach fails to account for the inter-task knowledge mapping relationships. Therefore, cross-task knowledge transfer during the optimization process remains inherently blind, potentially leading to mismatched subspace information and consequently degrading the algorithm’s performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multitask evolutionary algorithm based on an association mapping strategy and an adaptive population reuse mechanism, namely PA-MTEA. Specifically, to fully represent the correlations between multitask domains and enhance the adaptability of transfer solutions in target tasks, this paper introduces a subspace projection strategy based on partial least squares, which achieves the correlation mapping between the source and target tasks during the dimensionality reduction of the search space. Additionally, to further enhance knowledge transfer across tasks, an alignment matrix is obtained by adjusting the subspace Bregman divergence after deriving the respective subspaces, minimizing variability between task domains. Finally, to balance the global exploration of algorithms with local exploitation, an adaptive population reuse mechanism based on the residual structure is designed. This mechanism reuses historically successful individuals to guide the evolutionary direction of the population, thus improving the algorithm’s convergence performance. Experimental results on various benchmark suites and real-world cases demonstrate that PA-MTEA exhibits significantly superior performance compared to six other advanced multitask optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The segmentation of different tissues within blastocysts is essential for embryologists to objectively observe and evaluate embryos, thereby contributing to a higher success rate of in vitro fertilization treatment. Inspired by the primary observation of skeletal patterns and boundary information by clinical doctors, we present an interesting task-aware view for blastocyst segmentation with semi-supervised learning, focusing on task-invariant and task-specific dependencies of segmentation. Firstly, we explore one strong-correlation task with bidirectional transformation between its outputs and the segmentation results, and another weak-correlation task with monodirectional transformation from segmentation maps. The correlation among different tasks inspires us to propose Task-Aware Smoothness (TAS) Assumption , thereby deducing different types of task-aware consistency. Then, a new Unified Task-aware Consistency Interaction (UniTask+) framework is developed to unify and fully take advantage of these strong, weak, and strong-to-weak task-aware consistency. It is comprised of a medical segmentation (MS) branch to implement segmentation and two extra branches performing strong/weak-correlation tasks based on the same backbone. Concretely, a level-set (LS) branch promotes the strong consistency while a point-set (PS) branch stimulates the weak consistency with underlying task perturbations. Numerous experiments have been conducted on the inner cell mass (ICM), blastocyst, proving the effectiveness of our tactics. Furthermore, we have also conducted experiments with datasets from the left atrium (LA), which shares similar structural features with embryos, to validate the robustness of the model. Our methods have shown prominent improvements over up-to-date SSL methods, which advocates our precedent hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {Deep hashing has been widely used in large-scale multimedia retrieval due to its advantages in terms of low storage cost and computational efficiency. Deep hashing algorithms can jointly learn semantic features and hash functions, encoding the original data into compact binary codes with significant discriminative power. However, in multi-label scenarios, especially when the number of samples is extremely large, a high negative-positive imbalance may occur, particularly when the proportion of negative samples is too high, which can lead to bias in the semantic relationships between the learned images. To solve this problem, symmetric losses such as focal loss were proposed, which treat positive and negative samples equally, but the retrieval results are suboptimal. This may be because the equal-weighted processing strategy causes the model to over-focus on hard negative samples and ignore the learning of positive sample features. Besides, mislabeled negative samples, especially those with a probability close to 1, can lead the model to learn incorrect features, harming its discrimination ability, reducing accuracy and recall, and causing overfitting and poor generalization. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel hashing model, Deep Asymmetric Semantic Hashing with Probability Shifting framework (DASH-PS), for discriminative binary code learning. Specifically, by combining asymmetric focusing strategy and probability shifting strategy, asymmetric semantic loss is designed to solve negative-positive imbalance and ground-truth mislabeling. To keep the contribution of positive samples while focusing on hard negative samples, asymmetric focusing strategy is proposed to decouple negative and positive samples and assign different attenuation factors. By offsetting the probability of negative samples, probability shifting strategy completely discards easy negative samples and very hard negative samples suspected of being mislabeled. Additionally, an adaptive asymmetric learning mechanism is proposed to reduce the fixed difference in average probabilities between positive and negative samples, thereby simplifying hyperparameter selection and improving retrieval efficiency. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets validate that our DASH-PS outperforms various state-of-the-art hashing methods. The code for the implementation of our DASH-PS framework is available at https://github.com/QinLab-WFU/DASH-PS.},

  abstract     = {Video data can be naturally represented as tensors. Despite great progress in anomaly detection with memory-augmented autoencoders, the memory module therein can only handle vectors and inevitably breaks tensor structures, thus leading to performance degradation. Moreover, after the mapping of the encoder, some abnormal features may directly fall into the normal convex polytope, as autoencoders only use the output error to guide the construction of latent variables without imposing any constraint. The memory module can not handle these abnormal features, so that the abnormal observations may not be identified. To solve these problems, we propose a Physics-Informed Tensor AutoEncoder (PITAE) framework, which incorporates both neural networks and physical laws, i.e., tensor operation rules. Specifically, we design a tensor decomposition network followed by an explicit tensor operation to decompose the latent variable into low-rank and sparse components, and only the low-rank component is inputted to the decoder. In this way, we reserve the tensor structure and meanwhile impose a low-rank constraint on the latent variable, thereby compressing the features of normal samples into a ”smaller” region where anomalies are less likely to fall into. Consequently, the non-low-rank anomalies can be identified. But the low-rank anomalies may still not be identified. To further solve this problem, we design a tensor Memory module, and the overall model is named as PITAEM. Finally, based on the proposed framework, we design a novel composite anomaly score to identify anomalies of various kinds. Experiments on various video datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially in the small data regime.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid proliferation of digital imaging technologies, the need for robust and lightweight image encryption techniques has become increasingly critical, particularly for medical, military, and personal data applications. In this paper, we propose a novel image encryption scheme based on a one-dimensional inverse cosine chaotic map (1D-ICC), which introduces a highly sensitive and structurally complex nonlinear dynamical system. The proposed method integrates a dynamic Josephus-based intra-block scrambling mechanism, a global zigzag permutation strategy, and an adaptive diffusion process guided by chaotic sequences, thereby enhancing the confusion and diffusion characteristics of the cipher. Unlike conventional approaches, our scheme dynamically derives the encryption key from the SHA-512 hash of the original image, ensuring both sensitivity to plaintext changes and resistance to known-plaintext and chosen-plaintext attacks. The use of the 1D-ICC map, featuring a tunable control parameter r 5 enables rich chaotic behavior even in one dimension, reducing computational complexity without sacrificing security. Comprehensive experiments validate the robustness and efficiency of the encryption scheme, with performance metrics including correlation coefficients below 0.003, information entropy of 7.9993, a Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR) of 99.61 %, and a Unified Averaged Changed Intensity (UACI) of 33.42 %. These results demonstrate that our method surpasses several existing techniques in both security strength and computational performance, underscoring the potential of the 1D-ICC map for practical image encryption applications.},

Furthermore, while supervised learning has proven to be superior in training sentence representations for downstream tasks like text classification, this aspect has received relatively little attention. In this study, a novel model named L abel Em bedding joint with We akly-supervised C lassification ( LemWec ) is proposed, which aims to establish a unified framework by combining supervised sentence embedding with multiclass classification. For supervised sentence embeddings, the model incorporates seed information such as label names and designs an encoder network with a new pooling layer. Additionally, the model adopts a pseudo-labeling approach to leverage a substantial amount of unlabeled samples. This approach specifically addresses the drawback of generating pseudo-labels with the highest confidence and introduces a noise adaptation method to mitigate this issue. The results of extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed LemWec model can significantly enhance the performance of text classification when compared to a comprehensive set of baselines.},

Although many deep cell clustering methods have been proposed to cluster the scRNA-seq data, they overlook the structural partitioning objectives during the representation learning process, leading to challenges with non-linearly separable structures. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end deep kernel cell clustering model for scRNA-seq data based on self-supervised ZINB-based kernel representation learning, named scDKC, which simultaneously learns cell kernel representations and identifies cell clusters. Specifically, a kernel-aid hybrid representation learning encoder is developed to effectively learn the separable kernel representation of cells, consisting of cells’ expression characteristics and cell-cell topological interactions. To guide the direction of kernel representation learning, a ZINB-based kernel representation learning decoder is designed by capturing the global probabilistic structure, the representation and the cell graph structure of the scRNA-seq data. By leveraging the clustering self-supervised strategy, representation self-supervised strategy, ZINB-based distribution self-supervised strategy, and kernel self-supervised strategy, scDKC optimizes cell cluster label assignment and learns cell kernel representations through a joint mutual self-supervised mechanism. Extensive experiments on 15 real scRNA-seq datasets, comparing scDKC with 10 competing methods, highlight its competitive advantages.},

  abstract     = {Facial Expression Recognition(FER) is a key task in the broader landscape of affective computing and human-computer interaction, enabling machines to interpret human emotions. To better learn discriminative features under complex facial variations, recent FER research has increasingly adopted multi-branch fusion architectures that aim to capture complementary features from diverse perspectives. However, existing multi-branch fusion strategies, including static weighting, simple concatenation, or uncertainty-aware modeling, lack the capacity to comprehensively capture and reconcile the reliability variations across both individual instances and structural branches. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multi-branch fusion strategy, named Dual Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Framework(DUAFF), which improves the discriminability of integrated features by simultaneously modeling instance-wise uncertainty and inter-branch correlations. Specifically, the proposed method comprises two complementary modules: Instance-Discrepant Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Module (ID-UAFM) and Branch-Discrepant Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Module (BD-UAFM). ID-UAFM is introduced to perform channel-wise entropy analysis between semantically distinct samples to estimate instance-level uncertainty, enabling selective channel-wise fusion that emphasizes reliable representations while suppressing uncertain responses. BD-UAFM is further proposed to capture structural uncertainty by evaluating the relative reliability of features across multiple branches and adaptively weighting their contributions based on inter-branch discrepancies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DUAFF consistently outperforms POSTER across three benchmark datasets, achieving accuracy improvements of 0.23 % on RAF-DB, 0.69 % on FER2013, and 0.29 % on AffectNet (7-class), thereby confirming its effectiveness in enhancing the reliability and discriminability of facial representations.},

Previous efforts have improved the transferability through advanced gradients, augmented models, or augmented data. In this paper, we understand and enhance the transferability from a new perspective. Delving into intermediate features, we empirically find a difference between the distances of adversarial and original samples from cluster centers of the original classes. The adversarial samples are simultaneously far from both the original samples and the cluster centers, close to generalized decision boundaries. Based on this observation, we propose a novel spectrum tuning attack. Boundary samples are utilized to guide the generation of adversarial samples that are far away from the cluster centers. Specifically, randomized boundary samples are generated by frequency-domain transformations. With the gradients of the diverse boundary samples, the adversarial perturbation moves the examples away from cluster centers, thus approaching generalized decision boundaries. In the optimization process, conjugate directions are employed to avoid oscillations and stabilize the update direction. Given the strong Wolfe parameters, the analysis of the descent direction and current gradient further ensures the convergence speed and stability of the optimization. In addition, Gaussian preprocessing is introduced to smooth the update direction, further stabilize the direction and enhance the transferability. The proposed method is flexible enough to be combined with existing methods to further improve the transferability. Experiments conducted on the ImageNet-compatible dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, e.g., 92.6 % success rate against nine defense methods.},

This “single-verdict” approach is inherently susceptible to misjudgments arising from noisy or biased representations. To address this limitation, we introduce Multi-AD, a novel Multi-evidence-based graph Anomaly Detection framework that leverages the power of Language Models (LMs) to enable more robust and reliable anomaly detection. We provide a paradigm shift by constructing multiple evidence sequences for each target node, and employing LMs to assess the coherence of these sequences. By aggregating coherence scores across multiple sequences, Multi-AD leverages converging evidence to make more informed decisions about anomaly status as the presence of anomalous nodes disrupts coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a coherence-aware edge representation method to enhance the discriminative power of the constructed sequences and a multi-round adaptive integration strategy to handle challenging scenarios where normal nodes might be surrounded by anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Multi-AD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

Sparse subspace learning, as a machine learning technique, can extract critical information from multimodal data while addressing issues such as noise, high-dimensional complexity, and class imbalance. Our study utilizes longitudinal, multimodal neuroimaging data collected at multiple time points to develop a diagnostic model for PD. The approach involves extracting latent local features and leveraging deep learning techniques to generate a comprehensive global feature subset. Adaptive sparse selection is employed to reduce feature redundancy. Finally, support vector machine is used for classification and regression tasks, specifically for PD diagnosis and disease progression score prediction. Extensive experiments were conducted on the PPMI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 90.78 % for Scan Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficit (SWEDD) vs. Normal Control (NC) classification, 83.79 % for PD vs. NC, and 91.50 % for PD vs. SWEDD.

Clustering the images according to their relevance profiles reveals groups with significantly higher predictive performance compared to the full dataset. The corresponding relevance patterns highlight favorable price movement structures and are identified via the associated clusters.},

  abstract     = {Object identification is one of the computer vision-based methods used in locating and labelling objects in images. Object detection has been greatly advanced as it is now applicable for detecting night vision images with great accuracy. Most accurate object detection at night can be useful in many applications like nighttime driving, regulating harsh traffic in harsh weather conditions, and surveillance. Object detection in normal conditions can be smoother, but low illumination and harsh weather can lead to low versatility. Images captured at night can reflect a lot of noise with low visual features. Due to its challenging nature, a highly effective object detection model is a challenge for high-level applications. Traditional models still face issues and challenges related to uneven light conditions, brightness variations, different light sources, and noisy backgrounds that need to be addressed. Thus, it is necessary to develop an object detection model for dealing with images with low illumination and varying light conditions. Hence, in this work, an effective object detection framework is implemented for night vision images. At first, from the standard datasets, the significant night vision images are fetched and fed into the proposed model as a Residual 3D Transformer-based YoloV8 with an Adaptive Gated Recurrent Unit (R3DT-YAGRU) for detecting the objects. This includes combining spatial–temporal modelling capabilities into YOLOv8, particularly using 3D transformers for improved feature extraction and an adaptive GRU to manage temporal dependencies at night. Here, the Modified Random Variable-based Dollmaker Optimization Algorithm (MRV-DOA), which is a metaheuristic algorithm motivated by the doll-making procedure. Also, it helps in balancing the exploration phase and exploitation phase to discover the best solutions and is used for tuning the parameters of the R3DT-YAGRU model. At last, the experimental validation is carried out for the recommended object detection process by comparing with other models to establish the supremacy of the suggested work. From the study, the suggested framework achieves an accuracy of 96%, leading to enhanced decision making and better accuracy than other conventional models. The work has prepared its implementation accessible at https://github.com/charlesvprabhu56/Object-Detection .},

  abstract     = {Compared to traditional Computed Tomography (CT) scans and floatation catheters, chest X-ray offers an efficient, safe and timely examination paradigm, with broader range of scenarios (including intensive care units), for the detection of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). However, it is difficult to learn the variable radiological features of PAH from X-rays due to its low resolution and low contrast. To address the above issues, we propose a diversified features learning framework to fully explore the PAH-related representation from chest X-ray. We first employ a Chest Feature Enhancement Attention (CFEA) module to enhance the initial feature representation. Then, we employ the Deep Temporal Anti-Interference Metric Learning (TAIML) module to fully explore the PAH-related features. We incorporate the information on the temporal evolution of patients’ conditions. Specifically, a patient x , after undergoing treatment, may exhibit two possible states: x + (ill) and x − (cured). Therefore, we can define the distance d ( x , x + ) as the intra-class structural distance, and the distance d ( x , x − ) as the inter-class safe distance. Unlike existing metric learning, we adopt a new strategy: we push positive samples towards negative samples, but ensure distance between them is no less than d ( x , x − ) , thereby enhancing intra-class diversity while maintaining discriminability. Meanwhile, we ensure that the distance between positive samples is greater than d ( x , x + ) , thereby preserving the intra-class structure. Through these two steps, we can learn a diversified but discriminative representation of PAH. Comprehensive experiments showed the our model achieved an impressive accuracy of 86.27 % and an AUC of 0.857 in identifying PAH patients. The code is available at https://github.com/zgfdmn/PAH .},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the emergency triage has faced several challenges, including insufficient manual triage with physicians, limited medical resources contributing to incorrect triage, overcrowding in the emergency department (ED), and extended patient waiting time. Hence, the Medical Emergency prediction remains the major research area that identifies emergencies about specific diseases using the Medical Transcriptions (MT) provided by physicians. However, the existing methods face the challenges of handling the ambiguity of words, unstructured data, and increased computation complexity. Consequently, this research proposes the Tri-Head Attention-based Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers enabled Distributed Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (TriHAtt-BERT-DBiLSTM) for predicting medical emergencies. Specifically, the proposed approach integrates the Tri-Head Attention mechanisms into BERT, which is further hybridized with the DBiLSTM model that offers the synergic strength of providing the dense feature representations to capture the complex dependencies, and enhancement of model ability with the structured parameters to facilitate the medical emergency prediction. Besides, the utilization of BERT in the proposed approach assists in capturing more complex language representations and further executes a better embedding representation of words. The TriHAtt-BERT-DBiLSTM model surpasses other state-of-the-art techniques and achieves 96.40% of accuracy, 96.12% of F1-score, 96.09% of precision, and 96.15% of recall for medical emergency prediction.},

  abstract     = {The contact ring seals (CRSs) used in electroplating processes during semiconductor manufacturing are susceptible to degradation through chemical etching, electrochemical dissolution, and mechanical wear mechanisms. Despite the implementation of state-of-the-art surface treatment and coating technologies to mitigate CRS corrosion, manual intervention remains frequently required to address this problem. Conventional static defect detection systems for CRSs rely on predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and threshold-based defect area calculations, with surface anomalies identified by comparing the percentage of defective areas within these ROIs. However, this approach exhibits detection failures for millimeter-scale defects, low-contrast anomalies, and geometrically irregular patterns, especially under complex or dynamic environmental conditions. To address these systematic detection failures, we developed a dynamic defect detection system for CRSs by integrating artificial intelligence and traditional computer vision algorithms, achieving a 5.2x improvement in defect detection sensitivity. This system achieved detection accuracy and recall values of over 99 % as well as a response time of 1.43 s average latency, thereby demonstrating a substantial performance improvement compared to a static system, which achieved a recall rate of 18.9 % on the adopted dataset. The system satisfies real-time processing requirements while substantially reducing the need for manual intervention in defect detection and increases production efficiency. Finally, the experimental results of this study indicated that the postprocessing approaches used in the developed system enabled it to flexibly adapt to the different requirements of various production environments.},

  abstract     = {The classification of land remote sensing using single-modal data has reached a bottleneck, which has spurred significant interest in the joint utilization of multimodal remote sensing data to enhance classification performance. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in extracting intricate local and global features. Furthermore, achieving effective information interaction and deep fusion between multimodal datasets remains an unresolved challenge. To address these issues, we propose a Complementary Information-Guided Interactive Fusion Network (CIGIF-Net) for the classification of hyperspectral image (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. The core idea of our approach leverages the capability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract local spatial features while utilizing the strengths of Transformers in modeling long-range dependencies. Furthermore, our method facilitates deep fusion by designing mechanisms for the interactive integration of multimodal local spatial features, complemented by guidance from multimodal data during long-range dependency modeling, thereby improving overall classification performance. Specifically, CIGIF-Net incorporates multiscale feature learning, interactive feature fusion, and the complementary information-guided attention mechanism. Initially, CNNs are used to learn multiscale local spatial features. Subsequently, we perform an interactive fusion of multimodal spatial information based on channel attention techniques. Finally, the complementary information-guided attention mechanism dynamically utilizes complementary insights to inform deeper attention distributions, which guide global feature construction and enable efficient information aggregation. This methodology allows for the comprehensive extraction and synergistic utilization of complementary information across multimodal datasets. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely recognized HSI and LiDAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed CIGIF-Net achieves superior classification performance.},

Domain adaptation (DA)-based intrusion detection is a promising approach that transfers knowledge from a source domain to improve detection in a target IoT domain. However, effective DA methods must address various types of domain heterogeneity - such as differences in feature representation, intrusion distribution, and attack strategies. Existing intrusion detection datasets rarely consider these aspects, limiting their utility for evaluating heterogeneous DA approaches. To bridge this gap, we introduce TriHID , a new dataset specifically designed to capture heterogeneities from three perspectives. We evaluate four types of DA-based IoT intrusion detectors - multi-source, semi-supervised, unsupervised, and open-set on TriHID. Experimental results demonstrate that TriHID enables robust training and comprehensive evaluation of DA-based intrusion detection methods in heterogeneous IoT settings.},

Therefore, to tackle the multi-objective dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem (MODFJSP) involving new job insertions, this paper introduces an online scheduling framework called multi-head deep Q network (MHDQN), designed to simultaneously minimize both total tardiness and total machine idle time. The core architecture of MHDQN framework is an innovative multi-head network agent based on Dueling deep Q network (Deuling DQN), consisting of a shared network layer and objective-specific network layers. The shared network layer extracts and transforms the input global state features layer by layer, generating a high-dimensional, semantically rich shared feature. This provides a unified input foundation for the objective-specific network layers, which are responsible for extracting the specialized information related to each objective from the shared features and calculating the corresponding Q -values, thereby enabling the parallel optimization of each objective. Six combined scheduling rules are developed to form the action set, each incorporating both job and machine selection. An improved multi-objective action selection strategy is proposed, incorporating inverse sigmoid ϵ decay and Q -value maximum absolute (max-abs) normalization to optimize decision-making. Additionally, a multi-head network training mechanism leveraging the Double deep Q network (Double DQN) architecture has been developed. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that the MHDQN outperforms widely used traditional scheduling rules, multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms, and other reinforcement learning (RL) based scheduling methods, showing significant advantages and strong generalizability in multi-objective optimization tasks.},

  abstract     = {Managing platelet supply chains poses significant challenges due to the product’s short shelf life, highly uncertain demand, and the critical nature of its medical use. Previous studies in the blood supply chain rely on fixed-order quantities and ignore collaborative inventory-sharing strategies, which can lead to either excessive waste or severe shortages. However, in many real-world situations, fixed order quantities are often insufficient to accommodate fluctuating demand, especially in healthcare systems. Moreover, existing distribution models in the literature often overlook the equitable allocation of services across hospitals, leading to disparities in access to critical healthcare resources. This study proposes a novel two-phase decision-making framework that integrates a fuzzy periodic review inventory model with a cluster-based reactive transshipment strategy to optimize platelet supply and distribution. In Phase I, a fuzzy periodic review model determines optimal order quantities under uncertain demand using a possibilistic chance-constrained programming approach. In Phase II, hospitals are clustered based on service levels, enabling equitable transshipment among facilities to reduce disparities and improve overall responsiveness. A real-world case study from Tehran province is used to evaluate the model’s effectiveness. Results show an approximate 6% reduction in total shortages and a 2% improvement in average service levels. The proposed framework offers actionable insights for healthcare managers aiming to enhance resilience, equity, and efficiency in critical medical supply chains.},

EAs produce abundant data during evolution, which contains valuable information that reflects their evolutionary patterns. Effectively utilizing this information can enhance the algorithms’ effectiveness and efficiency. Deep learning excels at extracting knowledge from data. Inspired by this, we propose a novel insights-infused framework that utilizes deep neural networks to learn the evolutionary processes of EAs and extract useful synthesis insights from the evolutionary data. These synthesis insights not only guide the algorithm to evolve in a better direction on the original problems, but also improve its performance on new problems. The choice of neural networks is important. During pre-training, to reduce the inductive bias introduced by human prior knowledge, we design an MLP model to process the data. Additionally, we develop a variable-length encoding method to enable MLP networks to handle variable-length data. To verify the transfer evolution ability of synthesis insights, we devise a self-evolution strategy that fine-tunes the network using only the data generated by the algorithm itself, without introducing any external knowledge, when dealing with new problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesis insights extracted from the CEC2014 dataset guide the algorithms to evolve in a better direction for the CEC2014 problems, and in addition enhance their performance on new problems like CEC2017, CEC2022 and the real-world optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Radiology report generation focuses on producing comprehensive and clinically precise medical reports based on radiographic images, thereby improving medical efficiency and alleviating the burden on radiologists. Although existing deep learning methods have demonstrated superior performance, they are constrained by the local receptive field of convolutional neural networks and are inadequate for modeling long-range dependencies, making it challenging to detect critical lesion features in medical images. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown great potential in modeling long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity. Inspired by this, we propose MambaGen, the enhanced Mamba model specifically designed for radiology report generation tasks. Specifically, we design a Mamba-Visual Recalibration Module (MVRM), which utilizes a two-stage training strategy to effectively capture the efficient visual representation of medical images. This first stage combines convolutional layers with SSMs to model long-sequence dependencies and learn multi-level visual feature information. This second stage introduces local convolution and a channel attention mechanism to further recalibrate the local feature and mitigate channel redundancy. Comprehensive experiments on widely available datasets, such as IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR, demonstrate our model’s superior performance compared to existing methods, particularly with an improvement of 2.7 % on the BLEU-4 metric.

  abstract     = {Controlling nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emissions from diesel vehicles is a critical environmental challenge. Advanced SCR strategies depend on accurate multistep forecasting of NO x and ammonia (NH 3 ), but existing models often struggle with error accumulation and the non-stationary dynamics of emissions data. In this work, we first establish a new benchmark for this task, confirming that handling data non-stationarity is essential for robust prediction. Building on this insight, we propose FiTformer, a novel Transformer architecture that adopts an encoder-only framework to jointly forecast both NO x and NH 3 concentrations, where we introduce Intra-series Temporal-Frequency Fusion mechanism to capture intrinsic emissions dynamics and Inter-series Covariate Interaction mechanism to model external influences. Validated on real-world engine data, FiTformer consistently outperforms baseline models across all evaluated prediction horizons, with up to 44.1 % MAE and 36.9 % SMAPE reductions in 24-step NO x prediction and similarly strong gains for NH 3 prediction, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline TimesNet. Its high computational efficiency (0.30G MACs and 8.3 ms/iter) along with robust generalization and high resilience to data imperfections, underscores its suitability for real-time embedded SCR control, enabling more effective strategies for NO x reduction and NH 3 slip minimization.},

  abstract     = {Self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SeLECTS) is the most common form of focal epilepsy in childhood, accounting for 20–25 % of all childhood epilepsy cases and may be associated with cognitive dysfunction and behavioral issues. Accurate detection and assessment of epileptic discharges in EEG signals, particularly the spike-wave index (SWI), are crucial for timely intervention and treatment. Manual analysis of EEG data is labor-intensive and prone to errors, underscoring the need for automated methods. In the present study, we propose a novel D ual-Str e am Sp a tial- S pectral- T emporal L arge model (DeaSTL) that leverages a large-scale EEG architecture to effectively capture the multidimensional characteristics of EEG signals associated with SeLECTS syndrome. Our model integrates multi-view temporal representations and spatial-spectral representations through a dual-stream approach, enhancing the learning of complex patterns in EEG data. We introduce the S JTU Se L ECTS E EG D ataset (SLED), a comprehensive EEG dataset from 212 patients diagnosed with SeLECTS, including annotations for abnormal discharge detection, wake-sleep period classification, and SWI estimation. Addressing the previously unexplored problem of SWI prediction, we provide a novel method for quantifying the severity of epileptic discharges during sleep. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DeaSTL model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across multiple tasks, showcasing its potential for clinical application in assisting diagnosis and treatment planning.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks have delivered impressive results in medical image classification tasks. However, their performance is still challenging in medical scenarios with limited data, where training set biases such as label noise or class imbalance impede model learning. Dynamic learning based sample weighting achieves adaptive adjustment of sample importance through learnable weight functions and shows great potential in improving model robustness. Nevertheless, existing methods directly employ model states such as loss value or training accuracy to evaluate sample importance, ignoring the role of ambiguous samples in model optimization. This limitation hinders the performance of dynamic learning based sample weighting in medical image classification. In this paper, we propose a new sample weighting approach based on sample ambiguity and dynamic learning for improving medical image classification, named DLSA-SW. We introduce a dual-space sample ambiguity method by evaluating the category proximity in the feature space and the prediction confidence in the label space. Subsequently, to dynamically calculate sample weights according to sample ambiguity, a learnable sample weighting network is developed to adaptively adjust the weights during training to guide the task model. DLSA-SW performs alternate optimization to enable mutual adaptation of the sample weighting network and the task network. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on three medical image classification benchmarks: PatchCamelyon for lymph node histopathology classification, ISIC 2020 for skin lesion classification, and MTC for medullary thyroid cancer classification. DLSA-SW outperforms existing state-of-the-art sample weighting methods on all three datasets and yields substantial improvements over methods without sample weighting. These results demonstrate the robustness and practical applicability of our approach in clinical diagnostic tasks.},

  abstract     = {Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact manner of measuring heart rate variability (HRV) by deriving blood volume pulse (BVP) signals from facial videos. The performance of rPPG-based HRV measurement is challenging due to short-range noises (e.g., head movements) suppression and sufficient-duration BVP signal generation. Recent Transformer-based rPPG methods have shown advantages of global spatio-temporal feature modeling in eliminating noise and recovering high-quality BVP signals. However, these methods often face significant computational and memory constraints, limiting duration scalability of the generated BVP signals that might decrease HRV measurement performance. To address the above issue, this paper proposes a duration-scalable Transformer-based rPPG method, capable of global Long-range Spatio-Temporal modelling (LST), termed LST-rPPG, to generate high-quality BVP signals with a much longer duration. On the one hand, by employing spatial and temporal encoders, the original image-based rPPG issue is converted to a time-series problem. Besides, a sparse computation mechanism is integrated into the temporal encoder. This combination allows LST-rPPG to recover flexible-duration BVP signals, supporting continuous modeling of segments beyond 30 s with low computation and memory overhead. On the other hand, a dynamic loss function with stringent temporal constraints is designed to guarantee the quality of the generated BVP signals. Comprehensive experiments are performed on two public datasets, PURE and UBFC-RPPG, and the results demonstrate the feasibility of LST-rPPG for generating high-quality BVP signals with a much longer duration while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. Besides, LST-rPPG achieves at least the second-best results during all experiments.},

Benchmarks such as MTEB have shown that text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) capture rich semantic information, but their ability to reflect code-level functional semantics remains unclear. Existing studies largely focus on code clone detection, which emphasizes syntactic similarity and overlooks functional understanding. In this paper, we focus on the functional consistency of LLM code embeddings, which determines if two code snippets perform the same function regardless of syntactic differences. We propose a novel data synthesis framework called Functionality-Oriented Code Self-Evolution to construct diverse and challenging benchmarks. Specifically, we define code examples across four semantic and syntactic categories and find that existing datasets predominantly capture syntactic properties. Our framework generates four unique variations from a single code instance, providing a broader spectrum of code examples that better reflect functional differences. Extensive experiments on three downstream tasks-code clone detection, code functional consistency identification, and code retrieval-demonstrate that embedding models significantly improve their performance when trained on our evolved datasets. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalization of our data synthesis framework, advancing the functional understanding of code.},

To address these issues, a semisupervised graph U-Net with graph convolutional long short-term memory is proposed for HSI classification, abbreviated as SSGU-Net. Specifically, we design a novel graph convolutional long short-term memory feature extractor to learn discriminative spatial-spectral joint features by simultaneously modeling the correlations in the spatial and spectral domains. Then, we develop a semisupervised graph U-Net with mutually inverse operation of the graph pooling and the graph unpooling modules which uses both labeled samples and unlabeled samples to train a well-parameterized network for HSI classification. In particular, to suppress the effects of noise and outliers, the graph pooling module is designed to selectively retain discriminative samples and fully learn the optimal correlation between these retained samples. Meanwhile, the graph unpooling module employs the local spatial context to reconstruct the reduced samples, thus restoring the pooled data to its original scale for classification task. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving overall accuracy gains of 5.22 %, 1.58 %, and 1.57 % over the state-of-the-art competitors on the Indian Pines, University of Pavia, and Houston datasets, respectively.},

However, current end-to-end multilingual approaches often face semantic disparity issues across languages. When given parallel queries with the same semantics but in different languages, the generated responses may vary in meaning across languages, which may greatly affect the stability and reliability of multilingual systems in different language scenarios. We attribute this issue to open-domain/model uncertainty and language differences. To mitigate this issue, we first propose a novel Anchor-based Semantic Constraint (ASC) designed to reduce semantic disparity across languages for Encoder-Decoder Transformers. ASC employs language-independent anchor signal to guide the behaviors in both the encoder and decoder, thereby reducing uncertainty. Additionally, ASC incorporates a two-stage tuning process to further minimize the impact of language differences by ensuring the encoder remains language-independent. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses conducted on XDailyDialog demonstrate that ASC can effectively mitigate semantic disparity across languages and will not compromise dialogue response quality like the previous related baselines.},

First, collecting real-world data is challenging due to the diversity of CPU products and the specialized nature of hardware characteristics. This field lacks a standard dataset with unified hardware characteristics, wide data coverage, and comprehensive benchmarks. Second, existing methods based on hardware simulation models or machine learning exhibit notable shortcomings, such as lengthy simulation test cycles and low prediction accuracy. To bridge these gaps, we first collect, preprocess, and standardize historical data from the 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors across multiple benchmark suites to create a new dataset, named PerfCastDB. Subsequently, we design a deep learning based model called Nova CPU Performance Predictor (NCPP) as the baseline for this new dataset. The NCPP network is designed based on group attention mechanism. It effectively quantifies the implicit relationships between hardware characteristics within and across groups and comprehensively models the impact of various hardware characteristics on CPU performance prediction. We conduct comparative experiments using the proposed PerfCastDB dataset. Compared to existing approaches, NCPP achieves superior evaluation results, demonstrating its effectiveness.

  abstract     = {Overweight and oversized transport (O&OT) has become one of the most critical elements of project logistics, driven by advancements in transportation and lifting technologies that now allow high-volume loads to be moved across long distances. This type of transportation operation, also called abnormal transportation, is greatly affected by technical factors such as the weight and geometry of the load, road surface, axle load limitations, slope, and ground strength, as well as external variables such as weather conditions, traffic density, and legal regulations. In planning and operational processes, Decision-Makers (DMs) and practitioners who plan and execute operations without adequately considering these factors and variables can lead to delays in operations, serious risks, and loss of productivity. This research proposes a flexible decision support model that integrates Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Logarithmic Percentage Change-driven Objective Weighting (LOPCOW), and a ranking technique; i.e., Mixed Aggregation by Comprehensive Normalization Technique (MACONT) techniques to address the decision problems related to route selection, one of the most critical problems in transporting heavy and bulky loads, and to produce reasonable solutions. The proposed model significantly reduces information losses by processing subjective and objective information and integrating subjective (SWARA) and objective (LOPCOW) methods. Unlike traditional ranking approaches, the MACONT method combines three different normalization techniques to determine the ranking performance of alternatives. In this way, it provides more reliable and accurate results by reducing the deviations of the results provided by the single normalization technique. In addition, it shows each alternative’s good and bad performance compared to the others and is more convincing about the results obtained. According to the results obtained by applying the proposed model, fuel consumption (0.096) is determined as the most effective and critical factor in selecting the route on which heavy and bulky loads will be transported. In this context, choosing routes that allow lower fuel consumption can contribute to reducing carbon emissions and external costs arising from transportation. The extensive robustness and validation check to test the proposed model prove that the proposed model is a reliable, robust, and practical decision-making tool for making reasonable and rational decisions in O&OT.},

Numerical examples validate the effectiveness of BDOS in permutation event fusion, with comparative results demonstrating its advantages in order retention and belief distribution.

  abstract     = {Background and Objective With the rapid growth in the number of medical images, the need for content- based medical image retrieval (CBMIR) in clinical aid diagnosis is becoming increasingly important. Most current content-based CT image similarity retrieval methods use the entire CT image, ignoring the fact that the localized lesion region is the main target of similarity retrieval; Methods To address this issue, the paper proposes a fine-grained similarity retrieval method for lung CT images based on image block( IB ) similarity matching, taking lung CT images as an example. In this method, two enabling techniques are introduced: 1) a hybrid Convolution and Vision Transformer Model(CVTM) that effectively captures both local texture and global context features of lesion regions; 2) the iDS high-dimensional index designed to accelerate retrieval among IB ; Results With the aid of these techniques, fine-grained similarity retrieval optimization of lung CT images can be achieved, which facilitates more accurate lesion-level comparison and supports clinical decision-making; Conclusions Extensive experiments are conducted to indicate that the proposed fine-grained similarity retrieval method achieves excellent performance, with a mAP of 91.33%. Meanwhile, the retrieval efficiency of the iDS high-dimensional index is about 150% higher than that of sequential retrieval, especially when the retrieval radius is large and the database size is substantial.},

Although recent advancements have demonstrated prediction accuracy using graph convolutional networks, their depends heavily on the accuracy of the graph structures that represent the spatial relationships within the traffic network. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach to traffic prediction, the Active Causal Recurrent Graph Convolution Network (ACRGCN), as shown in Fig. 2. ACRGCN offers a new framework that effectively integrates a causal-embedded approach for traffic prediction, leveraging both structural and feature information from correlated traffic time series. Additionally, it incorporates a time-varying dynamic Bayesian network to capture the intricate spatiotemporal topology of traffic data. The model extracts spatiotemporal dependencies from traffic signals using the Active Causality Graph Recurrent Module (ACGRM), while efficiently modeling nonlinear traffic propagation patterns. Furthermore, ACRGCN employs a deep learning-based module that functions as a hyper-network, progressively generating dynamic causal graphs. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple real-world traffic graph datasets validate ACRGCN, and the results demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art method},

To protect data privacy, federated learning (FL), as a novel intelligent edge computing framework with localized training mechanisms, has been integrated into edge computing to form a system called CEC-FL and is widely studied. However, they are susceptible to potential poisoning attacks. Existing poisoning attack methods are mostly explored by performing malicious operations on training samples or labels directly and implementing corresponding defense strategies: they are designed to ignore the label transferability and diverse attack environments and are not work against stealthy security threats, mainly because they do not take into account the inherent vulnerabilities of the attack environment. Yet few general defense schemes have been developed. In response to the above vulnerabilities, in this work, we explore a B arycenter Po isoning method with L abel T ransferability (BPoLT) initiated by malicious attackers, resulting in a dynamic attack capability on the CEC-FL system. To address poisoning attacks, we provide a two-phase defense algorithm Res isting L abel T ransferability Pois oning called ResLT-Pois to distinguish malicious attackers from benign participants.

  abstract     = {Accurate PM2.5 prediction is crucial for effective environmental management and public health protection, yet current models show limited dynamic adaptability to complicated air pollution scenarios. Robust models are essential to support timely interventions in response to sudden pollution events or rapidly changing air quality patterns. However, existing models predominantly rely on predefined graph structures and pairwise spatial relationships, limiting their ability to capture the complex and dynamic interactions inherent in PM2.5 pollution. Furthermore, such models often assume equal contributions from neighboring nodes, neglecting heterogeneity and compromising predictive accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Hypergraph-based Convolution Network with a Dual Spatiotemporal Attention mechanism (AHCN-DA) for PM2.5 forecasting. This framework leverages representation learning and hypergraph structures to capture and integrate pairwise as well as higher-order spatial interactions, producing richer spatial-feature representations. The dual spatiotemporal attention mechanism dynamically assigns time-varying weights to neighboring nodes based on their relevance to target nodes, effectively mitigating the impact of irrelevant inputs. Additionally, AHCN-DA integrates a dilated convolution network with multi-scale kernels to capture temporal patterns effectively across varying scales. Extensive experiments on the 2023 China National Air Quality Dataset show significant improvements in predictive accuracy, particularly in enhancing the proportion of high-precision monitoring stations, with an R 2 of 0.9224, outperforming baseline models. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of AHCN-DA in enhancing prediction accuracy under complex pollution response patterns, contributing to more informed decision-making in environmental management.},

Fictitious team-play extend self-play algorithms to these scenarios, offering a novel approach to obtain equilibrium. However, it depends on normal-form team plans, which expand exponentially with game size, significantly constraining their applicability in large games. To overcome the challenge of computing equilibrium in large scale imperfect information team games, we propose a team self-play algorithm that utilizes refined team plans. Specifically, we pre-solve the equilibrium in a perfect recall environment to extract essential team plans from the original strategy space. To adapt these plans to an imperfect recall environment, we construct an auxiliary game with transformed ex ante coordinated information based on the original game and then solve equilibrium in auxiliary game to derive equilibrium for the original game. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our team self-play algorithm in eight different Kuhn poker scenarios. Compared to existing team self-play algorithms, our method efficiently handles large games and exhibits superior convergence compared to reinforcement learning based algorithms. Additionally, our experiments offer valuable insights and guidance on adapting equilibrium strategies from perfect recall environments to those with imperfect recall.},

Moreover, the traditional models struggle to adapt to the evolving patient data, capture long-term dependencies, and often suffer from lower accuracy.

Moreover, the Proactive Hybridized BiLSTM model adapts to dynamic changes in the data to learn and predict glaucoma-related features, ultimately improving detection performance over time. The proposed Proactive hybridized BiLSTM model attains higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 96.65%, 96.51%, and 96.79% using the OCT and FUNDUS image dataset.},

  abstract     = {Current deep learning methods for community detection in attributed networks face a critical limitation: they often fail to identify communities that are both structurally cohesive and semantically similar, thereby falling short of the balance typically observed in human-labeled partitions. This shortcoming stems from the absence of explicit mechanisms to jointly optimize these two objectives. In this paper, this challenge is addressed by proposing Deep Balanced Community Detection (DBCD), a novel unsupervised framework for community detection that balances topology and semantics. DBCD first constructs a powerful topology-semantic clustering consensus by integrating insights from both structural and attribute spaces. This consensus then steers a Graph Neural Network to simultaneously maximize global neural modularity and local cross-view consistency, while adaptively determining the number of communities. Extensive experiments reveal a striking result: DBCD consistently discovers communities that surpass the topology-semantic balance of the ground truth across multiple real-world networks. An empirical Pareto frontier analysis further validates that DBCD achieves a non-dominated solution, establishing it as a strong competitor among state-of-the-art methods.

Different from other networks, the traffic data of the power dispatch network is mainly composed of the port traffic from routers and switches. However, network accidents in power enterprises can cause long periods of missing network traffic data, reducing the number of learning samples for network traffic prediction models and making the forecasting results unreliable. Due to the long periods of missing data, this paper uses transfer learning (TL) to impute missing data with the knowledge from a relevant task, which has ample samples. However, the imputation result contains complex source and target data characteristics. Therefore, this paper introduces the idea of frequency decomposition to decompose the imputation results into different sub-sequences through variational mode decomposition (VMD). Additionally, this paper uses long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract the potential features of decomposition results. Finally, this paper combines TL, VMD, and LSTM to design the TL-VMD-LSTM algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated using inflow and outflow traffic data from two State Grid Corp. of China networks.

To address these challenges, multi-objective optimization algorithms have emerged as a promising strategy for feature selection due to their ability to optimize multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously. We propose a niche-based binary differential evolution algorithm (MONBDE) for high-dimensional multi-objective feature selection. MONBDE enhances feature selection performance through several mechanisms: a niche-based binary differential evolution operator, redundant solution repair mechanism and an environmental selection strategy. In experiments, the proposed algorithm was compared with five advanced multi-objective optimization algorithms and tested on 15 benchmark datasets using three common metrics. Experimental results show that the MONBDE algorithm outperforms comparative algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and feature subset size across most datasets. The proposed strategy effectively eliminates redundant and irrelevant solutions in feature selection, leading to a significant improvement in model classification performance.},

However, due to the soft boundaries of CTV, complex connections with surrounding tissues, and high interpatient variability, existing deep learning methods still face significant challenges, particularly for image slices that lack clear boundary information or where applicators are distant from CTV edges. Hence, we introduce DFCNet, a dual-path fusion network with cross-slice consistency constraints for CTV segmentation. The first path employs a dual-stream intra-slice feature encoding module to capture local and inter-regional details, thereby refining boundary delineation amidst the complex interplay with adjacent tissues. The second path integrates a cross-slice consistency constraint module to address soft boundaries and high interpatient variability, while ensuring the coherence and smoothness of the segmentation results. A feature fusion and decoding module combines semantic features from both paths, improving CTV region accuracy. Tests on 432 cervical cancer brachytherapy cases show DFCNet outperforms eighteen state-of-the-art segmentation methods, with Dice score improvements over two percentage points. The second path and feature fusion module can enhance other U-Net-based models, boosting their CTV segmentation performance. DFCNet excels in high-precision CTV segmentation, particularly for challenging slices, demonstrating its potential to improve cervical cancer radiotherapy accuracy, efficiency, and patient outcomes.},

However, consumers and merchants on platforms exhibit diverse attribution behaviors, including single-homing and multi-homing (access to only one platform/multiple platforms), not only affecting the platform’s market scale but also complicating their data provision strategies and data pricing strategies. Inspired by this practice, this paper considers varying attribution behaviors and studies the data operation strategies of competitive platforms. By constructing a two-period game model, we capture the entire process of platform’s data collection and provision, and solve the equilibrium decisions by reverse solution method. This research aims to identify the impact of attribution behaviors on platforms’ data strategies, thereby filling the gap in analyzing this issue from the perspective of two-sided platforms. Results show that when both groups of users (consumers and merchants) are multi-homing, platform facing higher operational costs may benefit more from implementing low data provision but high data pricing strategy, while more cost-efficient platform may choose the opposite strategy. This strategy is still applicable when only one group of users (consumers) becomes single-homing. However, once both groups of users are single-homing, both platforms’ strategies will change. Specifically, when merchant’s cross-side network effect (CNE) intensity is relatively low (high), compared with less cost-efficient platform, platform enjoying cost efficiencies should provide more (less) data at a relatively high (low) price. Moreover, platforms should cautiously provide data when both groups of users are single-homing, as it may hurt profits.},

  abstract     = {Although the multi-trip vehicle routing problem with time windows (MTVRPTW) and its variants have been extensively studied, their application in natural disaster contexts remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by developing a model and solution algorithm for the MTVRPTW with limited trip duration (MTVRPTW-LD), tailored to emergency supplies distribution in the early post-disaster phase. First, we replace the service-dependent loading time in traditional models with service-dependent unloading time and formulate an MTVRPTW-LD model to minimize total operational time, encompassing travel, service, and unloading times, based on the characteristics of emergency supplies distribution. Furthermore, a more practical method for calculating travel time is proposed to enhance the model’s applicability. Subsequently, a branch-and-price algorithm is designed to solve the MTVRPTW-LD model, in which the cumulative relative deprivation cost (CRDC) is introduced to improve equity in emergency supplies distribution. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on Solomon instances and test instances generated based on emergency scenarios. The results show that, in the test instances, incorporating CRDC can improve the equity by up to 34.3 %.},

  abstract     = {The Pareto set (PS) of a continuous multi-objective optimization problem exhibit a distribution along a low-dimensional manifold structure. This regularity property significantly contributes to generating high-quality offspring in large-scale multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (LSMOEAs). However, conventional regularity model-based algorithms face several challenges when dealing with large-scale multi-objective optimization problems (LSMOPs), including high computational costs for modeling, difficulty in capturing the true PS structure, and neglecting individual directional information. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-information offspring reproduction strategy that considers both the distribution information of the population and the directional information of the outstanding individuals. Specifically, this strategy comprises a sampling approach based on an augmented regularity model specifically designed for LSMOPs. Leveraging this model, we explore and exploit the decision space to sample a promising set of solutions. Additionally, the strategy also involves a search method based on competitive learning among individuals. By assigning a positive evolutionary direction to losing solutions, we update the losing solutions to generate high-quality offspring. We continuously refine the proposed regularity model to approximate the true PS more closely. In extensive experiments on large-scale multi-objective benchmark functions, we compare our algorithm with eight state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that our approach excels in handling LSMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Accurately identifying product defects and process anomalies in manufacturing processes is a critical task for product quality and system stability. Although the existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods do not require the annotation of anomalies, they are difficult to deal with the zero-shot scenario faced by multi-variety and small-batch production where there is no available data. In addition, many zero-shot detection algorithms need to represent the image features in tensor form with multiple local feature vectors, and then measure each local feature to infer the overall anomaly of the object. In this paper, we propose GlobalCLIP, a novel approach for zero-shot anomaly detection using only global feature vectors to enhance performance. Specifically, we use CLIP model to aggregate the global features, and design two kinds of adaptive modules from the error level and uncertainty level to realize the series integration of different discriminant models. The adaptive modules encourage the model to learn both normal and abnormal patterns with different granularity, and the self-cyclic training progressively improves model performance. Experiments show that compared to many unsupervised/weakly supervised methods, the performance of GlobalCLIP maintains its advantage even without known samples, and achieves significant improvement over available zero-shot methods.},

Accurate monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs) in irregular processes is essential for improving product quality and reducing scrap rates. This paper proposes a novel KPI-related process monitoring method that leverages the multiple kernel learning (MKL) technique, designed specifically for irregular scenarios with incomplete data. First, a novel MKL-based nonlinear matrix completion is proposed that utilizes a hierarchical strategy-based algorithm to estimate the missing values in incomplete data and the linear coefficients of multiple kernels. In addition, the corresponding convergence analysis is given. Based on the estimated completed data matrix, a novel MKL-based feature correlation analysis is proposed for indirect prediction of KPIs. Two statistics are established for detecting KPI-related and KPI-unrelated faults, respectively. A numerical case and an industrial example demonstrate that the proposed method not only accurately identifies the missing data, but also effectively detects the KPI-related faults.},

  abstract     = {At present, practical machine learning methodologies are extensively employed for the automation of detecting the intrusion available in the network. In key infrastructure scenarios involving communication strategies, the interplay between different industrial control systems and the inherent connection to the Internet environment through the Internet of Things renders them vulnerable to cyber threats. Considering the substantial volume of network traffic within critical Cyber-Physical Systems, conventional machine-learning approaches utilized for detecting anomalies prove to be ineffective. Hence, newly designed machine learning methods, with a focus on deep learning, are demonstrating effective applications in identifying and categorizing anomalies on both network and individual device levels. This article introduces an innovative Ensemble Random Explainable Artificial Intelligence Meerkat Search algorithm designed for the identification of cyber threats. To augment the effectiveness of the suggested method, it employs a dual-step process for the detection of network irregularities. During the initial phase, the approach involves data pre-processing and dimensionality reduction through the application of Kernel Principal Component Analysis to select the most suitable features. In the subsequent stage, the novel Ensemble Random Explainable Artificial Intelligence Meerkat Search algorithm is employed for classification. The effectiveness of the approach presented in this study is evaluated on diverse datasets, encompassing information collected within the Internet of Things context, specifically IoT-23 and LITNET-2020 datasets. The findings of the assessment of the suggested method are deliberated upon, including the examination of statistical significance and a comparative analysis with contemporary approaches in the field of network anomaly detection.

  abstract     = {Recommendation systems, which utilize algorithms and data analysis to provide personalized suggestions to users, have become an indispensable part of modern life. However, traditional recommendation algorithms face challenges such as the cold start problem, lack of diversity, and limited scalability. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly deep reinforcement learning (DRL), emerges as a promising solution to these problems by allowing agents to learn optimal strategies through interaction with their environment. Nevertheless, as the scale of data increases, RL-based recommendation systems often struggle to achieve a good balance between exploration and exploitation, impacting the overall performance of the algorithms. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based recommendation algorithm enhanced by a three-way decision (3WD) framework to address the exploration-exploitation balance challenge. The 3WD algorithm, rooted in rough set theory, categorizes decision outcomes into acceptance, rejection, and uncertainty regions. By applying 3WD in the action selection process of RL, we optimize the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, thereby improving the quality and computational efficiency of recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic threshold adjustment mechanism to adaptively refine the decision boundary during the action selection process in reinforcement learning, further enhancing the algorithm’s performance. Using the MovieLens dataset as a foundation, we conduct extensive experiments with several randomly generated data sets to evaluate the proposed method. Our results demonstrate that the 3WD-based RL algorithm outperforms traditional methods, such as epsilon-greedy and Softmax, in terms of runtime, recommendation accuracy, and error rate. Notably, the dynamic threshold adjustment model exhibits greater stability and surpasses static methods in recommendation success rates. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining 3WD with RL in recommendation systems, providing a powerful and efficient solution to the challenges faced by traditional methods. Finally, we analyze the limitations of the model based on the experimental results and propose avenues for future research.},

It provides a unified representation for data with different spatial supports, which enables blasthole geochemical assays to be properly modelled as interval observations rather than points. This approach is shown to improve regression performance and boundary delineation. A core contribution is a description of the mathematical changes to the covariance expressions which allow these benefits to be realised. The gradient and anti-derivatives are obtained to facilitate learning of the kernel hyperparameters. Numerical stability issues are also discussed. To illustrate its application, an IntegralGP data fusion algorithm is described. The objective is to assimilate line-based blasthole assays and update a block model that provides long-range prediction of Fe concentration beneath the drilled bench. Heteroscedastic GP is used to fuse chemically compatible but spatially incongruous data with different resolutions and sample spacings. Domain knowledge embodied in the structure and empirical distribution of the block model must be generally preserved while local inaccuracies are corrected. Using validation measurements within the predicted bench, our experiments demonstrate an improvement in bench-below grade prediction performance. For material classification, IntegralGP fusion reduces the absolute error and model bias in categorical prediction, especially instances where waste blocks are mistakenly classified as high-grade.},

Additionally, the extent of cross-output knowledge transfer between sequential layers can be assessed autonomously and effectively by utilizing a fast leave-one-out cross-validation method. 4) The model allows random assignment of model parameters in each layer, such as weights and kernel widths, boosting learning speed.

  abstract     = {The Koopman operator provides a new way to model complex data patterns, revealing the intrinsic dynamics of time series from a dynamical system perspective. Despite its potential, the Koopman operator has received limited attention in time series forecasting, particularly in addressing these complex, real-world challenges such as carbon emission dynamics characterized by nonlinearity, non-stationarity, and multi-scale coupling effects. To this end, this study proposes a novel forecasting paradigm, Fourier-Enhanced adaptive Koopman operator for carbon emission forecasting (F-KOCE). This approach conceptually extends traditional Koopman frameworks by embedding a spectral-decoupled time series representation into a dual Koopman learning structure, which enables the model to linearize nonlinear dynamics across multiple time scales in a theoretically grounded and practically adaptive manner. By integrating Fourier filter decomposition into Koopman operator theory, F-KOCE separates raw emissions into long-term trends and short-term fluctuations while achieving global linearization of system dynamics. A learnable Koopman operator captures intrinsic temporal structures, while a multi-granularity adaptive weight learning strategy enhances resilience against data variability. To further improve robustness, we introduce an adaptive residual fusion structure for block-level feature compression, noise suppression, and cross-scale information fusion. Additionally, the effective Trend Corrector mechanism dynamically modulates the influence of trend and fluctuation components, refining predictive accuracy. Beyond point forecasting, the framework is also extended to interval forecasting, providing uncertainty-aware predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on 36 Carbon Monitor datasets across six regions and six sectors demonstrate the superiority of F-KOCE over advanced existing models across multiple evaluation metrics. These results confirm the framework’s efficacy in capturing high-dimensional emission dynamics and underscore the potential of Koopman operator theory in carbon forecasting. By offering a robust, interpretable, and data-driven approach, F-KOCE provides valuable insights for climate policy formulation.},

  abstract     = {The 0–1 knapsack problem (KP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem with wide real-world applications. While evolutionary algorithms have demonstrated promise in solving 0–1 KPs, their performance deteriorates as the problem dimension increases. Cooperative co-evolution (CC) is an algorithmic framework based on a divide-and-conquer strategy, which has been used in solving large-scale optimization problems. Inspired by the similarity between item grouping in the 0–1 KP and decomposition strategies in CC, this paper proposes a novel grouping strategy that uses the position information of break items and profit-to-weight ratio to solve large-scale 0–1 KP. The strategy aims to divide the large-scale 0–1 KP into multiple subproblems, thus having a reduced search space for each subproblem. To enhance population diversity and search efficiency, the profit-to-weight ratio is used to generate an initial elite population. Additionally, to obtain the complete solution for the original large-scale KP, a subgroup merging method is designed to accelerate convergence and further improve population diversity. A three-phase repair operator is developed to fix infeasible solutions directly to create more feasible solutions. The resulting cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm is compared with ten state-of-the-art algorithms for solving 0–1 KPs with variables ranging from 100 to 5,000, including EAs, CC-based approaches, and a deep reinforcement learning method. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits higher solution accuracy and faster convergence than other competing algorithms. The CC framework takes considerably less running time than high-performing algorithms, providing an overall novel approach for solving large-scale 0–1 KPs.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the integration of forecasting and optimization in energy management systems, focusing on how switching costs, penalties incurred from frequent operational adjustments, affect the balance between forecast accuracy and stability in online decision-making. We develop a theoretical framework analyzing Fixed Horizon Control (FHC) algorithms under switching costs, deriving performance bounds that reveal trade-offs between commitment periods and forecast properties. We introduce a novel Scenario Distribution Change (SDC) metric for measuring temporal consistency in probabilistic forecasts. The framework is validated through empirical evaluation using a real-world battery scheduling case study based on the CityLearn 2022 challenge, comparing deterministic and stochastic optimization approaches across different commitment periods. Theoretical analysis reveals that switching costs create a U-shaped relationship between commitment period and performance, with optimal commitment depending on forecast stability. Empirical results demonstrate that switching costs significantly alter the accuracy-stability trade-off: while traditional approaches favor frequent updates (1-hour commitment), incorporating switching costs makes longer commitment periods (3+ hours) optimal when combined with stable forecasts. Stochastic optimization with scenario averaging reduces forecast error sensitivity by up to 2.9 % in grid costs compared to deterministic approaches. This work contributes the first theoretical bounds linking forecast stability to switching costs in energy systems, the SDC metric for evaluating probabilistic forecast stability, empirical evidence that longer commitment periods can outperform frequent updates under switching costs, and practical guidelines showing that forecast stability should be factored into decision-making frameworks for energy management systems in the presence of switching costs.},

By fostering a calculated system, this paper recognizes the commitments of deep learning strategies in choosing and sectioning providers, foreseeing store network gambles, and assessing requests and deals, creation, stock administration, transportation and circulation, manageable turn of events, and roundabout economy. The novelty in this paper is the Backpropagation (BP) neural networks with big data-driven demand forecasting in supply chains. This method can improve the accuracy of demand forecasting in supply chain management. The study includes a thorough survey of the applications of predictive BDA in SC request gauging. The review highlighted the BDA methodologies used for production network request estimation and comparatively classified them. We collected and analysed these studies as tactics and methodologies for the popular forecast. Seven standard tactics were selected and studied, along with their benefits and drawbacks. Finally, the box-cox transformation representation over years in which for the year 2011–01, it starts with a box-cox value of 9.7 and it inclined till 2011–06 and then declined very exponentially in 2012–07 at 9 and then it keeps on incrementing and reached at 11 at the year 2013–07. Then from 2014 to 2015, the pattern didn’t lower below the box-cox value 10.},
