  abstract     = {Short-term electric load forecasting remains challenged by the dual requirements of accuracy and robustness due to the combined effects of strong seasonality, multi-scale spikes, and stochastic disturbances. To address this, we propose a novel multi-scale forecasting framework, NP-WavKAN-Fusion, which integrates Neural Prophet for data decomposition and a Wavelet-based Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (WavKAN) with learnable wavelet kernels for multi-scale encoding. This fusion model utilizes a Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) to capture long-term temporal dependencies and an adaptive feature fusion gate (AFF) to dynamically re-weight static and dynamic features for final load predictions. Extensive experiments on two public datasets from Australia and Morocco show that NP-WavKAN-Fusion consistently outperforms traditional models, reducing the mean absolute error by at least 30 %. For multi-step forecasting tasks, NP-WavKAN-Fusion maintains error inflation within 15 %, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-sequence models such as Informer and PatchTST. The Diebold–Mariano test confirms that NP-WavKAN-Fusion yields statistically significant improvements, with 19 out of 20 comparisons showing lower errors. Ablation studies show that removing either the Neural Prophet component or the AFF significantly increases the forecasting error, validating the necessity of our layered denoising and fusion strategies. The proposed NP-WavKAN-Fusion framework demonstrates strong potential for real-world applications in electric load forecasting, offering robust performance under various temporal and non-stationary conditions.},

  abstract     = {Non-isothermal plastic deformation creates modeling challenges for constitutive model development. Current constitutive models challenge to capture the coupled microstructural changes that occur when temperature varies during processing. The Micro-Mechanism Informed Artificial Neural Network (MMIANN) framework was developed to address these limitations using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The MMIANN framework combines physics-based evolution equations for key metallurgical processes—dislocation density, grain boundary migration, and precipitation kinetics—with neural network predictions. These micro-mechanisms operate as internal state variables that guide the network's material behavior predictions. The architecture uses parallel physics-based and neural pathways, blended through adaptive coefficients. Thermodynamic constraints maintain consistency through penalty-based enforcement of the Clausius-Duhem inequality. The model was trained and validated using experimental data from simultaneous cooling and tensile deformation of AA7075 aluminum alloy. The tests replicated industrial hot forming conditions with cooling rates from 25 to 75 °C per second (°C/s). This experimental approach captures the thermal-mechanical coupling that drives microstructural evolution in practice. MMIANN achieved correlation coefficients exceeding 0.96 for stress, temperature, and grain size predictions. The framework captures thermomechanical regimes. Processing maps generated by the AI model link process parameters to microstructural outcomes. The analysis reveals an optimal processing window (40–55 °C/s cooling, 0.15–0.25 strain ( ε )) and identifies three regimes where different strengthening mechanisms dominate. By integrating metallurgical science with machine learning, this framework provides a practical tool for non-isothermal manufacturing processes. The approach bridges microstructural understanding with process control for thermal-mechanical operations through the application of artificial intelligence.},

  abstract     = {Condition monitoring of complex industrial systems is critical for ensuring operational reliability. Data-driven methods using artificial intelligence have advanced anomaly detection (AD) and fault diagnosis (FD), but existing approaches often treat them separately, focus on known faults, and struggle with previously unseen or rare conditions in multi-modal scenarios. This study proposes a novel condition monitoring framework that integrates AD and FD within a distributed architecture. Lightweight models—including kernel principal component analysis, support vector machines, and one-dimensional convolutional neural networks—enable efficient and scalable processing. A multilevel information fusion strategy ensures consistent detection and diagnosis while facilitating the isolation of previously unknown faults. Module test results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed feature extraction and adaptive modeling approaches. The overall test results for previously unknown faults vary across channels and modules. For samples with misalignment and inner blade wear, channel-level detection accuracy ranges from 0.007 to 0.989, with unknown recognition rates up to 0.933 and diagnosis probabilities from 0.508 to 0.933. For strong misalignment and fan-end inner race faults, nearly all channels achieve 100 % detection accuracy, with some diagnosis probabilities above 0.9, while unknown recognition remains minimal (mostly below 0.05). Importantly, the proposed framework integrates detection and diagnostic outputs across channels, effectively mapping previously unseen faults to similar known categories or to an unknown category. Overall, the proposed framework offers a referenced solution for condition monitoring of industrial systems like pumps, turbines, and compressors, and lays the foundation for future improvements incorporating domain knowledge and model-driven interpretability.},

This study proposes an integrated framework combining finite element analysis (FEA), experimental modal testing, and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to model and predict position-dependent dynamics across the machine workspace. A validated FEA model of a high-rigidity vertical machining centre is developed and correlated with experimental modal analysis using a PCB 086D20 impact hammer and tri-axial accelerometer. Natural frequencies and mode shapes are extracted and compared, showing deviation under 10 %, confirming model fidelity. To capture position-dependent dynamics, modal analysis was performed at 27 spatial locations, revealing significant frequency variation across planes, indicating localized compliance zones. A multilayer ANN is trained on the modal dataset to predict frequencies based on spatial coordinates, achieving R 2 values above 0.99. The proposed hybrid approach enables real-time estimation of structural dynamics, reducing the need for repeated testing and supporting intelligent control strategies in large-format CNC systems. This work contributes a predictive foundation for dynamic stability optimization, resonance avoidance, and digital twin development in precision machining applications.},

A novel hybrid nanofluid has exhibited exceptional thermal properties, combining five nanoparticles of uniform shapes with a base fluid, such as blood. This study investigates the influence of fin thickness, varying with length, considering the implications of internal heat production, convection, and thermal radiation processes in rectangular, convex, and triangular fin descriptions. Wet scenarios are interpreted to evaluate differences in thermal energy dynamics for fin shapes like Rectangular, Convex and Triangular. Darcy's model is employed to account for the material's porous nature. A finite difference scheme, implemented using Partial Differential Equation solver (PDSolve) in Maple (2024), provides graphical insights into fin effectiveness and thermal steady-state responses across various parameters. Incorporating Penta hybrid nanofluids enhances fin performance, with rectangular fins' Nusselt numbers (up to 1.936) proving more efficient, delivering faster thermal responses than triangular fins and convex fins. Further, using the Adam Optimisation algorithm, Convolutional Neural Networks were used to validate the current model. It was observed that these networks could accurately forecast the truth values, and the two findings matched, as indicated in Table 3 As a potential biological application, this research offers insight into optimising cooling systems for biomedical devices, such as heat exchangers in artificial organs.},

This field faces several challenges: (1) Acoustic is an essential component of emotion expression, but it often underperforms compared to visual and text in emotion recognition. (2) Capturing the feature interaction among different modalities is usually complex. (3) Processing high-definition videos can significantly reduce the efficiency of visual analysis. In this study, we presented a learning architecture designed to recognize human emotions effectively. For the first challenge, we implemented a multi-level acoustic encoder (MLAE) that enhances the extraction of acoustic information to improve the acoustic contribution in multi-modal emotion recognition. Facing the second challenge, we introduced the cross-attention block module, which adeptly captures the inter-modal interactions. To address the third challenge, we adopted the re-parameterized visual geometry group network (RepVGG) as the visual feature encoder, employing its multi-branch learning and single-branch reasoning structure to maintain high reasoning efficiency. Our model has demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of the interactive emotional dyadic motion capture (IEMOCAP) dataset and the multi-modal opinion sentiment and emotion intensity of the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU-MOSEI) dataset.},

  abstract     = {—Permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) are widely used in industrial applications but remain vulnerable to stator faults, such as inter-coil and inter-turn short circuits. Although recent deep learning-based fault detection methods have shown promise, they typically rely on large volumes of labelled fault data for training. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel unsupervised fault detection framework, termed Deep Adaptive Wavelet Autoencoder (DAWA) with Mutually Independent Empirical Cumulative Distribution (MIECD), specifically designed for PMSM fault detection. DAWA utilizes convolutional neural networks to learn adaptive wavelet filters through fast discrete wavelet transform, allowing for fully learnable, threshold-free extraction of fine-grained signal patterns. The resulting latent features are then mapped by MIECD into a mutually independent space via independent component analysis (ICA). Without assuming any prior data distribution, MIECD estimates empirical cumulative distributions (ECDs), computes tail probabilities across dimensions, and aggregates them into a unified anomaly score. Experimental results on motor vibration datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing average accuracy improvements of 15.85 % for Interturn and 15.16 % for Intercoil fault detection compared to conventional data-driven baselines across various operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {Health state prediction of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) is a critical technology to ensure their long-term reliable operation. Prediction accuracy directly influences the effectiveness of maintenance strategies and risk management. However, existing PEMFC degradation prediction methods based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer architectures mostly focus on point estimation while neglecting uncertainty quantification. This limitation makes it difficult to assess the confidence level of predictions in practical engineering applications, reducing the models' reliability in decision support. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Patch Time Series Transformer (B-PatchTST) method. By deeply integrating Bayesian variational inference with time series patch modeling, the method enables probabilistic prediction of PEMFC degradation trajectories and disentangled analysis of uncertainty sources. Unlike traditional Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) that primarily apply Bayesian modeling to fully connected layers, B-PatchTST introduces a Bayesian Self-Attention Mechanism, which models epistemic uncertainty in three stages: patch embedding, uncertainty-aware self-attention computation, and adaptive regularization. This design significantly enhances the credibility of the model. Extensive experiments on the fuel cell datasets demonstrate the proposed method's outstanding performance. It achieves an average reduction of 36.31 % in root mean square error and an average compression of 83.39 % in the 95 % confidence interval, significantly outperforming existing methods. This approach offers a trustworthy basis for predictive maintenance in PEMFC systems, promoting a shift from “experience-based maintenance” to “reliable prognostics” in hydrogen energy applications.},

  abstract     = {Accurately distinguishing field weeds from crops and locating weed positions are critical prerequisites in automated weed control operations. However, weed detection and localization in unstructured field environments with complex lighting remains challenging. Firstly, data-driven deep learning based algorithms usually have a high dependence on a large number of training samples, and there are huge differences between field weeds and crops in different regions, growth cycles, and types. In addition, the conflict between hardware performance and computation cost makes it difficult for existing weed detection algorithms to maintain both detection accuracy and speed on low-performance platforms. All these problems increase the difficulty of detection. To solve the above problems, we first construct a medium-to-large weed dataset using an open-source agricultural image dataset and collect field data. Subsequently, we have proposed a lightweight weed detection algorithm using the ShuffleNetv2 network as the backbone network, with a multi-scale pyramid network, and the overall network algorithm is named WeedNet-X. The number of model parameters and the computational volume of the algorithm are only 0.57 million and 0.48 Giga floating point operations (GFLOPs), respectively. On the two constructed datasets, the mean Average Precision (mAP) of the algorithm can reach 86.31 % and 80.98 %, respectively, which are improved by 0.61 % and 3.10 % compared to the baseline model. Finally, the hardware and software systems for weed detection verify the excellence of the proposed algorithm in terms of practical performance.},

  abstract     = {The recent human-made conflict in 2022 severely damaged Ukraine's infrastructure, causing significant instability in the food supply chain. This crisis was further exacerbated by trade bans imposed on another major global wheat exporter. Since wheat production and export are intrinsically linked, particularly in times of crisis, it is essential to adopt the concept of an intertwined supply chain. Accordingly, this study proposes an intertwined supply chain framework for the production and export of wheat during long-term disruptions. To enhance the viability of this intertwined system, the study introduces three key strategies. First, it addresses long-term disruptions and operational risks by employing redundancies and data-driven robust optimization techniques, where uncertainty sets are generated using a support vector clustering model. Second, the proposed supply chain accounts for freshwater resource limitations by integrating water resilience measures. Third, as the framework operates within a global context, it incorporates a comprehensive model that considers exchange rates, taxation, foreign demand points, and international trade responsibilities. To optimize these strategies, two multi-objective optimization models are developed and solved using an epsilon-constraint method. A cardinality-based measure is introduced to efficiently represent the Pareto front, offering decision-makers valuable insights into non-dominated solutions. The results are divided into analyses of wheat production, export, and their combined network. Individual analyses assess network setup, viability, and uncertainty control, while the integrated analysis examines sensitivity and interdependence. Overall, improving water use, managing risks, and designing a resilient, interconnected system can greatly strengthen the wheat supply chain during long-term crises.},

  abstract     = {Accurate forecasting of carbon trading prices (CTPs) with spikes is crucial for developing carbon emission reduction policies and planning corporate investments. However, most existing CTP approaches usually focus on designing a cutting-edge model without considering spike prediction. Therefore, this paper presents a novel heuristic optimization-based hybrid model framework for CTP prediction with spikes. First, random forest is exploited to identify the relevant features of spikes and non-spikes for CTPs, and categorical boosting is employed to predict the spike occurrences of CTPs. Then, a novel hybrid model based on multiple linear regression, categorical boosting, and two dimensions convolutional neural network and bidirectional gated recurrent unit with multi-head regularized attention mechanism (2DCNN-BiGRU-MRA) is proposed to predict spikes and non-spikes for CTPs. In this model, multiple linear regression and categorical boosting are respectively applied to capture the linear and complex nonlinear features of the CTPs, in which their prediction results and deviations are integrated into the 2DCNN-BiGRU-MRA model as relevant features. The proposed 2DCNN-BiGRU-MRA can learn the spatiotemporal features and enhance representation capabilities by introducing 2DCNN, BiGRU, and MRA, thereby improving the accuracy of CTP prediction. In addition, to construct appropriate model hyperparameters of 2DCNN-BiGRU-MRA, the strength honey badger algorithm based on the adaptive momentum estimation is proposed to optimize the hyperparameters of 2DCNN-BiGRU-MRA. Finally, the proposed framework is tested on the actual data of European Union emissions trading and the carbon market in Hubei, China, and case studies have confirmed the superiority and achievable local interpretability of the proposed hybrid model framework.},

  abstract     = {Geometric and thermal errors critically affect the precision of face gear grinding, yet current modeling approaches are computationally intensive and lack real-time adaptability. This study proposes a real-time spatiotemporal error compensation framework for face gear grinding. A closed-loop feedback mechanism is introduced to adaptively update compensation intensity based on residual error feedback, ensuring robustness and efficiency under fluctuating machining conditions. Moreover, a novel spatial-temporal thermal error model is developed by integrating Taylor-graph convolutional network and modified-long short term memory network to capture both node-level spatial fusion and long-term temporal dependencies. High-order terms in geometric error modeling are eliminated using a vector decomposition and truncation-based approach, significantly reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, a high-efficiency multi-source error-tooth flank mapping model is developed based on vector decomposition and truncation function methods, enabling accurate prediction with reduced computational cost. To identify dominant error contributors, an improved Morris-based sensitivity analysis method is integrated, distinguishing geometric and thermal errors affecting tooth flank deviation. Experimental results demonstrate sub-65 ms real-time response, 24.2 μm maximum error reduction, and robust adaptability under fluctuating machining conditions. Compared with recent gear-flank compensation studies, the proposed closed-loop framework achieves a 63.4 % reduction in maximum normal flank error under real machining and <65 ms response latency. This level is comparable to reported reductions based on grid-aggregated metrics in spiral bevel gears (76.82 % reduction of the sum of absolute grid errors), while additionally ensuring real-time, delay-aware execution. These findings validate the proposed system's potential for precision, real-time compensation in multi-axis manufacturing environments.},

The FE-predicted hysteresis curves are compared with test results to verify model accuracy, and a data set is established accordingly. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm is used for training and prediction, and compared with the traditional machine learning (ML) algorithm, the superiority of the XGBoost algorithm is manifested. The XGBoost algorithm is then used to predict the damage and energy values of the joint under more different parameter combinations, with the largest ratio of damage value to energy dissipation value selected as the optimal combination of the joints within the variation range of the six parameters. The results show that the FE model correlates well with the test results and can therefore be used to generate a data set. The prediction accuracy of XGBoost algorithm has high accuracy of more than 99 % in predicting damage and energy dissipation values and can thus be used for joint prediction research. Compared with other ML algorithms, XGBoost has the best prediction performance and superiority. Within the variation range of the six parameters, the ratio of damage value to energy dissipation value is the largest when the concrete strength, longitudinal bar diameter, concrete slab thickness, box girder strength, axial compression ratio, and transverse stiffener strength are respectively 30 Mega Pascal (MPa), 12 mm (mm), 90 mm, 390 MPa, 0.3, and 455 MPa.},

Existing diagnosis methods still have restricted generalization performance under speed variations owing to inadequate utilization of multisensor information. To address this problem, a novel feature-decision dual fusion network is proposed for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery under varying speed conditions. First, for each sensor, the frequency information learner is built to simultaneously extract global and local frequency domain features using global and local feature encoders. These features are then fused through a cross-attention mechanism to generate a sensor-specific initial classification decision. Subsequently, these individual sensor-wise decisions are fed into the decision dynamic ensemble to yield final fault diagnosis result. Moreover, an adaptive optimization strategy is designed to guide model learning generalizable features by flexibly adjusting the sensor loss weights during training. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on bearing and gearbox datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior generalization and robustness for fault diagnosis under varying speed conditions.},

  abstract     = {Solar cells are the fundamental core energy harvesting components in photovoltaic (PV) power generation stations. In view of the capability of detecting the invisible defects, the electroluminescence (EL) imaging is broadly used in the production lines of solar cells, based on which the deep learning technique is introduced to implement automatic defect detection and classification. However, the current deep learning models feature high complexity and require much computation resources, which are difficult to deploy in edge devices for real time applications. To tackle this issue, we proposed a novel lightweight and high-precision deep learning model named Cross Stage Partial Photovoltaic-You Only Look Once (CSPV-YOLO) based on the deep learning framework You Only Look Once v5 (YOLOv5) to enable the real-time solar cell defect detection. Firstly, a new module Cross Stage Partial C5 (CSPC5) is proposed to replace the initial C3 module in the YOLOv5 network to enhance the network accuracy in recognizing different types of defects. Secondly, a novel Spatial Pyramid Pooling with Cross Stage Partial (SPPFCSP) module is designed to replace the original Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast (SPPF), which boosts the network feature extraction capabilities from defect targets at multiple scales and facilitates a more efficient integration of multiscale features. Finally, the original loss function of YOLOv5 is replaced by the Scylla intersection over union (SIoU) function to optimize the training model. The proposed models have been validated and intensively compared with many other state-of-the-art models on two public datasets. Firstly, results of experiments on the public Pascal Visual Object Classes (PASCAL VOC) 2007 datasets demonstrate that the proposed SPPFCSP block is obviously superior to other Spatial Pyramid Pooling blocks for the most state-of-the-art YOLO detectors, which can significantly improve the detection accuracy. The comparison results of experiments on the public Photovoltaic Electroluminescence Anomaly Detection Dataset (PVEL-AD) that includes 12-class defects obviously indicate that the proposed CSPV-YOLO model is better than many state-of-the-art models and achieves 91.5 % average precision (AP) and frames per second (FPS) of 177.8 on with only 2.2 million (M) parameters. Hence, it is suitable for the deployment on edge devices for real-time applications.},

One of the main challenges for researchers is quickly and accurately segmenting 3D objects. Previous work has achieved excellent segmentation accuracy, but retraining requires a significant amount of time. Additionally, most methods fail to provide users with an efficient and convenient segmentation experience. To address these issues, we present Efficient Interactive Segmentation of 3D Gaussians (EISG), an efficient interactive segmentation method that eliminates the need for lengthy retraining. We first design an optimal view selection (OVS) method. This method uses 3D Gaussian entropy and image uncertainty to evaluate the quantity of view information. OVS helps users quickly select the optimal segmentation view, thereby enhancing interaction efficiency. Secondly, we use projection to find the target foreground rapidly and then segment the approximate objects using a clustering algorithm. Thirdly, we design a spatial-color background filter (SCBF) using the depth and color of 3D Gaussians. SCBF enables precise segmentation without needing retraining. Our method has been systematically tested on multiple datasets. Compared to other methods, the results demonstrate that EISG achieves ideal accuracy while significantly reducing processing time.},

  abstract     = {Correctly identifying power quality disturbance (PQD) is crucial for the proper functioning of power systems. Deep learning (DL) techniques have been widely used for PQD classification due to their excellent performance. However, DL models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, posing a serious security threat to DL-based PQD classification systems. This issue has received limited attention in current research. In this study, we first utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize various types of PQD signals. To evaluate model robustness, we introduce a black-box attack method for PQD classification based on the variance-tuning momentum iterative fast gradient sign method (VMI-FGSM). VMI-FGSM integrates a variance tuning method into the iterative process of the momentum iterative fast gradient sign method (MI-FGSM) , thereby producing more transferable adversarial PQD signals. To defend against such attacks, we propose a perturbation removal defense based on a generative adversarial network (PRD-GAN). This approach is capable of removing perturbations from adversarial PQD signals before they are recognized by the target classification model. Experiments demonstrate that VMI-FGSM produces adversarial perturbations that are nearly identical to those of the advanced MI-FGSM, but its adversarial examples are significantly more effective at misleading the target CNN model. Furthermore, the proposed PRD-GAN effectively reconstructs adversarial PQD signals into clean forms under various black-box attack intensities and outperforms the multi-level denoising autoencoder (ML-DAE) in defense performance due to its superior reconstruction capability.},

This paper presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven framework for adaptive resource management, defined as the capability to autonomously adjust resource allocation by proactively forecasting future demands and dynamically optimizing decisions in real-time. The framework integrates a suite of AI techniques, including time-series models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), chosen for their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies, for demand prediction. For resource allocation, it employs advanced actor–critic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), selected for their stability and efficiency in complex decision-making tasks. Performance was rigorously evaluated in a simulated dynamic environment. Experimental results demonstrate that combinations leveraging LSTM’s predictive accuracy with the robust optimization of PPO and DDPG achieve superior performance and stability. Specifically, the LSTM+DDPG and LSTM+PPO configurations yielded the highest average rewards (0.964 and 0.942, respectively), significantly outperforming the fixed-strategy baseline (0.497) and other AI pairings. Furthermore, the feasibility of training prediction models in a distributed manner via Federated Learning (FL) is successfully demonstrated.

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based segmentation techniques have demonstrated significant potential in defect detection, which is vital for product quality. However, the existing models tend to specialize in detecting specific defect types, reducing their adaptability to a wider range of product defects, most existing methods rely on multi-scale or prototype learning to extract defect features, but still struggle with complex backgrounds, various interferences, and large intra-class variations. Additionally, the rarity of certain defects limits the availability of training samples. Herein, an innovative segmentation network, the Prior Knowledge-based and Texture-Enhanced Network (PTNet), is designed for few-shot industrial segmentation. The model is mainly composed of a self-guidance branch, a cross-guidance branch, and a texture enhancement module, enabling generalization across defect types with minimal labeled samples. Self-guidance extracts prior knowledge from the query image, while the cross-guidance branch extracts prior and prototype features from the masked support image. The texture information in the low-level features of the backbone is then enhanced by proposed texture enhancement module (TEM). Finally, the enhanced low-level texture information are fused with high-level semantic features, allowing the network to fully exploit both local details and global context before being decoded to restore the original image size. This enables the model to handle complex textures and generalize to unseen defect types. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules. State-of-the-art performance is achieved in few-shot defect segmentation, with notable improvements in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 46.05 % and 46.98 % under 1-shot and 5-shot conditions, respectively.},

To accurately and reliably assess its health state, an ensemble learning algorithm (ELA) is introduced, tackling deviations of appraisal decision boundaries. Focusing on issues of complex weight calculation, model homogenization, and severe overfitting in ELA, an integration model based on an automatic weight allocation strategy (AWAS) is innovatively proposed, constructing a method for resistance estimations driven by information fusion, while maximizing its generalization ability. Firstly, for deterioration mechanism analysis of ballast resistance, a transmission state model for vehicle-ground collaboration is established, completing extractions of evolutionary rules. Secondly, the improved ELA leverages heterogeneous classifier optimization and automatic weighted soft voting, with its core ensemble strategy employing a secondary learner to map the fused datasets. Then, by means of data mining techniques, interpolation and denoising algorithms are applied to implement data preprocessing, facilitating the effective fusion of heterogeneous vehicle-ground information. Finally, based on occurrence of adverse conditions, an appropriate particle size is set to achieve state warning.

  abstract     = {The fusion of sophisticated computational, communicative, and physical elements in Smart Grid Cyber-Physical Systems (SGCPS) has greatly improved the efficiency and reliability of power grids. However, this complexity introduces enhanced cybersecurity risks, evidenced by significant cyberattacks on the Ukrainian power grid during 2015 and 2016. Despite progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven security solutions for SGCPS, practical deployment of these technologies is often limited due to a lack of high-quality attack data and owners’ hesitance to distribute sensitive details. This paper introduces an innovative strategy to fortify SGCPS against diverse network threats via a comprehensive intrusion detection system. We present a deep learning model leveraging a temporal convolutional network with multi-feature integration, aimed at robust threat identification. We also propose a federated learning framework enabling various SGCPS to jointly develop an extensive intrusion detection model, ensuring data privacy. Moreover, we incorporate a gradient compression technique utilizing the Long Short Term Memory- β -Total Correlation Variational Autoencoder (LSTM- β -TCVAE) model to enhance and secure model parameters throughout the training phase. Thorough experimental validations confirm the efficacy of our method in recognizing multiple cyber threat types to SGCPS and its advantages over current methods.},

  abstract     = {Detecting crack leakages in shield tunnels is crucial for ensuring structural safety and extending service life, as traditional detection methods are limited by high subjectivity and low accuracy. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Tunnel-YOLO, an improved object detection algorithm based on You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8). This algorithm replaces standard convolutional blocks with a novel Receptive Field Channel Attention Convolution (RFCAConv) module, which leverages dynamic receptive fields to enhance feature capture at different scales. We also introduce a C2f_SGE module, integrating the Spatial Group-wise Enhance (SGE) attention mechanism into the C2f (CSPNet with 2 convolutions) block to significantly improve feature extraction while suppressing background interference. Furthermore, an Edge Feature Enhancement Detection Head (EFE-Head) incorporates deconvolution layers to enhance fine-grained details for more precise boundary localization. To better accommodate the shape-sensitive detection task, our LeShape-IoU (Intersection over Union) loss function is designed to focus on the shape and scale characteristics of target bounding boxes. Experimental results on a public, real-world dataset demonstrate that Tunnel-YOLO significantly outperforms the baseline, increasing Recall, Precision, and mean Average Precision at 0.5 IoU (mAP50) by 15.7%, 10.3%, and 14.8%, respectively. Comparative analysis with other mainstream algorithms further validates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed Tunnel-YOLO.},

In this paper, a contrastive active adaptive partial label learning method under class distribution mismatch which combines active partial label learning with contrastive coding is proposed. A novel active sample selection strategy is first established to use label propagation ability to measure the optimization ability of unlabeled samples to partially labeled samples. Furthermore, to solve the problem of class distribution mismatch, a joint query score based on contrastive coding is utilized to reduce the queries of unlabeled samples out of target categories. Finally, the above two indicators are combined adaptively to select the most valuable unlabeled samples in target categories for manual labeling and the selected samples will be added to the training sample set to train the new classifier. The effectiveness and efficiency of the method are evaluated by performing experiments on the datasets CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.},

In recent years, machine-learning (ML) models have been widely applied in the daily runoff predictions, but the robustness and effectiveness of individual ML model is always limited. A novel weight optimization scheme has been introduced to ML models to obtain accurate predictions of daily river runoff. Variational modal decomposition method is adopted in the dataset preprocessing, and the runoff prediction performance of various classic ML models, including Genetic Algorithm-Back Propagation neural network (GA-BP), Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), Elman neural network (Elman) and Genetic Algorithm-Support Vector Machine (GA-SVM) are subsequently evaluated. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) based weight optimization strategy is proposed to combine different types of ML models, thus more accurate and robust results could be obtained. The ten-fold cross-validation method has been adopted and the performance of the optimized hybrid models are further evaluated for different schemes. A case study at Hankou hydrological station demonstrates that root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is improved by 35.7 %, 75.8 % respectively for the optimized hybrid model.

  abstract     = {RGBT (red-green-blue and thermal) salient object detection (SOD) aims to identify and highlight the most visually salient objects in an image by leveraging the complementary information from both RGB and thermal (TIR) modalities. It is particularly effective for 24/7 intelligent surveillance and autonomous perception in smart city security and traffic monitoring, especially under low light and adverse weather. However, existing methods primarily rely on manually aligned datasets, which are limited in handling the challenges posed by unaligned multi-modal data in real-world applications. Furthermore, these methods usually extract complementary information from both modalities using fixed-size windows (Liuet al., 2022, Wanget al., 2024b). However, such fixed-size windows are not effective in dealing with unaligned multi-modal images due to spatial inconsistencies. Additionally, existing methods often use single-layer high-level feature to represent semantic information, which fails to fully exploit the complementary benefits of multi-level features, thereby reducing the effectiveness of semantic guidance. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Semantics guided Multi-scale correlation Network (HSMNet) for alignment-free RGBT SOD. A Hierarchical Semantic Fusion Module (HSFM) dynamically assigns weights to features from multiple levels, enabling adaptive fusion of multi-level semantic information. A Multi-scale Asymmetric Correlation Module (MACM) employs windows of various sizes to capture asymmetric correlations between unaligned multi-modal data, enhancing cross-modal complementary information extraction even when data are not perfectly aligned. We conduct extensive experiments on unaligned, weakly aligned and aligned RGBT SOD datasets, with results demonstrating that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving superior accuracy and robustness in both unaligned and weakly aligned RGBT SOD scenarios.},

This study proposed a method to estimate the health of retired batteries by embedding their capacity degradation characteristics directly into the loss function of a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network, combined with a Physically Informed Neural Network (PINN) model. The model is developed by incorporating the dynamics of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) membrane, which evolves as the lithium-ion poles of the retired battery move. By combining these dynamics with the governing equations of motion, a partial differential equation (PDE) is derived. This approach integrates physical constraints, data-driven learning, and PDEs into a composite loss function. The proposed method is validated on two different datasets under varying operating temperatures. The results show that the PINN-BiLSTM model achieves a Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE) of 0.024, representing a 9.67 % improvement over the PINN-LSTM. This adaptive PINN method offers highly accurate health state predictions across temperature variations, thus supporting the sustainable use of retired batteries in secondary applications and helping to mitigate energy scarcity.},

  abstract     = {With the advances in communication technologies, remote monitoring and control of drug delivery are becoming prevalent in bio-medical engineering. In a chemotherapy system, the measurement signals can be wirelessly transferred to the control center by communication networks. Nevertheless, the avenues of communication might be jeopardized by false data injection (FDI), which poses significant risks to the security and stability of biomedical systems. In this work, a defense mechanism is developed to tackle the effect of FDI threats in the networked chemotherapy system. In particular, the effect of FDI attacks on the chemotherapy system is modeled by the Markov chain process. The proposed defense mechanism is designed in two parts: i ) a data-driven sliding mode observer (DDSMO) is utilized to identify the occurrence of cyber attacks in the tumor signals measured by the bio-sensor, and ii ) a mitigation scheme based on a dynamic rejection compensator (DRC) to compensate for the impact of cyber threats. In the mitigation phase, a goal representation heuristic dynamic programming (GrHDP) is adopted to adaptively adjust the parameters of DRC and to dynamically handle the cyber threats. The designed mitigation mechanism not only regulates the cancerous cells against cyber threats but also minimizes the side effects of drug delivery by regulating the output of normal cell and immune cell. Compared to prevalent methodologies, the proposed approach yields significant performance, including a 60.23 % improvement over the without protection, 37.48 % over the DDSMO-based model predictive controller (MPC), 35.95 % over the reinforcement learning (RL) based Kalman filter, and 70.44 % over the proportional integral (PI) based Kalman filter.},

  abstract     = {Multi-domain adaptive methods are becoming a growing focus of fault diagnosis, which can provide enhanced data support for models using the feature information from various source domains. As a most commonly used method, unsupervised multi-domain adaptive methods (UMA) can eliminate the requirement for the label of the target domain samples. However, the neglect of contributions from different source domains to the target domain and insufficient utilization of diagnostic information from multiple source domains are the widely limitation of UMA. Therefore, a dual-adversarial weighted multi-source domain unsupervised adaptive network (DAWMUN) is proposed to utilize diagnostic information from multi-source domains and consider the contribution of different source domains. Firstly, the shared feature extractor and dual adversarial training with the domain adversarial modules between multi-source domains and source-target domains are used to enhance domain confusion between multi-source and target domains (MSTD). Secondly, based on Multiple Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MK-MMD), a novel weighting mechanism and the corresponding training framework are constructed to effectively reduce negative transfer. Finally, a novel weighted classifier is proposed to merge the outputs of multiple classifiers and synthesize the impact of each source domain. The performance of the DAWMUN is validated using a rotating machinery dataset across various transfer tasks under different rotational speed and load conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the diagnostic accuracy using the proposed DAWMUN is superior to existing SSDA and MSDA methods, with the average accuracies of 98.53 % and 98.23 % across six tasks in two separate experimental setups. The comparison to the existing methods results that the DAWMUN still demonstrates superior performance with improvements of 2.54 % and 2.86 %, respectively.},

To address this limitation, we propose Clean-guided Adaptive Weighted Contrastive Hashing (CAWCH), a novel framework designed to improve robustness against noisy labels. CAWCH incorporates two main components: a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based noise purifier that identifies reliable and noisy samples by modeling sample loss, and a contrastive learning strategy that selectively chooses positive samples and adaptively assigns weights based on multi-label similarity, considering both intra- and inter-modal relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAWCH significantly outperforms existing methods under noisy label conditions, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for real-world cross-modal retrieval applications.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic flux leakage (MFL) signal denoising is essential for the nondestructive inspection of oil and gas pipelines, where complex noise interference can severely degrade defect quantification accuracy. Traditional approaches such as mean filtering and wavelet transform offer limited suppression of multi-type mixed noise and often distort critical features, including defect peaks and valleys. Even deep learning–based MFL denoising methods struggle in scenarios with substantial signal-noise overlap due to inadequate feature extraction and limited adaptability.This work presents an advanced denoising framework that combines dynamic feature fusion with a multi-scale autoencoder network. The framework jointly exploits time- and frequency-domain signal components, employing an adaptive weighting mechanism for dynamic feature fusion. Parallel convolutional branches extract multi-scale features, improving the capture of both global structures and fine-grained details, while a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) channel attention mechanism enhances defect-sensitive features and suppresses noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms mean filtering, wavelet denoising, and a baseline autoencoder, achieving notable gains in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), mean squared error (MSE), and signal similarity. Beyond superior noise suppression, the method preserves critical defect characteristics, providing a robust and reliable foundation for precise defect quantification in pipeline MFL inspection.},

  abstract     = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) faces a fundamental challenge in reconciling predictive performance with physical interpretability for infrastructure diagnostics. Conventional deep learning (DL) approaches neglect essential mechanisms governing crack width variation—including thermal gradients, hysteretic responses, and phase-shifted correlations—limiting their reliability in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a mechanism-guided optimization (MGO) framework that integrates domain knowledge into the Informer architecture through physics-informed enhancements: auto-correlation modeling for capturing temperature-crack hysteresis, static gated fusion for multi-feature integration, and adaptive elastic net regularization for feature selection. Validated on cable-stayed bridge monitoring data, our framework achieves significant mean absolute error reductions (MAE) (5 %–60 %) and root mean square error reductions (RMSE) (10 %–55 %) versus baseline Informer across all cracks and prediction horizons, with diebold-mariano (DM) tests confirming statistical superiority in most cases. Crucially, it demonstrates superior precision relative to six state-of-the-art benchmarks across all evaluation scenarios. The ordinary least squares (OLS)-enhanced variant further delivers volatility reduction, while sensor failure tests establish quantifiable robustness benchmarks through MAE progression from 0.013 mm to 0.391 mm. This work establishes an interpretable, physics-grounded paradigm that explicitly links environmental drivers to structural degradation.},

Accurate, efficient, and lightweight tongue segmentation significantly improves both the quality and practical applicability of intelligent disease diagnosis models. To address this challenge, we propose TongueSAM_Lite, a lightweight and fully automated tongue image segmentation model. Based on the Segment Anything Model. Our approach employs knowledge distillation and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to develop a novel lightweight image encoder, high-parameter modules in the Vision Transformer are partially replaced with lightweight image modules, which facilitate the transfer of its feature extraction capabilities while accelerating inference speed and reducing computational resource requirements. Additionally, to eliminate manual annotation of tongue region bounding boxes, we integrate a YOLOX-based automatic Box-prompt generator, enabling end-to-end fully automated prompting and segmentation of tongue images. To validate our approach, various experiments were conducted in three datasets. The results show that compared to the original large-scale model of the Segment Anything Model, TongueSAM_Lite reduces the size of the model by 42.7% and shortens the inference time to 45.43% while retaining the near-complete segmentation accuracy of few-shot learning. TongueSAM_Lite achieves Mean Intersection over Union scores of 96.48%, 98.36%, and 97.53% in the three datasets, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Further validation confirms that the YOLOX-based prompt encoder yields optimal performance for the generation of tongue image bounding boxes.

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) provides a promising solution to mitigate the annotation costs in remote sensing applications. Mainstream teacher-student based SSOD methods leverage unlabeled images through pseudo labeling, and their effectiveness is fundamentally limited by the inevitable noise in pseudo labels, particularly for remote sensing (RS) scenarios with complex backgrounds and dense, multi-scale and oriented objects. Current methods primarily focus on reducing pseudo label noise through category, scale and Intersection over Union information mining, as well as designing fine-grained confidence thresholding strategies. However, the inherent discrepancy between classification and localization reliability is neglected. In this study, with analyzing the characteristic discrepancies between the classification and localization branches, We propose artificial intelligence (AI) methodological innovation method named cross-branch information incorporation method (i.e., CBI-SSOD) to utilize these discrepancies to assist the training of the classification branch, and thus improve the performance of SSOD methods. Specifically, our method present two key AI innovations. Firstly, we propose a pretext task to extract cross-branch information, which can improve the classification ability by reinforce the consistent predictions between the classification branch and the pretext task. Besides, we propose a pseudo label reassignment approach to adjust the soft classification pseudo labels, and thus suppress pseudo label noise and improve the detection performance. Extensive experiments on Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images (DOTAv1.0) and DOTAv1.5 datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of our method, and demonstrate the practical engineering impact of our method on RS applications and interpretation systems.},

The development of TCs is often accompanied by frequent lightning activities. The risk of lightning strikes to high offshore wind turbines is substantially elevated. This study evaluates the lightning risk faced by offshore wind farms influenced by tropical cyclones. Firstly, TC paths are analyzed in both spatial and temporal dimensions by linking them with lightning data to examine the distribution of TC-related lightning, and the lightning strike characteristics of offshore wind turbines are investigated. Secondly, a Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model for lightning risk assessment is proposed, incorporating characteristics of TC lightning and offshore wind farms as input variables. The proposed BO-XGBoost model outperforms XGBoost, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Network (NN), achieving a precision of 98.9 % and a recall of 98.9 % on the test set. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analysis indicates that TC lightning characteristics and offshore wind farm characteristics significantly impact the model output, enhancing the accuracy of the model.

The traditional dynamic models like Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Transformer are difficult to model such data sequences. The main reason is that these models assume that data sampling frequency should be constant. To this end, a Sampling Interval-Adaptive Transformer (SIA-Trans) is proposed in this paper to adaptively model the temporal information for heterogeneous sampling sequences in industrial processes. The SIA-Trans uses the sampling interval and position embedding block to address the problem of unequal time intervals and rectify the temporal correlations in time series. Then, the interval-aware self-attention net is designed for dynamic data relationship modeling, taking the processed data through the self-attention mechanism. Finally, the predicted output is obtained after the point-wise feed-forward layer. The proposed SIA-Trans is validated on a real-world hydrocracking process to predict the content of hydrocarbon mixture with five carbon atoms (C5) hydrocarbons in light naphtha, as well as the final boiling point of jet fuel.},

Specifically, a two-branch architecture is designed to extract spatial and frequency features. To realize the interaction and communication of spatial and frequency information, the cross-modality interaction module is designed to explore the inter-modality correlation by applying across self-attention. Subsequently, a multi-scale feature enhancement module is introduced in the spatial branch to enhance the texture and semantic information of spatial features, improving the robustness of tackling image post-processing operations. In addition, to exploit the complementary relationship between the spatial and frequency features, an adaptive fusion module is designed to establish forged feature dependencies by leveraging spatial self-attention, while learning discriminative feature representations by fusing spatial and frequency features in an adaptive weighted manner. Extensive experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for intra-dataset, cross-dataset, and perturbed dataset evaluations.},

This paper focuses on the contribution of artificial intelligence in optimizing the deployment of UAV swarms for multi-objective target detection applications in sixth-generation networks. Specifically, the artificial intelligence contribution lies in the development of an improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization (IMOPSO) algorithm for solving a complex multi-objective deployment problem. The problem aims to simultaneously optimize communication rate, sensing quality, and energy consumption in the deployment of UAV swarms. To address this, the proposed IMOPSO incorporates chaotic initialization, Lévy flight mutation, dynamic mutation rate, and an elimination mechanism based on opposition-based learning. These innovations are designed to enhance the algorithm’s ability to explore the solution space effectively, overcome premature convergence to local solutions, and improve solution quality. In terms of engineering applications, the IMOPSO is applied to the deployment of UAV swarms for target detection, demonstrating its ability to enhance communication and sensing performance while reducing energy consumption in practical scenarios. Through extensive simulations, we show that the IMOPSO outperforms traditional optimization methods and other baseline algorithms, achieving superior results across all optimization objectives. Specifically, the IMOPSO achieves approximately 5% higher transmission data rate, 9% better sensing quality, and 19% lower energy consumption compared to baseline algorithms across multiple test scenarios. Furthermore, the solutions obtained are not only closer to the optimal front but also more concentrated, indicating higher-quality results.},

Existing deep learning-based SEI methods depend heavily on labeled data and fixed confidence thresholds for pseudo-labeling, which limits their effectiveness under label scarcity or open-set conditions. To overcome these issues, we propose a progressive semi-supervised learning (ProSSL) method for SEI that combines iterative clustering with contrastive learning to generate adaptive pseudo-labels. ProSSL introduces an “uncertain” class and employs a dual-constraint selector—prediction stability and class diversity—to suppress noisy pseudo-labels and ensure robust propagation. Experiments on the public real-world long range(LoRa) RF-fingerprint dataset show that ProSSL gains 2.90%–6.01% absolute accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines, reaching 96.48% accuracy with 90% labels and 59.88% with only 5% labels. While on the public automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast(ADS-B) Top-10 dataset, ProSSL achieves 84.40% accuracy with 5% labeled data and 99.40% accuracy with 90%labeled data, again outperforming all competing methods. Open-set evaluations further demonstrate that overall accuracy rises from 18.81% when only two classes are known to 62.25% when eight classes are known, confirming strong generalization to unseen emitters and validating ProSSL’s robustness and practicality in realistic wireless environments.},

However, current methods face challenges due to low imaging contrast, size disparities, and organ shape variability. Additionally, the manual annotation of computed tomography (CT) scans is labor-intensive and costly, limiting available labeled samples. To address these issues, we propose a consistency regularization-based network guided by anatomical structural relationships and global organ category representations, specifically designed for multi-organ segmentation using a limited number of annotated CT scan samples from pigs. Specifically, we designed the SpatialLink Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) module to extract anatomical structural information and capture dynamic spatial relationships between organs, thereby minimizing segmentation biases caused by organ shape variations. Moreover, we developed the Organ Category Coding module and Guidance module, which integrate consistency regularization and attention mechanisms, enabling the network to accurately extract global organ category representations during the decoding phase, even with a small number of labeled samples, significantly improving segmentation consistency across organs of different sizes. Additionally, We are the first to apply the Visual State Space block to multi-organ segmentation in pigs, using it to extract contextual information. Experiments on 60 pigs demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with significant improvements in segmentation accuracy for the gallbladder and bladder, including a 9.8% and 4.2% Dice score increase, respectively, and a 12.4% and 6.2% boost in Jaccard scores compared to compared with a selection of published methods.},

This technique can be employed to perform preventive maintenance of critical equipment in the industry in order to test the structural integrity of the facility. Several muography imaging algorithms based on machine learning methods are being developed in the recent years. These algorithms make exhaustive use of simulated data, usually using packages such as GEANT4 (GEometry ANd Tracking), that exhaustively simulate the detector, to produce training samples. This work presents a faster alternative for the generation of simulated samples based on generative adversarial neural networks. A speed up factor of 80 is observed with this system without any significant degradation of the quality of the simulation.},

  abstract     = {Regular and real-time monitoring of corrosion is crucial for ensuring structural safety and extending the service life of infrastructure. With the continuous development of advanced structural health monitoring technologies, intelligent corrosion detection has become an inevitable trend. This study addresses the issues of low accuracy, incomplete detail processing, and missed or false detections in complex scenarios in steel structure corrosion detection, as well as the challenges of high complexity and insufficient real-time performance in deep learning models. We propose a high-performance, lightweight, real-time corrosion detection model, Real-Time Detection Transformer for Corrosion (RT-DETR-Corrosion), based on knowledge distillation. By incorporating lightweight optimization on the RT-DETR-R18 baseline model and a hybrid knowledge distillation approach, the model significantly improves real-time performance and detection accuracy, meeting the application requirements for efficiency and precision in steel structure corrosion detection. Experimental results show that the model exhibits excellent optimization effects in terms of localization accuracy, classification accuracy, and position regression error on both the training and validation sets, while also demonstrating strong generalization ability. In extreme weather conditions (such as rain, fog, snow, and strong light) and complex scenarios (such as occlusion, blur, and low-light environments), the model maintains stable Precision, Recall, and mAP metrics, validating its reliability and applicability in diverse real-world engineering environments. Moreover, visualized heatmap analysis of detection results for different scenarios further confirms the model's precise attention to corrosion regions and its generalization ability, providing essential technical support for steel structure corrosion risk assessment and intelligent monitoring, with significant potential for engineering applications.},

Furthermore, the paper presents the structural form of arithmetic operations for the IVIFS with piecewise linear approximation and demonstrates the simplicity of these operations by an numerical example. In addition, we extend the findings on information measures for polygonal interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set pertaining to abstract functions that fulfill particular criteria. Furthermore, we delve into the transformation relationships among these information measures, from which a range of structural formats for information measures can be deduced based on functional expressions and transformation relationships.

Firstly, to comprehensively capture the feature information of two-dimensional space, the symmetrized dot pattern (SDP) is introduced to overcome the shortcomings of the ordinary images lack of physical meaning and the time-frequency distribution methods exhibit incomplete information representation, etc. Simultaneously, the amplitude and frequency information are intuitively expressed by a two-dimensional mirror snowflake symmetrized image (MSSI 2D ). Secondly, to overcome the shortcomings of single-scale and traditional coarse-graining, a two-dimensional refined composite multi-scale coarse-graining method is proposed, which improves the accuracy of feature extraction and reduces the calculation deviation. After that, a new feature extraction method namely two-dimensional refined composite multi-scale revised ensemble dispersion entropy (RCMREDE 2D ) is proposed, whose parameter stability and performance are explored through simulation analysis. The results demonstrate that the RCMREDE 2D exhibits excellent stability and anti-noise interference ability. Based on the advantages of RCMREDE 2D , a novel fault diagnosis method for rolling bearings is developed by integrating RCMREDE 2D and a firefly algorithm optimized support vector machine (FA-SVM) multi-fault classifier for pattern recognition. The proposed method is further validated through two measured bearing data sets and five comparative methods, and the results indicate that the RCMREDE 2D and FA-SVM achieve the highest recognition accuracy while demonstrating superior stability.},

However, deep neural networks exhibit a critical drop in performance due to catastrophic forgetting when they are required to learn new tasks incrementally. The more plastic the network is, the easier it can learn new tasks. Whereas, for continual semantic segmentation, it is more reliable to preserve the knowledge it has learned from previous tasks. Here, gated 0-1 Bernoulli variable is used as a regularization method to optimize performance by enhancing network sparsity. Then, the special case of gated 0-1 Bernoulli variable is applied in the replay-based method of continual semantic segmentation. Specifically, when the value of the sub-network sampling rate reaches 0.5, the network reaches the strongest stability. Finally, the gated 0-1 Bernoulli variable improves the network’s performance in complex scenarios and reduces cost under similar performance. Experimental results indicate that in using 100% samples for incremental training, the Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) of the old classes improves by up to 4.6% and 5.5% compared to the baseline at the end of the overall training in continual semantic segmentation scenarios 10-1 and 10-2. Furthermore, in using 60% samples for incremental training, the performance for the old tasks only drops by less than a percentage, while the time cost to complete the full setup decreases by 22%.},

  abstract     = {Activist video advertisements represent a strategic form of brand communication in which companies express their stance on social or environmental issues through emotionally driven storytelling and slogan-based narratives. Despite their growing prevalence, there is a notable lack of systematic and quantitative methods for evaluating their performance or comparing their effectiveness across competing brands. This research addresses that gap by proposing a comprehensive decision support system (DSS) designed to assess the performance of activist video advertisements in a structured and reproducible manner. The study introduces a novel hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework: the spherical cubic fuzzy (SCF)–Aczel-Alsina–ranking comparison (RANCOM)–method based on the removal effects of criteria (MEREC)–deviation-based pairwise assessment ratio technique (DEPART). This methodology integrates subjective weights obtained via SCF–RANCOM and objective weights derived through SCF–MEREC, with both sets of weights combined using SCF-based aggregation operators that incorporate Aczel-Alsina t-norm and t-conorm functions. Performance rankings are then generated using the SCF–DEPART method. To demonstrate the model's applicability, a real-world case study involving eight sustainability-oriented activist video advertisements released in Türkiye was conducted. Evaluations were based on input from ten domain experts across eleven criteria. The analysis identified “convincingness and credibility” as the most critical factor, with “The Voice of Nature” campaign achieving the highest performance rating. The model's robustness was confirmed through scenario-based sensitivity analyses, and its consistency was validated by benchmarking against thirteen alternative MCDM approaches. The findings offer meaningful implications for both academic research and advertising practice.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation systems. Conventional traffic flow prediction methods primarily rely on centralized training, which poses a risk of privacy leakage. Federated learning, a privacy-preserving framework to machine learning, enables distributed participants to jointly train a shared model without sharing local private data. However, traffic flow is typically collected from different devices and contains different temporal patterns, leading to non-independent and identically distributed. To address these challenges, we propose a traffic flow prediction method based on federated clustering with mutual knowledge distillation. We first perform temporal decomposition on the traffic flow data and use mutual learning with adaptive distillation loss to facilitate mutual knowledge transfer among local models during training. Then, we apply spectral clustering to cluster clients based on the cosine similarity of model parameters at the server and design a global model aggregation method to improve the performance of federated learning. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on two real-world traffic datasets, and the experiment results show significant improvements over traditional federated learning approaches and also outperform federated mutual learning. The results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively captures temporal information and mitigates the effect of non-independent and identically distributed issues.},

The supporting research database includes images, cyclic curve backbones, and geometric and mechanical characteristics of 253 RCSWs. Initially, the database is manually classified into shear, flexure, and shear-flexure failure modes based on observations of surface damage and the cyclic response of the wall. Subsequently, unsupervised clustering and supervised learning algorithms are employed to probabilistically quantify and predict the participation of flexural and shear modes in the overall seismic response of the walls, respectively. The unsupervised model, utilizing the K-means algorithm, identifies the primary failure modes of the walls, achieving over 90 % concordance with manual expert labeling. Based on the results of unsupervised clustering, a hybridity index is proposed to demonstrate the contributions of shear and flexure failure modes to the overall seismic response. Supervised learning is then used to predict hybridity indices from wall characteristics, with the Extremely Randomized Trees (Extra Trees) model achieving the best results based on a balanced evaluation of multiple performance metrics. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), a tool for exploring model sensitivity, highlights the aspect ratio as the key influencing factor on failure mode, in accordance with relevant structural engineering codes and standards. Implementation of the proposed framework in exploring the behaviors of four unseen case studies reveals a significant correlation between the predicted hybridity indices and observed damage, consistent with existing guidelines.},

  abstract     = {Existing Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) methods rely on features from a pre-trained backbone with a single-encoder structure, leading to initial features biased towards global or local preferences. This affects subsequent feature modeling and degrades COD performance. Some studies use modular or auxiliary flow structures to balance feature preferences but often focus only on interactions between hierarchical features or information flows, ignoring potential redundancy or noise within aggregated features. Therefore, we propose a novel dual-path multiple attention-guided feature interaction network (DMAFI-Net) for COD, which contains four main components: global and local features interaction module (GLFI), intra-feature interaction module (IFI), multi-scale feature enhancement module (MFE), and two decoders including neighbor connection decoder based feature aggregation (NFA) and refine decoder. Specifically, the GLFI is designed to implement the interaction and combination of global and local features, and the combined features will be sent to IFI to mine intra-feature information. Besides, the MFE is introduced to further enrich the extracted features obtained in the IFI. In the feature decoding stage, the NFA module utilizes neighbor connection decoder to fuse multi-scale features and ultimately generates a coarse prediction. Finally, the refine decoder leverages multiple attention modules to refine the initial prediction with the combined features as auxiliary cues and obtain the final camouflaged map. Extensive experiments on four COD benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework when compared to 24 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of five widely used evaluation metrics. Furthermore, the ablation studies show the effectiveness of main components of our DMAFI-Net.},

  abstract     = {As the application of speech-based depression detection systems expands, differences in cross-domain data distribution pose significant challenges. This paper proposes the framework of Time–Frequency Calibrated Transfer Learning (TFCTL). This framework first introduces Frequency-Delay Neural Network (FDNN), inspired by Time-Delay Neural Network (TDNN), extending the concept of temporal feature extraction using sliding windows and weight sharing from the time domain to the frequency domain. A multi-level information aggregation module then integrates features of varying abstraction levels from both time-delay and frequency-delay neural networks, balancing global and local speech information. Finally, TFCTL uses transfer learning to calibrate the distribution of the aggregated time–frequency embedding vectors, uncovering commonalities of depression features across different domains. Cross-speaker and cross-corpus experiments were conducted using the Chinese Multimodal Depression Corpus (CMDC) and the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus Wizard-of-Oz (DAIC-WOZ). In cross-speaker scenarios, TFCTL achieved F1 scores of 0.7324 on DAIC and 0.9660 on CMDC, outperforming other methods. In cross-corpus scenarios, TFCTL achieved F1 scores of 0.6743 on DAIC and 0.6879 on CMDC, demonstrating its robustness in addressing domain mismatch issues.

  abstract     = {In semiconductor engineering, high yield of wafers relies on accurate detection and classification of wafer defects. The dataset for detecting wafer defects presents three primary challenges: (i) different background types, (ii) variable image or defect scales, and (iii) imbalanced data with a long-tailed distribution of defect types. These challenges create significant limitations for traditional classification techniques. To address these issues, we propose a stratified framework called Wafer Detection and Classification (WaferDC), designed specifically for detecting and classifying wafer defects from scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Our framework achieves high defect detection performance on SEM wafer images by utilizing a multi-cluster memory bank, which effectively handles the challenges of (i) variable background types and (ii) differing image or defect scales. Building on this robust detection, we propose Segmentation and Mix (SegMix), a novel defect augmentation technique based on anomaly heatmaps, which enhances the reliability of defect detection and classification in a (iii) long-tailed imbalanced environment. Finally, we pass defect-classified images through a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based classifier (Shiet al., 2023) utilizing a vision transformer (ViT) architecture, further improving overall defect detection and classification performance. We rigorously tested WaferDC on a proprietary SEM wafer dataset and the public Describable Textures Dataset-Synthetic (DTD-Synthetic) and Magnetic Tile Defect (MTD) datasets. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method in improving defect detection and classification in wafer manufacturing. Our code is available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/WaferDC .},

  abstract     = {Generating obstacle-free trajectories for robotic manipulators in unstructured and cluttered environments remains a significant challenge. Existing motion planning methods often require additional computational effort to generate the final trajectory by solving kinematic or dynamic equations. This paper highlights the strong potential of model-free reinforcement learning methods over model-based approaches for obstacle-free trajectory planning in joint space. We propose a fast trajectory planning system for manipulators that combines vision-based path planning in task space with reinforcement learning-based obstacle avoidance in joint space. We divide the framework into two key components. The first introduces an innovative vision-based trajectory planner in task space, leveraging the large-scale fast segment anything (FSA) model in conjunction with basis spline (B-spline)-optimized kinodynamic path searching. The second component enhances the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm by integrating action ensembles (AE) and policy feedback (PF), which greatly improve precision and stability in goal-reaching and obstacle avoidance within joint space. These proximal policy optimization (PPO) enhancements increase the algorithm’s adaptability across diverse robotic tasks, ensuring consistent execution of commands from the first component by the manipulator, while also enhancing both obstacle avoidance efficiency and reaching accuracy. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of proximal policy optimization (PPO) enhancements, as well as simulation-to-simulation (Sim-to-Sim) and simulation-to-reality (Sim-to-Real) transfer, in improving model robustness and planner efficiency in complex scenarios. These enhancements allowed the robot to perform obstacle avoidance and real-time trajectory planning in obstructed environments. https://sites.google.com/view/ftp4rm/home},

  abstract     = {Given the urgency, timeliness and uncertainty of power batteries recycling, we extend a novel network model for retired battery recycling systems, bi-level capacitated location-routing problem with time windows for heterogeneous battery mixed-load (CLRPTW-HBM). Firstly, the expected interval and linear weighting methods are used to transform and process the lower-level multi-objective function that contains fuzzy variables. Secondly, a Transformer-based improved deep reinforcement learning algorithm (Transformer-IDRL) is proposed. (1) The bi-level CLRPTW-HBM is modeled as Markov decision process, and a policy network model with dual-layer encoder-decoder structure is designed based on Transformer architecture. (2) Randomly generate instance data, and the asynchronous advantage Actor-Critic with adaptive dynamic parameter tuning strategy is employed for training. (3) The action sampling strategy based on roulette reverse selection mechanism, and local search strategy incorporating problem characteristics are introduced to improve solution quality. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets and actual cases, and the results demonstrate superior performance of Transformer-IDRL, with an average Gap of 0.22 % and 0.19 %, a 5.30 % reduction in recycling cost, and a 6.06 % reduction in battery exposure risk. These satisfactory results highlight the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed model and method. Additionally, sensitivity analysis of model parameters shows that under different decision-maker preferences and vehicle loading capacity, the sensitivity range of path cost is [5.77 %, 39.85 %] and [16.04 %, 35.54 %], while that of exposure risk is [1.40 %, 3.39 %] and [1.35 %, 5.54 %], indicating that parameter variations significant influence the layout of recycling network and overall path cost. Therefore, decision-makers should flexibly adjust key parameters to balance economic benefits and sustainable development in battery recycling.},

This methodology is designed to evaluate offsite energy consumption of robotized workstations for different layouts characterized by relative position of the robot with respect to the serviced and fly-by points. This is important both for offline virtual commissioning of robotized workstations (determine layout) and for online operation for maintenance purposes (determine energy spikes different from normal model). The analyzed operation is the linear motion of the robot Tool Control Point in Cartesian space, characterized by the complexity of the kinematic model: each joint operates in coordinated motion, adjusting its velocity and acceleration continuously to ensure a straight path with constant speed. A custom Internet of things (IoT) device enables synchronized energy and motion data logging for robots, ensuring consistent values for sampled trajectories.

  abstract     = {Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are among the most energy-intensive components of urban infrastructure and bear strict regulatory responsibilities for wastewater quality. These dual challenges, minimizing energy consumption and maintaining environmental compliance, are deeply interrelated and must be managed simultaneously to achieve sustainable plant operation. This study proposes a framework that comprises two customized components. The first component employs a voting ensemble model based on transformer architecture to predict energy consumption. It processes heterogeneous feature domains — including hydraulic, wastewater, and climatic variables — through parallel attention-driven streams. The outputs from these streams are then aggregated using a weighted voting mechanism to produce the final prediction. Second, a multitask Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) forecasts wastewater quality indicators concurrently (ammonia, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)), capturing shared temporal dependencies and reducing model complexity. A hybrid preprocessing strategy is applied, incorporating domain-aware outlier detection (z-score and Interquartile Range (IQR)), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation, and feature selection using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Experimental results showed that. The voting ensemble model achieved the best results for energy consumption prediction with 31.61 of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The multitask Bi-GRU achieved the best results for wastewater quality indicators with RMSE at 6.1689, 48.0323, and 88.2214 for ammonia, BOD, and COD, respectively. This work is among the first to integrate transformer ensembles and multitask learning in a unified WWTP forecasting system. Simultaneously addressing energy efficiency and water quality assurance, this offers a practical, scalable, and intelligent decision-support tool for sustainable wastewater management.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to address the problem of efficient extraction of complete multi-scale information for supervised monocular depth estimation. Most of the existing depth estimation methods are based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). By gradually exploring the contextual and semantic features, they have achieved good results in scene depth estimation. However, with the expansion of the receptive field, global information limited by the local induction bias is gradually suppressed, resulting in the performance cannot be further improved. Recently, Transformer-based methods have been widely used to model the global correlation between features. Nevertheless, since the Transformer networks are not spatially aware enough, they usually lose local details and have no clear mechanism for reusing features when processing images. The Transformer networks perform self-attention mechanism at each location and cannot directly obtain information from other locations for features. Therefore, we propose a novel dual framework called as Transformer-CNN, which includes the Transformer-branch and the CNN-branch for monocular depth estimation. Specifically, the Transformer-branch is able to model the global contextual information and the CNN-branch can capture local spatial relationships in images. However, simply fusing these two independent branches may result in insufficient feature aggregation. To this end, we design a Parallel Feature Interaction Module (PFIM), which contains a Self-Attention Module (SAM) and a Cross-Attention Module (CAM), so as to highlight features from the Transformer-branch and the CNN-branch respectively and extract complementary information between the two branches. Meanwhile, in order to make full use of the low-level features with low quality in the scene, we propose a Low-level Information Acquisition Module (LIAM) to capture texture-related information and preserve texture details in the CNN-branch. Finally, to address the lack of multi-scale contextual information in Vision Transformer (ViT), we introduce a Wide Area Multi-scale Decoder (WAMD), which incorporates the multi-scale feature representations into the decoder part via a Wide Area Attention (WAA). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets collected in the outdoor and indoor environments demonstrate the competitive results of the proposed method, compared with the state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods.},

The main motivation was the recognition that such an approach can support the development of novel neural modeling and the optimal determination of damper parameters in terms of mechanical vibration attenuation. The training data were obtained using a theoretical model validated experimentally. The optimally selected MLP was compared with other regression models using 10 different metrics. A hyperparameter tuning of the determined neural network architecture was conducted based on the input parameters such as excitation amplitude, grain mass, and ATPID damper height. The analyses show that the proposed neural network could quickly and accurately estimate the system’s vibration amplitude and efficiently predict the optimal damper height. The ability to effectively determine the correct optimal height is crucial for ATPID damper control. The high efficiency in predicting the system’s vibration amplitude allows for the replacement of the theoretical model with applied time-consuming contact forces. The MLP accurately estimated vibration amplitudes with 1%–10% error for interpolated data and up to 15% for extrapolated cases. The issue raised is particularly important from the perspective of real-time damper control. It was found that computing a single case using the artificial neural network is more than ten times faster compared to the theoretical model. Therefore, the proposed ATPID damper model based on a neural network forms the basis for further considerations and scientific research to finally propose a control algorithm in the future.},

However, the challenges posed by the oversimplified multimodal feature fusion mechanism and the failure to account for the relative positional relationship between emotions and causes still hinder the performance of MECPEC. In this study, we propose an adaptive hybrid machine reading comprehension (AHMRC) framework to extract potential emotion-cause pairs inherent in conversations. The MECPEC task is first transformed into a two-round hybrid machine reading comprehension task that sequentially enforces the global emotion query and the local cause query with the goal of exploring the relative position constraint specific to conversations. Subsequently, an adaptive multimodal attention module is designed by incorporating features extracted from text, video, and audio modalities, and adaptively fusing them according to their contributions.

  abstract     = {Theoretical and computational modelling of heat conduction in a functionally graded cylinder has been rigorously investigated in prior studies, owing to its critical significance in high-stakes engineering applications such as nuclear reactor design, aerospace structural systems, and pressure vessel technology. Despite this extensive body of work, the majority of these studies have mostly focused on simplified two-dimensional models, frequently presuming idealized thermal parameters such as isotropic thermal conductivity, constant convection coefficients, and spatially uniform ambient temperatures. These simplifications overlook the crucial role of spatially varying thermal characteristics and three-dimensional (3D) temperature distributions, which are essential for accurately simulating the complex heat conduction behaviors found in real-world engineering. Unlike prior research, this study presents an analytical solution for heat conduction under non-homogeneous generalized Robin boundary conditions, capturing 3D thermal conductivity inhomogeneities along three orthogonal directions using Sturm-Liouville theory and finite integral transforms. However, while such analytical methods are highly accurate for simpler geometries, they often encounter significant challenges when extended to scenarios involving complex material gradients and irregular domains. A gradient-enhanced physics-informed neural network (g-PINN) framework is proposed to tackle these challenges, utilizing neural networks that incorporate physical laws and gradient information to enhance its applicability to complex configurations. This combined approach presents a novel framework that integrates classical theory with machine learning, facilitating precise modelling of thermal phenomena in functionally graded cylinders. The findings indicate that both the analytical and machine learning approaches (g-PINN) align closely with presented solutions, precisely capturing the energy equation and more complex boundary conditions.},

  abstract     = {Spurious drug–drug interactions arising from experimental biases can compromise treatment safety and hinder effective clinical decision-making for patients. However, current molecular representation learning methods still face significant challenges in addressing this problem. First, most graph neural network-based approaches consider only single-direction interactive semantic extraction between drug molecules, failing to capture more granular relationships between drugs fully. Moreover, during training, they are vulnerable to noise from negative sampling and cannot sufficiently leverage the complete drug–drug interaction annotations, resulting in reduced robustness and accuracy in downstream tasks. To this end, we propose a robust spurious DDI detection framework that employs chi-square-guided bidirectional attention to capture fine-grained and bidirectional interaction patterns. First, considering their mutual information flow, a two-way cross-attention mechanism is introduced for a more granular extraction of cross-drug molecular interaction semantic representations through bidirectionally perceiving interactive features between drugs. Second, on the basis of robust minimum covariance determinant theory, we propose a chi-square distribution-based spurious detection method to approximate the correctly annotated drug–drug interactive feature space to a chi-square distribution for a complete feature representation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets further validate our method’s effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in noisy interference scenarios.

Recently, methods based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) downstream tasks. However, due to significant deviations between the original and perturbed texts, these methods struggle to achieve satisfactory results in defending against textual adversarial attacks, especially in Chinese, which has unique syntactic structures. To address this issue, we propose a domain adaptation method for defending against Chinese textual adversarial attacks through a prompt-tuning model, which effectively mitigates the discrepancy between different domains. Specifically, the original and perturbed texts are treated as the source and target domains, respectively, with the textual adversarial defense task framed as a cross-domain classification problem. The soft prompt-tuning model trained in the source domain is iteratively adapted to uncover the true label information in the target domain. The graph attention network is incorporated to integrate Chinese syntactic structure information with semantic features. Through a voting mechanism on predicted labels generated by the iterative model, soft prompt-tuning is further optimized for cross-domain classification tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our method in Chinese textual adversarial defense tasks compared to baseline methods, including the state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches for PLMs and LLMs.},

  abstract     = {Rumors spreading on social media platforms result in potential damages. A precise rumor detection mechanism can help form a healthy public opinion environment. In recent years, deep learning-based rumor detection methods, especially graph model-based ones, have risen and reached promising performance. However, there are several defects in existing methods, which limit models from efficiently utilizing the propagation structure. In this paper, we propose a novel rumor detection model, which has high accuracy and reaches state-of-the-art performance. First, we design a powerful comprehensive rumor feature extractor that explicitly overcomes the restriction of previous Graph Neural Networks-based models. Then, by introducing Kernel Subtree features, our model acquires the capability to learn crucial local features from important nodes. Comparative experiments performed on two real-world social media platforms demonstrate that our work reaches state-of-the-art performance, which outperforms the best baseline with 1.6% and 1.9% in accuracy respectively.},

  abstract     = {Dependable stock price predictions are vital for optimizing economic policies and investment strategies in both national and corporate settings. However, the intrinsic volatility and intricacy of stock prices pose considerable challenges. Thus, this paper introduces a novel Committee of Multi-scale Nonlinear Learning Frameworks (CoML) that employs a three-stage model: decomposition, reconstruction, and prediction. First, a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise is adopted to decompose the original stock prices into multiple intrinsic mode functions. Secondly, a fine-to-coarse algorithm is applied to reconstruct the intrinsic mode functions, so as to effectively extract short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Finally, an ensemble of nonlinear models including bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), support vector regression (SVR) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used to learn and forecast features extracted to obtain high performance. Experimental results indicate that the model performs exceptionally well in both emerging and developed markets highlighting the innovative capabilities of CoML in highly complex and volatile financial markets. The proposed model is further validated using Model Confidence Set and the results indicate that the model is statistically significant.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle with performance issues when datasets are affected by label noise or annotation errors, commonly introduced during manual process or lack of proficiency. These noisy annotations disrupt the loss function, leading to "partially incorrect" gradients that impair the model's learning and overall performance. Additionally, the limited availability of scanned data for training often makes it challenging to develop a robust model. A common approach to address this issue is to leverage similar large annotated datasets. However, differences in dataset distributions can also lead to inconsistencies, introducing erroneous gradients during training and further impacting model performance. To address these challenges, we propose MGR-DAS (Meta-Gradient Reweighting via Direction-Aware Similarity), a novel meta-learning-based approach that can automatically evaluate the reliability of training samples during training using a small, clean subset easily curated from the noisy dataset. Our method quantifies reliability by measuring the cosine similarity between the gradients of noisy training samples and those of the clean subset. Samples with higher gradient alignment are assigned greater weights during training, effectively reducing the impact of noisy labels and improving model robustness. We evaluate our method using three standard metrics for medical image segmentation: the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), the 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), and Intersection over Union (IoU). The proposed MGR-DAS achieved an overall 2.4 % improvement in the DSC on the brain tumor segmentation (BraTS, 2021) dataset. Remarkably, even with only 10 clean annotations used in the reweighting algorithm, our method yielded a 28.7 % gain in DSC. In real-world, data-scarce scenarios, our proposed MGR-DAS also improved the overall DSC score by 2.6 % on BraTS pediatric (BraTS-PEDs) and by 1.0 % on BraTS-Africa, demonstrating strong generalizability and robustness. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method reliably identifies noisy data, prioritizes clean data through adaptive weighting, and outperforms existing fine-tuning, curriculum learning techniques, and other meta-learning frameworks commonly employed in classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) has shown considerable success in the field of industrial process fault detection. Nonetheless, due to its unsupervised nature, SFA relies solely on the normal training data and overlooks the incorporation of prior process knowledge, which consequently diminishes its efficacy in early fault detection. To mitigate this limitation, this paper introduces the concept of Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and proposes an improved SFA approach, referred to as ZSL-SFA. This novel method leverages fault semantic representations as auxiliary knowledge to enhance fault detection sensitivity in industrial process monitoring. The ZSL-SFA framework implements a dual-model collaborative monitoring system: (1) a primary SFA model is developed using normal operational data to capture the dynamic characteristics of the process; and (2) a semantic encoding mechanism, grounded in expert knowledge, is devised to build the auxiliary model, where a probabilistic attribute learner adaptively extracts semantic information from fault attribute descriptions, facilitating effective fault knowledge transfer through similarity analysis. The monitoring outcomes from both the primary and auxiliary models are integrated using a Bayesian fusion strategy, culminating in a comprehensive ZSL-SFA monitoring system. The main advantage of this method is its ability to fully exploit prior process knowledge to enhance the basic SFA model without the need for additional labeled fault samples. Experimental validations on the Tennessee-Eastman process simulation platform are performed to indicate that the proposed ZSL-SFA method surpasses the basic SFA method in terms of fault detection performance.},

  abstract     = {T-cell receptor sequences (TCR-seq) are closely related to cancers, and in particular, cancer-related TCR-seq are crucial in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Current prediction methods for cancer-related TCR-seq often focus solely on the sequence structure, neglecting its spatial structure. Therefore, we propose a multimodal deep learning method based on parallel and residual structures (MDPR) for the detection of cancer-related TCR-seq. MDPR can effectively integrate the spatial and sequence structure of TCR-seq for accurately identifying cancer-related sequences. First, we introduce a TCR-seq encoding method based on atomic three-dimensional spatial coordinates, allowing for more effective extraction of the spatial structural features of TCR-seq. Second, we use high-dimensional word vectors instead of the amino acid feature vectors traditionally used by other researchers. Third, we pretrain the spatial feature extraction module and then conduct joint training with the sequence feature extraction module. This approach allows the model to better consider the relationship between the two modalities, thereby improving prediction accuracy. Finally, MDPR achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.971 after ten rounds of three-fold cross-validation on the dataset. The AUC of MDPR is 5% higher than that of the previous best method. In short, we propose an artificial intelligence method called MDPR, and apply it to the biomedical field. MDPR can be obtained from https://github.com/biomg/MDPR .},

  abstract     = {Human activity recognition (HAR) is a significant application for wearable devices, which primarily identifies current human activities by analyzing sequential sensor data. The real-time data recording of wearable devices enables the collection of vast amount of unlabeled data. Utilizing this data for self-supervised contrastive pre-training of HAR models presents a feasible solution to the decline in recognition performance due to limited labeled data. However, traditional contrastive learning frameworks are primarily designed based on positive and negative sample pairs in the image domain. The relatively simple sequence data of HAR is prone to generating incorrect negative pairs, thus pre-training HAR models solely in this manner is unsatisfactory. Given the phenomena described above, this paper proposes an Instance Prediction and Clustering Self-supervised Contrastive Learning Framework (IPCSC) for HAR, considering the characteristics of human activity data. IPCSC circumvents negative sample pairs, instead extracting contrastive information at the instance perspective by prediction tasks among various augmented views of samples and integrating clustering concepts for contrastive learning from a holistic perspective. The primary objective is to enable the model to discern critical information within human activity data and distinguishable features between different activities, thereby improving the model’s pre-training efficacy and enhancing its downstream activity recognition performance. Numerous experimental analyses demonstrate that IPCSC outperforms other self-supervised methods, achieving an average F1-Score performance improvement of 5.65%, 4.11%, and 7.99% over supervised baselines on the UCI-HAR, MobiAct, and MotionSense datasets, respectively, with only 1% of the labeled data.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) consist of factual triples that describe relations between entities in the real world. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims to map entities and relations into constantly low-dimensional vectors, which is important for lots of downstream tasks (e.g., KG completion and information retrieval). Current KGE methods primarily rely on explicit structural patterns, neglecting latent contextual semantics behind those structures and resulting in sub-optimal performance. While some methods incorporate additional data (e.g., textual descriptions), such dependencies limit applicability due to additional data requirements. Furthermore, most KGE models suffer from limited supervision with sparse labeled triples, restricting their capacity to learn comprehensive semantic features. Inspired by the simple but effective self-supervised language model word2vec, one interesting question is: Can KGE be performed as a simple self-supervised language model ? To achieve this, we innovatively propose a self-supervised KGE framework that learns entity and relation embeddings by adapting word2vec’s skip-gram objective to path sequences extracted from KGs. Our framework employs separate embedding spaces for entities and relations with an entity-relation mapping mechanism for effective interaction between the two embedding spaces. Further, to enhance the training efficiency, we introduce a markov chain-based negative sampling strategy, which generates semantically meaningful negative samples by preserving the structural contexts along KG paths. Our framework, which is the first attempt to follow the context-based self-supervised idea of language models to conduct KGE tasks, addresses the constraints of label-dependent supervised KGE techniques and obviates the requirement for external information, while simultaneously enabling effective extraction of the implicit contextual semantics inherent in triple structures. Experiments on two widely-used KGE datasets show state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating our framework’s ability to learn semantically rich representations solely from graph structure.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology is widely used in cell type identification and disease research, but its data often contain a large number of missing values and zero values due to technical limitations and biological differences. These zero values not only affect downstream analysis, but also make it difficult to distinguish technical zero values from biological zero values. Therefore, this paper proposes a scRNA-seq data interpolation method (sc-MKNMF) based on non-negative matrix factorization and multi-kernel similarity network fusion for the first time. This method improves the accuracy of cell clustering by accurately filling some zero values. First, sc-MKNMF uses gene-cell dual-level analysis to distinguish technical zero values from biological zero values, and then calculates the similarity network of multi-kernel fusion of genes and cells respectively. Then, this method uses non-negative matrix factorization combined with similarity network to construct the objective function, and introduces sparse regularization terms to ensure the similarity between genes and cells and improve stability. In addition, sc-MKNMF is also equipped with an efficient optimization algorithm to promote its convergence by continuously updating the objective function. Finally, the verification and comparative experiments on 12 scRNA-seq datasets show that the sc-MKNMF method outperforms other advanced data interpolation methods. In addition, the extension of sc-MKNMF to the two tasks of cell trajectory inference and differentially expressed gene analysis showed significant improvement and excellent versatility.},

  abstract     = {Cercospora leaf spot (CLS) is a widespread disease that seriously threatens beet yield and sugar quality. Timely detection enables farmers to take early control measures and reduce economic losses. Although artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods are replacing manual inspection in agriculture, CLS detection in complex field environments remains highly challenging due to subtle early-stage symptoms and severe occlusions caused by overlapping leaves and weeds. To address these challenges, this paper presents Cercospora Leaf Spot–You Only Look Once (CLS–YOLO), an enhanced detection model built upon You Only Look Once version 11 (YOLOv11), incorporating novel modules specifically designed for accurate CLS detection under challenging field conditions. To improve the detection of weak and early-stage symptoms, we design the Multi-Scale Large Kernel Decomposition (MSLKD) module, which enhances feature extraction for subtle lesions. Furthermore, we develop the Spatial-Channel Interaction Attention (SCIA) module to mitigate detection errors arising from occlusion and fragmented disease patterns by refining multi-scale feature representations. Experimental results demonstrate CLS–YOLO achieves superior performance, reaching an mAP@0.5 of 73.6% ± 0.2% and an mAP@0.5:0.95 of 40.6% ± 0.3% over five independent runs, outperforming twelve mainstream object detection algorithms while maintaining lightweight efficiency. To validate generalization capability across scenarios, crops, and diseases, we conducted comparative experiments on two public crop disease datasets, where our method achieved superior overall performance. In summary, this study provides an effective AI-driven solution for precise crop disease detection, contributing to the practical advancement of intelligent agriculture.},

  abstract     = {Skin cancer, particularly melanoma, is one of the most aggressive and deadly forms of cancer with its incidence rising globally. Early detection is crucial for improving survival rates, but the traditional dermatoscopy method is a highly time-consuming and subjective process. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel Feature-Enhanced Edge-INverse attention network (FEEINnet) model that helps to segment the skin lesion region more accurately. FEEINnet consists of three sub-networks: Feature Enhanced Mechanism (FEM) learns and extracts the fine-grained enhanced features from informative channels, the Edge Attention Mechanism (EAM) helps to precisely identify the edges of the lesion region and the INverse Attention Mechanism (INAM) generates inverse attention maps which emphasize the less confident or ambiguous regions thereby increasing the segmentation accuracy iteratively. These three sub-networks collectively help to improve feature extraction, enhance boundary detection, and refine segmentation maps, even in challenging scenarios with varying lesion sizes, shapes and pigmentation. FEEINnet consistently outperforms existing models, achieving a F1-score of 95.55%, 95.53%, and 94.52%; Intersection over Union (IoU) of 92.76%, 92.43%, and 91.34%; and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 94.63%, 93.51%, and 91.85% on the Human Against Machine 10000 (HAM10000), Pedro Hispano Hospital ( P H 2 ), and International Skin Imaging Collaboration 2018 (ISIC2018) datasets, respectively.

  abstract     = {Fault-free functioning of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems is essential for reducing energy waste in modern-day buildings. Hence, data-driven approaches for HVAC fault detection have gained popularity. Faults become more severe with time. Fault detection reveals the presence of an anomaly, but it does not convey how critical the fault severity is. Fault severity indication provides this essential context, enabling urgent resource allocation to more severe faults, adding practical significance. However, faults being rare, obtaining substantial data at different severity levels to train supervised Machine Learning models is a realistic challenge. Therefore, we propose a method for estimating fault severity in an unsupervised setting. We define a robust Severity Indicator (SI) that reflects the shift in the severity levels of a fault. First, we define a healthy domain boundary for fault-free data using One-Class Support Vector Machines. SI scores are then computed using a novel adaptive feature weighing algorithm that assigns weights to individual features, adaptively, for every fault. We focus on detecting the shift in severity, rather than quantifying it. The study of the robustness of SI for different faults in HVAC subsystems, chillers, and air handling units (AHUs) yields consistently promising results. Our comparative analysis shows that our method outperforms the unweighted approach and existing state-of-the-art techniques for fault severity estimation. Notably, our method excels in detecting low-severity faults, addressing a common limitation in current methods.},

  abstract     = {Accurate detection of ore size is crucial in mineral processing, directly impacting equipment efficiency and product quality. However, traditional anchor-based models often struggle with the irregular shapes and varying scales of ore particles, resulting in limited performance. To overcome these challenges, an anchor-free detection framework was proposed. It incorporates a cross-stage partial bottleneck and a spatial pyramid pooling cross-stage partial connections (SPPCSCP-DualConv), both enhanced with dual convolution, to improve feature extraction and multi-scale fusion. In the backbone, the dual convolution module combines group convolution with heterogeneous convolution to improve feature diversity. The SPPCSCP-DualConv module further enhances feature representation in complex backgrounds. Additionally, a simplified path aggregation network (simPANet) feature fusion module is employed in the neck to refine the integration of multi-scale features. The proposed model was trained using a combination of binary cross-entropy, complete intersection over union (IoU), and distribution focal loss to optimize detection accuracy. The proposed model achieved a mean average precision of 86.80 % at an IoU threshold of .5 and 78.50 % across IoU thresholds from .5 to .95, surpassing existing methods while maintaining a lightweight architecture with only 10.10 million parameters and 89.45 giga floating point operations per second. Ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of the simPANet and SPPCSPC-DualConv modules in enhancing feature representation. Generalization tests across mining sites with similar distributions demonstrated strong performance, although limitations remain for exceptionally large ore blocks due to dataset bias. The proposed model significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ore particle size detection, providing reliable real-time insights to improve grinding control and mineral processing operations.},

  abstract     = {Failures in propulsion components, such as propellers, can critically affect flight safety; thus, early failure detection, preferably before flight, is essential. Traditional fault-diagnosis methods typically rely on additional sensors or operational data, which may not be available or practical in all situations. This study addresses these challenges by introducing motor-electric-signal-based fault diagnosis that is independent of airframe configuration and can detect faults, even when the aircraft is not in operation. However, difficulties arise owing to poor class variance in motor-electric-signal data and the challenge of obtaining fault data. To overcome these issues, a semi-supervised learning model based on a modified variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN) is proposed, which predicts faults using only normal motor-electric-signal data. Additionally, a new preprocessing method and patch-based ensemble inference technique are introduced to improve the poor class-variance characteristics of the data, thereby enhancing the prediction performance. This work demonstrates that propeller faults can be successfully diagnosed using motor-electric signals without the need for additional sensors or fault-data acquisition.},

To address these issues, a lightweight network via multi-dimension boundary perception and guidance is proposed for precise segmentation of wood defects. At first, based on the Segformer, a boundary prediction branch is added to enrich detailed boundary information in the encoder, and supervised by the Gaussian signal and cosine similarity, to balance the effect of the boundary gradient information. Then, a double-flow enhancing module is designed to integrate the adjacent level features, by embedding two enhancing paths, to adaptively generate discriminative information of the defects. Finally, a binary segmentation head following the predicted map is introduced to strengthen the penalty for the false prediction results of the boundary. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts on our wood surface defect dataset, as well as on three public datasets.},

Typically, the measurements are obtained in a single two-dimensional (2D) plane (a “slice”) by a sequential scanning geometry. The data from each slice alone does not carry sufficient information for a three-dimensional tomographic reconstruction in which biological features of interest in the log are well preserved. In the present work, we propose a learned iterative reconstruction method based on the Learned Primal-Dual neural network, suited for sequential scanning geometries. Our method accumulates information between neighbouring slices, instead of only accounting for single slices during reconstruction. Evaluations were performed by training U-Nets on segmentation of knots (branches), which are crucial features in wood processing. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that with as few as five source positions our method yields reconstructions of logs that are sufficiently accurate to identify biological features like knots (branches), heartwood and sapwood.},

  abstract     = {The hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HFSP) is a prominent challenge in advanced manufacturing systems. Existing research often overlooks the impact of workers in production shops or treats worker fatigue as a static parameter, failing to capture its nonlinear accumulation and recovery effects on processing efficiency. However, with the advent of Industry 5.0, there has been a growing emphasis on the critical role of human factors in production scheduling. As a result, designing an effective algorithm for HFSP that considers human factors has become a prominent research focus. In this paper, an extended distributed heterogeneous hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with the dynamic effects of worker fatigue (DHHFSP-WF) is investigated. To address this problem, a Deep Q-Network-based multi-objective optimization algorithm (DQNMOEA) is designed to minimize makespan, total energy consumption (TEC), and total worker idle time (WIT). In DQNMOEA, a four-dimensional vector encoding scheme considering worker allocation represents solution, and a reconstruction strategy ensures initial population quality and diversity. Moreover, an improved order crossover, two-point crossover, and a segment-based recombination mutation method are proposed to enhance the global search performance of the algorithm. Then, a problem-specific local search strategy is designed for each layer of the vector, allowing the Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based adaptive decision-making mechanism to perform local perturbations on the current non-dominated solutions in the most suitable dimensions. Finally, seven algorithms are adopted to make a comparison on 36 sets of instances, the experimental results indicate that DQNMOEA exhibits competitive performance in solving DHHFSP-WF.},

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Angle-Enhanced You Only Look Once (AE-YOLO) model achieves a mAP50:95 of 94.0 % and an angle prediction accuracy of 94.3 %. In addition, a temperature extraction module based on the OBBs is developed to accurately derive the temperature profile of the insulator core rod. This method significantly enhances the intelligence level of infrared image analysis for composite insulators and provides technical support for condition assessment and fault prediction in power transmission lines.},

To address the issue of inaccurate estimation of vehicle state parameters resulting from yaw rate sensor failures, this study proposes a three-mode collaborative fault-tolerant state estimation method based on Bayesian Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) kinematics-dynamics fusion. First, the kinematics-based method is established using the kinematics model. Second, the dynamics-based method is designed by integrating the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) with the dynamics model. Subsequently, a BiLSTM network fusion model based on Bayesian optimization is presented. The model utilizes estimates from kinematic and kinetic methods as a priori inputs and combines the bidirectional information capturing capability of BiLSTM with hyperparameter tuning from Bayesian optimization. The results indicate that when the yaw rate sensor fails, the proposed method achieves an average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0276 km per hour (km/h) for longitudinal speed, 0.0008 radian (rad) for side slip angle, and 0.0072 radian per second (rad/s) for yaw rate across all scenarios. This performance demonstrates a superiority over various maneuvers.

In particular, binary diffing is an essential technique for uncovering vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors in industrial control systems, where patch deployment is complicated by closed and restricted environments. Studies on binary diffing can be broadly categorized into dynamic analysis-based, static analysis-based, and neural network-based approaches. Each category of existing studies has its shortcomings, including limited coverage, low accuracy, and issues with on-demand learning. In this paper, we propose the binary diffing with sampling-and-aggregate, a hierarchical binary diffing model that generates inductive code representations based on graph sampling-and-aggregate. Our model sequentially produces instruction-level embedding, block-level embedding, and function-level embedding from the inter-procedural control flow graph of a given program, and then performs hierarchical code diffing based on these embeddings. We formally define the detailed models and present the algorithm of hierarchical binary diffing. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis of this algorithm, deriving several advantages. We implemented a prototype and evaluated it on a large-scale dataset in a cross-version, cross-optimization, and obfuscation settings. Our prototype showed F1-scores up to 0.96 and 0.968 in cross-version setting for function and basic block diffing, respectively. Also, our method demonstrated its robustness over several binary obfuscations. In conclusion, our proposal, which generates basic block- and function-level embedding by considering the control flow, has solid advantages on binary diffing and shows the robustness on the binary tampering.},

These methods lack systematic optimization for fine-grained knowledge level representation, making it difficult to fully reflect students’ true learning status. To address this, this paper introduces a Plug-and-Play F ine Grained N eural C ognitive D iagnosis Framework (FNCD) with Knowledge-Level Constraint Awareness . The framework combines a knowledge proficiency evaluation module with students’ answer records and a Q-matrix to statically assess knowledge mastery.

Additionally, it employs a multi-scale relational learning strategy and a Top-k attention-enhanced graph network mechanism to dynamically adjust the student similarity relationship network, accurately modeling the complex learning relationships between students. Ultimately, a joint training mechanism is used to optimize the outputs of each module, significantly improving the rationality, interpretability, and accuracy of CD. The experimental results demonstrate that FNCD, as an artificial intelligence-driven plug-and-play module, can be effectively integrated into existing CD models to enhance the modeling of fine-grained knowledge mastery and improve diagnostic accuracy, showcasing the application potential of artificial intelligence in personalized education.},

However, we find that the inadequacy of distilled information from the detector head during the alignment process inevitably constrains the performance of recent distillation-based OVD strategies. To this end, we propose Neighboring Region Attention Alignment (NRAA), which performs alignment within the attention mechanism to boost the open-vocabulary inference. Specifically, for a given proposal region, we randomly explore the neighboring boxes to capture the surrounding contextual vocabulary knowledge. Then, a set of regional token features, encompassing both the proposal and neighboring regions, utilize our proposed Neighboring Region Attention (NRA) to extract interaction information. Finally, this information is seamlessly provided to the distillation procedure to assist the alignment between the detector and the pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs).

  abstract     = {In the realm of industrial robots, ensuring operational reliability and Long-Term Autonomy hinges on the accurate detection of anomalies. However, this sample difference due to noise, joint random errors and sensor errors increases the challenge of robot anomaly detection. To address this problem, an unsupervised deep learning method based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) error calibration is proposed. Firstly, the attitude signals acquired by the IMU from the end of the robot were calibrated using Kalman filtering. The three dimensional (3D) free acceleration was corrected based on the calibrated attitude signal and the calibrated 3D free acceleration signal was used as a signal sample. Secondly, a time and frequency convolutional autoencoder model (TFCAE) is proposed. And the distribution of the different component signals is fitted by stacking multiple encoder modules and 3D-TFCAE is used for 3D free acceleration signal reconstruction model. Then, the error sphere radius is calculated based on the reconstruction error of the 3D free acceleration signal. And the error sphere radius is used as the anomaly detection threshold to realize the robust detection of different types of anomalies. The model was evaluated on a constructed anomaly dataset. This study contributes an innovative 3D-TFCAE architecture, integrating Kalman filtering with time-frequency feature fusion, markedly enhancing anomaly detection in complex signal environments. Experimental findings reveal that 3D-TFCAE significantly outperforms 18 baseline models, improving detection accuracy by about 20 %–40 %, offering an effective solution for high-precision anomaly detection in industrial robots.

  abstract     = {Picking robots have become an important development direction of smart agriculture, and the accurate detection, counting and lightweight deployment of fruits are the technical basis for realizing robot picking. However, due to complex weather conditions and the possible mutual occlusion between branches and citrus, it is challenging to accurately detect and count citrus in orchards. This study proposes a lightweight small target detection model for detecting and counting citrus, and deploys it on the citrus detection platform. The model first introduces FasterNet Block into the cross-stage partial feature fusion module of the backbone network to reduce the number of parameters and calculations while improving the detection accuracy of the network. Secondly, a multi-scale attention mechanism is added to the backbone network to enhance the feature extraction ability of the network. Finally, a bounding box loss function based on a dynamic non-monotonic focusing mechanism is used to increase the model convergence speed and further improve the model accuracy. Experimental results show that the model has an accuracy of 92.7%, an average precision of 91.7%, and a model size of only 5.37 megabytes. The lightweight model is applied to the citrus detection platform. Based on this application, a citrus counting method is proposed, which obtains a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.92, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.28, a determination coefficient ( R 2 ) of 0.98, and a frame rate of 80.6 per second, which meets the requirements of real-time citrus detection and counting. This provides technical support for the subsequent deployment and counting research of picking robots.},

  abstract     = {Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) offers optical contrast, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) excels in imaging soft tissue and organ anatomy. The fusion of PAT with MRI holds promising application prospects due to their complementary advantages. Existing image fusion has made considerable progress in pre-registered images, yet spatial deformations are difficult to avoid in medical imaging scenarios. More importantly, current algorithms focus on visual quality and statistical metrics, thus overlooking the requirements of high-level tasks. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised fusion model, termed PAMRFuse+, which integrates image generation and registration. Specifically, a cross-modal style transfer network is introduced to simplify cross-modal registration to single-modal registration. Subsequently, a multi-level registration network is employed to predict displacement vector fields. Furthermore, a dual-branch feature decomposition fusion network is proposed to address the challenges of cross-modal feature modeling and decomposition by integrating modality-specific and modality-shared features. PAMRFuse+ achieves satisfactory results in registering and fusing unaligned PAT–MRI datasets. Moreover, for the first time, we evaluate the performance of medical image fusion with multi-organ instance segmentation. Extensive experimental demonstrations reveal the advantages of PAMRFuse+ in improving the performance of medical image analysis tasks.},

  abstract     = {Accurate seismic risk assessment of railway embankments is critical for risk mitigation, seismic design, and emergency planning. However, conventional methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and complexity. This study proposes a novel machine learning (ML) framework to rapidly and accurately evaluate probabilistic seismic demand and risk for railway embankments. Latin hypercube sampling is utilised to generate representative soil parameter samples to construct numerical models for simulating dynamic responses under near-fault pulse-like ground motions. The peak permanent settlement (PPS) of the embankment surface is used as the key performance metric. Multiple ML models, including decision trees, random forests (RFs), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and a stacked ML model that integrates RFs, XGBoost, and ANNs, are trained and compared. The stacked ML model outperforms the other models and achieves the highest predictive accuracy for the PPS. SHapley Additive exPlanations are used to identify the velocity spectrum intensity (VSI) and the internal friction angle of the embankment as the most influential factors. Seismic fragility and risk curves are subsequently developed. The VSI and a power-law seismic hazard function are combined to estimate the annual exceedance probabilities for three seismic design criteria levels. The proposed ML framework significantly enhances the efficiency of seismic risk analysis while maintaining high precision, thereby providing a transformative approach for the seismic assessment of railway embankments.},

To address this challenge, we propose a novel method called Sparse Filtering-based Improved Mixed-Gaussian Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (SFIMPPCA) for enhanced LPEs detection. First, a Sparse Filtering (SF) preprocessing technique with an incremental structure is employed to extract the most discriminative features. Second, to address the distortion caused by LPEs, a dynamic ratio correction mechanism based on statistical variability is introduced, followed by a newly designed Mixed-Gaussian Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (MPPCA). Third, a Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA) is applied to automatically adjust control limits, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of fault detection. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process and the Tin Chemical Process (TCP). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves performance under LPEs conditions, achieving a 10%–12% improvement in most cases.},

Traditional models struggle to capture this fluidity, treating networks as static snapshots rather than living systems. While existing research has made strides in analyzing either spatial–temporal patterns or temporal sequences separately, these approaches often fall short in scalability and fail to unify discrete and continuous-time perspectives. To bridge this gap, we introduce DyGHS (Dynamic Graph Historical-Sequential), an innovative framework that harnesses dynamic graph neural networks to model how nodes, edges, and their historical interactions evolve together. By seamlessly integrating discrete-time and continuous-time graph representations, DyGHS not only captures the richness of real-world networks but also efficiently predicts future connections and node behaviors. Our experiments reveal that combining continuous-time Fourier transform (CTFT) with graph neural networks significantly boosts prediction accuracy, outperforming current methods in tasks like link prediction and node classification. This advancement opens new doors for understanding and anticipating the ever-changing tapestry of networked systems.},

  abstract     = {Domain gaps can often cause dramatic performance deterioration when applying medical image segmentation models trained on the source domain to the target domain. Although unsupervised domain adaptation methods can address the domain gap challenge to some extent, their reliance on accessing source images largely hampers their practical applicability, as source data are often inaccessible due to privacy concerns. Moreover, the low-quality characteristic of medical images can further degrade the domain adaptation performance of segmentation models. To address these issues, we propose the Masked-AutoEncoder-guided Diffusion (MAE-Diff) framework for source-free domain adaptive medical image segmentation. MAE-Diff mainly consists of a Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) Module for effective feature extraction and domain adaptation, and a Diffusion Module for effective segmentation of low-quality medical images. On source images, the MAE encoder is trained to extract image-specific features, and the Diffusion Module is trained to generate segmentation maps following a gradual denoising strategy, under the guidance of features extracted by the MAE encoder. Training on the target domain involves only fine-tuning MAE (trained on the source images) with target images, allowing MAE-Diff to adapt to the target domain distribution. Inference on target images can then be made by the source-based Diffusion Module, under the guidance of features extracted by the MAE encoder fine-tuned on the target images. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for source-free domain-adaptive medical image segmentation.

It aims to enhance the model’s self-learning capabilities by utilizing Siamese network to integrate deep fuzzy knowledge and fine-grained knowledge without the need for a teacher model. The innovations of this study are as follows: (1) The deep fuzzy rules in the proposed classifier are enriched with an “Inductive-Reflection” process, which reduces constraints on traditional basic fuzzy rule and aligns rule acquisition more closely with general human thinking manners; (2) The proposed method includes a mechanism for self-learning and improvement from both deep and fine-grained fuzzy knowledge, eliminating the complexity of retraining a new teacher model; (3) An adaptive learning function is developed to effectively adjust the learning process, adapting to tasks with different complexities. Extensive experiments results on benchmark datasets, as well as two real-world datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed classifier in terms of classification accuracy and weighted F1-score.},

  abstract     = {Industrial anomaly detection plays a crucial role in the industrial manufacturing field. Currently, utilizing generated data to improve the performance of the anomaly detection model is an effective approach. However, most existing methods often rely on mask-guided synthesis, where the distribution of the generated defects is limited by masks that are typically random or learned by a model. In addition, the scarcity of real anomalous samples makes it difficult for generative models to capture genuine defect patterns and align with the real anomaly distribution. To tackle these issues, we propose DefectGen, the first long-text-guided few-shot text-to-image data generation pipeline for industrial anomaly detection. To improve distribution alignment under limited anomaly samples, DefectGen incorporates a Prompt Generation and Variation Module, which uses MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) to expand few-shot image–text pairs into diverse and semantically rich prompts, and DoKr (Weight- D ecomposed L o w-Rank Adaptation with Kr onecker product), a lightweight fine-tuning strategy with structured low-rank adaptation. To ensure the quality of synthetic data, DefectGen further introduces the Real-Guided Clustering Filter, which selects high-quality generated samples by comparing their features with those of real anomalies. Experiments on the MVTec AD(MVTec AnomalyDetection) dataset show that DefectGen generates more diverse and realistic synthetic anomalies and achieves a 5.58% average improvement in anomaly classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

PIFT consists of three stages; (i) generating low fidelity data from prior knowledge under realistic settings, (ii) pre-training a single neural network with the generated low fidelity data, and (iii) fine-tuning the pre-trained model using physics-informed loss function. PIFT is evaluated on seven scientific problems including five ordinary differential equations and two partial differential equations. We also demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of PIFT to out-of-distribution tasks. PIFT exhibits high accuracy and robustness in discovering unknown parameters of differential equations from randomly distributed sparse data points.},

  abstract     = {Spatio-Temporal predictive models are crucial for forecasting where and when crimes will occur, aiding public security organizations in resource allocation and crime prevention. Despite numerous literature proposals, a lack of standardized evaluation criteria hinders comparability and reliability. To address this, we propose STEval, a comprehensive and flexible evaluation framework for spatio-temporal predictive models. STEval consists of four modules: data preparation, spatial structure definition, model training, and model evaluation. The framework’s robustness was demonstrated using a 40-million-record crime dataset from Minas Gerais State (Brazil) across five experimental scenarios, including variations in temporal granularity, spatial resolution, and distribution shifts. Results demonstrate that no single model is universally superior, and the most appropriate model depends on the specific application context. For instance, Spatio-Temporal Kernel Density Estimation (STKDE) consistently achieved high Hit Rates (HR), often exceeding 0.98 in fine spatial resolutions (e.g., 100-square meters grid) for violent crimes, while Spatial-Temporal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (STARIMA) demonstrated strong performance in temporal granularity tests, reaching HRs of up to 0.65 for theft predictions. Conversely, Extra Tree Regressor, though exhibiting significantly lower HRs (e.g., as low as 0.02 in some spatial tests), consistently provided the fastest execution times, often under 5 s, contrasting with STKDE’s execution times that could extend to thousands of seconds in dense spatial grids. The framework’s detailed analysis provides important insights for informed model selection and optimization, revealing each model’s strengths and limitations, and providing a robust foundation for future advancements in spatio-temporal crime prediction research, leveraging Machine Learning (ML) techniques.},

Traditional hardware technologies like Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) and Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) suffer from limitations such as high power consumption and insufficient scalability, which hinder secure and sustainable IoT deployment. Such limitations have prompted the need to seek other technologies that would serve the dual purpose of providing security as well as energy. Quantum-based technologies can become adequate candidates offering promising solutions to make IoT devices and sustainable systems more secured. Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) has been proposed as a nanotechnology with the potential of consuming ultra-low powers, less area, and high-speed operation. QCA enhances security through sustainable computing objectives by minimizing energy usage. To improve the future security and efficiency of IoT hardware, this paper suggests a QCA-based Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). This ALU can generate more than 12 logical and arithmetic operations. Designed together with the majority gates, XOR gates, multiplexers, and full adders, the ALU is simulated using the QCA-Designer 2.0.3. Simulated results indicate improvements in the number of cells and reduced occupied area relative to the earlier designs. These results indicate the potential of QCA technology in enabling secure, energy-efficient, and compact computing architecture applicable in the future IoT.},
