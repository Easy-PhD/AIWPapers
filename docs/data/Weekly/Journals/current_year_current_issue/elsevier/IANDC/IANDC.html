  abstract     = {Fast quantum algorithms can solve important computational problems more efficiently than classical algorithms. However, little is known about whether quantum computing can speed up solving geometric problems. This article explores quantum advantages for the problem of finding the center of a sphere in vector spaces over finite fields, given samples of random points on the sphere. We prove that any classical algorithm for this task requires approximately as many samples as the dimension of the vector space, by a reduction to an old and basic algebraic result—Warning's second theorem. On the other hand, we propose a quantum algorithm based on quantum walks that needs only a constant number of samples to find the center. Thus, an unbounded quantum advantage is revealed for a natural and intuitive geometric problem, which highlights the power of quantum computing in solving geometric problems.},

  abstract     = {Non-compact symmetries cannot be fully broken by randomness since non-compact groups have no invariant probability distributions. In particular, this makes trickier the “Copernican” random choice of the place of the observer in infinite cosmology models. This problem may be circumvented with what topologists call pointed spaces . Then randomness will be used only in building (infinite) models around the pre-designated “observance point”, that thus would not need to be randomly chosen. Additional complications come from the original randomness possibly being hidden. P. Gacs and A. Kucera proved that every sequence can be algorithmically generated from a random one. But Vladimir V'yugin discovered that randomized algorithms can with positive probability generate uncomputable sequences not algorithmically equivalent to any random ones.},

  abstract     = {We study the computational complexity of finite intersections and finite unions of deterministic context-free (dcf) languages. Earlier, Wotschke [J. Comput. System Sci. 16 (1978) 456–461] demonstrated that intersections of ( d + 1 ) dcf languages are in general more powerful than intersections of d dcf languages for any positive integer d based on the separation result of the intersection hierarchy of Liu and Weiner [Math. Systems Theory 7 (1973) 185–192]. The argument of Liu and Weiner, however, works only on bounded languages of particular forms, and therefore Wotschke's result is not directly extendable to other non-bounded languages. To deal with a wide range of languages for the non-membership to the intersection hierarchy, we circumvent the specialization of their proof technics and devise a new and practical technical tool: two pumping lemmas for finite unions of dcf languages. Since the family of dcf languages is closed under complementation and also under intersection with regular languages, these pumping lemmas help us establish the non-membership relation of languages formed by finite intersections of target languages. We also concern ourselves with a relationship to deterministic limited automata of Hibbard [Inf. Control 11 (1967) 196–238] in this regard.},

In this paper, we study the intersection between the set of k -subsequence universal words over some alphabet Σ and regular languages over Σ. We call a regular language L k- ∃ -subsequence universal if there exists a k -subsequence universal word in L , and k- ∀ -subsequence universal if every word of L is k -subsequence universal. We give algorithms solving the problems of deciding if a given regular language, represented by a finite automaton recognising it, is k- ∃ -subsequence universal and, respectively, if it is k- ∀ -subsequence universal , for a given k . The algorithms are FPT w.r.t. the size of the input alphabet, and their run-time does not depend on k ; they run in polynomial time in the number n of states of the input automaton when the size of the input alphabet is O ( log ⁡ n ) . Moreover, we show that the problem of deciding if a given regular language is k- ∃ -subsequence universal is NP-complete, when the language is over a large alphabet. Further, we provide algorithms for counting the number of k -subsequence universal words (paths) accepted by a given deterministic (respectively, non-deterministic) finite automaton, and ranking an input word (path) within the set of k -subsequence universal words accepted by a given finite automaton.},

  abstract     = {This paper advances the state of the art in the dynamic controllability (DC) and dispatchability of Simple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty (STNUs) through four key contributions. First, findSRNC is an algorithm that identifies semi-reducible negative cycles in non-dynamically controllable STNUs. Running in O ( m n + k 2 n + k n log ⁡ n ) time (matching the fastest DC-checking algorithms), it handles repeated edges and uses polynomial space, even when cycles might contain exponentially many edges. Second, minDisp ESTNU + is an algorithm that improves dispatchability computation for STNUs from O ( k n 3 ) to O ( n 3 + k 2 n log ⁡ n ) time. It outputs dispatchable Extended STNUs (ESTNUs) having minimal numbers of edges, which is crucial for subsequent real-time execution. Third, the Canonical Form of Nested Diamond Structures in Dispatchable ESTNUs is a rigorous theory that facilitates correctness proofs for dispatchability algorithms. It also helped reveal and correct a flaw in a previously published algorithm. Fourth, our empirical evaluation using improved open-source implementations demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our algorithms. These contributions address fundamental computational bottlenecks in temporal planning systems, enabling more efficient reasoning about uncertain timing constraints while providing real-time guarantees required for robotics, scheduling, and automated planning applications.},

  abstract     = {A polynomial Turing compression (PTC) for a parameterized problem L is a polynomial time Turing machine that has access to an oracle for a problem L ′ such that a polynomial in the input parameter bounds each query. Meanwhile, a polynomial compression (PC) can be regarded as a restricted variant of PTC where the machine can query the oracle exactly once and must output the same answer as the oracle. Bodlaender et al. (ICALP 2008) and Fortnow and Santhanam (STOC 2008) initiated an impressive hardness theory for PC under the assumption coNP ⊈ NP/poly. Let C be the set of all problems with PTCs but without PCs assuming coNP ⊈ NP/poly. Fernau et al. (STACS 2009) identified Leaf Out-tree( k ) as the first problem in C . However, little is known about C , with only a dozen problems confirmed in it over the last fifteen years. Open questions remain, such as whether CNF-SAT( n ) and k -path are in C , requiring novel ideas to clarify the differences between PTCs and PCs. In this paper, we enrich our knowledge about C by demonstrating that 17 problems parameterized by modular-width ( mw ), such as Chromatic Number( mw ) and Hamiltonian Cycle( mw ) , belong to C . Additionally, we develop a general recipe to prove the existence of PTCs for a class of problems, including these 17.},

  abstract     = {The theory of numberings provides classification results for families of sets in various computability-theoretic hierarchies. The algorithmic content of numberings is typically calibrated via the reducibility between numberings. For a given family of sets S , this reducibility gives rise to an upper semilattice of degrees that is often called the Rogers semilattice of S . This paper studies the cardinalities of Rogers semilattices for families of sets at finite levels of the Ershov hierarchy. The classical result of Khutoretskii (1971) shows that the Rogers semilattice of a family of c.e. sets is either one-element or countably infinite. Badaev and Lempp (2009) constructed a family of d.c.e. sets that demonstrates that the methods of Khutoretskii cannot be applied to obtain a similar result for Rogers semilattices already at the second level of the Ershov hierarchy. We prove that for any finite family of sets S at any finite level of the Ershov hierarchy, the corresponding Rogers semilattice is either one-element or countably infinite. We also obtain another sufficient condition for a Rogers semilattice to be infinite. This condition implies that the Rogers semilattice of Badaev and Lempp is also infinite.},

  abstract     = {Network motifs, regarded as fundamental building blocks, offer crucial insights into the structure and function of complex networks, with broad applications across disciplines including sociology, computer science, bioinformatics, chemoinformatics, and pharmaceutics. However, the identification of network motifs remains a significant and computationally challenging problem. Among various motifs, subtree enumeration has garnered substantial attention in recent years, particularly due to its relevance in network science and bioinformatics. For an n -vertex tree T , by introducing novel generating functions with ( d + 2 ) variables, we propose an innovative algorithm for the exact enumeration of T 's subtrees rooted at fixed vertex v , where the distance between v and the farthest leaf is k = 0 , 1 , … , d , and the distance between any two leaves is no more than d . Building on this algorithm, we develop novel recursive algorithms for exact enumerating various diameter no more than d subtrees (abbreviated as DNMT- d subtrees) of T . As applications, we apply these algorithms to derive the number of DNMT- d subtrees in a full binary tree B h with h ≥ 2 levels, and briefly discuss the density of DNMT- d subtrees in general trees. Our research generalizes the work of Frank Ruskey on Listing and Counting Subtrees of a Tree in 1981 and makes it a special case of our study where d equals the diameter of the tree T . Moreover, the proposed O ( d n 2 ) algorithms introduce new approaches for enumerating subtrees under diameter constraints and lay the groundwork for counting diameter-constrained subgraphs (motifs) in complex networks.},

It is proved that the problem whether such a system has a solution is Σ 2 0 -complete in the arithmetical hierarchy (cf. the earlier studied case of equations only, where it is co-r.e.-complete), the problem whether it has a unique solution is in Σ 3 0 ∩ Π 3 0 , and is both Σ 2 0 -hard and Π 2 0 -hard, existence of a finite or regular solution is an r.e.-complete problem, while testing whether a system has finitely many solutions is Σ 3 0 -complete.

  abstract     = {The representative k -median problem generalizes the classical clustering formulations in that it partitions the data points into ℓ disjoint demographic groups and imposes a lower-bound constraint on the number of opened facilities from each group, such that all the groups are fairly represented by the opened facilities. Due to its simplicity, the local-search heuristic, which iteratively swaps a bounded number of closed facilities for the same number of opened ones to improve the solution, has been frequently used in the representative k -median problem. It is known that the local-search heuristic, when restricted to constant-size swaps, yields a constant-factor approximation if ℓ = 2 , and has an unbounded approximation ratio if ℓ is super-constant. However, for any constant ℓ > 2 , the existence of a constant-factor approximation under constant-size swaps remained an open question for a long time. In response to this question, we demonstrate that the local-search heuristic guarantees a ( 4 ℓ + 5 ) -approximation when up to ℓ ( ℓ + 1 ) facilities are allowed to be swapped in each iteration, thus providing an affirmative answer to the question. Our main technical contribution is a novel approach for theoretically analyzing the local-search heuristic, which bounds its approximation ratio by linearly combining the clustering cost increases induced by a set of hierarchically organized swaps. Our techniques also generalize to the k -means clustering formulation and reveal similar approximation guarantees for the local-search heuristic.},

We introduce a new concept called g -good neighbor cut-component number (gc number for short), which has close relation with g -good-neighbor diagnosability. Sharp lower and upper bounds of the gc number of general graphs in terms of the g -good neighbor connectivity have been proposed, which provide a formula to compute the g -good-neighbor diagnosability for general graphs (therefore for Cartesian product graphs).

  abstract     = {We investigate the model of multiple rank-order contests held in parallel, where each contestant only selects one contest to join and each contest designer decides the prize structure to compete for the participation of contestants. We first analyze the strategic behaviors of contestants and completely characterize the symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium. As for the strategies of contest designers, when other designers' strategies are known, we show that computing the best response is NP-hard and propose a fully polynomial time approximation scheme to output the ϵ -approximate best response. When other designers' strategies are unknown, we provide a worst-case analysis on one designer's strategy. We give an upper bound on the worst-case utility of any strategy and propose a method to construct a strategy whose utility can guarantee a constant ratio of this upper bound in the worst case.},
