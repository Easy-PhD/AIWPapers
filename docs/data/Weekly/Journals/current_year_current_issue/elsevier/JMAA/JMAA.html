  abstract     = {This article develops the theory of two-variable Mittag-Leffler-Laguerre polynomials by employing a generating function based on 0 th -order Tricomi functions and leveraging the symbolic method as a foundational framework. Key results include the derivation of the generating function, series representation, symbolic partial differential relations, multiplicative and derivative operators, differential equations, and integral representations for two-variable Mittag-Leffler-Laguerre polynomials. Additionally, Lie-theoretic generating relations are explored through the Lie-Mon technique, emphasizing their algebraic structure. Specific cases for special parameter values ρ , and θ are analyzed, with visual representations illustrating their properties. The study concludes by reducing the two-variable Mittag-Leffler-Laguerre polynomials to one-variable Mittag-Leffler-Laguerre polynomials, presenting graphical representations, and summarizing related results. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and extending the properties of Mittag-Leffler-Laguerre polynomials in multiple dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Operator systems connect operator algebra, free semialgebraic geometry and quantum information theory. In this work we generalize operator systems and many of their theorems. While positive semidefinite matrices form the underlying structure of operator systems, our work shows that these can be promoted to far more general structures. For instance, we prove a general extension theorem which unifies the well-known homomorphism theorem, Riesz' extension theorem, Farkas' lemma and Arveson's extension theorem. On the other hand, the same theorem gives rise to new vector-valued extension theorems, even for invariant maps, when applied to other underlying structures. We also prove generalized versions of the Choi–Kraus representation, Choi–Effros theorem, duality of operator systems, factorizations of completely positive maps, and more, leading to new results even for operator systems themselves. In addition, our proofs are shorter and simpler, revealing the interplay between cones and tensor products, captured elegantly in terms of star autonomous categories. This perspective gives rise to new connections between group representations, mapping cones and topological quantum field theory, as they correspond to different instances of our framework and are thus siblings of operator systems.

By analyzing bifurcation structure of positive steady-states emanating from semi-trivial steady-states, and employing Leray-Schauder degree theory, we characterize how these combined factors dictate the multiplicity, uniqueness and stability of positive steady-states. Additionally, we examine the asymptotic behaviors of positive steady-states induced by the predator growth rate and prey diffusion rate. The long-term dynamical behaviors of the system are finally revealed. The findings reveal that the interplay of fear effect, protection zone and Ivlev-type interaction term generates unprecedented dynamical regimes in traditional models with fewer ecological factors, and offers both theoretical insights into complex ecosystems and practical guidance for conservation strategies. Biologically speaking, such joint effects help to showcase their synergistic roles in shaping population dynamics and ecological stability.},

The equation, derived from population dynamics, describes the evolution of population density under growth, migration, and memory effects. The control set is feedback-based and spatially nonlocal, depending on a weighted integral of the state. We establish the existence of controlled trajectories that approximate the infimum or supremum of a cost functional with arbitrary precision. Moreover, under additional regularity assumptions on the bounding functions of the control set, we provide the existence of truly optimal controlled trajectories.

Applying variational methods, multiple multi-bump solutions for the above equation have been obtained. More precisely, our findings demonstrate that if the zero set of Z possesses several isolated connected components Ω 1 , ⋯ , Ω k such that the interior of Ω i is not empty and ∂Ω is smooth, then for λ ≥ 1 sufficiently large, a bump solution is confined in a neighborhood of ⋃ j ∈ Γ Ω j for every non-empty subset Γ ⊂ { 1 , ⋯ , k } . Furthermore, let λ ≥ 1 be large enough, we also show that the above equation has at least 2 k − 1 multi-bump solutions. The novelty and characteristic of this paper lie in the simultaneous appearance of critical and logarithmic nonlinearities in this equation, and the results in this paper extend the subcritical case [39] to the critical case.},

  abstract     = {We consider the pipeline flow of blended gas. The flow is governed by a coupled system where for each component we have the isothermal Euler equations with an additional velocity coupling term that couples the velocities of the different components. Our motivation is hydrogen blending in natural gas pipelines, which will play a role in the transition to renewable energies. We show that with suitable boundary conditions the velocities of the gas components synchronize exponentially fast, as long as the L 2 -norm of the synchronization error is outside of a certain interval where the size of the interval is determined by the order of the interaction terms. This indicates that in some cases for a mixture of n components it is justified to use a drift-flux model where it is assumed that all components flow with the same velocity. For the proofs we use an appropriately chosen Lyapunov function which is based upon the idea of relative energy.},

The model represents resource perception using a spatial convolution kernel, capturing nonlocal interactions between consumers and their environment. We establish the global existence of classical solutions under periodic boundary conditions in two spatial dimensions and demonstrate the global stability of homogeneous steady states within specific parameter regimes. Additionally, numerical simulations are conducted to explore the influence of the perception radius R on system dynamics. Our results reveal that the perception radius plays a pivotal role in inducing phase transitions from uniform states to complex spatiotemporal patterns, underscoring the significance of cognitive sensing scales in ecological self-organization.},

A C ⁎ -support of S is the C ⁎ -algebra generated (via the Choi–Effros product) by S inside an injective operator system acting on H . By leveraging Hamana's theory, we show that such a C ⁎ -support is unique precisely when C ⁎ ( S ) (the C ⁎ -algebra generated in B ( H ) with the usual product) is contained in every copy of the injective envelope of S that acts on H . Further, we demonstrate how the uniqueness of certain C ⁎ -supports can be used to give new characterizations of the unique extension property for ⁎-representations, as well as the hyperrigidity of S . In another direction, we utilize the collection of all C ⁎ -supports of S to describe the subspace generated by the so-called abnormalities of S , thereby complementing an earlier result of Kakariadis.},

  abstract     = {We present a unified approach to establishing the existence of almost automorphic solutions to differential equations in Banach spaces. We introduce the concept of solutions having exclusive ranges for differential equations of the form u ′ = f ( t , u ) in a Banach space X , where f is almost automorphic in time t . The proposed methodology unifies classical techniques, covering cases where nonlinearities are globally Lipschitz with exponentially stable linear parts, as well as differential equations without global Lipschitz nonlinearities. The main result shows that, under certain conditions on f , every solution with an exclusive range is compactly almost automorphic. To illustrate the versatility of the developed approach, we provide several examples and applications, including a Bohr–Neugebauer type theorem and the analysis of differential equations possessing multiple and unique almost automorphic solutions.},
