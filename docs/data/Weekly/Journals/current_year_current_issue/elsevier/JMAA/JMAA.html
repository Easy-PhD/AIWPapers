  abstract     = {We develop a discrete Sobolev inequality, and we use this inequality to analyse the nonlocal discretised Kirchhoff equation − A ( ( a ⁎ ( g ∘ | Δ u | ) ) ( b + 1 ) ) ( Δ 2 u ) ( n ) = λ f ( n , u ( n + 1 ) ) , n ∈ { 0 , 1 , 2 , … , b } , where ⁎ represents a finite convolution. The equation is a discrete analogue of the classical steady-state Kirchhoff equation in one space dimension. Existence of at least one positive solution is investigated under the assumption that the equation is subject to two-point boundary data such that u ( 0 ) = 0 . Thus, both Dirichlet and right-focal data are captured by our results. An interesting aspect of our theory is that the coefficient function A may be both vanishing and sign-changing.},

By leveraging existing results on asymptotic autonomous systems, along with Fredholm theory and the Banach fixed-point theorem, we establish the existence of bistable traveling wave solutions using a perturbation argument. This result holds when the density-suppressed sensitivity is relatively small. Finally, we validate our main results through numerical simulations and further discuss wave patterns and the sign of the wave speed as the density-suppressed sensitivity varies.},

  abstract     = {We consider an age-structured viral dynamics model with Logistic growth and a general nonlinear incidence rate. We present the basic reproduction number of the continuous model and conduct a theoretical analysis of the model. For such a hybrid infinite-dimensional system with abstract nonlinear terms, the comprehensive numerical analysis is still pending. We address this problem by establishing a fully discrete linearly implicit scheme, and the non-negativity of the numerical scheme is confirmed by utilizing the theory of M -matrix. With a solvability analysis, the finite time convergence is proved for strong solutions. For long-time dynamics, by utilizing the exponential decay characteristic of the fundamental solution matrix, we established a 1-order convergence analysis for the numerical reproduction number R 0 Δ t , and further proved the 1-order convergence property of numerical equilibria. By applying linearization techniques and comparison principles, we demonstrate that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R 0 Δ t < 1 , and the endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when R 0 Δ t > 1 . Hence, numerical processes almost completely replicate the dynamic properties of continuous system. At last, some numerical experiments demonstrate the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we construct a time-delayed multi-group SIR epidemic model to discuss the impact of population behavior change on the occurrence of recurrent epidemic waves. We obtain the basic reproduction number R 0 and show that if R 0 ≤ 1 , then the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, whereas if R 0 > 1 , then the disease-free equilibrium is unstable and an endemic equilibrium exists. In a special two-group case, we show sufficient conditions for Hopf bifurcation and obtain index values that determine the direction, stability and period of bifurcated periodic solutions. By numerical simulation, we investigate the occurrence of periodic solutions in two groups representing an urban area and a non-urban area. We conclude that the epidemic size, response intensity of population behavior change and heterogeneity in two different groups can be the key factors of the occurrence of recurrent epidemic waves.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the composition of Bernstein–Durrmeyer operators and Szász–Mirakjan–Durrmeyer operators, focusing on the structure and properties of the associated kernel functions. In the case of the Bernstein–Durrmeyer operators, we establish new identities for the kernel arising from the composition of two and three operators. Like the well-known representation in terms of Legendre polynomials, they show the commutativity of these operators naturally. While this Legendre representation contains all possible products p k , i ( x ) p k , j ( y ) , 0 ≤ i , j ≤ k ≤ n , of Bernstein basis polynomials, the new representation has the beautiful property to contain only products p k , ℓ ( x ) p k , ℓ ( y ) , 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ k ≤ n , where n is the smallest degree of the Bernstein–Durrmeyer polynomials involved. This fact immediately implies that the composition can be written as a linear combination of the operators themselves. Building on the eigenstructure of the Bernstein–Durrmeyer operator M n , we obtain a representation of its r -th iterate as a linear combination of the operators M k , for k = 0 , 1 , … , n . We also address the composition of Szász–Mirakjan–Durrmeyer operators and revisit a known result giving an elementary proof.},
