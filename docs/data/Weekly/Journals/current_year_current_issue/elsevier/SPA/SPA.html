  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a class of reflected backward stochastic differential equations (RBSDE) driven by a marked point process (MPP) with a convex/concave generator. Based on fixed point argument, θ -method and truncation technique, the well-posedness of this kind of RBSDE with unbounded terminal condition and obstacle is investigated. Besides, we present an application on the pricing of American options via utility maximization, which is solved by constructing an RBSDE with a convex generator.},

  abstract     = {The adapted Wasserstein distance ( AW -distance) controls the calibration errors of optimal values in various stochastic optimization problems, pricing and hedging problems, optimal stopping problems, etc. However, statistical aspects of the AW -distance are bottlenecked by the failure of empirical measures ( Emp ) to converge under this distance. Kernel smoothing and adapted projection have been introduced to construct converging substitutes of empirical measures, known respectively as smoothed empirical measures ( S - Emp ) and adapted empirical measures ( A - Emp ). However, both approaches have limitations. Specifically, S - Emp lack comprehensive convergence results, whereas A - Emp in practical applications lead to fewer distinct samples compared to standard empirical measures. In this work, we address both of the aforementioned issues. First, we develop comprehensive convergence results of S - Emp . We then introduce a smoothed version for A - Emp , which provide as many distinct samples as desired. We refer them as AS - Emp and establish their convergence in mean, deviation and almost sure convergence. The convergence estimation incorporates two results: the empirical analysis of the smoothed adapted Wasserstein distance ( AW ( σ ) -distance) and its bandwidth effects. Both results are novel and their proof techniques could be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {We consider a control problem for the nonlinear stochastic Fokker–Planck equation. This equation describes the evolution of the distribution of nonlocally interacting particles affected by a common source of noise. The system is directed by a controller that acts on the drift term with the goal of minimising a cost functional. We establish the well-posedness of the state equation, prove the existence of optimal controls, and formulate a stochastic maximum principle (SMP) that provides necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the control problem. The adjoint process arising in the SMP is characterised by a nonlocal (semi)linear backward SPDE for which we study existence and uniqueness. We also rigorously connect the control problem for the nonlinear stochastic Fokker–Planck equation to the control of the corresponding McKean–Vlasov SDE that describes the motion of a representative particle. Our work extends existing results for the control of the Fokker–Planck equation to nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. In particular, the sufficient SMP, which we obtain by exploiting the special structure of the Fokker–Planck equation, seems to be novel even in the linear deterministic setting. We illustrate our results with an application to a model of government interventions in financial systems, supplemented by numerical illustrations.},

  abstract     = {In this article we show that for SDEs with a drift coefficient that is non-locally integrable, one may define a tamed Euler scheme that converges in L p at rate 1 / 2 to the true solution. The taming is required in this case since one cannot expect the regular Euler scheme to have finite moments in L p . Our proof strategy involves controlling the inverse moments of the distance of scheme and the true solution to the singularity set. We additionally show that our setting applies to the case of two scalar valued particles with singular interaction kernel. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work to prove strong convergence of an Euler-type scheme in the case of non-locally integrable drift.},
