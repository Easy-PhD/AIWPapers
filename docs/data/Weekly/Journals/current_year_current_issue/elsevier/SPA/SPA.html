  abstract     = {Consider the global optimisation of a function U defined on a finite set V endowed with an irreducible and reversible Markov generator. By integration, we extend U to the set P ( V ) of probability distributions on V and we penalize it with a time-dependent generalized entropy functional. Endowing P ( V ) with a Maas’ Wasserstein-type Riemannian structure enables us to consider an associated time-inhomogeneous gradient descent algorithm. There are several ways to interpret this P ( V ) -valued dynamical system as the time-marginal laws of a time-inhomogeneous non-linear Markov process taking values in V , each of them allowing for interacting particle approximations. This procedure extends to the discrete framework the continuous state space swarm algorithm approach of Bolte et al. (2023), but here we go further by considering more general generalized entropy functionals for which functional inequalities can be proven. Thus in the full generality of the above finite framework, we give conditions on the underlying time dependence ensuring the convergence of the algorithm toward laws supported by the set of global minima of U . Numerical simulations illustrate that one has to be careful about the choice of the time-inhomogeneous non-linear Markov process interpretation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a class of stochastic processes that encompasses many natural and widely used examples. A key feature of these processes is their infinite memory, which enables them to retain information from arbitrarily distant past states. Using the martingale decomposition method, we derive deviation and moment inequalities for separately Lipschitz functionals of such processes, under various moment conditions on certain dominating random variables. Our results extend those obtained for Markov chains by Dedecker and Fan [Stochastic Process. Appl., 2015], as well as recent results by Chazottes et al. [Ann. Appl. Probab., 2023] concerning specific infinite-memory models with sub-Gaussian concentration bounds. We also discuss an application to the stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The adapted Wasserstein distance ( AW -distance) controls the calibration errors of optimal values in various stochastic optimization problems, pricing and hedging problems, optimal stopping problems, etc. However, statistical aspects of the AW -distance are bottlenecked by the failure of empirical measures ( Emp ) to converge under this distance. Kernel smoothing and adapted projection have been introduced to construct converging substitutes of empirical measures, known respectively as smoothed empirical measures ( S - Emp ) and adapted empirical measures ( A - Emp ). However, both approaches have limitations. Specifically, S - Emp lack comprehensive convergence results, whereas A - Emp in practical applications lead to fewer distinct samples compared to standard empirical measures. In this work, we address both of the aforementioned issues. First, we develop comprehensive convergence results of S - Emp . We then introduce a smoothed version for A - Emp , which provide as many distinct samples as desired. We refer them as AS - Emp and establish their convergence in mean, deviation and almost sure convergence. The convergence estimation incorporates two results: the empirical analysis of the smoothed adapted Wasserstein distance ( AW ( σ ) -distance) and its bandwidth effects. Both results are novel and their proof techniques could be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {We consider a control problem for the nonlinear stochastic Fokker–Planck equation. This equation describes the evolution of the distribution of nonlocally interacting particles affected by a common source of noise. The system is directed by a controller that acts on the drift term with the goal of minimising a cost functional. We establish the well-posedness of the state equation, prove the existence of optimal controls, and formulate a stochastic maximum principle (SMP) that provides necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the control problem. The adjoint process arising in the SMP is characterised by a nonlocal (semi)linear backward SPDE for which we study existence and uniqueness. We also rigorously connect the control problem for the nonlinear stochastic Fokker–Planck equation to the control of the corresponding McKean–Vlasov SDE that describes the motion of a representative particle. Our work extends existing results for the control of the Fokker–Planck equation to nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. In particular, the sufficient SMP, which we obtain by exploiting the special structure of the Fokker–Planck equation, seems to be novel even in the linear deterministic setting. We illustrate our results with an application to a model of government interventions in financial systems, supplemented by numerical illustrations.},

We establish duality relations for each system through an analytical approach. It turns out that with open boundaries self-duality breaks down and qualitatively different properties compared to closed boundaries (i.e., finite volume without reservoirs) arise: Both the DCP and GDCP are ergodic but no longer absorbing, while the respective dual processes are absorbing but not ergodic. We provide expressions for the stationary correlation functions in terms of the dual absorption probabilities. We perform explicit computations for a small sized DCP, and for arbitrary size in a particular setting of the GDCP. The duality function is factorized for the DCP and GDCP, contrary to the SIR model for which the duality relation is nonlocal and yields an explicit expression of the time evolution of some specific correlation functions, describing the time decay of the sizes of clusters of susceptible individuals.},

The taming is required in this case since one cannot expect the regular Euler scheme to have finite moments in L p . Our proof strategy involves controlling the inverse moments of the distance of scheme and the true solution to the singularity set. We additionally show that our setting applies to the case of two scalar valued particles with singular interaction kernel. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work to prove strong convergence of an Euler-type scheme in the case of non-locally integrable drift.},
