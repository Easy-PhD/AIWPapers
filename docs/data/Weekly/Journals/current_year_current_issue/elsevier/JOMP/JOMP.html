  abstract     = {Experiment-based calibration is a novel method for measurement validation, which – unlike classical validity metrics – does not require stable between-person variance. In this approach, the latent variable to be measured is manipulated by an experiment, and its predicted scores – termed standard scores – are compared against the measured scores. Previous work has shown that under plausible boundary conditions, the correlation between standard and measured scores – termed retrodictive validity – is informative about measurement accuracy, i.e. combined trueness and precision. Here, I expand these findings in several directions. First, I formalise the approach in a probability-theoretic framework with the concept of a standardised calibration space. Second, I relate this framework to classical validity theory and show that the boundary conditions in fact apply to any form of criterion validity, including classical convergent validity. Thus, I state precise and empirically quantifiable boundary conditions under which criterion validity metrics are informative on validity. Third, I relate these boundary conditions to confounding variables, i.e. correlated latent variables. I show that in the limit, calibration will converge on the latent variable that is most closely related to the standard. Finally, I provide a framework for modelling the data-generating process with Markov kernels, and identify sufficient conditions under which the data generation model results in a calibration space. In sum, this article provides a formal probability-theoretic framework for experiment-based calibration and facilitates modelling and empirical assessment of the data generating processes.},

  abstract     = {Iverson (2006b) proposed the law of similarity ξ s ( λ x ) = γ ( λ , s ) ξ η ( λ , s ) ( x ) for the sensitivity functions ξ s ( s ∈ S ) . Compared to the former models, the generality of this one lies in that here γ and η can also depend on the variables λ and s . In the literature, this model (or its special cases) is usually considered together with a given psychophysical representation (e.g. Fechnerian, subtractive, or affine). Our goal, however, is to study at first Iverson’s law of similarity on its own. We show that if certain mild assumptions are fulfilled, then ξ can be written in a rather simple form containing only one-variable functions. The obtained form proves to be very useful when we assume some kind of representation. Motivated by Hsu and Iverson (2016) , we then study the above model assuming that the mapping η is multiplicatively translational. First, we show how these mappings can be characterized. Later we turn to the examination of Falmagne’s power law. According to our results, the corresponding function ξ can have a Fechnerian representation, and also it can have a subtractive representation. We close the paper with the study of the shift invariance property.},

  abstract     = {Any medical innovation must first prove its benefits with reliable evidence from clinical trials. Evidence is commonly expressed using two metrics, summarizing treatment benefits based on either absolute risk reductions (ARRs) or relative risk reductions (RRRs). Both metrics are derived from the same data, but they implement conceptually distinct ideas. Here, we analyze these risk reductions measures from a causal modeling perspective. First, we show that ARR is equivalent to Δ P , while RRR is equivalent to causal power, thus clarifying the implicit causal assumptions. Second, we show how this formal equivalence establishes a relationship with causal Bayes nets theory, offering a basis for incorporating risk reduction metrics into a computational modeling framework. Leveraging these analyses, we demonstrate that under dynamically varying baseline risks, ARRs and RRRs lead to strongly diverging predictions. Specifically, the inherent assumption of a linear parameterization of the underlying causal graph can lead to incorrect conclusions when generalizing treatment benefits (e.g, predicting the effect of a vaccine in new populations with different baseline risks). Our analyses highlight the shared principles underlying risk reduction metrics and measures of causal strength, emphasizing the potential for explicating causal structure and inference in medical research.},
