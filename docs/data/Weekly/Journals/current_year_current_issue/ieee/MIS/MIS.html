  abstract     = {Multimodal sentiment analysis faces significant challenges in real-world applications due to the frequent absence of modalities caused by privacy concerns, device limitations, or security policies. This article introduces a random modality dropout based on generative approach (RMDG), designed to enhance the robustness and performance of multimodal models under various modality absence scenarios. The RMDG method employs a generative approach during the training phase, where random modality dropout is applied to simulate missing modalities. By leveraging the remaining modalities to predict and regenerate the key features of the missing ones, the model effectively adapts to dynamic and unpredictable modality absences. This strategy not only eliminates the need for separate training or adjustments for each modality combination but also significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of sentiment analysis in incomplete multimodal data scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMDG outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in both complete and missing modality conditions.},

  abstract     = {With widespread adoption globally, micromobility like bikes, e-scooters, and e-bikes has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to complement existing transportation modes and promote sustainable transportation. Understanding micromobility user behaviors in urban areas is essential for improving safety and comfort, as well as for informing infrastructure development and policy. Prior investigations on micromobility user behaviors primarily relied on statistical and kinematic modeling approaches. Although these methods have proven effective in characterizing user behaviors at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered data analytics and behavioral modeling is revolutionizing the field. Recently, advanced machine learning models, such as gradient boosting decision tree, graph convolutional network, and inverse reinforcement learning, has introduced new momentum into micromobility user behavior research. This article explores recent developments, research opportunities, and future directions in this field, leveraging the power of more generic AI approaches.},

National/international AI governance and risk management policies and frameworks have identified a core set of tenets for TRAI, including fairness, safety, privacy, security, transparency, explainability, and responsible deployment. Responsible AI processes/tools (RAPs) are solutions designed to operationalize and implement the tenets, serving as a middle layer between the tenets and real-world AI-embedded processes. In recent years, the design of RAPs has emerged as an important avenue for computational and social science researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. We highlight six important research directions for the design of RAPs. Using a real-world case study, we describe the importance of each research direction and illustrate current challenges.},

  abstract     = {Modern learning models, while powerful, often exhibit a complexity level that renders them opaque black boxes, lacking transparency and hindering our understanding of their decision-making processes. Opacity challenges the practical application of machine learning, especially in critical domains requiring informed decisions. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) addresses that challenge, unraveling the complexity of black boxes by providing explanations. Feature attribution/importance XAI stands out for its ability to delineate the significance of input features in predictions. However, most attribution methods have limitations, such as instability, when divergent explanations result from similar or the same instance. This work introduces T-Explainer, a novel additive attribution explainer based on the Taylor expansion that offers desirable properties, such as local accuracy and consistency. We demonstrate T-Explainer’s effectiveness and stability over multiple runs in quantitative benchmark experiments against well-known attribution methods. Additionally, we provide several tools to evaluate and visualize explanations, turning T-Explainer into a comprehensive XAI framework.},

  abstract     = {Semantic maps provide information on road elements, which is crucial for ensuring driving safety. However, previous methods mostly focus on normal weather conditions, neglecting the challenges of scene feature extraction caused by image degradation in complex weather scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a normal weather scene-guided complex weather scene map construction network (NCMC-Net). First, we propose a scene feature sharing module based on the complement learning mechanism. This module alternately updates the shared feature pool with features from normal and complex weather scenes during two training stages. Second, we design a feature refinement module based on the channel attention mechanism to adjust the intensity of multichannel features selectively. The two modules facilitate the extraction of optimal complex weather scene features guided by features from normal weather scenes. Experimental results on the complex weather scene dataset nuScenes-W validate our model’s performance.},

  abstract     = {Despite substantial progress in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a systematic characterization of DRL agents’ robustness to unexpected events in the environment is relatively understudied. Such unexpected events (“novelties”), especially those that are more structural than parametric, may significantly deteriorate the performance of DRL agents, leading them to be unfit for open-world environments and applications. However, not all novelties affect an agent’s performance equally. Unfortunately, even with reasonable and constrained definitions of the problem, the space of all novelties can be (at least) exponential. Hence, an effective search strategy is required to find novelties that can adversely affect the agent. This article presents a formalism for this problem and proposes a deep Q-learning-based novelty search strategy that efficiently and systematically finds candidate (potentially complex) novelties with significant negative impact on a DRL agent. We conduct a detailed set of experiments in a stochastic multiagent game environment (Monopoly) with complex decision-making properties.},
