  abstract     = {Ensuring the safety and well-being of children is increasingly important, especially in a world where visual content is pervasive. This article proposes a novel multimodal, multilingual, and multiclass sentiment analysis method for social media content, aimed at improving content moderation for child safety. Our approach integrates textual, visual, and audio data from videos, categorizing sentiment into four levels: positive, slightly negative, negative, and strongly negative, enabling granular detection of harmful content. To enhance explainability and trust, we also leverage interpretable mechanisms to analyze the contributions of each modality. Evaluation of our method demonstrates strong generalization across diverse video types, and demonstrated that most misclassifications arise from annotation inconsistencies or ambiguities, highlighting the model’s reliability in real-world scenarios. Notably, when compared to lightweight multimodal language models, our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness. Overall, the evaluation confirms its effectiveness for video sentiment analysis and content moderation, particularly for child safety.},

Although guidelines for developing human-centered models are essential, government intervention is urgently needed to incentivize and support companies’ ethical behavior. This article explores the idea of ethics-driven incentives to help the AI industry better understand, address, and mitigate the societal impacts of these technologies. We propose an ethics-driven incentive spectrum tailored to the industry’s unique challenges by analyzing existing incentive schemes related to environmental sustainability, transparency, and corporate social responsibility. By aligning public and private interests, these incentives can catalyze the deployment of ethical intelligent systems, ensuring that they benefit society equitably and responsibly. Our study concludes with a series of future research directions, inviting experts and professionals to delve deeper into this research direction and help to realize the potential of AI for the welfare of society.},

In response, governments worldwide are increasingly interested in leveraging advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), to enhance efficiency and optimize policy outcomes. This article explores the application of large language models (LLMs), a subset of generative AI, to streamline tasks and improve decision making in spectrum management and regulation. It examines the various roles of LLMs in this field and addresses associated challenges. Through empirical case studies and experimental findings, the article demonstrates how LLMs can profoundly transform spectrum management and regulation practices. The study also offers insights into effectively integrating AI into regulatory frameworks, providing practical lessons and best practices for governmental AI initiatives.},

Recognizing this transformative potential, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) launched a pilot initiative to explore the integration of GenAI techniques into its daily operation for performance excellence, where 22 projects were launched in May 2024. Within these projects, this article presents the development of the intelligent agent Pubbie as a case study, targeting the automation of performance measurement, data management, and insight reporting at the NRC. Cutting-edge techniques are explored, including LLM orchestration and semantic embedding via RoBERTa, while strategic fine-tuning and few-shot learning approaches are incorporated to infuse domain knowledge at an affordable cost. The user-friendly interface of Pubbie allows general government users to input queries in natural language and easily upload or download files with a simple button click, greatly reducing manual efforts and accessibility barriers.},

  abstract     = {The ability of large language models (LLMs) to interpret and generate human-like text, along with their inbuilt knowledge and reasoning skills, has opened the door for many new applications. We develop a novel LLM agent as an autonomous cyber defender and benchmark it using the CAGE-2 public challenge, which evaluates submitted agents in a simulated network. The agent uses a pretrained LLM to interpret a text description of the challenge and choose the best defensive action given a network observation. Its performance is on par with the most successful reinforcement learning agent submitted to CAGE-2 with the advantages of explainability and avoiding training episodes, but with the cost of requiring LLM prompt engineering. Finally, we test the LLM agent experimentally to explore how LLM temperature and prompt complexity affect performance. We show that higher complexity prompts significantly improve performance, while LLM temperature has only a minor effect.},

  abstract     = {Over the last few years, there has been increasing use of drones by terror groups and in armed conflict. Several technologies have been developed to detect drone flights. However, much less work has been done on the drone threat prediction problem (DTPP): Predicting which drone trajectories are threatening and which ones are not. We propose the drone early warning system (DEWS), a framework to solve this problem. Solving DTPP early is key. Once a drone starts on its trajectory, we show that DEWS can make accurate predictions within 20–30 s of the flight with an F1-score of over 80% on data about a major European city. We study the tradeoff between earliness of predictions and accuracy. We identify the key features that ensure good predictions.},
