  abstract     = {Anovel observer-based fuzzy adaptive fault-tolerant control approach is proposed for multimotor synchronously driving servo systems in the situation of a single-motor malfunction. Different from most existing fault-tolerant control strategies based on analytical redundancy, this article leverages inherent hardware advantages of multimotor systems and develops a structural redundancy-based fault-tolerant control by directly turning off the faulty motor, which enhances the reliability of the remaining healthy motors driving the asymmetric system. To further address the unknown nonlinearities and measurement inaccuracies introduced by the unbalanced faulty system, a fuzzy logic system is developed to identify the state-based unbalanced torque and additional friction dynamics, and a state observer is then designed to estimate the load speed. Moreover, the command-filtered backstepping technique is utilized in the control design process to reduce the computational complexity caused by the repeated signal derivations. After stability analysis, an experiment on the multimotor prototype is implemented to show the effectiveness of the designed fault-tolerant control approach.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on achieving hierarchical optimal synchronization in a fractional-order nonlinear multiagent system (FONMAS) composed of a single leader and multiple followers, analyzed within the framework of the Stackelberg–Nash game theory. The leader makes decisions by anticipating the optimal responses of all followers, whereas each follower concurrently reacts optimally to the leader’s strategy by engaging in a Nash game. To obtain the optimal control policy of the FONMAS, a regularized fuzzy reinforcement learning approach is proposed. First, a fractional-order (FO) Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation in coupled form is formulated, which serves as the basis for deriving the optimal control policies of both the leader and the followers. It is further proven that these strategies constitute a Stackelberg–Nash equilibrium. Next, due to the asymmetry among agents, solving the FO coupled HJB equations becomes challenging. To address this, a hierarchical learning framework grounded in FO value iteration is proposed, which depends solely on partial knowledge of the system dynamics. We demonstrate that, given mild coupling assumptions, this method converges asymptotically to equilibrium policies. Furthermore, a regularized actor–critic framework with fuzzy logic is employed to estimate the cost function and optimal control policy, and the FO weight update rules are developed by formulating a Lyapunov function for the optimal fuzzy weight deviation, ensuring convergence to optimal weight values. Ultimately, both theoretical analysis and simulation results support the efficiency of the proposed method.},

To address this problem, a performance index comprising local containment error, control energy, and fault effects, is first formulated under the zero-sum differential game, where controllers and faults are treated as opposing players with different signs. Subsequently, improved generalized fuzzy hyperbolic model-based approximation techniques are used to identify unknown dynamics and learn optimal FTCC policies incorporating reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, to enhance the weight convergence performance and relax the traditional persistence of excitation condition, a practical fixed-time identifier is developed based on the generalized fuzzy hyperbolic model by integrating practical fixed-time system identification technique with experience replay technique. Then, using the generalized fuzzy hyperbolic model as the critic, a fuzzy-RL algorithm with experience replay is developed to learn optimal FTCC policies from the coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equations. The containment error and the critic approximation error are ensured to be ultimately uniformly bounded using the Lyapunov method.

However, the actuator failure and unavoidable external disturbances may cause deviations in the DO concentration, and even destabilize the system. In this article, a fault tolerant control approach utilizing adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and experience replay (ER) is developed with the purpose of realizing robust control of the DO concentration under the influence of the actuator failure and external disturbances. First, a novel cost function considering actuator multiplicative failure and disturbances is constructed. Based on this cost function, the control law is designed, which can effectively suppress the adverse effects of the actuator failure and external disturbances on control performance. Second, the control input, failure input, and cost function are estimated via two action networks and one critic network. Specifically, the collaborative interaction of the three networks contributes to get the optimal robust control law. Third, an improved ER technique named disturbance-focused ER is designed for adjusting the critic network and action networks, where a metric rooted in disturbance magnitude and time-difference error is designed to dynamically adjust data and batch sizes, for effectively suppressing the external disturbances. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed fault tolerant control method based on ADP with ER is confirmed through simulation experiments.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical fuzzy systems (HFSs), as a type of deep-structured fuzzy model, exhibit strong expressive power, excellent scalability, high flexibility, and desirable interpretability, making them highly promising for tackling a variety of complex problems. Despite their widespread applications in various fields such as control, classification, and modeling, very little research has been conducted to analyze how inputs influence the system’s behavior. Consequently, this article presents an in-depth analysis of a class of incremental HFSs (IHFSs) from two perspectives of input importance. First, an enhanced mutual information-based input importance ranking method is proposed, enabling a more effective and concise evaluation of the degree to which inputs influence or depend on the ground truth. Next, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, both at the subsystem level and the entire system level, is performed to illustrate the impact of inputs on the system. Specifically, a novel sensitivity metric, termed average sensitivity (AS), is proposed to simplify sensitivity calculations, thereby significantly reducing computational costs. Several related theorems are provided to theoretically analyze the sensitivity of the system to inputs under specific conditions. Furthermore, an evaluation framework based on the AS, called ASEF, is proposed for assessing the rationality of the constructed IHFS structure, which facilitates the effective design of high-performance systems for modeling tasks. A series of experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods. Finally, several potential research directions are suggested to drive further progress.},

Such a framework operates in a parallel structure where the model-free predefined-time controller guarantees the transient performance while the proposed network controller provides appropriate torques to handle failures and uncertainties, which leads to a solution for both normal and faulty conditions. Significant features of this study are that the control design does not depend on any information about system dynamics, and theoretically, the predefined-time convergence is accomplished by means of the online parameter learning algorithm. Moreover, a hierarchical self-organizing algorithm is embedded in the proposed network controller to overcome the network structure complexity and the input partition problem.

Although many methods have been developed from diverse perspectives, to our knowledge, none can provide fine-grained hypergraph fuzzy community information, and the quality of identified crisp partitions is often limited. This study defines a set of novel concepts of multi-scale hypergraph fuzzy memberships that systematically quantify the partial belongingness (i.e., membership grades) among nodes, hyperedges, and hypergraph communities within the interval [0,1], thereby revealing the multi-scale partial topological affiliations. Furthermore, the multiscale hypergraph fuzzy memberships are employed to develop a general framework, named fuzzy membership-assisted hypergraph modularity optimization (FMHMO), aiming to approximate the modularity-optimal crisp hypergraph partition. The FMHMO framework comprises two key strategies: Hyperedge similarity-based hypergraph reduction (HS-HR) and fuzzy membership-based hypergraph partition recovery (FM-HPR). In particular, HS-HR reduces a hypergraph to a simple weighted graph, mapping hyperedges as nodes and their interactions as edges using novel hyperedge similarity as weights. Thereby, preserving intrahyperedge and interhyperedge topologies of the original hypergraph. FM-HPR recovers a hypergraph partition from the approximately modularity-optimal weighted graph partition by quantifying the fuzzy memberships of bridge nodes connecting multiple incident hyperedges, thereby enabling precise assignment of their crisp hypergraph community affiliations. Experimental results in both synthetic and real-world datasets indicate the superiority of FMHMO over state-of-the-art hypergraph community detection algorithms in accuracy and modularity quality.},

  abstract     = {Recently, many laws and regulations have granted users the right to be forgotten, i.e., the right to require data controllers to delete user data. Various methods for machine unlearning have been proposed to remove individual data points. However, they do not scale to the scenarios where larger groups of features are to be removed. To address this challenge, we propose MAFRO, an optimal-granularity fuzzy decision rule–based classifier that accelerates unlearning via influence functions. Building on granular computing (GrC), MAFRO first selects a minimal reduct of attributes, then constructs fuzzy granules with a Gaussian membership function to extract concise decision rules and realizes unlearning through the influence function. Specifically, instead of training with the full set of attributes, we use the reduct, a minimal subset of attributes that can classify the data with the same accuracy as the full set of attributes. Next, we extract fuzzy rules based on the reduct. Finally, fusing the generated rules establishes the linear model with strongly convex loss functions. In this way, MAFRO can quantify the divergence caused by attribute deleting and update the model without retraining it, thereby adapting the influence of data removal on the model and accelerating the unlearning process. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate MAFRO on 10 typical datasets in terms of performance and unlearning speed. We compare MAFRO with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that MAFRO enhances accuracy by an average of 6.96%, and achieves up to 236× speedup for attribute unlearning tasks.},

Existing ensemble clustering methods face two notable challenges: 1) developing a new ensemble framework that yields a final clustering result matching the ground-truth cluster count and 2) revealing consistency among all base clustering results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel one-step fuzzy ensemble clustering method (OS-FECM) that incorporates ground-truth cluster number graphs. Initially, OS-FECM establishes a one-step fuzzy ensemble framework that directly integrates all base fuzzy clustering results (i.e., membership matrices) with varying cluster counts, thereby eliminating reliance on the coassociation matrix typical of existing two-step ensemble frameworks. Furthermore, we construct a ground-truth cluster number graph, which maps the number of clusters in each base clustering result to the ground-truth cluster count in the final ensemble result. This graph reveals the consistency among all base fuzzy clustering results and illustrates the relationships between clusters in the base results and the ground-truth clusters. It is then embedded into the corresponding base fuzzy clustering results to enhance the final ensemble result. Finally, we employ an alternating optimization method alongside a weighting mechanism to derive the final ensemble clustering result and adaptively assign importance to each base clustering result. Experimental evaluations across various datasets demonstrate that OS-FECM achieves clustering performance that is at least comparable to, if not superior to, that of other comparative methods.},

  abstract     = {This article provides theoretical analysis of the fixed-time multi-almost-periodicity in switched fuzzy neural networks, employing multicontroller strategies and a state-dependent switching mechanism. Utilizing the Ascoli–Arzela theorem, the properties of $M$-matrix, Lyapunov functions method, and some inequality techniques, we establish some sufficient conditions to ascertain that the number of exponentially stable almost-periodic solutions can be up to $4^{n}$, where $n$ is the number of neurons. Furthermore, we design various controllers to achieve the fixed-time stability for various almost-periodic solutions located in the positive invariant sets. Then, the settling time for the switched fuzzy networks to achieve multi-almost-periodicity is estimated. It is noteworthy to state that this article considers fixed-time multiperiodicity and fixed-time multistability as special cases of fixed-time multi-almost-periodicity. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {An adaptive fuzzy dynamic event-triggered control approach is proposed for a fleet of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating under jointly connected switching topologies. The primary challenge lies in addressing asynchronous switching topologies caused by topology identification delays. To tackle this, asynchronous distributed observers are constructed, and topological switching rules are designed, ensuring that all follower UAVs can estimate the leader UAV’s state by leveraging asynchronous distributed state errors. In addition, a novel dynamic event-triggering mechanism is introduced. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed triggering function directly couples the external state variable with the last triggered value, dynamically regulates the triggered interval based on the control performance, and minimizes the number of occurrences while maintaining the system performance. An adaptive fuzzy translational and rotational controller is further developed to enable the follower UAVs to accurately track the state of the leader UAV while ensuring that all closed-loop states remain globally uniformly ultimately bounded. The proposed strategies are validated for effectiveness and superiority through a semiphysical simulation platform.},

This article addresses the issues of dissipative sliding mode control and dissipativity-based sliding mode tracking control for fuzzy SPSs in the presence of time-varying delays under a state-dependent switching paradigm. First, a bumpless transfer technique and a hysteresis switching mechanism for fuzzy switched systems are employed to mitigate input chattering and avoid high-frequency switching, respectively. Then, a novel fuzzy integral switching sliding surface is formulated to accommodate the characteristics of nonlinear switched systems. Based on the multiple linear copositive Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the closed-loop positive system is asymptotically stable with strict $(q,r)$-$\alpha$ dissipativity and bumpless transfer performance under the proposed controller. Furthermore, the dissipative tracking control design is investigated via the designed fuzzy integral sliding mode surface, with guaranteed reachability under positivity and stability conditions. Ultimately, the feasibility of the mentioned fuzzy sliding mode control strategy is verified through two examples with a Lotka–Volterra population model.},

  abstract     = {The federated fuzzy C-means (federated FCM) extends the traditional Fuzzy C-means (FCM) to the federated learning (FL) scenario, aiming to address the data privacy preservation issue of soft clustering in distributed environments. However, a significant challenge persists with existing federated FCM algorithms, i.e., they struggle to converge effectively in complex heterogeneous scenarios, leading to unstable clustering outcomes. Here the complex heterogeneous scenarios stem from the combination of nonindependently and identically distributed (non-IID) data across different clients (statistical heterogeneity), coupled with the involvement of only some clients in each iteration (systematic heterogeneity). While prior research has attempted to address the impact of statistical heterogeneity in FL scenarios, it has overlooked the issue of system heterogeneity. In response, this article proposes a novel federated FCM algorithm (SC-FFCM) that remains robust even in such complex heterogeneous scenarios. First, the client-side clustering module of SC-FFCM adopts a gradient-based FCM algorithm, facilitating corrections to the direction of local optimization. Second, the algorithm introduces a control variates technique to rectify update bias during the iteration process, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of random client sampling and non-IID data distribution on the algorithm convergence. Finally, the proposed algorithm approximates the ideal federated FCM algorithm. Experimental studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Existing approaches typically rely on global-level feature learning or noise disambiguation; however, they often struggle to effectively capture the multigranularity relationships inherent in feature and label spaces, and tend to overlook critical intrafeature information essential for accurate label discrimination. To address these limitations, we propose a novel partial multilabel learning framework based on a dynamic coarse-to-fine granularity feature aggregation strategy, which hierarchically extracts feature representations across multiple levels of granularity and dynamically emphasizes label-relevant feature components. Specifically, the dynamic fine-granularity graph captures label-specific local information by modeling the fuzzy aggregations among fine-granularity feature components, while the dynamic coarse-granularity graph learns adaptive label representations by identifying feature-aware correlations of labels and suppressing noise. By jointly leveraging these two complementary granularity levels, the model effectively integrates multilevel semantic relationships and enhances the overall discriminative capacity of the learned features. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets under varying noise conditions demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in partial multilabel classification.},

In industrial production, operators often lack a comprehensive and objective assessment of the operating conditions of an SAG process and usually make different control decisions based on experience to meet production demands. This article explains a two-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method for the load and efficiency of an SAG process. First, the operation mechanism of an SAG process is analyzed, and the evaluation indicators of load and efficiency are determined. Then, the levels and weights of each indicator are determined by combining expert experience and actual production data. Finally, the operating load level is first evaluated by combining the information entropy weight and fuzzy computation. When the load level is within an acceptable range, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of the efficiency level is then performed. The modeling method of efficiency indicator, circulating load ratio (CLR), is integrated with random forest and Bayesian optimization to carry out the efficiency evaluation. Experiments using actual production data demonstrate CLR modeling performance with a mean absolute error of 1.084% and a mean absolute percentage error of 9.415%. The accuracy of the operating efficiency evaluation is 81.69%. This method provides an objective and uniform criterion for operators to evaluate the operating load and efficiency of an SAG process, thus guiding the regulation of actual production.},

  abstract     = {Pixel-level histopathology image segmentation plays a vital role in computational pathology, and weakly supervised segmentation methods, which rely solely on image-level labels, have shown great potential. However, most existing weakly supervised segmentation methods are limited by the fixed receptive field of convolutional neural networks, and overlook the uncertainty of the distribution of different tissue types and the fuzziness of class boundaries, resulting in limited segmentation effects. To address these problems, we propose a fuzzy-enhanced class-aware attention based Transformer (FCAformer) for weakly supervised histopathology image segmentation. FCAformer employs the Transformer architecture for model global contextual information, which effectively alleviates the limitation of fixed receptive field on the size of attention map in traditional methods. Subsequently, FCAformer integrates fuzzy system to model the uncertainty in histopathology images. Specifically, it assigns membership function to the output feature map of the last layer of Transformer encoder, generates fuzzy membership matrix, extracts fuzzy features by combining three fuzzy rules, and finally fuses these features to generate fuzzy attention map. This attention map guides the network to learn the characteristics of different tissue types and improve the fuzziness of class boundaries, thereby improving the modeling ability of the model on uncertain tissue distribution and fuzzy areas. In addition, based on the idea of contrastive learning, we design contrastive class token (CCT) loss to further enhance the distinguishability between different class labels. Extensive experiments on LUAD-HistoSeg and BCSS-WSSS datasets demonstrate that FCAformer achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance in weakly supervised segmentation tasks.},

Additionally, it addresses the shortcomings of traditional objective functions, such as mean squared error (MSE), which fail to capture the complexities inherent in high-dimensional and uncertain datasets. The BPFNN framework integrates Bayesian probabilistic modeling with advanced fuzzy clustering techniques, utilizing a non-Gaussian probability density function to better represent data uncertainties. A hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo strategy, combining Metropolis-Hastings for membership updates and Gibbs sampling for cluster parameter estimation, is employed to effectively model uncertainty. For the learning of connection weights, the generalized cross-entropy loss function is applied, and the iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm is used to update the weights, allowing for a more precise quantification of the divergence between predicted and ground truth labels. Experimental evaluations on several benchmark datasets, as well as a high-dimensional laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) spectral dataset, demonstrate that the proposed BPFNN significantly outperforms both traditional methods and State-of-the-Art techniques in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. Notably, BPFNN achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.2% over conventional models on benchmark datasets, with a 5.3% improvement on the LIBS dataset, highlighting its substantial advancement in the field.},

With the numerous efforts contributed by related researchers, impressive success has been achieved in employing the external knowledge to enhance the sentiment representation. However, in previous works, the utilization of external knowledge is quite straightforward, which does not match the sentiment characteristics of human beings. Thus, this work proposes a novel humanized ABSA method, namely, fuzzy humanized sentiment-assisted graph attention networks (FHSGAT). Preliminary, to acquire the essential semantic features, the sentence is reconstructed by the manually designed prompt template, which would assist the pretrained language model in generating the target-guided semantic representation. In addition, based on the normal dependence graph, triple-dimensional external knowledge is injected into the corresponding nodes. Specifically, this article leverages the Gaussian membership function to fuzzify the sentiment knowledge-enhanced nodes, enabling the networks to obtain the humanized sentiment relationship between graph nodes, namely, fuzzy humanized syntactic features. Besides, due to its exquisite performance in information fusion, graph attention networks are utilized to accomplish the integration of target-guided semantic representation and fuzzy humanized syntactic features synchronously. Eventually, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method FHSGAT, extensive experiments are conducted on five publicly and widely used benchmarks, and the corresponding results show the performance of the proposed approach outperforms the state of the art obviously.},

  abstract     = {Constraints from the external environment and personal experiences may hinder decision makers from offering complete fuzzy preference relations in situations of group decision making. Conflicts in individual different preferences impede any effort of reaching consensus. Addressing such challenges, traditional methods typically isolate fuzzy preference relation completion and consensus reaching as two separate parts, while improving consistency level through iterative processes. However, such an approach affects the efficiency of consensus achievement. Furthermore, existing studies utilize limited known objective information for filling missing values, while neglecting the excavation of indirect preferences that requires lower cognitive capacity from decision makers. Consequently, the credibility of decision results is greatly reduced. Through integrating indirect preferences, this article introduces a consensus framework that concurrently accomplishes fuzzy preference relation completion and consensus reaching. In the framework, an ordinal regression consensus discriminant model is constructed to first assess the compatibility of information sets. Subsequently, to accurately identify and manage conflicting information, we design a conflict feedback mechanism by considering the minimum cost elimination consensus model and the minimum cost adjustment consensus model. Our proposed method not only deeply explores decision makers’ implicit preferences, but also achieves the integration of three goals: missing value prediction, consensus reaching, and additive consistency realization. It avoids multiple consistency iterations and distortions, while enhancing the reliability of estimated values and the efficiency of consensus reaching. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through case analysis, sensitivity analysis, and comparative analysis.},

In order to address these challenges, in this work, we propose an adaptive FCM clustering algorithm based on anisotropic Gaussian kernel function, which facilitates the process of feature selection for multidimensional data with fewer iterations after feature reduction based on updating the kernel width vector. In order to enhance the classification accuracy, we assign adaptive weights to each sample and adjust these weights to mitigate the impact of outliers on classification accuracy. Unlike traditional fuzzy clustering algorithms, we employ the particle swarm optimization algorithm with time-varying acceleration coefficients to determine the global optimal parameters, thus reducing the computational resources and enhancing the algorithm’s efficiency. The experimental results based on 16 publicly available datasets validate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher classification accuracy with minimal number of iterations.},

Second, graph-based FCM typically separates graph construction from clustering, overlooking the knowledge interaction between graphs and clustering, obtaining suboptimal performance. Third, exploring the similarity structures among all samples is computationally expensive for large-scale tasks. To solve these dilemmas, we propose a scalable fuzzy clustering with collaborative structure learning and preservation (CSLP), which simultaneously leverages both cluster information and similarity structures to learn an optimal membership degree representation. Specifically, a self-weighted manner is devised to measure the sample importance, thereby reducing the adverse impacts of outliers. Moreover, the graph is updated according to the data similarities in the membership degree representation, such that CSLP collaboratively learns the graph and membership degrees in a mutually reinforcing manner. Thus, the similarity structures are fully explored during clustering processes and preserved in the learned membership degrees, enhancing the discrimination of clustering labels. To further improve efficiency, an acceleration solution is developed to reduce the computational cost of CSLP by propagating membership degrees from potential centers to samples, making CSLP scalable for large-scale tasks. An iterative strategy is designed to solve the formulated objective function. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSLP outperforms other fuzzy clustering methods in terms of both effectiveness and scalability.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel neuro-fuzzy-based evolution-guided Q-learning (EGQL) algorithm is established for solving the optimal control problem of unknown nonlinear systems. To enhance the accuracy for approximating the Q-function, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is leveraged, which offers superior precision compared to traditional polynomial approximations commonly used in adaptive dynamic programming. Despite its advantages, the ANFIS-based approximation faces challenges in obtaining the derivative of the Q-function with respect to the control input. To address this limitation, evolutionary algorithms are integrated into EGQL, eliminating the need for gradient information by directly minimizing the Q-function values to derive optimal control strategies. This integration enables precise and robust exploration of the solution space, resulting in accurate and reliable control policies. Furthermore, convergence and monotonic improvement are ensured by the EGQL algorithm, making it suitable for uncertain and nonlinear environments. The effectiveness and superiority of the ANFIS-based EGQL algorithm are validated through simulation results. The developed algorithm achieves a 3.1% reduction in total cost compared to the traditional approach, demonstrating superior control performance.},

In addition, traditional graph clustering faces computational challenges due to regular graph construction and spectral decomposition, and binary indicators hinder interpretability in uncertain scenarios. We propose a novel method termed Fast Fuzzy Graph Cut (FFGC) to overcome key issues in graph clustering by: Preventing information loss by tackling the original graph cut problem; eliminating solution deviation by directly solving for the target variable; alleviating computational burdens by employing anchor graphs in place of regular graphs; and enhancing flexibility by incorporating a regularization term to soften the cluster indicator. The use of a fuzzy cluster indicator within the graph cut framework expands FFGC’s applicability to a wider range of real-world data, increasing both its adaptability and interpretability. In addition, we develop two efficient optimization algorithms to solve the resulting objective problem. Extensive experimental evaluations validate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of FFGC in clustering tasks.},

Finally, the output of F-KSCNs is obtained by comprehensively evaluating the significance of each submodel. Compared to the original KSCNs, the proposed F-KSCNs have stronger fuzzy inference ability and can deal with rule-based information.

  abstract     = {Clustering is an important unsupervised learning technique widely applied in data analysis and pattern recognition. Graph-based clustering methods have gained attention for their ability to effectively model complex data structures. However, traditional methods mainly rely on first-order proximity information, which struggles to capture high-order structural relationships between data points. Such limitation can significantly degrade clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel fuzzy clustering approach leveraging orthogonal tensor decomposition on high-order anchor graphs (OTDHAG). Unlike conventional high-order graph-based methods that rely on self-multiplication of proximity matrices, which are computationally expensive, our method introduces the high-order anchor graph with low computational complexity, and exploits high-order proximity information via orthogonal tensor factorization on high-order anchor graphs. Meanwhile, tensor nuclear norm regularization is adopted to enhance clustering consistency, thereby improving clustering quality. Experiments on 10 benchmark datasets (e.g., MNIST, Wine, PIE) demonstrate that OTDHAG outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, achieving 92.3% accuracy on Wine (vs. 86.5% for DenoHOG) and 88.7% NMI on MNIST (vs. 82.1% for AOPL-Root). In conclusion, OTDHAG not only significantly improves clustering accuracy and computational efficiency but also provides a scalable solution for clustering tasks.},

  abstract     = {The secondary membership functions (MFs) of type-2 (T2) fuzzy sets (FSs) are generally assumed to be convex, normal, and upper semicontinuous. Although not explicitly stated, this fact can be detected by taking a look at the $\alpha$-cuts of their join and meet in vertical-slice format. These two operations induce $[0,1]_{\mathcal {F}}$, i.e., the complete lattice of the convex normal upper semicontinuous FSs on $[0, 1]$ together with the so-called convolution order. In this article, we deduce the $\alpha$-cut representations of suprema and infima over finite and infinite sets that occur in the inference mechanisms of general type-2 (GT2) fuzzy inference systems (FISs). We continue by developing a complete, albeit not distributive, lattice structure for the class of all convex upper semicontinuous FSs on $[0, 1]$, denoted ${\mathcal {F}}_{CU}$, which permits designing T2 FISs involving T2 FSs whose secondary MFs are not necessarily normal. Using our formulae of the $\alpha$-cuts of suprema and infima in $[0,1]_{\mathcal {F}}$ and ${\mathcal {F}}_{CU}$, whose elements we describe using so-called anti-dilations, we prove that $[0,1]_{\mathcal {F}}$ is a closed sublattice of ${\mathcal {F}}_{CU}$. We also expand on the lattice-theoretical relations between $[0,1]_{\mathcal {F}}$ and the complete lattices of the convex (strictly) normal FSs. In addition, we show that $[0,1]_{\mathcal {F}}$ and ${\mathcal {F}}_{CU}$ contain complete sublattices of (extended) interval type-2 (IT2) FSs. With these results at hand, it becomes easy to perform the transitions FISs under the minimum t-norm $\to$ (closed) IT2 FISs $\to$ GT2 FISs currently used in practice $\to$ GT2 FISs having not necessarily normal secondary MFs.},

This innovative approach integrates physiological signals and behavioral data, employs multiple multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to learn the fuzzy measures of single base learners and complementary increments, then constructs all fuzzy measures, and finally achieves an interpretable decision-level fusion process through fuzzy integrals. Furthermore, we incorporate model-agnostic meta-learning for conducting few-shot domain-adaptive training, mitigating the issues related to high individual variability levels and the scarcity of multimodal depression data.

  abstract     = {Facial movement-based depression recognition has garnered considerable attention in automatic depression detection field in recent years. Current methods typically seek to establish a uniform depression discrimination criterion and often overlook interindividual differences in facial movements, which lead to a decrease in the accuracy of models. A closer examination of the clinical diagnostic criteria for depression reveals that individuals with depression exhibit a wide variety of symptoms. This suggests that even individuals with similar levels of depression may exhibit significantly different facial movements. To address this challenge, this study introduces a novel framework for depression assessment—multiscale video adaptive graph network (MVAGN). By leveraging the information transmission capabilities of graph neural network to balance the relationship between individual differences and commonalities to achieve more accurate depression identification. MVAGN consists of three modules: the multiscale video feature extractor (MVFE), the hybrid feature interaction graph module (HFIGM), and the adaptive hybrid graph network (AHGN). MVFE extracts multiscale features from the video, HFIGM transforms these features into graph representations, and AHGN facilitates information transfer between nodes to reduce individual feature differences, ultimately providing a more precise estimation of depression severity. Experiments conducted on the AVEC2013 and AVEC2014 datasets demonstrate that MVAGN achieves state-of-the-art performance. This article proposes that building a fuzzy system with a compact kernel and a loose periphery provides a viable path for recognizing depression.},

  abstract     = {Image aesthetic quality assessment (IAQA) aims to simulate user perceptions to judge the aesthetic quality of images. Due to the high subjectivity of users and the complexity of image aesthetics, modeling IAQA solely at the image level is a compromise. Consequently, existing methods mainly focus on multimodal-based models and achieve effective performance. These methods explore aesthetic comments on images to characterize users and serve as auxiliary text information for multimodal modeling. Unfortunately, this may suffer from two limitations. One limitation is that aesthetic comments are often unavailable for an unknown image in the test phase, and another limitation is that the semantic information of these comments may be uncertain and fuzzy. Therefore, this article proposes a progressively generated text-assisted IAQA method, aiming to address the lack of aesthetic comments and the fuzziness of aesthetic judgments in these comments. Specifically, we first adopt a multimodal large language model to generate aesthetic comments on images by simulating user perceptions and utilize the generated comments to characterize their aesthetic perception to assist in the pretraining of our multimodal-based IAQA model. Then, we design an attribute prediction module to determine the attribute levels of aesthetic judgments and utilize text template construction to further generate explicit descriptions of image aesthetics. Finally, we leverage the generated attribute descriptions to further assist in training our IAQA model. By progressively generating textual auxiliary descriptions of aesthetics for images, the proposed model can gradually determine the aesthetic quality of the images. Massive experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream methods on multiple IAQA datasets.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a sudden shift toward remote and hybrid work, placing IT technologies at the forefront of organizational practices and revealing a spectrum of emotional responses among employees. While conventional wisdom suggests that high salaries in the IT industry safeguard well-being, this study challenges the notion that “money cannot buy happiness” by demonstrating that technostress, social isolation, and “Zoom fatigue” persist regardless of income level. Drawing on a longitudinal dataset collected at three one-year intervals, the research employs fuzzy semantics to translate qualitative survey data into quantitative descriptors, basket analysis to identify consistent behavioral patterns, and a Minimal Spanning Tree-based isolation forest enhanced by Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy rules to detect anomalies. The findings indicate a nuanced interplay of negative and positive emotions, with fear, anxiety, and fatigue frequently coexisting alongside pride, energy, and satisfaction. Some anomalies in responses reveal issues, such as random guessing or minimal IT usage, underscoring the importance of filtering out low-quality data. Crucially, the emotional outcomes are influenced not only by pandemic-related disruption but also by psychosocial and organizational factors—such as role complexity, skill requirements, and managerial support—providing a holistic view of how and why IT-based work can foster both strain and fulfillment. These insights hold practical implications for employers, suggesting that comprehensive well-being strategies, rather than monetary incentives alone, are pivotal in promoting a healthier, more resilient IT workforce.},
