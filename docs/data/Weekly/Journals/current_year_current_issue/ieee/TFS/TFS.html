By introducing a novel prescribed-performance transformation, the initial error of each subsystem can be confined in the constrained area for arbitrary system initialization. Then, the designed controller can guarantee global stability of the studied system for all initial system states, and can allow the system nonlinearities to be completely unknown. The odd-rational-power terms are divided into two parts appropriately by using mathematical tools, which facilitates the control design under sensor faults and odd-rational powers while the odd-rational powers are allowed to be unknown. It is proved that the proposed controller can guarantee the global stability of nonlinear systems with unknown system nonlinearities under odd-rational powers and sensor faults. Finally, the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed method are highlighted by both numerical and semi-physical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Microwave filters (MFs) are indispensable in communication systems for selecting specific frequency signals. The tuning of MFs is a demanding and time-consuming task, which can be addressed by the inverse decision-making model (IDMM). However, two main challenges arise in the sampling process for IDMM, namely, low efficiency due to the large number of samples and poor adaptability in the presence of uncertain initial positions. To overcome these challenges, a fuzzy nonuniform sampling (FNUS) method is proposed, leveraging the flexibility of the fuzzy logic system. Specifically, an adaptive sampling framework based on a fuzzy logic system is presented to handle the uncertainty of initial positions. Under this framework, a nonuniform sampling approach is devised to collect fewer samples far from the target and more samples close to the target. Given the similarity and single-sided distribution of samples in the raw dataset oriented to modeling, the tailored enhancement strategies are designed to improve dataset quality. Finally, the efficiency and adaptability of FNUS are demonstrated to be superior to the existing methods through simulations. Furthermore, the practicality of FNUS is validated by experiments on physical MFs.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), group decision-making (GDM) has become a critical approach to ensuring the scientificity and fairness of decisions in complex systems. However, existing GDM methods often face limitations due to the presence of hypocritical trust and irrational confidence among decision-makers (DMs), which can significantly hinder the effective achievement of consensus. To address these challenges, this article proposes an innovative consensus reaching process that integrates fuzzy preference relations and advanced AI techniques to systematically identify and eliminate irrational factors in the decision-making process. The proposed method introduces a novel mechanism for quantifying the contribution degree of DMs based on game theory within the framework of fuzzy sociometric relations and effectively identifies and eliminates hypocritical trust relationships using geometric analysis. In addition, an innovative quartile classification method based on dynamic monitoring is designed to achieve real-time assessment and adjustment of the confidence level of DMs. By combining principles of calculus and geometry, an accurate calculation model of DM weights is constructed. The proposed method establishes a two-level consensus feedback mechanism integrating confidence level and trust degree, ultimately realizing the selection of the optimal alternative. Systematic case studies and comparative experimental analyses demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed method in terms of consensus efficiency and decision-making quality. The key innovations of this research include the development of a new weight determination method based on calculus and geometry, the construction of a hypocritical trust identification mechanism using game theory and geometric analysis, and the establishment of an irrational confidence regulation system combining regret theory with dynamic monitoring. These contributions provide a robust theoretical framework and methodological support for addressing consensus challenges in complex GDM scenarios.},

Fuzzy support vector machines and their variants have demonstrated potential in handling noise and outliers but struggle to address the challenge of imbalanced datasets. To deal with this problem, in this article, we propose a novel relative density and nonmembership (RDNM)-based intuitionistic fuzzy twin support vector machine for class imbalance learning. The method utilizes a $k$-nearest neighbor-based probability density estimation to assess the significance of each training pattern. Furthermore, a novel RDNM-based membership function is employed to effectively distinguish noise and outliers from support vectors. To address the class imbalance problem, majority class training patterns are assigned a score function incorporating the imbalance ratio, while minority class patterns are given a higher membership degree of unity. To validate the superiority of the proposed method, comprehensive experiments and statistical analyses are conducted over 30 imbalanced benchmark datasets, employing linear and nonlinear kernels, and the outcomes are compared with the existing approaches. In addition, the proposed model is applied to the HAM10000 dataset, which consists of dermatoscopic images for skin lesion classification, showcasing its effectiveness in medical applications. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses the baseline models, underscoring its capability for addressing classification challenges in real-world applications with imbalanced class distributions.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of medical imaging technologies has led to an exponential increase in medical image data, making efficient retrieval from large-scale datasets critical for improving diagnostic accuracy and speed. However, two key challenges hinder this process: first, the presence of uncertain and subtle lesions in medical images that are often difficult to discern, and second, class imbalance across different case types within medical image databases. These inherent challenges significantly degrade the performance of existing hashing algorithms. In recent years, methods based on the Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) have shown promising performance in medical image modeling. Inspired by these advances, this article proposes a novel fuzzy hashing network (FHN) based on TSK-FS to enhance retrieval performance by effectively handling both uncertainty and data imbalance in medical imaging. The FHN first introduces a novel fuzzification mechanism that incorporates the concept of a self-attention mechanism to effectively capture the complex underlying features in medical images, thereby enhancing the data discriminability in fuzzy spaces. Meanwhile, a new consequent parameter learning mechanism is developed for defuzzification by introducing the Transformer network, which aims to improve the inference efficiency and generalization capability of the FHN. Based on these two mechanisms, FHN’s capability of analyzing and handling uncertain data is significantly enhanced. Furthermore, a novel hash center loss is designed to capture global relationships while emphasizing local structural information, thereby improving the handling of imbalanced data and significantly enhancing retrieval performance.},

Since the considered unreliable communication networks are jointly strongly connected switching networks and suffer from time delays, agents cannot receive their neighboring agents’ actions or can only obtain delayed actions. To estimate the neighboring agents’ actions, a distributed NE seeking observer is developed. Then, based on the proposed distributed NE seeking observer and backstepping control technology, a distributed fuzzy adaptive control scheme is constructed by utilizing fuzzy logic systems and adopting integrable functions and bounded parameter estimation algorithms. It is proven that the observation error of the distributed NE seeking observer asymptotically converges to zero, and the developed fuzzy adaptive control scheme can ensure that the agents’ outputs asymptotically converge to the NE of the noncooperative game. Moreover, the nondifferentiable problem of virtual controllers is avoided. Finally, we apply the distributed fuzzy adaptive control scheme to marine surface vehicles, and the simulation and comparison results confirm its effectiveness.},

More possibilities for transient performance of fuzzy systems are developed. Then, fuzzy set theory is introduced to describe system uncertainties. A fuzzy mechanical system with prescribed performance is constructed in the homeomorphism mapping space. An adaptive control method with finite-time stability is proposed. Thus, the preassigned performance is met through a two-layer collaborative convergence characteristic, rather than relying solely on performance constraint. High-order adaptive laws reduce control costs and avoid overcompensation. Control design is always deterministic rather than based on fuzzy rules. A more effective way is reflected in fuzzy-based optimization. Based on fuzzy sets to measure uncertainty, a cooperative game optimization strategy is designed to obtain the optimal decision for multiple objectives and control parameters. The best combination of performance and cost is solved. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via the steer-by-wire system.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a novel federated learning framework to multivariate regression problems, termed evolving Gaussian federated regression (eGauss+$_{\text{FR}}$). The need for a federated approach is due to the increasing problem of distributed acquisition of the data and protection for the rights of distributing these data. Regression problems are usually nonlinear and, therefore, strongly connected to the clustering to divide the data space into smaller subspaces where a linear approximation could be applied. Here, we are faced with the main drawback of traditional clustering methods, where a predefined number of clusters are needed. In federated learning problems, where the data are commonly nonidentically distributed between different sources or clients, this represents a significant challenge. This problem can be overcome by introducing an evolving approach, which adds and removes the clusters on-the-fly. The idea in our approach is to use the incremental c-regression or c-varieties clustering methods to define the clusters, which lie close to the lines and describe them with the centers and the covariance matrices. The clustering is done for each data source or client. Due to the restriction and protection of data sharing, only the centers and the covariance matrices of all clients are then transmitted to main server and merged together, which is here done in a way as proposed in eGauss+ method. From merged clusters the auxiliary points are generated, which than serve to approximate the function by using classical fuzzy models. Our proposed method was demonstrated on simple synthetic data, while synthetic and real-world datasets were used to test time complexity and scalability with the number of clients. The results demonstrate the benefits of evolving federated method, which results in high-quality approximation of the function and can be easily extended to high-dimensional problems.},

Aiming at characterizing nonlinearity with parameter uncertainty, the interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy technique is implemented in system modeling. Meanwhile, it is supposed that both observer and controller modes can just be acquired via a hidden Markov mode detector in the first attempt. Then, following the concept of nonparallel distribution compensation, the observer-based IT2 fuzzy asynchronous controllers are constructed with observers and controllers sharing the same fuzzy membership function but different from that in systems, which improves the designed flexibility. In accordance with semi-Markov kernel approach and the Lyapunov function contingent upon both system modes and sojourn times, sufficient criteria are established for the functioning of expected mode-dependent IT2 fuzzy observers and controllers such that the $\sigma$-mean-square stability for the resulting nonlinear augmented semi-Markov jump singularly perturbed systems comprised of the controlled systems and observation error systems is guaranteed. Furthermore, from the perspective of fuzzy processing, parameters and relaxation matrices that comply with fuzzy rules are added to ensure system stability while further reducing the conservatism of conditions. Ultimately, a circuit model and comparison examples are shown to substantiate the necessity and superiority of the suggested technique.},

  abstract     = {Dempster–Shafer (DS) evidence theory provides a powerful framework for modeling uncertainty, reasoning, and combining information from multiple sources. However, it may yield counterintuitive results when handling conflicting evidence, thereby affecting decision reliability and limiting practical applications. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel evidential reasoning rule with divisive hierarchical clustering (ER-DHC), consisting of two main modules: evidence clustering and cluster fusion. At first, a new divisive hierarchical algorithm is introduced for evidence clustering, comprising coarse-grained and fine-grained division. In the coarse-grained stage, evidence with different decision preferences is grouped into separate clusters, thus preventing high intracluster conflicts and laying a solid foundation for evidence clustering. The fine-grained division adaptively refines cluster structures using an inflection point detection method, thereby enhancing clustering quality. On this basis, a new cluster fusion strategy is developed, involving intracluster fusion via classical Dempster’s rule and intercluster fusion using a fuzzy preference relation-based weighted approach. This fusion strategy can degenerate into classical DS fusion and weighted fusion, while also introducing a new clustering fusion perspective, offering better flexibility. Finally, the proposed ER-DHC method is applied to the multisource information fusion system, with experimental results demonstrating improved performance of target classification.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel prescribed-time composite learning-enhanced fuzzy (PrTCLF) cooperative control approach is proposed for the multiple-leadermultiple-follower (MLMF) teleoperation systems in the presence of system model uncertainties and external interferences. First, compared with traditional MLMF systems, a unifying virtual leader–follower teleoperation control framework, notably applicative for more general situations where the number of leaderand follower robots is not the same, is constructed by introducing scheduled control authority for different operators, especially in cooperative control mode. A significant feature of this article is that the first result of a novel time-dependent function integrated PrTCLF learning law rendering all the synchronization errors of the uncertain MLMF teleoperation system to zero is creatively derived, by which the effect of the traditional fuzzy learning error on the precision of system convergence is essentially solved. Meanwhile, in order to ensure the high efficiency and robustness of cooperative work, a new class of nonsingular prescribed-time terminal sliding mode surface is designed without any switching behavior. Besides, the sufficient conditions for maintaining the prescribed-time stability of the MLMF teleoperation system are provided through systematic Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, the effectiveness of the control structure and algorithm is verified by a large number of simulation and experimental results.},

  abstract     = {As an innovative methodology in data processing and knowledge representation, granular-ball computing (GBC) adaptively generates distinct neighborhoods for individual objects, thereby improving both generality and flexibility. By replacing point inputs with granular-balls (GBs), GBC achieves substantial efficiency gains. However, traditional GB-based classifiers may produce unreliable classifications under uncertain conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that integrates three-way decision (3WD) theory with GBC, enabling robust handling of uncertain classification problems. This study first introduces a sequential three-way decision with fuzzy granular-ball rough sets (S3WD-FGBRS). We systematically analyze the changing rules of the multilevel decision cost in S3WD-FGBRS and its three regions. Building upon the principle of justifiable granularity, we develop a cost-sensitive three-way granular-ball generation method (CS3W-GBG) based on S3WD-FGBRS that incorporates a granularity optimization mechanism. To validate our approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments using three state-of-the-art GB classifiers and two benchmark classifiers on 12 publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CS3W-GBG exhibits strong resilience in processing uncertain data through its 3WD strategy. Furthermore, our method achieves competitive performance compared to existing approaches in terms of classification accuracy and robustness.},

This study proposes a novel actor-critic reinforcement learning control scheme, integrated with a fuzzy logic system (FLS), to address USV tracking and formation control problems in narrow waterways. Specifically, an FLS-based observer is designed to estimate unknown parameters, such as USV mass and speed, and environmental disturbances, and an actor–critic reinforcement learning controller is developed to allow for tracking and formation control of multiple USVs. The stability of the proposed control scheme is formally analyzed. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller, showcasing its ability to maintain the USV formation when tracking riverbanks rendered dynamic by environmental disturbances and obtains 24.48% reduction in trajectory length when compared with the existing controllers. This improves the autonomous tracking and formation capabilities of USVs in constrained and uncertain environments.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) are widely used for modeling complex systems but are limited in handling uncertainty from imprecise or multi-interval data. To address this, extended models, such as fuzzy gray cognitive maps (FGCMs) and fuzzy general gray cognitive maps (FGGCMs) have been developed. In particular, FGGCMs can process general gray numbers, enabling more effective modeling of uncertainty. However, the convergence properties of FGGCMs remain underexplored, limiting their reliability in applications involving prediction, control, and decision-making. This article addresses this gap by establishing a rigorous theoretical framework for analyzing the convergence of FGGCMs using the tanh activation function. First, we define the metric and vector space structure of GGN and prove their completeness. Based on this, Banach’s fixed-point theorem is employed to derive sufficient conditions for the global convergence of FGGCMs to a unique fixed point. Moreover, convergence criteria are separately established for the kernel and grayness components. Finally, we show that existing convergence results for FCMs and FGCMs are special cases of the broader theorems proposed in this work. The main finding is the convergence theorems of tanh FGGCM and the results provide a solid mathematical foundation for future developments in learning algorithms and FCM-based modeling under uncertainty.},

The T2FSHLRNN, configured as a weighted combination of a type-2 fuzzy neural network and a single hidden layer network, demonstrates strong global learning ability. Leveraging its internal and external double-layer feedback mechanism, the network can incorporate both current and previous error information during the approximation process, effectively improving the approximation accuracy and reducing system chattering. Furthermore, an adaptive gain function is proposed and an adaptive terminal super-twisting controller based on T2FSHLRNN (ATSC-T2FSHLRNN) is developed. The system’s stability under unknown disturbance is ensured using Lyapunov synthesis. Based on this, the online parameter learning algorithm for T2FSHLRNN and the variable gains of ATSC are derived.

  abstract     = {To tackle the insufficient representation of uncertainty and weak structural adaptability in nonlinear system modeling, a dynamic interval type-2 fuzzy stochastic configuration network (DIT2FSCN) is proposed, synergistically integrating fuzzy rule initialization and dynamic sparse interpolation rule growth. First, a k-means clustering algorithm based on density peaks (BDPKA) is introduced to initialize the parameters of DIT2FSCN. The limitations of traditional clustering methods, such as sensitivity to initial centers and the requirement to predefine the number of rules, can be overcome by fusing density peak detection with k-means clustering, enabling data-driven fuzzy rule generation. Second, a two-stage modeling framework incorporating interval type-2 fuzzy inference and stochastic configuration-based dynamic optimization is designed. The uncertainty modeling capability of an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) and the incremental learning ability of stochastic configuration networks are jointly harnessed, allowing for dynamic characterization of complex system behaviors. Third, a dynamic sparse interpolation rule growth strategy based on the blankness score is proposed. The blankness scoring mechanism that accounts for both interrule spacing and local data distribution is designed to facilitate adaptive rule base expansion via sparse region identification and dynamic interpolation, capturing the coupling relationships in nonlinear systems. Finally, the effectiveness of DIT2FSCN is validated through simulation experiments, including sequence prediction, benchmark dataset modeling, and two real-world industrial process applications. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DIT2FSCN has better performance than its peers in accuracy and generalization capability.},

In order to ensure the control quality and simultaneously save the communication resource, new resilient adaptive event-triggered scheme is proposed with a reinforcement learning-based intelligent optimal threshold regulation mechanism based on observed states. Then, an augmented observer-based fuzzy switching system is constructed using the time delay method. In addition, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee global exponential stability of the closed-loop nonlinear lane keeping system with prescribed H∞ performance using a piecewise Lyapunov functional analysis approach. Subsequently, the gains for controller, observer, and trigger are co-designed and computed by solving certain matrix inequalities.

This assumption limits the applicability of control strategies to scenarios with asymmetric information interactions among UAVs. To overcome this limitation, this article addresses the distributed formation control problem of nonlinear multi-UAV systems with unknown uncertainties under general directed communication networks. The approximation capabilities of fuzzy logic systems are leveraged to handle nonlinearities and uncertainties. To conserve limited resources, an event-driven approach is introduced for the design of a distributed formation control strategy. Specifically, the controller of each UAV is updated only when specific events are triggered by a distributed triggering condition, instead of being updated continuously over time. Under intermittent event-driven control updates, all UAVs can achieve a desired time-varying formation configuration, while excluding the Zeno behavior. Adaptive gains, rather than fixed gains, are introduced into the control strategy to enable more flexible control implementation without relying on global information. In addition to formation control, an event-driven attitude control strategy is proposed to ensure that the yaw angles of all UAVs converge to a prescribed value. Finally, simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control schemes.},

First, a novel measurement method for attribute fluctuation is proposed, based on the variation range of attribute membership degrees. To mitigate redundancy in the concept space, a fuzzy granular concept space is constructed using the concept contribution degree. Second, the model leverages the semantic richness of concepts by integrating similar fuzzy granular concepts, thereby constructing a clustering space.

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose a novel data transformation-driven fuzzy clustering neural network (DTFCNN) to enhance the dimensionality reduction function and end-to-end refinment learning ability of the entire structure. Unlike conventional fuzzy clustering-based neural networks, which rely on fuzzy c-means clustering in the hidden layer and least squares error-based learning for connection weights, the DTFCNN utilizes backpropagation (BP) learning as a refinement algorithm. This refinement process enables iterative fine-tuning of the model’s parameters, allowing it to adapt more effectively to complex patterns. By using BP, DTFCNN enhances its ability to learn intricate feature interactions and extract relevant features from high-dimensional spaces, thereby significantly improving the model’s flexibility and performance. The proposed DTFCNN consists of four layers. First, a preprocessing layer employs principal component analysis for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, where eigenvectors are used as connection weights for the preprocessing layer. Second, a hidden layer utilizes fuzzy c-means clustering for generating fuzzy membership degrees, and centers serve as connection weights for hidden layers. The entries of the partition matrix also are regarded as membership degrees. In the output layer, a linear-driven affine transform is used for fitting connection weights, and a SoftMax function is employed to express the outputs as probabilities. Finally, all parameters, such as eigenvectors, centers, and coefficients, from the preprocessing layer to the output layer are refined through BP-based learning. To validate the effectiveness of the DTFCNN, we conducted a collection of comparison experiments: 1) publicly benchmark datasets with statistical analysis, 2) facial recognition datasets for application-specific testing, and 3) three large-scale datasets. The results demonstrate that the DTFCNN outperforms classical classifiers, state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers, and deep learning baselines in terms of accuracy and generalization capability. The DTFCNN model uses fewer parameters than deep learning baselines, resulting in faster training times without compromising performance. Overall, the DTFCNN achieves higher accuracy while maintaining model adaptability.},

  abstract     = {In the era of Big Data, the integration and fusion of heterogeneous information have become essential for addressing complex decision-making challenges in large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM), where expanding scale and diverse participant behaviors increasingly demand advanced techniques to enhance efficiency, fairness, and accuracy. To meet these demands, this article proposes a novel framework that leverages information-fusion principles to optimize group decision-making processes. First, an enhanced fuzzy C-means algorithm, termed Trust-based regularized fuzzy C-means, is introduced. By incorporating a regularization term derived from trust relationships, it improves clustering precision and enables finer segmentation of decision-makers (DMs), thus laying solid groundwork for consensus. Building on this, we develop an optimization model integrating three-way decision theory to resolve asynchronous differences among experts. The model uses dynamic trust updates to guide DMs from the negative region toward those in the positive region, with special emphasis on rapid consensus in emergencies. Furthermore, the study, for the first time, systematically investigates manipulative and herd behaviors within large datasets; adopting a cautious strategy to mitigate their impact on fairness and effectiveness, it embeds pseudotrust identification into the framework to further refine the decision environment. Extensive case studies and comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves decision-making efficiency, fairness, and accuracy, offering new perspectives and practical tools for managing complex information and optimizing group behaviors in LSGDM.},

  abstract     = {The integrated wheel-end module (IWEM) incorporates both driving and steering functions at the wheel end, enabling independent control of each wheel and significantly enhancing the vehicle’s agility and stability. However, during steering maneuvers, road excitations and variations in wheel motion may lead to air-gap eccentricity (AGE) in the in-wheel motor, resulting in the unbalanced radial force and torque (URF/URT). These disturbances degrade the tracking accuracy of the wheel-end module and subsequently impair the vehicle’s steering performance. To address this issue, a control-oriented model of the IWEM is developed, incorporating the coupled characteristics of longitudinal slip and lateral slip angle of the tire. Furthermore, an interval type-II fuzzy logic (IT2FL) driven self-tuning tube model predictive control strategy is proposed. First, the generation mechanism of URF/URT under AGE is analyzed in depth. To mitigate the adverse effects of these uncertain disturbances on the wheel-end dynamics, an online observation method based on IT2FL systems is designed to enable real-time estimation of URF/URT and its perturbation bounds. On this basis, a self-tuning tube model predictive controller is developed to dynamically adjust the Tube boundaries according to the real-time observed disturbance range, effectively reducing control conservatism and improving tracking accuracy. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations and real-vehicle experiments validate that the proposed method can effectively suppress the adverse effects caused by AGE and significantly enhance the tracking control performance of the integrated wheel-end system.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rough set theory has made significant strides in the field of feature selection. However, it still faces challenges when dealing with noisy data. Most traditional models fail to incorporate sample weight information in the evaluation of sample similarity, leaving them prone to interference from noisy samples. To address this issue, this article introduces a novel Weighted Fuzzy Rough Set (WFRS) model, designed to more accurately capture the uncertainty inherent in data. This model combines class distribution with the concept of neighborhood weights for samples, and proposes a directed weighted fuzzy binary relation to evaluate both the similarity and differences between samples. By doing so, it avoids the overfitting issues typically caused by over-reliance on distribution information from local noisy samples. Drawing on sample weighting, traditional fuzzy approximation operators are reinterpreted and redefined, leading to the construction of the WFRS model. Key uncertainty metrics, such as decision approximation and the positive region, are analyzed in depth, providing a solid theoretical foundation for subsequent feature selection and decision analysis. Based on this model, a forward heuristic feature selection algorithm is developed and compared with various State-of-the-Art algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs exceptionally well across multiple evaluation metrics, fully validating the efficiency and robustness of the WFRS model.},

  abstract     = {Multilabel feature selection (MFS) plays a vital role in enhancing model performance by identifying the most relevant features. However, most existing methods assume complete feature information and overlook the potential issue of missing features in real-world applications. Furthermore, existing methods mainly focus on feature redundancy while paying insufficient attention to the potential positive interaction among features, which adversely affects the effectiveness of feature selection (FS). To overcome these limitations, this article proposes a novel incomplete MFS method based on dynamic dual-graph optimization and fuzzy feature interaction (D2GOFI). The method addresses two core challenges systematically: 1) feature-missing processing; and 2) feature interaction modeling. Specifically, D2GOFI introduces a fuzzy tolerance relation to mitigate information loss caused by missing features, and proposes fuzzy tolerance implication granularity information to reveal the data’s intrinsic structure and guide the FS process effectively. To address the potential issue of overinclusivity introduced by the fuzzy tolerance relation, a nonnegative adjustment matrix has been designed to improve the stability and reliability of FS. Meanwhile, D2GOFI explicitly models positive fuzzy interaction between features to enhance the expressiveness of feature relevance evaluation. Finally, a dynamic dual-graph optimization strategy is employed to preserve local manifold structures at the feature and label levels simultaneously, ensuring the FS process aligns with the data’s inherent patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that D2GOFI achieves superior accuracy and robustness across multiple datasets.},

To effectively represent knowledge in dynamic multiview data, this article proposes a dynamic multiview concept-cognitive learning (DMVCCL) model. First, a multiview knowledge representation framework is established, which uses fuzzy three-way concepts as basic carriers. The natural hierarchical relationship between concepts is utilized to precisely represent knowledge in multiview data. Then, for dynamic multiview data, a clue-based dynamic concept updating mechanism is designed. This mechanism leverages the varying sensitivities of concepts at different granularity levels to data changes, enabling learning concepts at the optimal granularity level. Moreover, the weights of each view are assigned based on the representation capability of the learned concepts, and a multiview classification method is designed using the similarity between concepts and data.

  abstract     = {Multitask Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy systems (MT-TSK-FS) commonly utilize interpretable fuzzy rules to facilitate information sharing among tasks and have shown promising performance. However, existing MT-TSK-FS modeling approaches still face several challenges. Specifically, they mainly focus on the global fitting of tasks while overlooking the local fitting accuracy of individual rules, thereby undermining rule interpretability. Moreover, the antecedent and consequent components of fuzzy rules are often learned independently, lacking collaborative coordination. In addition, task-specific rule diversity is insufficiently addressed, which may result in redundant or overlapping rules. To this end, we propose a progressive collaborative learning framework for MT-TSK-FS (MTTSKFS-PCL), which progressively optimizes the model from the local perspective of individual rules to that of global tasks. At the local level, a locally target-guided multitask fuzzy clustering method is introduced to enhance local rule accuracy and to jointly optimize rule antecedents and consequents. At the global level, a mini-batch gradient descent (MBGD) algorithm is employed to integrate fuzzy rules and enhance overall task fitting. Meanwhile, a confidence-supervised regularization strategy is introduced to preserve local rule accuracy throughout the MBGD process. Furthermore, a rule diversity enhancement mechanism is incorporated to improve task-specific rule diversity. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MTTSKFS-PCL significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness in multitask fuzzy modeling.},

This functional also provides a graceful event-triggered $H_\infty$ analysis framework that avoids the use of the $S$-procedure. Then, the Lyapunov matrices in the functional are set to be aperiodic sampling-dependent, thereby further reducing the conservatism of the criteria. Furthermore, a basic-inequality-based method is provided to handle the imperfect premise matching between the fuzzy system and the fuzzy controller in interval type-2 fuzzy systems, avoiding the previous introduction of additional free matrices and extra constraints. Thereafter, the fuzzy controller design method is given, and the aperiodic sampling-based static/dynamic event-triggered control is effectively implemented. Ultimately, two case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and demonstrate their ability to achieve superior event-triggered control effects compared with the existing literature.},

  abstract     = {Most fuzzy clustering algorithms are based on the well-known Bezdek’s fuzzy $C$-means (FCM). However, FCM fails when the data is imbalanced (class sizes are highly unequal). This issue arises because in FCM all data points have only attraction to each cluster prototype (i.e., centroid), causing centroids to be biased toward the large class with the most data points. This article proposes a novel equilibrium $K$-means (EKM) for imbalanced data, where data points exert both attraction and repulsion on centroids. The equilibrium between opposing forces reduces the learning bias toward large clusters, leading to more meaningful clusters on imbalanced data. Unlike FCM, EKM explicitly models the relationship between membership and centroid via equality constraints, avoiding the pitfalls of uniform effect. We derive closed-form centroid update equations proven to converge exponentially fast. Experiments are conducted on four artificial and 16 real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that EKM significantly outperforms 13 State-of-the-Art methods on imbalanced datasets while maintaining competitive performance on balanced data. EKM achieves an average improvement of 0.22 in normalized mutual information, 0.31 in adjusted rand index, and 0.21 in clustering accuracy over FCM on 10 real-world imbalanced datasets, with comparable computational efficiency in theory and practice.},

It is for the first time in the literature of fuzzy based linguistic MADM models that MARSHAL treats inputs as rich linguistic features from a pretrained deep learning based large language model. This is in addition to the input being uncertain and hesitant, while also presenting vector arithmetic based information elicitation from corresponding hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets. The idea is to introduce semantically-aware probabilistic attribute weights based on high-dimensional linguistic features learned by an enhanced variant of BERT, utilized to solve MADM problems alongside risk and regret-aversive behaviors of experts. The proposed model is tested for applicability on a real case-study of employee flight risk detection.
