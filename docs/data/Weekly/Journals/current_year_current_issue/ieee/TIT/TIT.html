  abstract     = {We study direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation from coarsely quantized data. We focus on a two-step approach which first estimates the signal subspace via covariance estimation and then extracts DOA angles by the ESPRIT algorithm. In particular, we analyze two stochastic quantization schemes which use dithering: a one-bit quantizer combined with rectangular dither and a multi-bit quantizer with triangular dither. For each quantizer, we derive rigorous high probability bounds for the distances between the true and estimated signal subspaces and DOA angles. Using our analysis, we identify scenarios in which subspace and DOA estimation via triangular dithering qualitatively outperforms rectangular dithering. We verify in numerical simulations that our estimates are optimal in their dependence on the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the target matrix. The resulting subspace estimation guarantees are equally applicable in the analysis of other spectral estimation algorithms and related problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a performance analysis of two distinct techniques for antenna selection and precoding in downlink multi-user massive multiple-input single-output systems with limited dynamic range power amplifiers. Both techniques are derived from the original formulation of the regularized-zero forcing precoder, designed as the solution to minimizing a regularized distortion. Based on this, the first technique, called the $\ell _{1}$ -norm precoder, adopts an $\ell _{1}$ -norm regularization term to encourage sparse solutions, thereby enabling antenna selection. The second technique, termed the thresholded $\ell _{1}$ -norm precoder, involves post-processing the precoder solution obtained from the first method by applying an entry-wise thresholding operation. This work conducts a precise performance analysis to compare these two techniques. The analysis leverages the Gaussian min-max theorem which is effective for examining the asymptotic behavior of optimization problems without explicit solutions. While the analysis of the $\ell _{1}$ -norm precoder follows from the conventional convex Gaussian min-max theorem framework, understanding the thresholded $\ell _{1}$ -norm precoder is more complex due to the non-linear behavior introduced by the thresholding operation. To address this complexity, we develop a novel Gaussian min-max theorem tailored to these scenarios. We provide precise asymptotic behavior analysis of the precoders, focusing on metrics such as received signal-to-noise and distortion ratio and bit error rate. Our analysis demonstrates that the thresholded $\ell _{1}$ -norm precoder can offer superior performance when the threshold parameter is carefully selected. Simulations confirm that the asymptotic results are accurate for systems equipped with hundreds of antennas at the base station, serving dozens of user terminals.},

  abstract     = {The reconstruction of sparse signals from a limited set of measurements poses a significant challenge as it necessitates a solution to an underdetermined system of linear equations. Compressed sensing (CS) deals with sparse signal reconstruction using techniques such as linear programming (LP) and iterative message passing schemes. The interval passing algorithm (IPA) is an attractive CS approach due to its low complexity when compared to LP. In this paper, we propose a sequential IPA that is inspired by sequential belief propagation decoding of low-density-parity-check (LDPC) codes used for forward error correction in channel coding. In the sequential setting, each check node (CN) in the Tanner graph of an LDPC measurement matrix is scheduled one at a time in every iteration, as opposed to the standard “flooding” interval passing approach in which all CNs are scheduled at once per iteration. The sequential scheme offers a significantly lower message passing complexity compared to flooding IPA on average, and for some measurement matrix and signal sparsity, a complexity reduction of approximately 36% is achieved. We show both analytically and numerically that the reconstruction accuracy of the IPA is not compromised by adopting our sequential scheduling approach.},

Two distributed agents observe a pair of sequences $X^{d}$ and $Y^{d}$ drawn according to a joint distribution $P_{X^{d}Y^{d}}$ . The agents aim to generate outputs $U=f_{d}(X^{d})$ and $V=g_{d}(Y^{d})$ with a joint distribution sufficiently close in total variation to a target distribution $Q_{UV}$ . Existing works have shown that the NISS problem with finite-alphabet outputs is decidable. For the binary-output NISS, an upper-bound to the input complexity was derived which is $O\left ({{\exp \mathrm {poly}\left ({{\frac {1}{\epsilon }}}\right)}}\right)$ . In this work, the input complexity and algorithm design are addressed in several classes of NISS scenarios. For binary-output NISS scenarios with doubly-symmetric binary inputs, it is shown that the input complexity is $\Theta \left ({{\log {\frac {1}{\epsilon }}}}\right)$ , thus providing a super-exponential improvement in input complexity. An explicit characterization of the simulating pair of functions is provided. For general finite-input scenarios, a constructive algorithm is introduced that explicitly finds the simulating functions $(f_{d}(X^{d}),g_{d}(Y^{d}))$ . The approach relies on a novel Fourier analysis framework. Various numerical simulations of NISS scenarios with IID inputs are provided. Furthermore, to illustrate the general applicability of the Fourier framework, several examples with non-IID inputs, including entanglement-assisted NISS and NISS with Markovian inputs are provided.},

  abstract     = {Cascade connection architectures of nonlinear feedback shift registers (NFSRs) have been widely used as the main components in the design of cryptographic algorithms, such as the Grain family of stream ciphers. It is known that the cascade connection of an n-stage NFSR into an m-stage NFSR is equivalent to an $(n+m)$ -stage NFSR. However, the converse problem on decomposing an NFSR into the cascade connection of two smaller NFSRs has not been well addressed, which can be transformed to decomposing the characteristic function h of the NFSR into the form $h=f \ast g$ for some nonlinear $f,g$ , where “ $\ast $ ” is a special composition of Boolean functions. In this paper, we present a complete and efficient method for such decomposition problem based on previous works. The framework of the decomposition consists of two steps. The first is to construct a candidate set for g as precise as possible, and the second is to verify each candidate g and recover the corresponding f. We propose the notion of $\ast $ -multiples of Boolean functions, and present three ways to take derivatives of h to extract the low-degree $\ast $ -multiples of g, which are useful to determine g efficiently. Compared to existing methods, the new approach can provide a very small candidate set for g in most cases, with the size being $O(\deg (h))$ , thereby achieving lower and more stable time costs in determining whether h is $\ast $ -reducible and enumerating all pairs $(f,g)$ such that $h=f \ast g$ (if it is $\ast $ -reducible). Moreover, we show that the decomposition method also applies to shift-invariant maps, by establishing a connection between the $\ast $ -product of Boolean functions and the composition of shift-invariant maps.},

This concept is motivated by the detailed analysis of the differential behaviour of non-APN functions (of low differential uniformity) G using the so-called difference squares. Indeed, the insight into some structural qualities of S-boxes provided by this new approach is particularly useful in the light of recent refinements of differential cryptanalysis. We describe the relations between the APN-defect and other current concepts of similar nature. Values of APN-defect for several classes of functions of interest, including Dembowski-Ostrom polynomials are given. This enables one to identify the quasi-APN ones, i.e., those with favourable differential behavior. The difference square corresponding to a modification of the inverse function is determined, its APN-defect depending on n is evaluated, the partial quadruple system associated to it is described, and the implications are discussed. In the forthcoming second part of this work we further examine the APN-defect of modifications of the inverse function and address some questions concerning CCZ-equivalence. We also study modifications of classes of functions of low differential uniformity over infinitely many extensions of $\mathbb {F}_{2^{n}}$ and present quantitative results on their differential behaviour.},

Furthermore, our theory is given in a unified manner for general Galois rings, which include both rings of the form $\mathbb {Z}_{p^{k}}$ and fields like $\mathbb {F}_{p^{k}}$ , which have been treated separately in prior works. We present multiple concrete sets of parameters for degree-D RMFEs (including $D=2$ ), which can be useful for future works. In the recent work of (Cheon & Lee, Eurocrypt’22), the concept of a degree-D packing method was formally introduced, which captures the idea of embedding multiple elements of a smaller ring into a larger ring. We show that the generalized notion of RMFEs to degree-D RMFEs which, in spite of being “more algebraic” than packing methods, turn out to be essentially equivalent. Thus, our constructions of degree-D RMFEs are also degree-D packing methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the semantics-aware remote state estimation of an asymmetric Markov chain with prioritized states. Due to resource constraints, the sensor needs to trade off estimation quality against communication cost. The aim is to exploit the significance of information through the history of system realizations to determine the optimal timing of transmission, thereby reducing the amount of uninformative data transmitted in the network. To this end, we introduce a new metric, the significance-aware Age of Consecutive Error (AoCE), that captures three semantic attributes: the significance of estimation error, the cost of consecutive error (or lasting impact, for short), and the urgency of lasting impact. Different costs and non-linear age functions are assigned to different estimation errors to account for their relative importance to system performance. We identify the optimal transmission problem as a countably infinite state Markov decision process (MDP) with unbounded costs. We first give sufficient conditions on the age functions, source pattern, and channel reliability so that an optimal policy exists to have bounded average costs. We show that the optimal policy exhibits a switching structure. That is, the sensor triggers a transmission only when the system has been trapped in an error for a certain number of consecutive time slots. We also provide sufficient conditions under which the switching policy degenerates into a simple threshold policy, i.e., featuring identical thresholds for all estimation errors. Furthermore, we exploit the structural results and develop a structured policy iteration (SPI) algorithm that considerably reduces computation overhead. Numerical results show that the optimal policy outperforms the classic rule-, distortion- and age-based policies. An important takeaway is that the more semantic attributes we utilize, the fewer transmissions are needed.},

Our main contribution is the design of novel sample-efficient RLHF algorithms based on information-directed sampling (IDS), an online decision-making principle inspired by information theory. Our algorithms maximize the sum of the value function and a mutual information term that encourages exploration of the unknown environment (which quantifies the information gained about the environment through observed human feedback data). To tackle the challenge of large state spaces and improve sample efficiency, we construct a simplified surrogate environment and introduce a novel distance measure (named the $\ell _{g}$ -distance), enabling our IDS-based algorithm to achieve a Bayesian regret upper bound of order $O(H^{3/2}\sqrt {\log (K(\epsilon)) T})$ , where H is the episode length, T is the number of episode and $K(\epsilon)$ is related to the covering number of the environment. Specializing to the tabular settings, this regret bound is of order $\tilde {O}(H^{2}\sqrt {SAT})$ , where S and A are the numbers of states and actions. Finally, we propose an Approximate-IDS algorithm that is computationally more efficient while maintaining nearly the same sample efficiency. The design principle of this approximate algorithm is not only effective in RLHF settings but also applicable to the standard RL framework. Moreover, our work showcases the value of information theory in reinforcement learning and in the training of large language models.},

  abstract     = {We study community detection in multiple networks with jointly correlated node attributes and edges. This setting arises naturally in applications such as social platforms, where a shared set of users may exhibit both correlated friendship patterns and correlated attributes across different platforms. Extending the classical Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and its contextual counterpart (Contextual SBM or CSBM), we introduce the correlated CSBM, which incorporates structural and attribute correlations across graphs. To build intuition, we first analyze correlated Gaussian Mixture Models, wherein only correlated node attributes are available without edges, and identify the conditions under which an estimator minimizing the distance between attributes achieves exact matching of nodes across the two databases. For the correlated CSBMs, we develop a two-step procedure that first applies k-core matching to most nodes using edge information, then refines the matching for the remaining unmatched nodes by leveraging their attributes with a distance-based estimator. We identify the conditions under which the algorithm recovers the exact node correspondence, enabling us to merge the correlated edges and average the correlated attributes for enhanced community detection. Crucially, by aligning and combining graphs, we identify regimes in which community detection is impossible in a single graph but becomes feasible when side information from correlated graphs is incorporated. Our results illustrate how the interplay between graph matching and community recovery can boost performance, broadening the scope of multi-graph, attribute-based community detection.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new multi-linear projection method for denoising and estimation of high-dimensional matrix-variate factor time series. It assumes that a $p_{1}\times p_{2}$ matrix-variate time series consists of a dynamically dependent, lower-dimensional matrix-variate factor process and a $p_{1}\times p_{2}$ matrix idiosyncratic series. In addition, the latter series assumes a matrix-variate factor structure such that its row and column covariances may have diverging/spiked eigenvalues to accommodate the case of low signal-to-noise ratio often encountered in applications. We use an iterative projection procedure to reduce the dimensions and noise effects in estimating front and back loading matrices and to obtain faster convergence rates than those of the traditional methods available in the literature. We further introduce a two-way projected Principal Component Analysis to mitigate the diverging noise effects, and implement a high-dimensional white-noise testing procedure to estimate the dimension of the matrix factor process. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are established if the dimensions and sample size go to infinity. We also use simulations and real examples to assess the performance of the proposed method in finite samples and to compare its forecasting ability with some existing ones in the literature. The proposed method fares well in out-of-sample forecasting. In the appendix, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach even when the idiosyncratic terms exhibit serial correlations with or without a diverging white noise effect.},

  abstract     = {Feature extraction and selection in the presence of nonlinear dependencies among the data is a fundamental challenge in unsupervised learning. We propose using a Gram-Schmidt (GS) type orthogonalization process over function spaces to detect and map out such dependencies. Specifically, by applying the GS process over some family of functions, we construct a series of covariance matrices that can either be used to identify new large-variance directions, or to remove those dependencies from known directions. In the former case, we provide information-theoretic guarantees in terms of entropy reduction. In the latter, we provide precise conditions by which the chosen function family eliminates existing redundancy in the data. Each approach provides both a feature extraction and a feature selection algorithm. Our feature extraction methods are linear, and can be seen as natural generalization of principal component analysis (PCA). We provide experimental results for synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets which show superior performance over state-of-the-art (linear) feature extraction and selection algorithms. Surprisingly, our linear feature extraction algorithms are comparable and often outperform several important nonlinear feature extraction methods such as autoencoders, kernel PCA, and UMAP. Furthermore, one of our feature selection algorithms strictly generalizes a recent Fourier-based feature selection mechanism (Heidari et al., IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 2022), yet at significantly reduced complexity.},

  abstract     = {Existing periodic Gaussian process (PGP) modeling methods rely on the regularly-spaced-signal assumption (i.e., signals are evenly spaced) and the integer-period assumption for the sake of computational feasibility. However, such an assumption prevents conventional efficient modeling approaches from working properly on irregularly (unevenly) spaced signals, such as evenly spaced signals with missing data. Moreover, without the integer-period assumption, it is computationally prohibitive to accurately search the decimal period of PGP due to the severe non-convexity of its likelihood function. To address these issues, this study proposes a PGP-controlled B-spline for scalable modeling of irregularly spaced signals with a decimal period. The proposed model integrates PGP with B-spline basis functions, allowing for nonlinear and nonparametric modeling of periodic signals. An explore-exploit optimization is developed to overcome the non-convexity of the likelihood, enabling effective and efficient decimal period estimation. The proposed PGP modeling approach has a linear time complexity. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are studied, which shed light on the period estimation of other PGP models. Simulation and real case studies are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

The James-Stein estimator is used in constructing detection schemes that exhibit strong detection performance both asymptotically and non-asymptotically. Our results indicate that utilizing the James-Stein estimator in the recently developed window-limited CuSum test constitutes a uniform improvement over its typical maximum likelihood variant. That is, the proposed James-Stein version achieves a smaller detection delay simultaneously for all possible post-change parameter values and every false alarm rate constraint, as long as the number of parallel data streams is greater than three. Additionally, an alternative detection procedure that utilizes the James-Stein estimator is shown to have asymptotic detection delay properties that compare favorably to existing tests. The second-order asymptotic detection delay term is reduced in a predefined low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space, while second-order asymptotic minimaxity is preserved. The results are verified in simulations, where the proposed schemes are shown to achieve smaller detection delays compared to existing alternatives, especially when the number of data streams is large.},

Using this generalized concept, we provide a complete set of entropic conditions for free convertibility between quantum states or channels in any closed and convex quantum resource theory. We also derive an information-theoretic interpretation for the resource global robustness of a state or a channel in terms of a mutual-information-like quantity based on the FCME. Apart from this entropic approach, we characterize dynamic resources by also analyzing their performance in operational tasks. We construct operationally meaningful and complete sets of resource monotones with these tasks, which enable faithful tests of free convertibility between quantum channels. Finally, we show that every well-defined robustness-based measure of a channel can be interpreted as an operational advantage of the channel over free channels in a communication task.},

Such techniques will be crucial for near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computers, as the limited number of qubits is likely to be a major bottleneck for demonstrating quantum advantage. One typically distinguishes between gate cuts and wire cuts when partitioning a circuit. The cost for any circuit knitting approach scales exponentially in the number of cuts. One possibility to realize a cut is via the quasiprobability simulation technique. In fact, we argue that all existing rigorous circuit knitting techniques can be understood in this framework. Furthermore, we characterize the optimal overhead for wire cuts where the subcircuits can exchange classical information or not. We show that the optimal cost for cutting n wires without and with classical communication between the subcircuits scales as $O(16^{n})$ and $O(4^{n})$ , respectively.},

Both parties know the set of source states as well as their statistics. However, they don’t know the actual state. We establish a single-letter formula for the compound CR capacity in the presence of communication over the channel and study key properties of the compound CR capacity: super-additivity, concavity, and continuity. We also consider the case where there is no communication between the terminals, and only the source outputs observed by the terminal at the receiving end of the perfect channel are state-dependent. In this setting, we establish single-letter bounds on the compound CR capacity. The single-letter lower bound is derived under the assumption that the source distributions are pairwise distinct for all states.

As two special subclasses of linear codes, minimal linear codes and self-orthogonal linear codes are of particular interest. Constructing linear codes that possess both minimality and self-orthogonality is very interesting. The main purpose of this paper is to construct self-orthogonal minimal linear codes that violate the Ashikhmin-Barg (AB for short) condition over the finite field $\mathbb {F}_{p}$ . First, we present several classes of self-orthogonal minimal linear codes violating the AB condition over the finite field $\mathbb {F}_{2}$ and determine their weight distributions. Next, for any odd prime p, we construct two classes of self-orthogonal linear codes from p-ary functions, which contain some optimal or almost optimal codes. Finally, based on plateaued functions, we construct two classes of self-orthogonal linear codes that violate the AB condition. Their weight distributions are also provided. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate the constructions of linear codes that violate the AB condition and satisfy self-orthogonality.},

Their strong error-correcting abilities and efficient encoding and decoding methods make BCH codes widely applicable in various areas, including communication systems, data storage devices, and consumer electronics. Although BCH codes have been extensively studied, the parameters of BCH codes are not known in general. Let q be a prime power and m be a positive integer. Denote by ${\mathcal {C}}_{\left ({{q,m,\delta)}}\right)}$ the narrow-sense primitive BCH code with length $q^{m}-1$ and designed distance $\delta $ . As of now, the dimensions of ${\mathcal {C}}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ are fully understood only for $m \leq 2$ . For $m \geq 4$ , the dimensions of ${\mathcal {C}}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ are known only for the range $2 \leq \delta \leq q^{\lfloor (m+1)/2 \rfloor +1}$ and for a limited number of special cases. In this paper, we determined the dimension and Bose distance of ${\mathcal {C}}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ for $m\geq 4$ and $\delta \in [2, q^{\lfloor (2m-1)/{3}\rfloor +1}] $ .

  abstract     = {In 2019, Carlet et al. introduced the concept of $\sigma $ duals of linear codes involving the $\sigma $ inner product, which generalizes the Euclidean, Hermitian and $\ell $ -Galois cases. This paper focuses on constructing new and improved classical codes and quantum codes within the framework of the $\sigma $ inner product. We derive some general properties of linear codes, including matrix-product (MP) codes, with respect to the $\sigma $ inner product. We develop general methods and design effective routes involving certain optimization problems for constructing $\sigma $ self-orthogonal (SO) and $\sigma $ dual-containing (DC) MP codes. Our schemes efficiently generate numerous such codes with new or optimal parameters. We establish the $\sigma $ construction of quantum stabilizer codes from classical codes. We propose a unified method for constructing two general classes of entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) based on the $\sigma $ hulls of general linear codes. This further yields six types of EAQECCs with flexible parameters based on propagation rules using MP codes under the Euclidean and Hermitian cases. Compared to the best-known ternary EAQECCs, we obtain 17 new ones and 13 of them have improved parameters. Finally, we present two infinite families of q-ary EAQECCs with lengths $(q^{2}-1)(q+2)$ and $q^{2}(q+2)$ , respectively. These families include many q-ary QECCs that are not only new according to Grassl’s online database but also surpass those listed in Edel’s online database.},

  abstract     = {Tanner codes are error-correcting codes built from a bipartite graph G and a short inner code $C_{0}$ . Expander codes are a special type of Tanner code, where the graph is highly interconnected, ensuring stronger error correction capabilities. This paper is motivated by the following natural and fundamental problem in decoding expander codes: What are the sufficient and necessary conditions that $\delta \in [{0,1}]$ and $d_{0}\in \mathbb {N}$ must satisfy, so that every bipartite expander G with vertex expansion ratio $\delta $ and every linear inner code $C_{0}$ with minimum distance $d_{0}$ together define an expander code that corrects $\Omega (n)$ errors in $O(n)$ time? For $C_{0}$ being the parity-check code, the landmark work of Sipser and Spielman (IEEE-TIT’96) showed that $\delta \gt 3/4$ is sufficient; later, Viderman (ACM-TOCT’13) improved this to $\delta \gt 2/3-\Omega (1)$ and he also showed that $\delta \gt 1/2$ is necessary. For general linear code $C_{0}$ , the previously best-known result of Dowling and Gao (IEEE-TIT’18) showed that $d_{0}=\Omega (c\delta ^{-2})$ is sufficient, where c is the left-degree of G. We present a near-optimal solution to the above problem for general $C_{0}$ by showing that $\delta d_{0}\gt 3$ is sufficient and $\delta d_{0}\gt 1$ is necessary, thereby significantly improving Dowling-Gao’s result. To prove the sufficient condition, we present two novel algorithms for decoding arbitrary expander codes with $\delta d_{0}\gt 3$ , where the first algorithm is deterministic, and the second one is randomized and has a larger decoding radius. To prove the necessary condition, we generalize the aforementioned necessary result of Viderman, and construct for every pair of $\delta,d_{0}$ with $\delta d_{0}=1$ , an expander code with constant distance, that only corrects a constant number of errors.},

  abstract     = {Coded computing has proved to be useful in distributed computing, and has addressed challenges such as straggler workers. We have observed that almost all coded computing systems studied so far consider a setup of one leader and some workers. However, recently emerging technologies such as blockchain, internet of things, and federated learning introduce new requirements for coded computing systems. In these systems, data is generated (and probably stored) in a distributed manner, so central encoding/decoding by a leader is not feasible and scalable. This paper presents a multi-leader distributed coded computing system that consists of $k\in \mathbb {N}$ data owners and $N\in \mathbb {N}$ workers, where data owners employ workers to do some computations on their data, as specified by a target function f of degree $d\in \mathbb {N}$ . As there is no central encoder, workers perform encoding themselves, prior to computation phase. The challenge in this system is the presence of adversarial data owners that do not know the data of honest data owners but cause discrepancies by sending different versions of data to different workers, which is detrimental to local encodings in workers. There are at most $\beta \in \mathbb {N}$ adversarial data owners, and each distributes at most $v\in \mathbb {N}$ different versions of data. Since the adversaries and their possibly colluded behavior are not known to workers and honest data owners, workers compute tags of their received data, in addition to their main computational task, and send them to data owners in order to help them in decoding. We introduce a tag function that allows data owners to partition workers into sets that previously had received the same data from all data owners. Then, we characterize the fundamental limit of this multi-leader distributed coded computing system, denoted by $t^{*}$ , which is the minimum number of workers whose work can be used to correctly calculate the desired function of data of honest data owners. We show that $t^{*}=v^{\beta }d(K-1)+1$ , and present converse and achievable proofs.},

Particularly, we deterministically construct two GRS codes with given code length, dimensions, and intersection dimension. As an application of our main results, we derive the algebraic structure of the hull of a GRS code and exhibit a necessary and sufficient condition for the hull to be a GRS code. In addition, we discuss when a GRS code is self-orthogonal or dual-containing and when the hull of an RS code is again an RS code. Finally, as an application, we resolve the problem of explicit construction of MDS entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) from classical codes for $n \leq q$ .

  abstract     = {The optimal receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, giving the maximum probability of detection as a function of the probability of false alarm, is a key information-theoretic indicator of the difficulty of a binary hypothesis testing problem (BHT). It is well known that the optimal ROC curve for a given BHT, corresponding to the likelihood ratio test, is determined by the probability distribution of the observed data under each of the two hypotheses. In some cases, these two distributions may be unknown or computationally intractable, but independent samples of the likelihood ratio can be observed. This raises the problem of estimating the optimal ROC for a BHT from such samples. The maximum likelihood estimator of the optimal ROC curve is derived, and it is shown to converge almost surely to the true optimal ROC curve in the Lévy metric, as the number of observations tends to infinity. Finite sample size bounds are obtained for three other estimators: the classical empirical estimator, based on estimating the two types of error probabilities from two separate sets of samples, and two variations of the maximum likelihood estimator called the split estimator and fused estimator, respectively. The maximum likelihood estimator is observed in simulation experiments to be considerably more accurate than the empirical estimator, especially when the number of samples obtained under one of the two hypotheses is small. The area under the maximum likelihood estimator is derived; it is a consistent estimator of the area under the true optimal ROC curve.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers guessing-based decoders with abandonment for discrete memoryless channels in which all codewords have the same composition. This class of decoders rank-orders all input sequences in the codebook’s composition class from “closest” to “farthest” from the channel output and then queries them sequentially in that order for codebook membership. Decoding terminates when a codeword is encountered or when a predetermined number of guesses is reached, and decoding is abandoned. We derive ensemble-tight first-order asymptotics for the code rate and abandonment rate, which shows that guessing-based decoding is more efficient than conventional testing-based decoding whenever the capacity of the channel exceeds half the entropy of the capacity-achieving input distribution. The main focus of this paper is on refined asymptotics, specifically, second-order asymptotics, error exponents, and strong converse exponents. The optimal second-order region is characterized in terms of the minimum of the second-order code and abandonment rates. The error (resp. strong converse) exponent is characterized in terms of the minimum (resp. maximum) of the usual channel coding exponent and an abandonment exponent, which turns out to be a special case of the exponent of conditional almost-lossless source coding.},

  abstract     = {The two-user broadcast channel (BC) with receivers connected by bidirectional cooperation links of finite capacities, known as conferencing decoders, is considered. A novel capacity region outer bound is established based on multiple applications of the Csiszár-Körner identity. Achievable rate regions are derived by using Marton’s coding as the transmission scheme, together with different combinations of decode-and-forward and quantize-bin-and-forward strategies at the receivers. It is shown that the outer bound coincides with the achievable rate region for a new class of semi-deterministic BCs with degraded message sets; for this class of channels, one-round cooperation is sufficient to achieve the capacity. Capacity result is also derived for a class of more capable semi-deterministic BCs with both common and private messages and one-sided conferencing. For the Gaussian BC with conferencing decoders, if the noises at the decoders are perfectly correlated (i.e., the correlation is either 1 or −1), the new outer bound yields exact capacity region for two cases: 1) BC with degraded message sets; 2) BC with one-sided conferencing from the weaker receiver to the stronger receiver. When the noises have arbitrary correlation, the outer bound is shown to be within half a bit from the capacity region for these same two cases. Finally, for the general Gaussian BC, a one-sided cooperation scheme based on decode-and-forward from the stronger receiver to the weaker receiver is shown to achieve the capacity region to within $\frac {1}{2}\log \left ({{\frac {2}{1-|\lambda |}}}\right)$ bits, where $\lambda $ is the noise correlation. An interesting implication of these results is that for a Gaussian BC with perfectly negatively correlated noises and conferencing decoders with finite cooperation link capacities, it is possible to achieve a strictly positive rate using only an infinitesimal amount of transmit power.},

  abstract     = {Consider a composite hypothesis testing problem where the test has access to the null hypothesis P but not to the alternative hypothesis Q. The generalized likelihood-ratio test (GLRT) for this problem is the Hoeffding test, which accepts P if the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the empirical distribution of $Z^{n}$ and P is below some threshold. This paper proposes a generalization of the Hoeffding test, termed divergence test, for which the KL divergence is replaced by an arbitrary divergence. For this test, the first and second-order terms of the type-II error probability for a fixed type-I error probability are characterized and compared with the error terms of the Neyman-Pearson test, which is the optimal test when both P and Q are known. It is demonstrated that, irrespective of the divergence, divergence tests achieve the first-order term of the Neyman-Pearson test. In contrast, the second-order term of divergence tests is strictly worse than that of the Neyman-Pearson test. It is further demonstrated that divergence tests with an invariant divergence achieve the same second-order term as the Hoeffding test, but divergence tests with a non-invariant divergence may outperform the Hoeffding test for some alternative hypotheses Q. This implies that the GLRT may have a second-order asymptotic performance that is strictly suboptimal.},

  abstract     = {We apply the innovations method to Viterbi decoding of convolutional codes. First, we calculate the covariance matrix of the innovation (i.e., the soft-decision input to the main decoder in a scarce-state-transition (SST) Viterbi decoder). Then a covariance matrix corresponding to that of the one-step prediction error in the Kalman filter is obtained. Furthermore, from that matrix, a covariance matrix corresponding to that of the filtering error in the Kalman filter is derived using the formula in the Kalman filter. This is justified from the fact that Viterbi decoding of convolutional codes has the structure of the Kalman filter. As a result, an upper bound on the average mutual information per branch for Viterbi decoding of convolutional codes is given using these covariance matrices. Also, the trace of the latter covariance matrix represents the (filtering) linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) per branch. We show that an upper bound on the average mutual information per branch is sandwiched between half the SNR times the filtering and one-step prediction LMMSEs per branch. In the case of quick-look-in (QLI) codes, from the covariance matrix of the soft-decision input to the main decoder, we can get a matrix. We show that the trace of this matrix has some connection with the linear smoothing error.},

  abstract     = {Designing capacity-achieving coding schemes for the band-limited additive colored Gaussian noise (ACGN) channel has been and is still a challenge. In this paper, the capacity of the band-limited ACGN channel is studied from a fundamental algorithmic point of view by addressing the question of whether or not the capacity can be algorithmically computed. To this aim, the concept of Turing machines is used, which provides fundamental performance limits of digital computers. It is shown that there are band-limited ACGN channels having computable continuous spectral densities whose capacity are non-computable numbers. Moreover, it is demonstrated that for those channels, it is impossible to find computable sequences of asymptotically sharp upper bounds for their capacities. Furthermore, the implications of the non-computability of the ACGN channel capacity in information theory and coding are discussed, particularly regarding the impossibility of computing achievable rates in the finite blocklength regime and the challenges of finding universal algorithms that compute capacity-achieving power spectral densities for the ACGN channel.},
