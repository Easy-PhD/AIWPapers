  abstract     = {Accurate detection of 3D objects is vital to the perception of the railway environments for the safe operation autonomous trains, particularly given the complexity of railway environments and the challenges in detecting objects of variable sizes and of distant objects. This study introduces RailFusion, a LiDAR-Camera fusion network for integrating multi-modal features. RailFusion consists of two main modules: Cross-Domain Feature Extraction (CDFE) and Multi-Modal Fusion (MMF). Specifically, the CDFE module is designed with a novel feature extraction method to enhance cross-domain features interaction by utilizing LiDAR spatial depth and image semantic information. The MMF module uses deformable attention for aligning and fusing multi-modal features. Further to this, the channel normalization fusion is proposed to assign channel weights. Experimental results show that the mean average-precision (mAP) of our proposed RailFusion is 57.2%, which is 8.4% higher than the baseline 3D object detection network BEVFusion. Moreover, the results show that RailFusion is applicable to long-range detection as well as for detecting varying sized and short-range objects. All these indicate that RailFusion has the potential to be readily applicable in 3D object detection in railway environments.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, rolling stock can be equipped with high-frequency vibration sensors to continuously monitor rail infrastructures and detect defects. These moving sensors measure at high speeds and sampling frequencies, generating a massive amount of data that covers each track position with very short signal durations. These data contain a variety of dynamic and transient responses that vary significantly along the track and are affected by noise. This leads to a large amount of unlabeled and noisy data, complicating the extraction of dynamic responses for effective anomaly detection. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an unsupervised representation learning methodology to automatically capture and extract characteristic features of dynamic responses that reflect the conditions of rail infrastructures. The unsupervised nature allows exploratory analysis of high-frequency vibration signals when prior knowledge or reference information about infrastructure conditions is unavailable or very limited. A collaborative optimization process that synchronizes empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) is presented. The EMD level is tuned to remove noise while preserving effective vibration responses. The CAE is trained using demodulated signals that are considered normal to generate representations that ensure reconstruction quality and differentiate between normal and abnormal conditions. Furthermore, a Gaussian mixture model is used to showcase the effectiveness of the learned representations for rail infrastructures. Applied to validated axle box acceleration data for rail defect detection and train-borne laser Doppler vibrometer data for rail fastener monitoring, our method outperforms other variants of autoencoder-based models and the wavelet-based CAE in accurately identifying the conditions. It achieves an average improvement of 16% with the axle box acceleration data and 21% with the laser Doppler vibrometer data.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the concept of “digital twins” (DTs) has gained increasing attention in the railroad industry. This complex concept allows the creation of digital representations of physical assets or processes and can support a railroad’s transportation system throughout its lifecycle. For decades, MxV Rail has used the Facility for Accelerated Service Testing (FAST (Registered trademark.) to enable research and testing designed to improve the safety, reliability, and efficiency of North American railroads. At FAST, data streams generated by 1) operations, 2) maintenance, 3) wayside and onboard detector technologies, and 4) individual testing are employed to better understand the effects of heavy axle loads (HAL) as high tonnage accumulates on track components at various stages of wear. The development and implementation of DTs have strong potential to support decision-making for infrastructure and mechanical systems with regard to monitoring, predictive maintenance, and knowledge transfer to conditions where data is unavailable. This paper seeks to open the conversation by reviewing the concept of DTs in the North American railroad industry and showing the vision of the implementation layers for making a DT for FAST and the current efforts to achieve this vision.},

Based on historical URT accident data, this study develops a hybrid ensemble learning model based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for predicting accident consequences in URT. The CNN is employed to capture spatial patterns from the diverse accident data, while the BERT is applied to learn complex relations in accident text descriptions. The results of the two models are combined for classifying accident consequences. The proposed hybrid ensemble learning model was applied to predict accident consequences in Chongqing’s URT using historical accident records. It achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.805 on testing data set, which is at least 20% higher than that of commonly used machine learning models, including multilayer perceptrons, support vector machines, and Bayesian networks. Furthermore, the reapplication of the proposed model to historical accident records of the URT in Chengdu demonstrates the generalizability and reusability of the model. This study forecasts the consequences of URT accidents with high accuracy using limited historical data, which supports operators in identifying high-frequency and high-impact accidents. Consequently, targeted maintenance and timely emergency response strategies can be developed to decrease accident rates and mitigate the impacts.},

Previous works construct recognizers with complicated training procedures and additional corpora to boost performance, limiting their efficiency in practical application scenarios. This paper proposes a novel ship license plate recognizer by combining autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) decoding mechanisms. By adaptively incorporating the dual-branch character representations, our method explicitly sidesteps the dependence on an external language model and is adapted to the weak semantic correlation characteristics of ship name text images. Furthermore, we introduce a confidence-based dynamic reweighting strategy that includes character- and instance-level granularities. This encourages the model to learn more from hard or challenging samples. Experimental results conducted on two SLPR benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing that it is competitive and outperforms previous approaches. Our study comprehensively explores the relative importance of linguistic and visual cues in SLPR and demonstrates the advantages of the dynamically fused model with dual-branch autoregressive and non-autoregressive over single-branch recognition.},

By considering practical aspects, such as the movement characteristics of each vehicle and the avoidance of no-fly zones for the UAV, we aim to optimize the three-dimensional trajectories and pickup strategies of the two vehicles to identify the shortest route to minimize pickup completion time. To deal with the nonconvex optimization problem, we employ a successive convex approximation to convert the original problem into a convex form for optimization variables, and we also use a penalty convex-concave procedure to retain the binary natures of the control parameters that are required to design the pickup strategy. We also propose a two-stage iterative algorithm based on interior-point methods to solve the relaxed convex problem to find suboptimal solutions. The simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme can successfully allow the UAV and UGV to follow the shortest effective path and thus improve pickup completion time through load balancing, while outperforming the baseline schemes under various scenarios.},

Building on this groundwork, we further develop a universal sensing-adjustment system with dynamically activated states triggered by the defined safety boundary, enabling active readjustment of the prescribed envelope boundaries. This results in a new PPC scheme capable of promptly detecting error fluctuations and smoothly readjusting prescribed envelopes, effectively addressing the fragility defect associated with existing protocols while ensuring hypersonic flight safety. Moreover, our proposed hypersonic controller does not necessitate approximators or learning parameters required for current fuzzy/neural control approaches, showcasing a low-computational design framework.

In this paper, two main contributions have been made: 1) for driver loop, a variable steering ratio (VSR) strategy applied to SBW system is designed based on an improved fuzzy controller, whose parameters are optimized through simulated annealing (SA) algorithm; 2) for intelligent control system loop, an improved RL-MPC method is proposed to realize the high precision steering tracking control for autonomous vehicles (AVs), in which MPC and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) are deeply integrated to combine their short-term optimization ability and long-term value estimation capability. Moreover, to shorten the time of overall training and ensure that the optimal control strategy can be explored, the DDPG agent is pretrained before the parallel training of RL-MPC. CarSim-MATLAB/Simulink co-simulation results show that in the whole tracking process, the lateral position error and yaw angle error of the vehicle are significantly reduced, indicating that the tracking accuracy is greatly improved. Meanwhile, the steering wheel angle and speed are also reduced, which means that the driver will spend less energy during the steering process.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving has become an inevitable trend in automotive development. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is extensively used in autonomous vehicle motion planning, demonstrating good generalization but facing challenges of long training times and lack of consideration of uncertainty. To address these challenges, an Adaptive Heuristic Reinforcement Learning (AHRL) approach is proposed. First, this study improves upon the Dueling Double Deep Q Network (D3QN) algorithm by proposing the Adaptive Heuristic Dueling Double Deep Q Network (Adapt-HD3QN) algorithm. Specifically, heuristic functions from search-based planning algorithms are incorporated into the RL reward terms to guide heuristic learning and enhance learning efficiency. Additionally, considering the uncertainties in real-world driving environments, such as the movement of other traffic participants and building occlusions, a Mixed Artificial Potential Field (Mix-APF) is implemented to address static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Furthermore, potential collisions between the autonomous vehicle and other vehicles in occluded areas are modeled as a zero-sum game, with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) used for prior modeling of potential vehicles, aiding in constructing the potential vehicle’s forward hidden set. Finally, a signal-free intersection scenario, a typical crash-prone road type, is constructed on CARLA, incorporating static obstacles and other traffic participants. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Adapt-HD3QN algorithm exhibits superior safety, training efficiency, and traffic efficiency in scenarios with road environment perception uncertainties caused by occlusion.},

  abstract     = {Online map matching (MM) aligns real-time GPS trajectories with digital road networks, playing a vital role in vehicle navigation, route planning, and traffic analysis. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are widely used for their interpretability and ability to handle low GPS sampling rates. However, in urban scenarios characterized by complex road networks, significant GPS localization error, and dynamic traffic conditions, existing HMM-based methods face challenges such as large road search spaces due to uniform GPS localization error distributions (GLED) and inaccurate route accessibility estimates stemming from inadequate consideration of real-time traffic conditions. This paper proposes an improved HMM-based MM method, recognizing that urban vehicle trajectories can be categorized into two types: path-free (e.g., taxis, private cars) and path-constrained (e.g., buses). Analyzing path-constrained trajectories helps estimate fine-grained GLED and real-time traffic states of path-free vehicles more precisely. The novelty of our approach lies in two aspects: i) Using a hierarchical spectral clustering algorithm based on GPS localization errors of path-constrained bus trajectories, a city is divided into fine-grained sub-regions with consistent GLED. This enables the HMM an adaptive road search scopes, improving online MM efficiency. ii) Gradient boosting trees, known for their interpretability, estimate free-flow speeds by integrating path-constrained trajectories with the factors like road attributes and time, optimizing HMM state transition probabilities for path-free trajectory MM. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that the optimized HMM methods, leveraging different trajectory types, significantly enhance MM efficiency and accuracy compared to baseline models.The codebase of our methods and datasets are available at https://github.com/jacklee018/onlineMM-IPCT.},

  abstract     = {Effective traffic prediction is a critical component of traffic management, especially long-term traffic prediction, as it holds significance for urban traffic planning, traffic warning, people’s travel planning, etc. Traffic flow data usually include natural spatio-temporal characteristics, which means the spatial and temporal dependencies are both to be considered for building traffic prediction model. Hence, a triple dynamic graph convolutional recurrent network (TDGCRN) is proposed in this paper, in which a temporal segmentation-based triple spatio-temporal encoder-decoder module is used to capture correlation features of different periods contained in traffic dataset, such as hourly, daily, and weekly cycles; and then a dynamic fusion module is introduced to adaptively learn the weights of different periods to effectively fuse these different cycle features; finally a congestion index-based adjacency matrix update module is utilized to model the topology of graphs to capture the dynamic topology characteristics of the road network. In addition, the congestion index is presented to detect the topology changes caused by traffic congestion to reduce the number of dynamic graphs so as to save computational cost in the training process on our self-collected dataset WH-CN. Experiments on the public dataset (PEMS-BAY and METR-LA datasets) and WH-CN dataset show that our model achieved average improvements of 0.98%, 1.19%, and 1.17% in MAE, RMSE, and MAPE metrics by comparison with the suboptimal baseline, respectively. And on the WH-CN dataset, it also reduced the average training time per epoch by reducing the frequency of dynamic graph generation, thereby reducing the computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) is a non-encrypted authentication technology that adds a layer of security to wireless communications in intelligent transportation systems. However, most existing SEI methods are constrained to identify fixed classes and cannot learn incrementally. In practical applications, the constant emergence of new classes or tasks necessitates the capacity to continuously learn new classes from streaming data. In this paper, combining momentum-based prototype correction and hierarchical regularization, a simple and effective non-example class-incremental method for SEI is proposed, named MoPC-HR. The momentum-based prototype correction dynamically adjusts old class prototypes (i.e., old class centers), strengthening the separation between old and new classes and enabling smoother integration of new classes. Hierarchical regularization is applied at multiple levels to control feature differences between old and new classes, preventing the model from favoring new classes and reducing catastrophic forgetting. Experiments on real-world AIS-100 and ADS-B datasets show that MoPC-HR outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, in the incremental phase 20, MoPC-HR achieves an average accuracy of 97.04%, average forgetting of 2.95%, and average intransigence of 2.85% on the AIS-100 dataset; and an average accuracy of 95.99%, average forgetting of 3.66%, and average intransigence of 3.60% on the ADS-B dataset.

Previous research has demonstrated that effective feature representation enhances model performance, yet few methods thoroughly explore the complementary relationships between features at different scales in complex wild environments. In this paper, we propose a Progressive Terrain Segmentation Network (PTSNet) for the segmentation of navigable areas, which introduces global contextual information as prior knowledge for fusion and delivers robust feature representation by progressively exploring the complementary relationships between multi-scale features from both spatial and channel perspectives. PTSNet consists of two main components: the Global Sparsity-Entropy Module (GSEM) and the Fusion-Awareness Module (FAM). The GSEM, based on self-attention, employs Top-K sparsity and entropy refinement to effectively capture global semantic information with long-range dependencies, and the information derived from GSEM act as prior knowledge to guide feature fusion. Additionally, we propose the FAM, which consists of the Attention Aggregation Unit (AAU) and the Contribution-aware Unit (CAU), to explore complementary relationships in multi-scale feature interactions and obtain sufficient scene information. Extensive experiments conducted on various wild datasets demonstrate that PTSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurately segmenting navigable areas, offering a new solution for the safe operation of self-driving systems in wild environments.

  abstract     = {The increasing depletion of fossil fuels and growing environmental concerns are increasing the need for energy efficient and sustainable solutions, particularly in transport. At this point, especially in public transport, electric vehicles (EVs) offer a promising alternative; however, issues such as range anxiety and energy efficiency require comprehensive solutions. This study introduces the Gauss-based Trolleybus Energy Consumption Model (GTECM) for electric buses, harnessing real-time big data to mitigate range anxiety and enhance energy efficiency. This model employs Gaussian Process Regression to a large-scale dataset including 100,000 entries collected over six months in Türkiye. With an overall Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.013905, GTECM substantially outperforms linear approaches across Türkiye’s primary routes, exhibiting route-specific RMSE values between 0.28117 and 0.30540. Empirical findings suggest potential energy savings of up to 50%, alongside a 10% extension in driving range, thereby mitigating an estimated 4,220 tons of CO2 and 129.88 tons of NO2 emissions annually. Moreover, the projected amortization period for diesel-to-electric bus conversion stands at 6.83 years, underscoring GTECM’s pragmatic utility for sustainable urban transit optimization. The findings of the study can form the basis for future research and guide policy makers and urban planners in the development of more efficient and sustainable transport networks.},

Therefore, developing intelligent routing and scheduling systems to efficiently coordinate multi-robot movements in transportation networks emerges as a critical challenge. To address this issue, this study constructs an optimization model for cooperative robot operations, aiming to minimize total energy consumption and the completion time of most time-consuming robot. These objectives contain conflicts, thus requiring a multi-objective optimization approach to resolve them. We propose a reinforced neighborhood search method combined with genetic algorithm (RNSGA), which combines single solution search ideas and population-based techniques. RNSGA consists of two crucial steps: route construction to determine the composition and visiting sequence of task points within each route, as well as route allocation to assign routes to individual robots. The route construction phase incorporates several key components, including solution initialization, route balance mechanism, proximity-based optimization mechanism, and intro-route sequence adjustment method. For the route allocation phase, a population-based allocation mechanism is employed to determine the optimal assignment of routes. Comprehensive experiments on 24 classic transportation test instances demonstrate that RNSGA significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art algorithms.},

To facilitate this, the decision making system of AVs must accurately assess HDV intentions while accounting for inherent uncertainties. Current HDV intention prediction models often misclassify these intentions, leading to unsafe navigation decisions. This study introduces a three-stage Bayesian sequential game-based decision making architecture designed for AV operation. In the first stage, the AV utilizes a temporal neural network to classify vehicle intentions. In the second stage, a sequential game is solved to determine optimal actions by predicting future HDV states. The final stage, serving as a validation stage, identifies and corrects misclassifications from the first stage by predicting HDV future positions, incorporating models that account for potential deviations from the ground truth. Simulation results indicate a $93.5\pm 0.5$ % accuracy in initial intention predictions, facilitating swift and effective decision making. The validation stage further enhances safety by promptly correcting errors, ensuring reliable navigation for AVs in HDV environments.},

We introduce a novel Internet of Autonomous Vehicles (IoAV) architecture integrating an AI-driven intrusion detection system with a Chaotic Map-Based Authenticated Key Agreement protocol to address these security concerns. This integration dynamically mitigates evolving security threats through adaptive system responses. Our framework incorporates Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) technology to generate cryptographically secure private keys, establishing robust communication channels between users, Charging Stations (CS), and AVs coordinated by an Electric Service Provider (ESP). Rigorous evaluation using the Real-or-Random (ROR) model demonstrates the protocol’s resilience against diverse attack vectors, including man-in-the-middle, replay, and adversarial attacks. Experimental validation confirms the framework’s effectiveness (97.8% detection accuracy, AUC-ROC: 0.976), computational efficiency (31.25% reduction in overhead, 4.2ms inference latency), and operational resilience (99.3% authentication integrity under $10^{3}$ requests/second DDoS simulation).

The integrity of multi-sensor signals over time is critical for the train’s Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system. However, data missing during multi-sensor signal acquisition and transmission can severely limit the performance of PHM systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Conditional Time Series Diffusion (CTSDiff) model designed for efficient and accurate imputation of missing values in high-speed trains’ multi-sensor time series signals. Firstly, CTSDiff utilizes the non-missing sensor signals collected as conditional information to guide missing data generation, thereby achieving data imputation. Secondly, CTSDiff employs one-dimensional convolutional residual blocks with dilation parameters to capture complex temporal dependencies and adopts a skip-step non-Markovian sampling process to accelerate the imputation procedure. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that CTSDiff can generate high-quality and diverse imputations across various missing data scenarios. The imputation data provided by CTSDiff ensures consistency with actual data distribution and obtains confidence information of the imputed data, significantly enhancing the integrity of multi-sensor signals in high-speed trains and the accuracy of intelligent analysis within PHM systems. Notably, this study opens new avenues for addressing missing data issues in high-speed train multi-sensor datasets and showcases the great potential of diffusion models in generating sensor signals.},

However, the current DRT dispatching hardly achieves a balance between the operating costs and service flexibility, leading to a high failure rate of DRT operation. To address this issue, this research proposes a dispatching method for DRT with passengers’ hidden preference exploitation capability. The proposed DRT dispatching method overcomes the imbalance shortcomings of conventional method and bears the following features: 1) With the capability of exploiting the passengers’ hidden preference; 2) With the capability of making the most of the passengers’ room for compromise. To evaluate the proposed dispatching method, a numerical experiment compared with conventional DRT dispatching model is conducted, and sensitivity analysis is performed for passenger satisfaction level threshold. The evaluation results show that with the capability of exploiting the passengers’ hidden preference, the proposed DRT dispatching method is able to improve the average travel time by 27.8%~47.5% and reduce the average waiting time by 26.4%~47.4%; via making the most of the passengers’ room for compromise, the proposed DRT dispatching method is able to enhance the passenger average satisfaction by 65.3%~85.7%.

  abstract     = {Identifying driving heterogeneity plays an important role in improving traffic safety and efficiency. This paper proposes a novel framework to identify driving heterogeneity from the underlying characteristics of driving behaviour. The framework includes three processes: Action phase extraction, Action pattern calibration, and Action pattern classification. The concepts of Action phase and Action patterns are proposed to decipher and interpret driving behaviours. Action phases are extracted by rule-based segmentation methods and Action patterns are calibrated based on an unsupervised learning approach. The extraction and calibration processes provide a rigorous labelling approach for the attention-based LSTM Action pattern classification process. Evaluation of the framework on a large-scale naturalistic driving dataset reveals six distinct Action patterns. The implementation of the attention mechanism to LSTM models significantly enhanced both the accuracy and time efficiency of Action pattern identification. The proposed framework offers benefits in detecting and reducing variability in driving behaviour through ITS applications such as user-based traffic management, personalised Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), and advanced autonomous vehicles (AV) design, thereby enhancing road safety and traffic efficiency.},

  abstract     = {RGB-thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation enables intelligent vehicles to understand environments while operating in urban scenes. However, the research encounters two main challenges: 1) scarcity of training samples under snowy conditions and 2) challenge in applying the model in practice. To address the first challenge, we proposed a publicly accessible RGB-T semantic segmentation dataset in snowy urban scenes (SUS dataset). The SUS dataset comprises 1035 pairs of precisely registered RGB-T images, and provides pixel-level semantic annotations for five categories for all images. To tackle the second challenge, we introduced MCNet-S ${}^{\ast }$ , a novel semantic segmentation model that leverages knowledge distillation (KD). The KD structure consists of an RGB-T teacher model, named MCNet-T, and an RGB student model, named MCNet-S. Within MCNet-T, we proposed a cross-modal dual association (CDA) module to enhance utilization of RGB-T information in snowy urban scenes. Within MCNet-S, a depth-wise separable pyramid (DSP) module was proposed to improve the efficiency of RGB information utilization and align the feature dimensions with those of MCNet-T. Between MCNet-S and MCNet-T, memory-based contrastive learning distillation (MCLD) was proposed to transfer the prior thermal knowledge, improving the segmentation accuracy of MCNet-S and obtaining optimized MCNet-S $\ast $ . Extensive experiments on the SUS and MFNet datasets show that the proposed models outperform state-of-the-art models. The SUS dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/xiaodonguo/SUS_dataset.},

  abstract     = {Transportation infrastructure significantly influences the development of sustainable transportation systems and the effective management of road networks. Accurate segmentation of road infrastructure provides valuable data and a structured approach for the effective management of road deterioration. However, existing methods are limited in segmenting road deterioration data due to the lack of probabilistic assessment and the inability to effectively handle outliers. To address this gap, the Gaussian mixture segmentation (GMS) model is introduced, applying a Gaussian mixture distribution to model the variability in road deterioration. Our approach utilizes spatial line segmentation to effectively segment large-scale road networks into meaningful segments. The GMS model was applied to road deterioration data from the South West region of Western Australia, identifying and segmenting roads based on their distribution characteristics using the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence. To assess the performance of the GMS model, metrics such as the number of segments, coefficient of variation (CV), Caliński-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index were evaluated. The results demonstrate that the GMS model outperformed existing segmentation methods, achieving an increase in the average percentage of segments with a CV lower than 0.25 by 23.5% to 98.8%, along with a reduction in the average Davies-Bouldin Index by 25.2% to 64.4% and improvements in the average Caliński-Harabasz Index, which increased by 23.0% to 131.1%. This approach enhances the understanding of the spatial distribution of road deterioration, informing maintenance strategies for large-scale road networks and addressing the complexities of road infrastructure management, including traffic dynamics and environmental impacts.},

  abstract     = {Testing asphalt binder’s viscoelastic properties is complex and resource-consuming, contrasting with readily available composition data. Establishing a connection between these two aspects is vital, but limited high-quality data poses challenges. Data augmentation through virtual data generation can address this issue. Traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) struggle with the intricacy of asphalt binder data, so we propose a hybrid VAE-GAN model, combining a Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with GAN, specifically designed for this data type. We evaluated eight machine learning algorithms to determine the best one for linking asphalt binder composition and viscoelastic properties. Next, we constructed a progressive data augmentation framework to efficiently integrate the generated data. Our findings confirm that the VAE-GAN effectively creates realistic virtual data, with support vector regression (SVR) emerging as the top choice for building the relationship model. Integrating the augmented data improved prediction accuracy by around 30% compared to using only real data, verifying the efficiency of our virtual data generation approach. To enhance the practicality of the relationship model, we created a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). This study streamlines asphalt performance evaluation and adaptable design, addressing data limitations in materials research, thus supporting sustainable and low-carbon development goals. By simplifying complex processes and improving data utilization, our work paves the way for smarter material designs in various industries.},

Then, a time alignment model based on the hypothesis of linear translation in Bird’s Eye View (BEV) feature maps is introduced, providing a detailed design for the direction and distance of the translation operation.

  abstract     = {Blockchain serves as a trust layer for data exchange in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) due to its immutability and transparency. However, it can also be abused to spread false and inaccurate information. Additionally, the explosive growth of data in VANETs and the limited storage capacity of edge nodes make it challenging to maintain the entire blockchain. To address these challenges, we propose an anonymous vehicle announcement scheme based on redactable blockchain. Specifically, we propose a novel ephemeral trapdoor revocable chameleon hash scheme (ETRCH) that enables decentralized management and enforced revocation of redaction privileges. ETRCH deploys multiple regulators, each capable of creating multiple ephemeral trapdoors. These regulators enable $\boldsymbol {k}$ -out-of- $\boldsymbol {n}$ edge nodes associated with the same ephemeral trapdoor to collaboratively rewrite blockchain data, thereby addressing storage limitations. In addition, $\boldsymbol {k}$ -out-of- $\boldsymbol {n}$ regulators can cooperate to update the ephemeral trapdoor and revoke the redaction privileges of any malicious regulator discovered to be abusing their privileges. To facilitate the threshold authentication of announcement messages, we construct a redactable threshold ring signature scheme (RTRS) based on ETRCH, enabling anonymous signing of announcements in VANETs. Additionally, if a regulator detects a false or misleading message, the content can be promptly rewritten. Finally, we conducted rigorous security analysis and comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. The results demonstrate that compared to VANETs systems based on immutable blockchains, our scheme is both secure and efficient.},

Besides, existing research primarily focuses on the countermeasures for detecting but lacks the strategies to be taken after a cyberattack has occurred. In this study, we propose a Cyberattack Trajectory-based Forecasting and Warning System (Cyber-TFWS) that demonstrates effective perception, prediction, judgement and warning capabilities under cyberattacks to enhance the safety against spoofing attacks in CV environment. We introduce a research framework for effectively collecting the trajectories of human-driven CVs under cyberattacks and the trajectories are processed by an unsupervised algorithm. A novel generative-based algorithm named CAGAN integrating into our system is also proposed. The results indicate the proposed system successfully issues the warning actions to the specific drivers and prevented 100% of red-light running behaviors and also significantly enhanced the safety. The proposed system has the potential to be incorporated with CV applications and can benefit governs or police markers in developing the cyberattack protection system.},

  abstract     = {Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is critical for ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles and advancing higher levels of driving automation. However, the complex interpersonal interactions and highly dynamic trajectory patterns in real-world scenarios pose significant challenges to achieving precise predictions. Recently, Transformers have shown remarkable success in pedestrian trajectory prediction, primarily due to their effective modeling of temporal and spatial dependencies via Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHA) mechanisms. Despite these advancements, existing self-attention methods often rely on Euclidean distance-based metrics and dot-product operations, which are inadequate for capturing interaction-induced trajectory curvatures. To address this limitation, we propose a novel hybrid Transformer architecture, FuseFormer, that incorporates Geodesic Self-Attention (GSA) mechanisms. GSA utilizes geodesic distances to characterize interaction features effectively, complementing MHA, which excels in capturing local features and maintaining temporal correlations. FuseFormer employs a gating network to adaptively combine GSA and MHA embeddings, leveraging their complementary strengths. Additionally, FuseFormer integrates a Transformer-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) decoder to model trajectory temporal dynamics. This design enables the generation of future trajectories that align closely with motion trends while adapting the network depth to input sequence lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that FuseFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across widely used pedestrian trajectory prediction datasets, including ETH/UCY, SDD, and NBA. These results underscore the model’s effectiveness and generalization capability in capturing complex interaction patterns and handling diverse scenarios.},

In this article, we propose an end-to-end learning approach that synthesizes imitation learning with DRL for AAV navigation and obstacle avoidance. Specifically, we formulate this problem as a partially observable Markov decision process with sparse rewards and learn an end-to-end policy that maps imperfect sensor data to control signals. To efficiently optimize the policy under the sparse reward setting, we propose the selective behavior cloning enhanced actor-critic (SBCAC) algorithm. By integrating an experience filter and a Q-value based action selector to selectively mimic an artificial potential field based non-expert policy, our approach significantly improves the learning performance and sample efficiency. Extensive simulations with fixed-wing and multi-rotor AAVs in different scenarios demonstrate that SBCAC achieves an average improvement of up to 16.07% in success rate, a 72.46% reduction in crash rate, and a 94.62% reduction in stray rate compared to the state-of-the-art selective imitation baseline. Furthermore, hardware-in-the-loop and physical experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing its potential for practical applications in complex environments.},

This paper endeavors to decompose the acceptance criterion into quantitative perception requirements, aiming to furnish developers with requirements that are not only understandable but also actionable. This paper introduces a risk decomposition methodology to derive SOTIF requirements for perception. More explicitly, for subsystem-level safety requirements, we define a collision severity model to establish requirements for state uncertainty and present a Bayesian model to discern requirements for existence uncertainty. For component-level safety requirements, we proposed a decomposition method based on the Shapley value.

  abstract     = {Existing RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) models are primarily trained on general-purpose datasets, which may lead to domain shift issues when applied directly to new, specific scenes, such as stereo traffic datasets. Though “large-scale datasets (COME15K and ReDweb-S)” have been released, they only partially address the domain shift problem. From the perspective of data augmentation, this paper presents a novel solution, which follows a weakly-supervised way to adapt generic RGB-D SOD models for specific scenarios, with a focus on traffic scene imagery. Our key idea is to equip plain videos (specific scenarios, i.e., traffic scenes) with newly estimated saliency informative depth maps and pseudo-SOD GTs, enabling them to support the retraining of existing RGB-D SOD models for meeting the requirements of these specific scenes. To achieve this, we offer a fresh perspective on how depth information can be leveraged in the SOD task and introduce a new paradigm for extracting intrinsic information from optical flows derived from videos to refine RGB-D SOD models. Our method achieves a 1.2% improvement in F-measure on RGB-D datasets and a 27% enhancement on real-world street view datasets compared to baseline models. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing model adaptability for traffic scene imagery, even with limited target domain data.

  abstract     = {In recent years, researchers have focused on identifying tasks related to driver state, traffic environment, and others to enhance the safety of autonomous driving assistance systems. However, current research on these tasks is conducted independently, neglecting the interconnections between the driver, traffic environment, and vehicle. In this paper, we propose a Unified Multi-task Assistive Driving Network Based on Multimodal Fusion (UMD-Net), the first unified model capable of recognizing four tasks simultaneously by utilizing multimodal data: driver behavior recognition, driver emotion recognition, traffic context recognition, and vehicle behavior recognition. In order to better enhance the synergistic effects between multiple tasks, we designed the position-sensitive multi-directional attention feature extraction subnetwork and recursive dynamic feature fusion module. The former captures the key features of multi-view images by different directions of attention mechanism to improve the generalization of the model across multiple tasks. The latter dynamically adjusts the fusion weight according to the multimodal features to enhance the representation ability of important features in multi-task learning. Our model was evaluated on the public dataset AIDE, achieving the best performance across all four tasks and a high accuracy of 95.31% in the traffic context recognition task, demonstrating the superiority of our approach. The code is available on https://github.com/Wenzhuo-Liu/UMD-Net.},

  abstract     = {Demand prediction is essential for enhancing the service quality of ride-hailing platforms. However, the imbalanced and highly skewed nature of ride-hailing demand poses challenges in achieving accurate predictions, especially at major transport hubs. Existing studies have predominantly focused on enhancing prediction models or algorithms, while the lack of attention given to understanding the underlying data characteristics inevitably leads to a mediocre prediction performance. To address this issue, this paper presents a practical approach-referred to Pattern Recognition and Prediction-that makes the trade-off between data intricacy and model flexibility. Firstly, the feature-weighted fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is employed to assign appropriate pattern labels to daily demand order sequences. Subsequently, reinforcement learning assists ensemble learning to recognize the service pattern for new instance and predict the recognized patterns based on the multi-layer stacking model. In particular, the reinforcement learning dynamically identifies the most suitable combination of predictors, which are then efficiently stacked using a multi-layer stacking model. To quantify the uncertainty in predictions, an improved kernel density estimation is additionally developed for interval predictions. Extensive experiments on a real-world ride-hailing dataset from Beijing West Railway Station, China, demonstrate improvements in both point and interval prediction accuracy, with the former exhibiting a minimum increase of 3.37% compared to benchmark models without pattern recognition, and the latter achieving a more balanced interval width and coverage compared to traditional parametric methods.},

First, a multiple point-mass model of the HST system, which reflects in-train coupling force between adjacent cars, is derived. It is assumed that the first car of the HST is a motor car, i.e. the car is capable of traction and braking. Next, under the conditions that the bias faults and the disturbances are norm-bounded, a computationally inexpensive decentralized adaptive control method with backstepping technique is developed. Utilizing the information garnered from the adaptive mechanism, the detrimental effects stemming from the aerodynamic resistance and the motor faults can be comprehensively eradicated in the motor cars. Furthermore, a linear matrix inequality technique is introduced to address the in-train coupling forces for ensuring the tracking stability of the trailer cars. It is shown that the resulting closed-loop system is not only stable, but also that the position tracking error and velocity tracking error of the motor cars can asymptotically converge to zero. Compared with the existing results, a computationally inexpensive decentralized adaptive asymptotic tracking control approach is proposed, which requires only one parameter to be updated online adaptively per motor car. Finally, simulation on a HST with 2 motor cars and 6 trailer cars is provided for verifying the theoretical results.},

Compared to existing studies on the MEE problem, the vehicle model employed more accurately reflects real-world traffic, and the limitation of undirected communication topologies is overcome. In this paper, an analytical method is proposed to search for the MEE, particularly for vehicle platoons equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC) and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) systems. This method derives analytical results regarding the MEE by examining the monotonicity relationship between the EDM and the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix. In particular, we examine the coupled effects of the moduli and phases of the eigenvalues on searching for the MEE. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the computation time required to calculate the EDM by three orders of magnitude compared to the traditional method.},

Radar sensors are known for their robustness in adverse weather conditions compared to other perception sensors such as LiDAR and cameras. However, their application in autonomous vehicles (AVs) is often limited due to the low-resolution data they produce. The primary aim of this study is to enhance radar images captured by AVs, enabling these vehicles to rely on radar sensors for object identification and semantic segmentation in all weather conditions. The training of the GAN was performed using ground truth images derived from high-resolution LiDAR point cloud maps and radar images collected in good weather conditions. These ground truth images were generated through a customized LiDAR scan accumulation method, followed by a two-dimensional (2D) projection and cropping process. Additionally, a customized data augmentation method was employed during the training process to improve the performance of the proposed method in adverse weather conditions. During the inference phase, our approach exclusively uses radar images to produce enhanced and semantically segmented versions of the input radar images. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through both qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating its capability to generate enhanced and semantically segmented images from radar images in all weather conditions.

  abstract     = {Vehicle visual localization uses vision sensors to capture environmental information, enabling precise localization of autonomous vehicles within their surroundings. However, current visual localization methods generally have some shortcomings: on one hand, they are limited by the camera’s field of view, on the other hand, their robustness is often inadequate under challenging conditions such as lighting changes, long-term scene changes, or occlusions. To address these issues, we formulate a general spherical camera model for both fisheye and panoramic cameras and propose a minimal solution for pose estimation using this model based on vehicle motion characteristic. The minimal solution cannot filter outliers, so a robust estimation framework is necessary. For outlier-rejection, we introduce two frameworks: a probabilistic optimal RANSAC and a globally optimal graph-based framework. We conduct a probabilistic analysis of the RANSAC to demonstrate its enhanced robustness given by the proposed minimal solution. To achieve robustness to extreme outliers (higher than 90%), we decouple the rotation and translation space through the minimal solution to construct maximum consensus graph for the two sub-problems. We then employs a maximum clique search algorithm to find the optimal solutions, achieving deterministic convergence while maintaining real-time performance. Extensive experiments with synthetic data, real-world fisheye images, and 360° panoramic images validate the robustness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles due to their inherent inertia, yet challenging. The prevailing practice is to leverage multi-modal data that correlate with pedestrian crossing intention as input to infer it, with ego-vehicle speed being a commonly used modality. However, from a causal perspective, we identify two critical issues overlooked by existing methods: 1) The causal relationship between ego-vehicle speed and pedestrian crossing intention is inconsistent across the training and testing phases, leading to a distribution shift in the data; 2) There exists a bidirectional causality between ego-vehicle speed and pedestrian crossing intention, comprising forward causality and anti-causality. The imbalanced distribution of these two causal directions in natural datasets results in causal confusion, further exacerbating the distribution shift. These issues lead to a counter-intuitive hypothesis: removing ego-vehicle speed as input can actually benefit prediction performance. Therefore, we propose LIM (Less Is More), a uni-modal model that utilizes only skeleton sequences as input. LIM features specially designed modules for efficient skeleton sequence processing, eliminating the reliance on unstable ego-vehicle speed. Moreover, LIM employs adversarial training to identify and remove any latent ego-vehicle speed information embedded within the skeleton sequences. LIM achieves competitive prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal models while offering superior real-time capabilities and lower computational costs. By revealing critical issues overlooked by most existing work and providing a more robust crossing intention prediction model, our work contributes to the development of safer autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Bird’s-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation is becoming crucial in autonomous driving systems. It realizes ego-vehicle surrounding environment perception by projecting 2D multi-view images into 3D world space. Recently, BEV segmentation has made notable progress, attributed to better view transformation modules, larger image encoders, or more temporal information. However, there are still two issues: 1) a lack of effective understanding and enhancement of BEV space features, particularly in accurately capturing long-distance environmental features and 2) recognizing fine details of target objects. To address these issues, we propose OE-BevSeg, an end-to-end multimodal framework that enhances BEV segmentation performance through global environment-aware perception and local target object enhancement. OE-BevSeg employs an environment-aware BEV compressor. Based on prior knowledge about the main composition of the BEV surrounding environment varying with the increase of distance intervals, long-sequence global modeling is utilized to improve the model’s understanding and perception of the environment. From the perspective of enriching target object information in segmentation results, we introduce the center-informed object enhancement module, using centerness information to supervise and guide the segmentation head, thereby enhancing segmentation performance from a local enhancement perspective. Additionally, we designed a multimodal fusion branch that integrates multi-view RGB image features with radar/LiDAR features, achieving significant performance improvements. Extensive experiments show that, whether in camera-only or multimodal fusion BEV segmentation tasks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results by a large margin on the nuScenes dataset for vehicle segmentation, demonstrating superior applicability in the field of autonomous driving.

  abstract     = {The polarization-based attitude and heading reference system (PAHRS) consisting of inertial navigation system (INS) and polarization sensor (PS) offers an effective solution for attitude and heading determination in the case of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signal degradation. Its performance depends largely on the state estimation accuracy. In the existing work, the Kalman filtering (KF), as a low complexity scheme, is employed to achieve the state estimation of PAHRS. However, in practice, the performance of PAHRS could be affected by weather conditions and the maneuvering state of the vehicle. The accurate noise statistics of INS and PS is often encountered, which leads to a degradation of PAHRS. To improve the adaptability and accuracy of the system, in this article, we conduct a KF flow-based deep neural networks (KFDNNs), a real-time state estimator that learns from PS and INS data to carry out Kalman filter. In the constructed KFDNNs, deep neural networks (DNNs) are inserted into the flow of the KF to learn the optimal Kalman gain from PAHRS data, which we can retain data efficiency and interpretability of the classic algorithm while circumvents the dependency of the KF on knowledge of the noise statistics. Moreover, a two-stage training strategy consisting of warm-up training stage and task-oriented training stage is presented for the KFDNNs, which mitigate the gradient explosion caused by the unstable random initialization of KFDNNs while improve the flexibility of sequence length selection. Finally, the simulation and vehicle test are carried to verify the performance of PAHRS. The experimental results confirm the KFDNNs outperforms KF-based INS/PS method especially in complex weather and maneuvering scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) has become a popular research topic in intelligent transportation systems. Regional Traffic Signal Control (RTSC) using the Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) technique has become a promising approach for ATSC due to its ability to achieve the optimum trade-off between scalability and optimality. Most existing RTSC approaches partition a traffic network into several disjoint regions, followed by applying centralized reinforcement learning techniques to each region. However, the pursuit of cooperation among RTSC agents still remains an open issue and no communication strategy for RTSC agents has been investigated. In this paper, we propose communication strategies to capture the correlation of micro-traffic states among lanes and the correlation of macro-traffic states among intersections. We first justify that the evolution equation of the RTSC process is Markovian via a system of store-and-forward queues. Next, based on the evolution equation, we propose two GAT-Aggregated (GA2) communication modules—GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug to extract both intra-region and inter-region correlations between macro and micro traffic states. While GA2-Naive only considers the movements at each intersection, GA2-Aug also considers the lane-changing behavior of vehicles. Two proposed communication modules are then aggregated into two existing novel RTSC frameworks—RegionLight and Regional-DRL. Experimental results demonstrate that both GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug effectively improve the performance of existing RTSC frameworks under both real and synthetic scenarios. Hyperparameter testing also reveals the robustness and potential of our communication modules in large-scale traffic networks.},

  abstract     = {Effective delay management is essential for enhancing high-speed railway (HSR) operational efficiency. Clustering methods, a core technique for identifying delay patterns, categorize trains with similar operational characteristics. However, existing studies rarely consider anomalies, which are significant deviations from typical train operational characteristics and often indicate faults or infrastructure weaknesses. Detecting and analyzing these anomalous delays is therefore crucial. As delay data continuously accumulate, traditional clustering methods require repeated re-clustering of dynamically changing datasets, making them time-consuming and labor-intensive. To efficiently cluster and detect anomalies in train delay data, this paper proposes an Incremental Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (IDPMM)-based anomaly detection method. This approach integrates posterior probability-based anomaly detection with density-based checks to achieve real-time identification of anomalous delays. Subsequently, adaptive clustering is performed on each batch of non-anomalous data, merging similar clusters to incrementally refine the clustering model. Meanwhile, the clustering structure is dynamically adjusted to enhance model robustness. Experimental validation on multiple public datasets and real-world train operation data demonstrates that, compared to the traditional Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM), the proposed IDPMM method reduces processing time by 65.3%-87.7% and memory consumption by 80%-95%. Moreover, among evaluated incremental clustering methods, IDPMM achieves the highest anomaly detection performance. In real-world applications, IDPMM facilitates real-time anomaly detection, enabling early identification of anomalous trains at the onset of delay propagation. This capability supports timely dispatch interventions, mitigating cascading delays and improving train operation stability and scheduling efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Advancements in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have led to innovative solutions for planning optimization, efficiency enhancement, and resource allocation in transportation networks, which are demonstrated in applications such as smart parking lot management and electric vehicle (EV) charging station allocation, where improved decision-making and system-wide optimization have been achieved. However, as these systems evolve, the demand for better adaptability and coordination continues to grow to maximize their overall effectiveness and efficiency. To achieve this, we propose the Multi-Personality Multi-Agent Meta-Reinforcement Learning (MPMA-MRL) framework. This approach incorporates multiple meta-trained, meta-tested explainable personality policies, which are deployed to each agent. A personality selector is trained and deployed on each agent to optimize the overall performance. MPMA-MRL is superior than traditional methods in terms of the adaptability and coordination in ITS by leveraging improved information from the environment, more practical coordination among agents, faster adaptation speed to intermediate tasks, and more appropriate allocation and planning. The proposed framework is evaluated in the applications of parking lot optimization and EV charging station allocation. Its broader impact on multi-agent smart systems is analyzed to demonstrate its generalizability. The results demonstrate that in parking lot optimization, MPMA-MRL significantly reduces the time required to direct all vehicles to available parking spots. In EV charging station allocation, MPMA-MRL effectively minimizes waiting times at charging stations. Moreover, in both applications, MPMA-MRL exhibits enhanced adaptability to previously unseen scenarios, improving its applicability.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of the Internet of Things (IOT), Vehicular Ad Hoc networks (VANETs) are integrated into intelligent transportation systems to facilitate vehicle communication. However, as the number of vehicles and application diversity increase, significant security concerns have emerged, including message authentication and vehicle privacy protection. Consequently, researchers have devised several identity authentication protocols to ensure legitimate communication between parties. Nevertheless, existing schemes fail to address real-time response identity authentication due to high-speed vehicle movement and the need for traversing multiple domains. This limitation poses challenges in traffic management and even threatens human life. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel identity authentication method called broadcast authentication and design a new protocol incorporating this approach. The confidentiality and unforgeability of our proposal are proven based on classic hardness assumptions. Our protocol enables vehicles to authenticate with multiple roadside units through a single request communication process, thereby avoiding delays in authentication while saving costs associated with communication and computation. Compared with existing schemes, our protocol demonstrates superior computing efficiency and performance.},

  abstract     = {The booming usage of Electric Vehicles (EV) led to the augmentation of Lithium-Ion batteries. This is due to its charging speed, ease of maintenance, lower operational cost, and high specific energy. Yet, these batteries are under scrutiny due to the significant amount of fire accidents in recent years. These accidents result from thermal runaway, a chain reaction that may lead to a catastrophic explosion. Approximately 60% of EV battery fire incidents stem from internal thermal runaway while charging accidents account for 30%. This paper envisages an ensemble machine learning (ML) approach for early prediction of fire in Li-ion batteries by quantitatively analyzing the volume of gases released during venting. The methodology is based upon previous research conducted and employs a dataset curated from previous studies to serve as a benchmark. Generative AI (Conditional Generative Adversarial Network) is used to generate synthetic data samples. The validity of the dataset has been rigorously verified using Kernal Density plots, ensuring its reliability for predictive modeling. The random forest algorithm proves its efficacy and can predict the time before the thermal runaway to alert the user. Performance evaluation metrics, including 97.83% accuracy, 96.97% precision, 98.63% recall, and a 97.8% F1 score, highlight its robustness. These findings represent a significant advancement over previous research, establishing a reliable framework for enhancing EV battery safety.},

Despite the potential of utilizing the advanced communication technology to enhance driving reliability, conficts between high-quality sensing needs of CAVs and insufficient sensing sharing wellness present significant challenges. To bridge the gaps, this paper proposes a novel cooperative sensing sharing framework that utilizes vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to extend the effective sensory range of CAVs, thereby reducing perception gaps and enhancing driving efficiency in complex driving environments. Aiming at incentivizing cooperative sensing sharing ecosystem within this decentralized framework, we first introduce a multi-tier blockchain architecture that ensures secure and transparent data sharing among CAVs. Concurrently, a custom-designed efficient consensus algorithm is proposed to minimize the overhead while guaranteeing transaction throughput. To tackle issues related to trust and motivate long-term cooperative behavior, we introduce a supervision-oriented model that utilizes evolutionary game to formulate incentive mechanisms discouraging malicious participation and promoting honest, active engagement. Finally, theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that our system not only ensures healthy sensing sharing performance but also maintains system security.},

Such interruptions pose significant challenges to maintaining platoon formation and achieving effective tracking performance. The proposed approach integrates network performance and state estimation within a nonlinear distributed model predictive control (DMPC) framework. A V2V communication model for platooning on straight roads is developed using stochastic geometry theory, and a unidirectional connectivity determination method assesses platoon topology connectivity. Missing information due to communication degradation is estimated using the probabilities of successful V2X information reception and connectivity results. This estimation provides reference trajectories for disconnected vehicles, ensuring platoon safety and stability. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through simulations of a heterogeneous platoon with 15 vehicles under nine network topologies, considering both fixed-time and random intermittent network interruptions. Results demonstrate that under random network interruptions, the proposed method improves tracking performance by 87.1%, driving comfort by 72.5%, and energy efficiency by 23.2% compared to a baseline control method. Preliminary real-world testing further validates the feasibility of the approach. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed method in maintaining platoon stability and safety, even during complete V2X communication loss.},

  abstract     = {To enhance the reliability and long-term stability of track structures, it is essential to intelligently upgrade maintenance methods. Track geometry irregularity (TGI) plays a critical role in line maintenance, as its acquisition and control efficiency directly impact maintenance effectiveness. The Chord-reference system (CR-system) is widely used for measuring TGI data, but these measurements often exhibit amplification or reduction at different wavelengths, making them unsuitable for precise track fine-tuning maintenance. In addition, traditional maintenance scheme design algorithm suffers from low solution efficiency when faced with large-scale decision variables. Therefore, we propose a two-stage physical-informed neural network (TS-PINN) approach for high-speed railway TGI Maintenance. In the first stage, we systematically introduce a PINN for TGI measurement (PINN-M) based on the classic CR-system principle, which can effectively rectify the measured TGI data into the real TGI data within a specific wavelength range. In the second stage, we propose a PINN for track fine-tuning (PINN-F) maintenance scheme design, which rectifies the real TGI data into maintenance scheme that meets specific track parameter constraints. By incorporating early stopping (ES) mechanism and shared network, we realize the automated design of maintenance schemes with specified Track Quality Index (TQI) targets using rapid measured TGI data. Case results show that the proposed approach has good robustness, can significantly reduce maintenance costs, and improve the efficiency of TGI maintenance.},

  abstract     = {Safe trajectory planning in uncertain environments is critical for autonomous driving. However, keeping the safety of vehicles under uncertainty is an open and challenging problem. The key challenges are how to predict and quantify the trajectory uncertainty of other traffic participants, and perform high-quality real-time trajectory planning in dynamic and complex environments. To address these challenges, this paper presents an uncertainty-aware safe trajectory planner based on model predictive control, which considers the uncertain trajectory of the target vehicle and enhances the system safety. To predict the trajectory uncertainty of the target vehicle, a trajectory prediction method combining kinematics and reachable set is proposed, which can reduce the conservatism compared to robust invariant set. To ensure vehicle safety in uncertain environments, an uncertainty-aware safe trajectory planner is established, which extend the control barrier function to uncertain system, and the control barrier function safety constraints are constructed based on the probabilistic n-step reachable set of the target vehicle trajectory. In addition, safety constraints including safe distance from the target vehicle, vehicle handling stability, road boundary, actuator saturation constraints are taken into account. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed planner can improve the system safety and feasibility in uncertain environments compared with other baseline methods. Additionally, its robustness is validated by analyzing the impact of different levels of uncertainty in complex scenarios. Moreover, the real-time performance is verified by the hardware-in-the-loop experiment, which proves that the planner can be applied in real-world autonomous vehicle systems.},

  abstract     = {Marine transportation constitutes a vital segment of international trade logistics. Recognizing marine carrier ship types is essential for the governance and efficiency of the marine transportation sector. Recognizing ship types by analyzing Automatic Identification System (AIS) trajectory data represents a fundamental aspect of trajectory classification within Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Due to their data representation limitations, traditional CNNs and RNNs struggle to simultaneously process the topological relationships and the attributes of trajectory points. This restriction significantly hinders the learning of micro-activity behaviors of ships. To overcome this, we introduce Graph Isomorphic Network (GIN), a new variant of graphical neural networks with enhanced representation capabilities. Therefore, this study develops a GIN-based framework for graph representation learning. Initially, ship trajectories are represented as vector graph structures, with both original and derived features incorporated into the node embeddings. Subsequently, a GIN-based model for graph representation learning is employed to extract features necessary for ship type recognition. The model’s performance is evaluated through experiments on ground truth data from the Gulf of Mexico and the New Jersey Bight, achieving recognition accuracies of 93.95% and 92.33%, respectively. The high accuracy and robustness of the model substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed method in ship type recognition. This research illustrates that GIN-based graph representation learning can efficiently capture trajectory features, offering a valuable reference for motion trajectory representation extraction and pattern recognition in diverse geographical contexts.},

In this paper, we introduce a non-cooperative game that extends a closed queueing model into a competitive environment, in which players decide the number of jobs that they wish to submit. This can be used to model vehicle sharing systems with multiple providers, in which they receive fares from trips but are responsible for the costs of their own fleet. The core technical results of this paper include conditions that guarantee the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium, and an efficient equilibrium-finding algorithm. We then present a case study, using our model, of a vehicle sharing system in Oslo with multiple providers.

  abstract     = {Accurate trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in optimizing the performance of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, reducing data transmission overhead, and enhancing communication network security. However, the expanding sensing range in IoV has led to increasingly complex spatial-temporal interactions, posing significant challenges for future trajectory prediction endeavors. Currently, predominant approaches involve constructing spatial-temporal interactions through various attention mechanisms. Nevertheless, these methods often yield numerous redundant interactions, potentially resulting in unstable predictions and diffuse interactions. Consequently, there is a pressing need to enhance the application of these methods in trajectory prediction within IoV contexts. Motivated by these challenges, our work introduces a sparse spatial-temporal Transformer (SSTT) to predict vehicle trajectories. SSTT consists of two main Transformer modules: the sparse spatial Transformer and the local-global temporal Transformer. We integrate a learnable sparse plugin into the former to minimize extraneous information in spatial interactions. This plugin enables SSTT to focus more effectively on critical interactive neighbor vehicles by optimizing attention weight distribution, thereby enhancing optimization convergence and prediction accuracy. For the latter, local time windows are employed to capture temporal local correlations and extend the attentional receptive field. Experimental results conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SSTT achieves state-of-the-art performance, and even when only 15% of the training data is used, it can still outperform SOAT baselines. This study presents novel ideas and methodologies for advancing trajectory prediction techniques within the IoV paradigm. The code and our model will be available at GitHub.},

Then, the optimized tracking control scheme for the UFFR is devised by integrating both adaptive neural networks and the backstepping technique. The objective of introducing adaptive neural network technique is to overcome the challenge posed by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, it is demonstrated that all signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally ultimately bounded and the output variables follow the reference signals to the desired accuracy.

This paper discusses how efficiency can be increased with respect to container transfer within a terminal. Therefore, two mathematical models of the terminal operations are derived, which represent the transshipment and movement of containers within the terminal as well as between different modes of transport. For both models, finite-dimensional optimization problems are formulated and solved numerically using the optimization software WORHP for different scenarios. Results indicate that the proposed optimal control strategy is capable of effectively utilizing resources in the maritime container terminal where as the amounts of containers in the yard in for unoptimised case reach 35000 containers and for the optimised case it is varied between 4850 and 5100 containers.},

  abstract     = {Cracks are the most common disease in road maintenance work. They will accelerate the aging and damage of the pavement and bring potential risks to driving safety. Automatic detection of pavement cracks ensures infrastructure road safety. However, automatic detection of pavement cracks has always faced many challenges, such as irregular crack shapes and background noise interference. The existing methods ignore the correlation between cracked pixels, and there are some problems such as loss of detail information, lack of feature fusion and semantic gap. A Multi-Attention Fusion Dual-Branch Network(MFDB-Net) is proposed to accurately detect complete cracks. In this network, a dual-branch network is used as the backbone. A deeper branch extracts the semantic information of cracks, and a shallower branch retains more crack detail information. In addition, multiscale features are extracted by connecting multiple dilated convolutions in series with different convolution kernel sizes, which establishes global context connections. The attention mechanism is introduced to extract high-level network features and low-level network features respectively. Fusing features brings into play the characteristics of different network layers. Five publicly available crack datasets are used in our experiments, and the assessment is performed based on six evaluation metrics. We achieve F1-score of 0.879 and MIoU of 0.886 on the DeepCrack, F1-score of 0.737 and MIoU of 0.775 on the Crack500, F1-score of 0.571 and MIoU of 0.698 on the CrackTree200, and F1-score of 0.602 and MIoU of 0.712 on the EdmCrack600. We also carry out the generalization experiments on CFD. Sufficient experiments demonstrate our method present superior performance compared to other methods.},

  abstract     = {Haze deteriorates the quality of captured images, which severely limits the accuracy of clean image-trained object detectors in hazy conditions. Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a clean source image-trained detector to the unlabeled hazy target domain without access to the clean source domain data. However, existing source-free object detection (SFOD) methods encounter two issues when leveraging pseudo labeling paradigm: 1) the large domain shift between clear and hazy images may introduce noises in pseudo labels, 2) the single confidence threshold-based methods may ignore valuable information of the low-confidence samples. To address these issues, we propose a multi-level guided discrepancy learning-based approach for SFOD in hazy conditions, named MGDL. Specifically, we first propose a differentiated enhancement module (DEM) to intentionally augment the diversity of data styles. It uses dehazing and random perturbation to generate reliable high-quality labels and strengthen the tolerance to haze-related factors. To enhance the consistency constraints for discrepancy learning, we propose a multi-level guiding strategy (MLGS) which consists of a dual label-level and an instance-level guidance. Considering that false negatives may dominate in noisy labels, we propose a dual label-level guiding (DLG) strategy to excavate comprehensive useful information from high- and low-confidence samples. Besides, an instance-level contrastive learning (ICL) approach is proposed to guide the model to focus on objects and make the model insensitive to style at the same time. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets have demonstrated that our method achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art SFOD methods.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) is enhancing comfort and traffic control and have brought about a paradigm shift in the design of contemporary transportation systems. However, as smart sensing technologies become more widely used with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), intruders have found vehicular sensor networks to be a soft target. In this article, an optimized Attention Induced Multi Head Convolutional Neural Network for Intrusion Detection System in VANETs (AIMHCNN-IDS-VANET) is proposed. The data is collected from the CAN_HCRL_OTIDS dataset. This data is fed to a pre-processing segment where Tanh-based normalization (ThN) is used to normalize the data. Then, the pre-processed data serves as input to AIMHCNN which classifies the data into denial of service (DoS) attack, fuzzy attack, impersonation attack, and normal (attack-free). In general, AIMHCNN doesn’t express some adaption of optimization approaches to determine optimal parameters to assure accurate classification of attack detection. Hence, the Capuchin search optimization algorithm is proposed to enhance the weight parameter of the AIMHCNN classifier, which precisely classifies the IDS. The proposed method is implemented and its efficacy is analyzed on several performance parameters. The method is observed to attain higher accuracy, higher precision, and higher specificity when compared with existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Lane detection is a challenging task due to the inherently sparse nature of lanes, which are characterized by their thin and long structures. However, existing lane detection methods often rely on dense anchors or interactions and may not well handle the sparse characteristics of lanes. Dense anchor-based methods are not fully end-to-end, necessitating non-maximum suppression to eliminate near-duplicate detection results. Recently, DETR-like methods have emerged, aiming to achieve end-to-end lane detection with sparse queries. Nevertheless, these methods establish dense interactions among all image tokens, which not only leads to substantial computational redundancy, but also complicates the extraction of sparse lane features from global feature maps. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel end-to-end lane detection framework called Sparse LaneFormer, which leverages both sparse proposals and interactions. Specifically, we introduce a Lane Aware Query (LAQ) as sparse lane proposals, which can predict learnable and explicit lane positions. Additionally, we introduce a Lane Token Selector (LTS) and a Linear Deformable Sampler (LDS) to establish sparse interactions among lane tokens. LTS selectively updates sparse lane tokens in the encoder, while LDS, in the decoder, extracts discriminative lane representations from global feature maps by sampling lane features along LAQ. By concentrating on the most informative tokens, Sparse LaneFormer can achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 10% of encoder tokens, resulting in an 80% reduction in overall computational cost compared to its dense counterpart. Our Sparse LaneFormer represents a pioneering effort in exploring a fully sparse design for lane detection, setting a new benchmark for efficiency and accuracy in this field.},

  abstract     = {The CAN bus is the most widely used bus for intra-vehicle communication due to its high transmission stability, excellent real-time communication capability, and relatively low cost. As the number of ECUs grows, the CAN bus load increases and thus raises the possibility of data transmission delays and errors. Message compression based on the differential algorithm has been proposed to reduce the CAN bus load. However, current works do not consider the security problems of the CAN bus. Attackers can manage to acquire the original messages before compression and disturb the message statistics to decrease compression rate by injecting malicious frames. In this paper, we propose a secure compression mechanism for the intra-vehicle network, including an improved compression algorithm, a stream key distribution scheme, and a hierarchical encryption scheme. Formal verification results show that the proposed scheme can achieve mutual authentication, message confidentiality and integrity, resist replay attacks, and support secure compression. Evaluations using real vehicle data on 16 MHz boards show the average communication overhead can be reduced by 46.38% compared to the original messages. Performance analysis results show our scheme can reduce computational overhead on compression by 31.82% and 19.43% on decompression compared to related schemes.},

  abstract     = {The operational dynamics of vehicular transportation significantly influence energy expenditure and contribute to the escalation of global warming. However, a noticeable gap exists in the availability of Eco-driving methodologies tailored to mitigate conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles. In response, this study proposes a Vehicle-to-Pedestrian communication Eco-driving (V2P Eco-driving) strategy that operates without traffic lights and incorporates collaborative pedestrian trajectory prediction. Its performance is evaluated through a comparative study with the Ecological Intelligent Traffic Lights System (Eco-ITLS) strategy, which adjusts traffic light phases based on pedestrian and vehicle flow detection. To enhance the generalization of the prediction model, pedestrian social interactions are modeled using relative displacement and velocity metrics, while Kalman filtering mitigates systemic discrepancies in vehicular and infrastructural components. A modified distance-discrete dynamic programming (D-DDP) algorithm, accounting for remaining travel time, is introduced to optimize eco-friendly vehicle actions. The algorithm is benchmarked against other Eco-driving algorithms in terms of solution quality, memory consumption, and computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a balance between computational efficiency and solution quality. Real-world data validation and parameter calibration confirm its practicality. Simulations further highlight the V2P Eco-driving strategy’s significant potential for reducing energy consumption and emissions compared to conventional traffic light-based Eco-driving strategies.},

Based on the fluid dynamics theory, a detailed air braking system is established, which considers the characteristics of brake pipes, reservoirs and brake waves. The HTLVDM in-corporates locomotive and wagon components, along with nonlinear hysteresis characteristics of the coupler draft gear. Thus, the air braking system, which delivers pressure signals from the brake pipe to the brake cylinder via a control valve, is coupled to the locomotive and wagon dynamics system through a brake shoe. This model facilitates studying the dynamic performance of the entire system under varied train formations and braking strategies. Using this model, we compare and analyze the impacts of the fluid dynamics model (FDM) and empirical model (EM) of the air braking system on train dynamics behavior. Results reveal significant differences in train dynamic behavior between FDM and EM simulations, highlighting the necessity of employing the FDM for evaluating train operation safety.},

To solve this challenging problem, this paper proposes a predefined multi-modal image method to improve decision-making accuracy and a shared framework to quickly train all networks. The inputs are composed of various observations including bird’s-eye view, state, and front view, rather than traditional sensor raw data. They can be filtered out ineffectual features based on human prior knowledge to avoid over-exploration with invalid changes, such as light, trees, mountains, etc. Combined with the processed representations, predefined images are formed by embedding the trajectory, forbidden line, etc. The method can assist agents to capture the coupling relationship between the actions and states, allowing networks to positively adjust weights to quickly obtain expected rewards. Considering that embedding a feature extraction network into reinforcement learning networks will lead to repeated cumulative calculations, a shared framework is proposed to independently compress features while jointly participates in online training to reduce computing costs. This module dynamically combines the policy and critic to update its weights, which overcomes decision-making problems caused by inaccurate the latent feature sequence during pre-training and fine-tuning methods. Finally, the interactive environment is constructed on a realistic driving simulator CARLA, and the fusion of different modal states is explored. The results showed that the multi-modal fusion can explore to earn maximum rewards, and the proposed methods are effective for the training.},

The separating boundary represents a locus of stationary traffic states, i.e., the fundamental diagram. To fit fundamental diagrams, we develop an enhanced cross entropy minimization method that honors equilibrium traffic physics. We illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach by comparing it with the traditional approach that uses local speed-density states and least squares estimation. Our experiments show that the separating boundary in our approach is invariant to varying trajectory samples within the same spatio-temporal region, providing further evidence that the separating boundary is indeed a locus of stationary traffic states.},

  abstract     = {Accurate localization of autonomous vehicles is crucial for autonomous driving and safety, especially in complex urban environments where high-precision GPS is not available. Visual place recognition (VPR) uses visual cues to identify the current location from a known database, serving as an auxiliary means for precise localization in autonomous driving. In real-world applications, variations in scene appearance due to changes in illumination and seasons present significant challenges for VPR. Current VPR methods often fail in adverse visual environments due to their inability to provide robust scene descriptions. Therefore, the extraction of stable and effective information from images is relatively important. In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction network, termed SBCNet. This network is designed to capture semantic boundaries and texture details within images by training an auxiliary semantic boundary detection task. By focusing on these fundamental elements, the model’s perceptual capacity for structural features can be enhanced. Moreover, we introduce a semantic edge attention module that generates spatial attention maps based on semantic edges and texture details, allowing for the comprehensive utilization of pivotal structural cues. With this explicit guide, the network prioritizes local regions with appearance invariance during the feature extraction process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains robust performance under various adverse visual conditions. Even in low-light environments, such as those encountered at night, our method exhibits commendable performance.},

  abstract     = {Advancements in autonomous driving technologies continue to revolutionize transportation, yet the full realization of self-driving vehicles remains hampered by several critical challenges. Automated vehicles continue to encounter significant challenges in perception, prediction, and decision-making, while their low-level modules are relatively mature and robust. Conversely, humans surpass machines in terms of high-level intelligence but may suffer from control performance degradation. To coalesce the strength of the human and machine, a novel collaboration scheme is proposed to compensate for the prediction-decision uncertainty via human guidance while providing low-level control feedback to the driver. This approach generates multiple decision candidates and corresponding predictions for other road users using a transformer-based socially compliant generative adversarial network (SCGAN). The driver can assist in choosing the appropriate candidate using the context-understanding capability, while concurrently, the control projection of this chosen decision guides the driver to achieve the desired objective via haptic steering feedback. The haptic feedback can reflect the decision uncertainties enabled by the decision-control projection of the intention estimation of the ego vehicle. A Type-II fuzzy controller is utilized to determine the control authority to account for the complexity of the future movement. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through a real-time human-in-the-loop experiment, including an ablation study and comparisons with other human-machine collaboration schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can minimize human-machine conflicts while increasing system safety.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are transforming modern mobility, with vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication emerging as a critical technology for enhancing transportation safety and efficiency. However, the dynamic nature of vehicular networks presents significant challenges, including unreliable channel state information and limited spectrum resources. These limitations can compromise the reliable and low-latency transmission of safety-critical data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a robust approach for device-to-device (D2D)-based V2X communication networks, focusing on jointly optimizing channel reuse and power allocation to maximize information transmission success rate (SR) and average energy efficiency (AE). A two-step strategy is developed: Firstly, a long-timescale Kuhn-Munkres (LTKM) algorithm is devised to improve channel efficiency through intelligent channel reuse decisions. Secondly, the power allocation problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) and resolved using a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based algorithm, enhancing the network’s robustness to time-varying vehicular network scenario. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Compared to the original Kuhn-Munkres algorithm, the signaling overhead of our approach is reduced by approximately 82%. Furthermore, compared to three benchmark schemes, our approach improves overall performance by approximately 11%, 20%, 33%, and 61%, respectively. Moreover, our approach exhibits more stable performance under different vehicle speeds, which further highlights the robustness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Roadside perception can significantly enhance the safety of autonomous vehicles by extending their perceptual capabilities beyond the visual range and addressing occluded regions. However, current state-of-the-art vision-based roadside detection methods exhibit high accuracy on labeled scenes but perform poorly on new scenes. This limitation arises because roadside cameras remain stationary after installation and can only gather data from a single scene, leading the algorithm to overfit these roadside backgrounds and camera positions. To tackle this issue, we propose an innovative Scenario Generalization Framework for Vision-based Roadside 3D Object Detection, called SGV3D. Specifically, we utilize a Background-suppressed Module (BSM) to reduce background overfitting in vision-centric pipelines by diminishing background features during the 2D to bird’s-eye-view projection. Furthermore, by introducing the Semi-supervised Data Generation Pipeline (SSDG) that employs unlabeled images from new scenes, we generate diverse foreground instances with varying camera poses, mitigating the risk of overfitting to specific camera positions. Experiments conducted on two large-scale roadside benchmarks demonstrate that SGV3D, with only a minimal increase in latency, effectively improves the scenario generalization capabilities of vision-based roadside 3D object detectors. The code is available here (https://github.com/yanglei18/SGV3D).},

Freeways, where reliable perception is crucial for safe navigation, present higher safety risks. Lidar’s ability to provide precise depth information and function effectively in challenging scenarios becomes essential. However, fewer studies have explored roadway readiness for lidar-based performance. This study identified the effects of freeway design and condition on lane-detection performance of lidar-based AVs through a field test on two typical freeways in Shanghai, China, and the freeway readiness was evaluated. The Tongji University Road and Traffic Data Acquisition System was used for data collection. The lane-detection failure was treated as the label. Ten variables of five feature types were considered as the parameters, including road geometry, road segment, road marking, vehicle operation, and environment. The XGBoost ensemble machine learning algorithm and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used for modeling and interpretation, respectively. Results show: 1) all features except for light condition were strongly correlated to lidar-based lane-detection failures; 2) higher failure probability was observed under circumstances like the presence of larger change rate of vertical curves, right-most lane with entrance or exit, taper extensions, special markings like words, worn-out markings, higher speed, and closer leading large-vehicle distance; and 3) several interaction effects were discovered. Results provide three contributions to AV safety: 1) make freeway design better accommodate to AVs; 2) provide ODD management references; and 3) offer technical improvement focuses to manufacturers.},

The proposed gantry crane systems resembles a prismatic-revolute-prismatic (PRP) robotic configuration where the revolute joint corresponds to the sway angle which is not actuated. Firstly, an energy-based modeling of the PRP-GC systems is presented where both Euler-Lagrange and port-controlled Hamiltonian formalisms are used. Secondly, we present the design of a Neural Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-Based Controller (N-IDA-PBC) that allows for an automated learning of an IDA-PBC controller, where the solutions to the corresponding IDA-PBC matching PDE are not trivial for underactuated systems. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed N-IDA-PBC is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations, where the neural networks training of N-IDA-PBC uses $3,000$ randomly generated data points and $20,000$ samples of Monte-Carlo simulation are performed, taking into account uncertainties in the systems’ parameters, including initial states, physical damping, and payload masses. The Monte-Carlo simulations show that the trained N-IDA-PBC is able to regulate the trolley position and sway angle to the set-point position and it is robust against parameter uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {The goal of multi-object tracking (MOT) is to estimate the location of objects and maintain their identities consistently to yield their individual trajectories. It has become a trend to fuse multi-sensor information to achieve 3D MOT, since it can leverage the advantages of different sensors to enhance tracking performance. However, it is a challenging work due to the necessity of fusing features with diverse attributes and wrong association caused by significant noise. In this paper, we propose adaptive weight parameter-based multi-feature fusion to create affinity function, alongside adaptive setting of data association searching range, aiming to augment camera-Lidar information fusion-based MOT framework. First, detected results from these two sensors are divided into three categories. Then, to fully utilize both motion and appearance information, adaptive weight parameter setting is proposed to embed appearance information into motion information, forming the basis for creating an affinity function for data association. Furthermore, to mitigate wrong association caused by object temporary occlusion or out-of-view, a method for adaptively adjusting the association searching area is introduced based on the number of frames in which tracking trajectories disappear. Finally, to prevent appearance information pollution caused by significant noise, a confidence score-based tracking trajectory appearance feature updating strategy is explored. The experiment results on KITTI and nuScenes MOT benchmark show remarkable performance improvement over other state-of-the-art MOT methods and demonstrate the effect of our designed modules.},

To fill this gap, the variance inference ensemble network is proposed to enhance environmental perception and quantify uncertainty for 3-D object detection in point cloud. Specifically, the method is divided into three parts. Several variance inference neural networks that adopt multivariate Gaussian distribution for direct modeling are first constructed through a two-stage training strategy, extracting both the object details and variances from point cloud data in parallel. Following this, an uncertainty-aware fusion strategy is designed to integrate and filter the multiple results above based on the associated uncertainty and yield reliable and comprehensive results. Furthermore, a novel metric, uncertainty index, is coined to estimate the uncertainty of detected objects for the single deterministic network and ensemble network in a unified and quantitative manner. Finally, we validate our method on the KITTI dataset. The experiment demonstrates that our method outperforms the original baseline and recent uncertainty quantification methods across different scenarios.},

However, to achieve overtaking along the trajectory, what initial conditions does the vehicle need to satisfy has not been fully investigated. The challenge is that the initial conditions for the vehicle depend on multiple physical constraints in the trajectory planning, which are often difficult to be analytically solved. To overcome this difficulty, the proposed overtaking trajectory is decomposed into several cubic Bézier spiral segments firstly. Then, according to the decomposition, the multiple constraints with respect to the overtaking trajectory are simplified, based on which the solvability of the constraints is analyzed. Specifically, from the analysis, it is shown that if the initial linear velocity of the vehicle is less than $5/6$ times of the maximum linear velocity, then the multiple constraints can be solved, which implies that the vehicle can achieve overtaking along the proposed trajectory. Moreover, to avoid collision of two vehicles, a safety initial distance between two vehicles is determined. In addition, a control algorithm for the overtaking vehicle is given, which enables the overtaking vehicle to drive along the proposed overtaking trajectory. Finally, the theoretical results are verified through the simulations and experiments.},

  abstract     = {Difficulty in parking leads to many issues, such as traffic congestion, and hinders the development of intelligent transportation systems. One significant reason is that the cruise parking does not fully utilize real-time information about the parking lot (e.g., availability status of the parking spaces), resulting in low parking efficiency and high parking costs. Even though reservation parking improves parking efficiency, its reservation service is coarse (e.g., could not reserve a specific parking space). Therefore, to achieve more efficient parking and optimize existing reservation services, we propose a real-time parking space view (PSV) framework (called PRPSV). PSV can reflect the position distribution and availability status of each parking space in a parking lot, which enables drivers to quickly and efficiently obtain real-time parking information and complete parking decisions. However, there have been fewer studies on PSV in recent years, and these methods are high-cost, limited scalability, and do not use PSV to optimize parking efficiency and services. Therefore, we propose a method to construct and update PSV accurately. Further, we model cruise and reservation modes in non-PSV and PSV-based scenarios to compare and analyze the impact of PSV on parking efficiency. Finally, the comprehensive qualitative comparison with related work demonstrates the innovativeness of PRPSV and the sufficient experimental results and a case study in an actual parking lot show that PRPSV can efficiently and accurately construct and update PSV, and the introduction of PSV can effectively improve parking efficiency and optimize reservation services.},

The strategy layer aims to predict the future status of both mainline and on-ramp platoons and develops a sequencing game to determine an optimal merging sequence and speed-adaption time instant to minimize the total carbon emission and delay. The control layer designs a platoon controller based on Distributed Model Predictive Control, which solves the local optimization problem of each vehicle in the platoon. Thus, the framework is not limited to the number of vehicles in the scenario and achieves a system-optimal objective while being optimal for a single vehicle.

  abstract     = {Traffic capacity is an important indicator of traffic supply capability. An accurate portrayal of intersection capacity serves as a foundation for various intersection management studies, supporting the optimization of traffic operational efficiency and resource allocation. However, existing research on autonomous intersections primarily estimates intersection capacity through simulation experiments, which often suffer from low efficiency. Consequently, the challenge lies in developing more convenient methods for capacity analysis in such environments. To address this gap, this paper proposes analytical models for the traffic capacity of autonomous intersections based on queuing theory. Firstly, the analytical model of the traffic capacity in the conflict zones is derived. Based on that, the capacity model for the autonomous intersection is developed by incorporating vehicle interaction modes, varying arrival rates, and distinct turning ratios for each approach. Depending on the settings of safety time headways, two models, referred to as the specific and uniform cases, are considered. Further, the capacity range, queuing length, and queuing time of the two scenarios are derived. Finally, the rationality and accuracy of the proposed models are verified based on numerical simulations. The results show that the proposed models can better estimate the actual operating conditions of autonomous intersections. The average errors of the autonomous intersection model in the one-lane intersection scenario are less than 2%, with a 22% error reduction from the baseline model. Besides, the average errors of the multi-lane autonomous intersection model are less than 4%. The average relative and absolute errors between the model predictions and simulation results for queuing length and queuing time are negligible. The proposed models offer valuable insights for intersection design, level of service determination, and management control strategy selection.},

  abstract     = {This study examines logit models applied to the truck route choice problem using GPS trucking data from the Dallas metropolitan area. Instead of assuming a constant coefficient for each variable in the conventional multinomial logit model, the proposed mixed c-logit model assumes a certain probability distribution for each coefficient, in an attempt to better reflect the drivers’ preference heterogeneity. A commonality factor is introduced in the model to address roadway travel time correlations due to route overlaps. Three Bayesian models with different hierarchy levels are introduced and are solved using mean-field variational inference with the block coordinate algorithm. In the reduced subnetwork of the examined area, the drivers are assumed to make their route choices in three groups of routes, referred to as choice groups. Attributes that would affect the truck driver’s route choice decisions are different among choice groups. With this setting, the proposed Bayesian models are then tested with the three truck route choice groups respectively. Generally, the study finds that the factors considered in truckers’ route choice vary with context.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that their signcryption protocol lacks robustness against public key replacement attacks, and then introduce an enhanced signcryption protocol secure in the random oracles. Our certificate-based and identity-based heterogeneous signcryption protocol enables communication between entities in different cryptosystems, while ensuring pseudonym-based conditional privacy for vehicles. Additionally, it supports public verification for tracing malicious behavior from anonymous vehicles. Unlike other protocols, our protocol avoids costly pairings or map-to-point hashes, and incorporates online/offline construction and batch verification, significantly reducing communication delays and computational overhead. Performance analysis shows that our protocol outperforms existing approaches in VANETs.},

In this study, we introduce LSTM-CGAN to generate scenarios for assessing AV safety performance. First, we extract static, environmental, and dynamic elements from the China In-depth Mobility Safety Study-Traffic Accident (CIMSS-TA) dataset and reconstruct 630 real-world crashes to obtain pre-crash trajectories of the ego and objective vehicles. The proposed model then synthesizes samples by utilizing high-risk trajectories extracted from pre-crash trajectories, resulting in the generation of 6,300 trajectories, ten times the original dataset. The synthesized samples closely resemble real-world trajectories while enhancing diversity, with 61.9% of road segment and 55.5% of intersection trajectories scenes being classified as challenging. By integrating static and dynamic elements with the synthesized trajectories, critical scenarios for counterfactual simulations are generated. Finally, the Baidu Apollo, a well-known Autonomous Driving System (ADS), is tested in simulations using both generated and original scenarios. It is evidenced that the proposed method is effective in generating more safety-critical scenarios and that static and environmental factors have different impacts on AV performance. This study provides valuable insights into the unknown safety-critical scenario construction of AV safety testing, thereby facilitating the commercialization of AVs.},

  abstract     = {The increasing use of virtual reality (VR) in public transportation enables travelers to engage in immersive entertainment or productive tasks, thereby enhancing the overall travel experience. However, mismatched VR visual motion and physical car motion can cause motion sickness (MS), leading to nausea, postural instability and reduced time for enjoyment or productive tasks. Thus, the benefits of using VR in transportation systems are currently limited to individuals who do not experience MS. Thus, effective MS mitigation is essential for improving travel safety, maximizing travel time, and expanding VR accessibility. Neuromodulation targeting the vestibular apparatus, such as bone-conducted vibration (BCV), has shown promise in reducing MS. However, it remains unclear whether neuromodulation directly targeting vestibular cortical regions, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), is superior. This paper focuses on the design and validation of a novel vestibular cortical neuromodulation approach using tACS in mitigating MS in a novel simulated in-car VR environment. Eighty participants were recruited to evaluate the tACS approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed tACS approach effectively reduces nausea, enhances postural stability, and extends survival time in MS. Compared to BCV, tACS demonstrates a faster onset of action and longer mitigation effects. However, from an applied perspective, the effects of our tACS approach were relatively short-lived and accompanied by side effects such as tingling and itching.},

Current deep models are restricted to small road networks and cannot adapt to or learn large-scale, variable, and noisy trajectories. From a data-driven perspective, we effectively applied and developed a transformer function and proposed a transformer-based map matching (MMformer) for large-scale road networks. This model does not require maps and trajectories to be gridded, and directly runs on the vectors of trajectory points. The decoder module can learn, gather, and store the connections of road segments; therefore, the outputs of the decoder have a graph-like inductive bias. Trajectory point vector, including coming direction, enhances encoder and decoder performance. After experimenting with different embedding modules, the trajectory point vectors were embedded using a single linear layer. Extensive experiments demonstrated that MMformer can perform the map-matching task for large-scale road networks, and its map-matching accuracy on large-scale road networks is 10% higher than that of existing models on small road networks.},

Then, the link reliability evaluation metrics are constructed based on the vehicular willingness, the degree of vehicle connection and the expected count of task transmission. Furthermore, an evaluation model of processing delay and resource quantity is established to further estimate the selection of offloaded vehicles according to node degree, resource degree, computation capacity and transmission capacity. Finally, the multi-layer task offloading scheme is proposed, where we build an optimization model to minimize the task transmission and computation (completion) delays.

This proliferation can be accredited to various advances such as low-latency connectivity, fast execution of control commands, high reliability and more importantly their potential for autonomous operations. Consequently, this allowed the information fusion community to develop various methods of fusion of different types of data. However, these methods in general do not thoroughly consider the proliferation of cyber attacks targeting UAS vehicles especially for civilian and military missions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach leveraging information fusion to secure autonomous drone operations entitled Information Fusion for Secure Drone Operations (IFSDO). Our solution allows the distribution and enforcement of security policies and dynamic spectrum allocation policies to drones during all mission phases depending on the user role. IFSDO works by orchestrating different techniques including cryptography, attribute-based access control and ontological rules to allow the drone to autonomously and securely manage various types of access requests to ensure the mission can be conducted safely. We validate our findings with a case study illustrating the initial exchange of critical data between the security manager and the drone as part of a civilian package delivery mission involving several stakeholders interacting with the drones. The initial results show promising potential of success of our approach.},

However, existing protocols do not address inter-domain Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication and suffer from security risks such as key escrow issue, message leakage, and high overhead performance issues. Therefore, we propose a provable privacy-preserving authentication protocol for V2V communication that can guarantee the anonymity security of vehicle identities and the integrity confidentiality of communication messages in V2V communication (including intra-RSU domain V2V communication and inter-RSU domain V2V communication). For privacy-sensitive IIoV scenarios, the proposed protocol supports batch signature authentication of messages and shared responsibility revocation of malicious vehicle identities, which can solve the problems of limited system resources and security risks. The proposed protocol is robust. It is shown to be resistant to multiple malicious attacks through a formal security analysis under the Real-or-Random (ROR) model. In addition, We have simulated the proposed protocol using SUMO, OMNET++. Compared with the existing protocols, we find that the proposed protocol satisfies more security properties and has an excellent performance with low computation cost, communication cost, storage cost, packet loss rate and delay.},

Specifically, given communication and timeliness constraints, the problem of task allocation is formulated as an evolutionary network game model. In particular, a kernel of the integral operator based on the variable function is intended to enhance the nearsightedness and memorylessness of traditional replicator dynamics. Next, long-term payoffs are introduced to analyze the evolutionary process of task allocation. Furthermore, the stability of the evolutionary equilibrium strategy is demonstrated. Experiments and comparisons on different scenarios demonstrate that the proposed model is effective for enhancing load balancing and completion rate. The model is scalable in terms of computation time reduction and is resilient in its ability to adapt to system perturbations.},

In automating rubber-tired gantry cranes (RTGs) for container handling, small- and medium-sized terminals are increasingly favoring for vision-based solutions over expensive LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) systems. However, conventional image processing-based methods fail to meet robustness and real-time requirements in practical settings. Meanwhile, deep learning-based object detection approaches offer greater adaptability to complex environments but are limited by their dependence on large-scale datasets and insufficient localization accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper presents a three-stage container detection and localization method for RTGs, exploiting a Segment Anything Model and image processing. First, an Auto-Prompting Segment Anything Model (AP-SAM) is proposed for the first time. It strengthens the similarity between reference and target features by training a feature adaptor module that uses only a single reference image with segmentation labels. Next, local peak points of the similarity map are selected as prompts, guiding the SAM to achieve initial container segmentation. Subsequently, we design an image processing method considering a container’s structural and geometric characteristics to detect its top surface, castings, and lock holes. Furthermore, we propose a novel estimation strategy to infer the positions of unknown lock holes on the detected ones, significantly improving the location accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves a container detection precision of 93.3% and an average location error of just 5.55 pixels, surpassing existing methods.},

The omnipresence of blind spots, where emergencies may arise unexpectedly, requires AVs to drive with adequate precautions. However, existing planning algorithms often resort to excessive conservatism that leads to navigation-disrupting deadlocks. To address these challenges, we adopt the concept of phantom obstacles, imparting them with uncertainties. At that point, we propose an integrated lateral and longitudinal trajectory planning method to emulate human-like precautionary driving styles, and adopt stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) to model various uncertainties of obstacles. Furthermore, we analyze deadlock causation mechanisms and present a novel quantified risk assessment method featuring an innovative adaptation of ST projection for occlusion-aware planning. This approach formulates a driving strategy that significantly reduces the likelihood of deadlock, enhancing the AV’s ability to navigate effectively in occluded scenarios. Case analysis and statistical research across diverse scenarios, featuring different objects in various typical settings, validate the safety, efficiency and comfort of the proposed planning results. These findings underscore the potential of our approach to advance the capabilities of autonomous vehicles in navigating complex and occluded driving environments.},

  abstract     = {Motion sickness (MS) could be significantly increased by the growing deployment of autonomous vehicles and new energy automobiles. Hence, there is a pressing need in the field of autonomous driving for a rapid, low side effect solution to mitigate MS symptoms. This study developed and validated a novel wearable Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) device capable of predicting the risk of MS incidence and alleviating MS symptoms. A revised Motion Sickness Index (MSI) was also proposed to individualize the MS risk in different scenes. The effectiveness of the device was demonstrated through subjective and objective experimental data, including significantly increased endurance time with an average level of 40%, improved tolerance of MSI over 42%, no reduction of pupil diameter and less gaze dispersion. In summary, both positive physiological indicators and subjective ratings all suggested remarkable advantages of the device in enhancing participants’ MS tolerance level. Potential applications of the device can be further investigated in multiple scenarios, such as long journey driving, pilots training.},

Take advantage of trial and error mechanism, reinforcement learning is able to self evolve by learning the optimal policy, and it is particularly well suitable for solving decision-making problems. However, reinforcement learning suffers from safety issues and low learning efficiency, especially in the continuous action space. Therefore, the motivation of this paper is to address the above problem by proposing a hybrid Mechanism-Experience-Learning augmented approach. Specifically, to realize the efficient self-evolution, the driving tendency by analogy with human driving experience is proposed to reduce the search space of the autonomous driving problem, while the constrained optimization problem based on a mechanistic model is designed to ensure safety during the self-evolving process. Experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of generating safe and reasonable actions in various complex scenarios, improving the performance of the autonomous driving system. Compared to conventional reinforcement learning, the safety and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are greatly improved. The training process is collision-free, and the training time is equivalent to less than 10 minutes in the real world.},

It can be used for downstream tasks, such as motion planning and trajectory prediction. However, taking as input a front-view image from a single camera, most existing methods can only provide V-shaped semantic BEV maps, which limits the field-of-view for the BEV maps. To provide a solution to this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end network to generate semantic BEV maps in full view by taking as input the equidistant sequential images. Specifically, we design a self-adapted sequence fusion module to fuse the features from different images in a distance sequence. In addition, a road-aware view transformation module is introduced to wrap the front-view feature map into BEV based on an attention mechanism. We also create a dataset with semantic labels in full BEV from the public nuScenes data. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and the superiority over the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection is a crucial application of traffic management to intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). An ITS utilizes predictive models to identify potential problems and improves system operation reliability by analyzing real-time data streams from millions of sensors, actuators, and other recording devices. However, the collected data typically contain anomalies that can lead to inaccurate traffic system estimates. To evaluate the effectiveness of anomaly detection algorithms on ITS data, comparative analyses of different algorithms are conducted using both labeled and unlabeled data collected from the California Department of Transportation Performance Measurement System. The results highlight the robustness of certain algorithms, such as CBLOF (Cluster-Based Local Outlier Factor), in detecting both point and collective anomalies. Additionally, this study introduces an enhanced dynamic CBLOF algorithm that integrates adaptive windowing and incremental learning, enabling real-time updates and enhanced responsiveness to evolve traffic conditions. Experimental findings demonstrate that this enhancement significantly boosts anomaly detection accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, making it well-suited for dynamic traffic scenarios. Furthermore, we explored the fusion of traffic domain knowledge with data features in anomaly detection. Our findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate algorithms that consider specific problems, evaluation indicators, and data characteristics. This research provides valuable insights for transportation authorities seeking to improve their ability to detect anomalous traffic events, ultimately leading to more effective traffic management and congestion reduction strategies.},

  abstract     = {Train platoons are a really innovative application for future railways, in which trains are virtually-coupled via Train-Train communication, so drastically reducing their headways and increasing line capacity. However, as the spacing between trains becomes closer, the influence of disturbances from preceding trains becomes more significant and cannot be ignored. This influence can have a substantial impact on the operational behavior of the following trains, leading to fluctuating spacing within the platoon and potentially compromising the safety and stability of the train spacing. This paper introduces a formalized modeling framework and a controller synthesis method for train platoons, aiming to achieve absolute safety and stable operation in train platoon operations. The framework utilizes Hybrid Priced Two-player Timed Game Automaton (HPTTGA) to describe train platoon dynamics and synthesizes controllers that satisfy safety requirements using an On-the-fly Controller Synthesis (OCS) algorithm, where the effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through a two-train tracking example, and Q-learning is applied to select controller which satisfy local and string stability. Owing to model-based feature, the proposed method is compared to classical Model Predictive Control (MPC) in terms of safety, local stability, and string stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently ensures train platoon safety and achieves similar control performance to MPC in extreme operating scenarios. Moreover, under velocity limit scenarios, the proposed method successfully achieves the desired following behavior of the trailing train according to the control objectives.},

  abstract     = {Safety driver vigilance is a prerequisite for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. In contrast to vehicle behavioral trajectory detection, which suffers from high latency and low accuracy, vigilance detection based on physiological signals is currently the most reliable and accurate method. While vigilance monitoring methods using electroencephalograms (EEG) have made considerable progress in experimental scenarios, they remain a challenging problem in scenario-constrained conditions, such as high-speed moving autonomous vehicles. This is due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in EEG signal acquisition and the difficulty of real-time processing. Moreover, cumbersome data acquisition processes and the challenges of labeling have hindered progress in this area. Given the successful use of EEG for monitoring in experimental settings, we believe that the transfer of knowledge learned from these scenarios to new contexts is reasonably feasible. Thus, this work aims to bridge the domain gap between experimental and real-world scenarios while balancing the number of channels and accuracy. Specifically, we propose a framework for EEG vigilance detection capable of Cross-scenario, Cross-subject, and Cross-device, called CCC. The proposed framework leverages the standard montage structure of EEG channels, reducing the number of channels by considering the common regions of EEG channels across different scenarios. The results show that our proposed model achieves an average accuracy of 86.20% on the SEED-VIG dataset with 12 subjects, which is higher than the 82.21% achieved by state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Finally, we investigate the role of the attention mechanism and transfer learning, and further attempt to explain the advantages of our proposed approach from a visualization perspective.},

  abstract     = {The adoption of autonomous vessels has been accelerated by the flourishing maritime economy and more stringent shipping regulations. Accurate sea state estimation (SSE) is of paramount importance for their safe operation. Traditional SSE methods face several limitations, including subjectivity in manual observation, high radar costs, and the insufficient timeliness of satellite data. In contrast, SSE methods based on ship motion data, particularly deep learning models, offer advantages in capturing complex nonlinear relationships. However, challenges persist, such as imbalanced sea state data, suboptimal performance under extreme conditions, and the complexity of ship motion data, which hampers effective feature extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that integrates a dynamic attention mechanism with adaptive selective kernel modules and multi-scale feature fusion to capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Additionally, an enhanced prototype classifier, utilizing cosine similarity and dynamic prototype updating, is introduced to mitigate data imbalance and improve model robustness in extreme conditions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we conducted experiments on 30 benchmark datasets for multivariate time series classification, as well as two sea state datasets. The comparison results demonstrate that our model outperforms most baseline methods in general multivariate time series classification tasks and also surpasses state-of-the-art methods for SSE and class imbalance learning. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the proposed model is robust to data noise and missing values.},

In response, a Many-objective Intelligent Alignment Optimization (Ma-IAO) method is presented in this paper. First, a six-objective Ma-IAO model is built considering three kinds of objective factors in railway design, namely economic, geologic and ecologic factors. Then, a Particle Swarm Optimization with Strengthened Pareto Dominance Analysis (SPDA-PSO) is developed to solve the model. Two types of external archives are primarily designed to store and update nondominated solutions during optimization with a specifically-proposed strengthened pareto dominance criterion (known as LC-dominance). Afterward, two elite selection operators are devised to search for Pareto corner and knee points within external archives as the best particle individuals for guiding SPDA-PSO evolution. Lastly, the proposed method has been applied to a complex real-world railway example. Through comparisons with a contemporary M-IAO method and the manual work of human designers, its effectiveness is confirmed via detailed data analyses.},

Multiple platoons traveling in a cooperative way can alleviate congestion and enhance driving safety by information sharing and consensus. To address the data security and privacy concerns, blockchain could be applied to enable secure data sharing and consensus across multiple platoons. However, existing performance of blockchain is insufficient to ensure reliable and efficient data consensus among multiple platoons. First, the hierarchical structure of platoons with different roles of vehicles complicates the trust establishment between platoons, making it challenging to evaluate their trustworthiness and ensure consensus reliability. Additionally, data sharing in vehicle platooning networks demands timely information and efficient consensus-building. To tackle above challenges, we design a role-adaptive trust model for trust evaluation of platoons in consideration of different roles of vehicles within a platoon. Based on the proposed model, we formulate a blockchain consensus optimization problem to facilitate both reliability and efficiency of data consensus among multiple platoons. Leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) techniques, we then propose the Diffusion Enhanced Soft Actor-Critic (DESAC) by integrating the diffusion model and SAC, to further improve the performance of blockchain consensus.

To address this issue, this study suggests providing pre-instruction on eHMI to enhance comprehension. To compare pedestrians’ subjective feelings and walking behavior changes with and without the use of eHMI, as well as before and after receiving pre-instructions, a road crossing experiment using a within-subject design was conducted. In the experiment, the participants were challenged to recognize situations and experienced uncertainty when encountering AVs lacking eHMI, in contrast to manual driving vehicles. After the pre-instruction, participants could understand the driving intention of an AV with eHMI and predict its driving behavior more easily. Furthermore, participants’ subjective feelings and hesitation to make decisions improved to align with the same criteria as encountered with a manual driving vehicle. Additionally, this study found that the information guidance effect of using eHMI made participants’ walking speeds more consistent over multiple trials, as they gain a comprehensive understanding of eHMI principles through the pre-instruction.},

  abstract     = {Improving transport efficiency is challenging for multimodal transport participants to improve cost-effectiveness. This paper proposes to select city nodes and establish a multi-objective fuzzy optimization model with mixed time window constraints to consider customer demand and transportation time uncertainty. T-rex Optimization algorithm (TROA) is used to solve the problem, which efficiently lowers transportation costs and carbon emissions and has higher precision and dependability than Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The efficacy of this method is proven using the example of the multimodal transportation network in China’s central-eastern economic zone. These findings provide potential solutions for multimodal transportation aimed at enhancing transportation efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning is well used in the field of autonomous driving, but systems often encounter scenarios that are significantly different from their training data, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In the realm of autonomous driving safety, perception is the most crucial and complex component, with existing perception network frameworks still suffering from inadequate accuracy, compounded by the plethora of uncertain factors and OOD scenarios in real road environments. However, previous research mainly focused on uncertainty methods and OOD detection techniques, lacking comprehensive reviews that cover their origins in the context of perception safety, theoretical analyses, evaluation metrics, and their applicability in ensuring autonomous driving safety. This review analyzes the OOD and uncertainty issues faced in the autonomous driving perception domain, including some cause analyses and solution s to these issues. Additionally, the review discusses OOD detection evaluation metrics that meet the safety requirements of autonomous driving. Thirdly, it summarizes existing OOD detection methods and explores their strengths and weaknesses under autonomous driving safety with evaluation metrics. Lastly, the article analyzes the application of uncertainty techniques in OOD detection, including the shortcomings and categorization of uncertainty methods, spatial feature utilization, semantic information, and performance optimization techniques. The review also highlights the shortcomings and improvement directions of uncertainty quantification techniques in OOD detection, along with the potential for further integration with autonomous driving scenarios. This study aims to promote the research and application of uncertainty quantification and OOD detection technologies in the context of autonomous driving safety. To facilitate future research, we create a repository that includes links to relevant reviews and methodological code for learning at https://github.com/sotif-ma/OOD-Detection-Methods-and-Datasets},

However, the intrinsic defects of point cloud data structure have always been a considerable challenge for model complexity and accuracy. As substantial researches have been conducted over the years, multitudinous compelling architectures applied in LiDAR point clouds are proposed in succession. To facilitate further research, we present a systematic integrated survey focusing explicitly on more than 200 key contributions to deep learning-based 3D LiDAR point cloud processing over the recent five years, detailing the revolution of feature extraction techniques of point cloud and specific deep learning-based tasks. Based on an introduction of the hardware sensors and devices of several LiDAR systems, the working mechanism and principle of 3D LiDAR point cloud acquisition and storage are interpreted. Moreover, about 30 publicly accessible datasets, including classical and latest outputs, are summarized and collated in accordance with different tasks.

  abstract     = {With the advancement of deep learning, the learning-based motion planning (MP) approach exhibits immense potential in intelligent vehicles (IVs). Because the principle and framework of the learning-based MP method differ from the traditional MP methods, exploring effective strategies to enhance interpretability plays an important role. This survey fills the gaps in the IV field’s learning-based motion planning and interpretability enhancement. Our study aims to explore two fundamental inquiries. Firstly, how can we design learning-based MP to achieve high performance? Secondly, how can we enhance the interpretability of learning-based MP? To this end, this paper provides an extensive overview of more than 200 papers employed in learning-based MP techniques within the last 10 years. By summarizing these techniques, a taxonomy for integrating learning-based MP techniques into an IV architecture is presented as three modes: learning-based key-module generator, learning-based trajectory generator, and learning-based policy generator. Interpretability enhancement has different considerations for different modes. Additionally, we compile a summary of resources utilized in learning-based MP. Finally, we discuss critical challenges and make suggestions.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of the transportation industry has raised demands on highway maintenance, particularly highlighting the inefficiency of pavement structural performance evaluation based on fixed-point deflection detection. The traffic speed deflection devices (TSDD) can continuously collect pavement deflection data at normal driving speeds and have the advantages of minimal traffic disruption and realistic loading modes. In terms of motivation, the TSDD aligns with the development trends of the highway industry and data intelligence era. In terms of reliability, data comparisons between TSDD and falling weight deflectometer (FWD) show similar trends. However, the actual detection process is more complex, requiring analysis and adjustment of factors such as vehicle speed, pavement roughness, environment temperature, and reported data range. When the TSDD is running on the road, it requires a complete data analysis system, including powerful noise reduction algorithms, accurate deflection algorithms, reasonable deflection index models, and effective modulus inversion models. Finally, consideration should be given to integrating TSDD assessment into the pavement management system, focusing on the relationship between pavement structural and functional conditions, as well as balancing economic considerations and decision-making effectiveness. Given the complex issues, various aspects of TSDD research are systematically investigated in this review. The survey research aims to summarize the development process and current applications of TSDD, investigate the technical challenges and phased solutions in its applications, and evaluate its capability and practices in improving PMS. These analyses are expected to help relevant personnel deepen the understanding of this emerging technology and jointly promote its rapid development.},

  abstract     = {The security of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks is fundamental to the realization of next-generation intelligent transportation systems. However, the dynamic nature of V2X environments introduces critical challenges in ensuring robust Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), particularly concerning false alarm rates, adversarial attacks, computational complexity, and real-world deployment constraints. Traditional centralized machine learning-based IDS suffer from high computation costs, privacy risks, bandwidth constraints, and scalability limitations, making them impractical for real-time, distributed vehicular networks. To address these gaps, this paper provides a comprehensive and structured survey of IDS methodologies in V2X security, focusing on Federated Learning (FL) and Edge AI for privacy-preserving and scalable IDS solutions. Unlike prior works, we systematically analyze and benchmark intrusion detection datasets, highlighting limitations in detecting zero-day attacks and exploring the need for hybrid datasets that integrate real-world vehicular data with adversarial attack scenarios. Furthermore, we investigate the adversarial robustness of ML-based IDS, analyzing AI-based evasion techniques, data poisoning threats, and misbehavior detection challenges. A key novelty of this work lies in the detailed examination of computational complexities in IDS deployment, including sensor fusion methods, noise reduction techniques, and false alarm mitigation strategies, which are often overlooked in previous surveys. We also explore deep learning-based IDS, providing a comparative evaluation of simulated versus real-world performance. Additionally, we present an in-depth discussion on post-quantum cryptographic techniques and blockchain integration for enhancing security in Federated Learning-based IDS. This survey bridges the gap between theoretical IDS models and real-world V2X deployment, addressing key constraints such as energy efficiency, communication overhead, and scalability in resource-constrained vehicular networks. By studying the state-of-the-art methodologies, identifying critical research gaps, and proposing practical advancements, this paper serves as a definitive resource for researchers,and industry professionals, guiding the development of robust, adaptive, and privacy-preserving IDS solutions for next-generation autonomous and connected vehicles (CAVs).},
