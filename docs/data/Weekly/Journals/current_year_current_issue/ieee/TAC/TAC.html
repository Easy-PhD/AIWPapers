  abstract     = {This article studies active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) for uncertain switched systems under triggered learning. The novel triggered-learning ADRC framework optimizes the ADRC performance of switched systems through reinforcement learning (RL) and enables “on-demand” updates of neural networks with guidance from a predesigned trigger. The innovation of this article is mainly reflected in four aspects: First, the RL-based gain automatic update mechanism (i.e., the dual-gain optimization mechanism) optimizes the performance of extended state observer and controller; the optimal policy is obtained from the experience-based deep deterministic policy gradient with self-learning ability. Second, the adaptive performance-triggered strategy guides the update of dual-gain; the on-demand triggering judgment is achieved by comparing cost functions that reflect the tracking control performance. Third, the proposed theoretical analysis method proves that the learning mechanism can enhance the closed-loop system performance. Fourth, the constructed ADRC-based switching law accelerates the convergence of system tracking error. Finally, a comparative simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this article, a quantitative analysis for the inhibitory effect of directed cycles on the consensus of directed network is provided. Specifically, directed cycle necessarily inhibits network consensus when there is at least one node with in-degree of 1 on the cycle, and the more the nodes with in-degree of 1, the greater the inhibition. The inhibition induced by multiple disjoint directed cycles is only determined by the directed cycle with the minimum node in-degree, independent of other directed cycles. Generally, the more intersected directed cycles, the smaller the convergence rate. Accordingly, to improve the consensus or synchronizability of a directed network, it is necessary to avoid the generation of multiple intersected directed cycles, especially those with a large number of in-degree 1.},

Such constraint is realized by setting saturation for neighbors' positions in agent dynamics. By using a novel system transformation, the heterogeneous high-order interval consensus problem then can be transformed into a first-order one, thus restoring the monotonic property, and further facilitating the analysis of the position interval consensus. We introduce a fully distributed absolute damping gain design. When the intersection of the intervals imposed by the agents is nonempty, the resulting positions must converge to a common value inside that intersection. When the intersection of the intervals is empty, there exists a unique, and globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. Numerical simulations have been presented to validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.},

Each player in a cluster communicates and cooperates with other players based on a directed connected network to make optimal actions that minimize the cost function of their cluster. We propose a two-timescale multiagent system (MAS) for multicluster nonconvex games. We further propose a two-timescale MAS in which players are formulated by Euler–Lagrange dynamics.

This article further explores the concept of uniform observability of a linear time-varying system with respect to a subspace. We will first establish the invariance property of uniform observability with respect to some invariant subspace under time-varying output feedback control. Then, based on this invariance property, we will establish an exponential convergence result with respect to an invariant subspace for a class of linear switched systems. Leveraging this exponential convergence result, we will solve the exponential synchronization problem for general linear multiagent systems over jointly connected switching networks. It is noted that the exponential synchronization problem was also studied recently by some more sophisticated methods. Compared with these methods, our method is much simpler. Moreover, our method leads to an explicit characterization of the exponential synchronization rate.},

Then, an online-verifiable initial excitation-based dual-integrator-based learning algorithm is first proposed for establishing data-driven learning algorithm. The optimal data-driven control policy is learned by solving the linear regression equation (LRE) based on online system data, where the uniqueness of the LRE solution is established by verifying an invertible matrix under an online-verifiable initial excitation condition, rather than requiring the full-rank condition. Compared with existing iterative learning algorithms, our proposed algorithm relaxes those limitations, including the persistent exciting condition, the computation of memory-expensive delayed-window integral, the full-rank condition, an intelligent data-storage, and an initial stabilizing control policy.

In this setting, heterogeneous agents have individual preferences and associated rewards for doing each task; however, these rewards are only known asymptotically. The assignment problem is formulated by means of a combinatorial partition game for known rewards, with no constraints on the number of tasks per agent. We relax this into a weight game, which together with the former, are shown to contain the optimal task allocation in the corresponding set of Nash equilibria (NE). We then propose a projected, best-response, ascending gradient dynamics (PBRAG) that converges to an NE in finite time. This forms the basis of a distributed online version that can deal with a converging sequence of rewards by means of an agreement subroutine. We present simulations that support our results.},

For these systems, well-defined switching rules enable the severely unstable dynamics to achieve stability and OR by allowing each subsystem to dwell for a short period. However, during LDZV attacks, the system's external variables (inputs and outputs) are set to zero for a long period. Given the presence of severely unstable dynamics, it becomes impossible to construct reliable switching rules that guarantee security, stability, and OR by merely extending the dwell time. In this scenario, specific system internal parameters, such as dissipativity parameters, can be leveraged in designing a secure control scheme to address the cumulative impacts of LDZV attacks and severely unstable dynamics. Thereby, event-triggered protocols and switching rules are designed from the dissipativity context. Finally, the secure OR solvability is verified using an aeroengine.},

  abstract     = {The successive convex approximation (SCA) methods stand out as the viable option for nonlinear optimization-based control, as it effectively addresses the challenges posed by nonlinear (potentially nonconvex) optimization problems by transforming them into a sequence of strongly convex subproblems. However, the current SCA algorithm exhibits a slow convergence rate, resulting in a relatively poor performance within a limited sample time. In this article, the process of SCA is retreated as solving a fixed-point nonlinear equation. By analyzing the derivative properties of this nonlinear equation, we introduce a Newton-based accelerated SCA algorithm designed to enhance the local convergence rate while inheriting all favorable characteristics of the SCA methods. Specifically, our algorithm offers the following benefits: first, it is capable of effectively tackling nonlinear optimization-based control problems; second, it permits flexible termination with all generated intermediate solutions being feasible for the original nonlinear problem; third, it guarantees convergence with locally superlinear convergence rate to the stationary point of the original nonlinear problem. Finally, we conduct experiments in a multiagent collision avoidance scenario to show its validity.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the multigroup consensus problem with signed networks, where a set of agents with positive-weight edges is treated as a group, and the edges among groups are negative weights. Based on group homomorphism theory, each group can be mapped as a virtual node, called the group representative node. Consequently, the signed networks can be represented by the homomorphic mapping graph with only negative weight edges. The definition of structural balance has been extended, eliminating the requirement for a structurally balanced network to have an even number of negative edges. As a result, a signed network with negative cycles is also considered structurally balanced. Then, multigroup symmetry consensus conditions are derived based on the characteristics of the Laplacian matrix associated with the homomorphic mapping graph. It can be concluded that average consensus and bipartite consensus are special cases of multigroup symmetric consensus. Each group in the signed networks is assigned different consensus parameters, thereby achieving asymmetric consensus, which together with symmetric consensus forms multigroup consensus control.},

Considering the mismatch of the data during the switching interval, the slack variable is introduced to ensure the feasibility of the algorithm. Then, the stability of the switched linear system is analyzed theoretically. The exponential stability of one single subsystem is shown with the existence of the artificial perturbation in the actual control input. We also elucidate the uniformly bounded growth of the system trajectory over the switching interval. Based on these results, we prove that the closed-loop system is exponentially stable, provided the switching signal satisfies the dwell-time condition.

In contrast, while adaptive learning does not necessarily require such knowledge, it often results in less predictable closed-loop system behavior compared to fixed-gain control. To this end, this article presents a novel symbiotic control framework that offers the strengths of fixed-gain control and adaptive learning architectures. Specifically, this framework synergistically integrates these architectures to mitigate the effects of uncertainties in a more predictable manner as compared to adaptive learning alone and it does not require any knowledge on such uncertainties. Both parametric and nonparametric uncertainties are considered, where we utilize neural networks to approximate the unknown uncertainty basis for the latter case. Counterintuitively, the proposed framework has the ability to achieve a desired level of closed-loop system behavior even with an insufficient number of neurons (e.g., when the neural network approximation error is large) or in the face of injudiciously selected adaptive learning parameters (e.g., high leakage term parameters).},

The architecture is made deep by stacking the LSTM cells on top of each other, and therefore, the overall architecture is henceforth referred to as a stacked LSTM (SLSTM). Specifically, an adaptive SLSTM architecture is developed with shortcut connections and is implemented in the controller as a feedforward estimate. Analytical adaptive laws derived from a Lyapunov-based stability analysis update the SLSTM weights in real-time and allow the SLSTM estimate to approximate the unknown drift dynamics. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis ensures asymptotic tracking error convergence for the developed Lyapunov-based stacked LSTM (Lb-SLSTM) controller and weight adaptation law.

Both algorithms invoke RR update for each agent, inherit favorable characteristics of RR for minimizing smooth nonconvex objective functions, and improve the performance of previous distributed RR methods both theoretically and empirically. Specifically, both GT-RR and ED-RR achieve the convergence rate of $\mathcal {O}(1/[(1-\lambda)^{1/3}m^{1/3}T^{2/3}])$ in driving the (minimum) expected squared norm of the gradient to zero, where $T$ denotes the number of epochs, $m$ is the sample size for each agent, and $(1-\lambda)$ represents the spectral gap of the mixing matrix. When the objective functions further satisfy the Polyak–Łojasiewicz condition, we show GT-RR and ED-RR both achieve $\mathcal {O}(1/[(1-\lambda)mT^{2}])$ convergence rate in terms of the averaged expected differences between the agents' function values and the global minimum value. Notably, both results are comparable to the convergence rates of centralized RR methods (up to constant factors depending on the network topology) and outperform those of previous distributed RR algorithms.},

Based on that, when the decay rate parameters for Lyapunov functions are known, the reachable set bounding region can be determined by solving vertex constraints in linear matrix inequality forms. In cases where the decay rates are unknown, a simulated annealing algorithm and a Boundary Intersection algorithm are proposed to provide a tractable solution for parameter searching, and to achieve lower conservatism in the reachable set bounding regions.

The strategy ensures that the detection signal at sampling instants consistently remains zero, allowing the designed zero-dynamics attack to achieve stealthiness. From the perspective of defenders, asynchronous sampling-and-holding countermeasure by introducing time-gap is presented. This countermeasure effectively disrupts the stealthiness of zero-dynamics attack, realizing the attack detection and enhancing the system security. It is demonstrated that for each sampling interval, there is at least one time-gap caused by asynchronous sampling-and-holding that allows attack signal to be detected.

Using the proposed approach, the control path constraints are transformed into deterministic constraints using analytic approximations. By adjusting the parameters in the proposed approximation function, the feasible set of the approximate optimization problem converges to the real feasible set conservatively. Such a property leads to both feasibility and suboptimality of the solution obtained by solving a deterministic optimization problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the designed UCB and approximation function are effective for trajectory optimization problems with control bounds and obstacle avoidance chance constraints. Comparative studies verified that the approximation function ensures the feasibility of the original chance constrained problem and reduces conservatism.},

In particular, many works require to restrict the class of LTI systems to those satisfying the relation $p\ell =n$. In this note, we show how to address the general multi-input multi-output (MIMO) case (for which $p\ell \geq n$ in general) by constructing an alternative nonminimal state vector from data. Different from the existing literature, our method guarantees the satisfaction of certain rank conditions when the system is persistently excited, thereby facilitating the direct data-driven dynamic output-feedback control of MIMO systems by applying methods that were originally developed for the input-state data setting.},

  abstract     = {Sampled-data-based event-triggered (SDET) communication techniques have found extensive applications in the research of synchronization and consensus in directed networks (DNs). However, as the quantity of nodes in a network expands, existing investigations encounter difficulties in obtaining solutions within finite computation times due to computational complexity. For coping with this scenario, a novel event-triggered pinning quasi-synchronization approach is explored in this research for a category of switched directed networks (SDNs) with sampling measurements. By developing a time-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) and implementing a state-dependent switching strategy utilizing sampling measurements, sufficient conditions are formulated to assure that the synchronization errors are ultimately bounded in an exponential fashion. Different from previous relevant findings, the verification of matrix conditions in the derived synchronization criterion no longer depends on the number of nodes in networks, making it more suitable for large-scale SDNs. Ultimately, two simulation examples are incorporated to elucidate the applicability of the newly crafted synchronization methodology.},

For nonminimum phase systems with unstable internal dynamics, the inverse model yields unbounded inputs, impeding the implementation of the feedforward control method. Existing stable inversion leverages noncausal input and initial state transition to achieve exact tracking with an infinite time preview of the output. However, a limited preview window results in tracking errors, and the existence of the optimal transition relies on the invertibility of the Grammian matrix. Recently, a novel stable inversion based on lifting time systems has been introduced. It enables finite-time precision tracking without an infinite preview window and exhibits significant application potential, though confined to linear time-invariant systems. From the perspective of the lifted system, this article addresses the stable inversion problem in finite time for multivariate linear periodic time-varying systems leveraging the equivalence between the linear periodic time-varying system and its lifted system.

These constitute a very rich uncertainty model, which enjoys many desirable geometrical, statistical, and computational properties, and which naturally generalizes both robust and stochastic models, and captures many additional real-world uncertainty phenomena (e.g., black swan events). Our contributions show that OT ambiguity sets are also analytically tractable: they propagate easily and intuitively through linear and nonlinear (possibly corrupted by noise) transformations, and the result of the propagation is again an OT ambiguity set or can be upper bounded by an OT ambiguity set. In the context of dynamical systems, our results allow us to consider multiple sources of uncertainty (e.g., initial condition, additive noise, and multiplicative noise) and to capture in closed form, via an OT ambiguity set, the resulting uncertainty in the state at any future time. Our results are actionable, interpretable, and readily employable in a great variety of computationally tractable control and estimation formulations.

However, existing methods, such as mixed-integer programming and nonlinear programming, often struggle to efficiently solve control problems with complex, long-horizon STL specifications. This study introduces STLCCP, a novel convex optimization-based framework that leverages key structural properties of STL: monotonicity of the robustness function, its hierarchical tree structure, and correspondence between convexity/concavity in optimizations and conjunctiveness/ disjunctiveness in specifications. The framework begins with a structure-aware decomposition of STL formulas, transforming the problem into an equivalent difference of convex programs. This is then solved sequentially as a convex quadratic program using an improved version of the convex-concave procedure. To further enhance efficiency, we develop a smooth approximation of the robustness function using a function termed the mellowmin function, specifically tailored to the proposed framework. Numerical experiments on motion planning benchmarks demonstrate that STLCCP can efficiently handle complex scenarios over long horizons, outperforming existing methods.},

These rewards, which adapt to the evolving state of the epidemic, are ascribed by a dynamic payoff mechanism we seek to design. We use a modified suspectable-infectious–recovered–susceptible model to track how the epidemic progresses in response to the agents' strategic choices. By employing perturbed best response evolutionary dynamics to model the population's strategic behavior, we extend previous related work so as to allow for noise in the agents' perceptions of the rewards and intrinsic costs of the available strategies. Central to our approach is the use of system-theoretic methods and passivity concepts to obtain a Lyapunov function, ensuring the global asymptotic stability of an endemic equilibrium with minimized infection prevalence under budget constraints. We leverage the Lyapunov function to analyze how the epidemic's spread rate is influenced by the time scale of the payoff mechanism's dynamics. In addition, we derive anytime upper bounds on both the infectious fraction of the population and the instantaneous cost a social planner must incur to control the spread, allowing us to quantify the tradeoff between peak infection prevalence and the corresponding cost. For a class of one-parameter perturbed best response models, we propose a method to learn the model's parameter from data.},

First, we analyze the impact of the time delays induced by signal quantization and DoS attacks on the switching signals, control laws, and measurement data. We then design an integral sliding surface associated with the switching modes such that, when system uncertainties, disturbances, and the frequency and duration of DoS attacks are suitably bounded, input-to-state practical stability is guaranteed. Moreover, a reaching law is designed such that the trajectories of the networked switched system reach the sliding surface in finite time.

Our approach is based on that of the so-called mean subsequence reduced (MSR) algorithm with a special emphasis on its use in agents capable to communicate with multihop neighbors. The MSR algorithm provides an effective technique for agents to achieve resilient consensus if the multiagent network satisfies certain connectivity requirements. Our analysis highlights that for maintaining the same level of resilience against adversarial nodes, such network connectivity requirements can be relaxed by increasing the number of relay hops. In particular, we characterize tight network structures for our algorithm to succeed and propose a novel notion of graph robustness with multihop communication. Moreover, we analyze the multihop W-MSR algorithm with delays in communication since messages from multihop neighbors may require different numbers of time steps for their transmissions.

  abstract     = {In this article, we establish that stabilization of a class of linear, hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with a large (nevertheless finite) number of components, can be achieved via employment of a backstepping-based control law, which is constructed for stabilization of a continuum version (i.e., as the number of components tends to infinity) of the PDE system. This is achieved by proving that the exact backstepping kernels, constructed for stabilization of the large-scale system, can be approximated (in certain sense such that exponential stability is preserved) by the backstepping kernels constructed for stabilization of a continuum version (essentially an infinite ensemble) of the original PDE system. The proof relies on construction of a convergent sequence of backstepping kernels that is defined such that each kernel matches the exact backstepping kernels (derived based on the original, large-scale system), in a piecewise constant manner with respect to an ensemble variable; while showing that they satisfy the continuum backstepping kernel equations. We present a numerical example that reveals that complexity of computation of stabilizing backstepping kernels may not scale with the number of components of the PDE state, when the kernels are constructed on the basis of the continuum version, in contrast to the case in which they are constructed on the basis of the original, large-scale system. In addition, we formally establish the connection between the solutions to the large-scale system and its continuum counterpart. Thus, this approach can be useful for design of computationally tractable, stabilizing backstepping-based control laws for large-scale PDE systems.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes an innovative hybrid dynamic mechanism to uniquely and robustly lift a path from the 3-D special orthogonal group to the modified Rodrigues parameters (MRP) space. The path-lifting mechanism leverages the unique properties of the MRP representation and is crucial for developing a novel framework for the equivalence of stability results between these topological spaces. The new hybrid methodology allows the design and analysis of an attitude feedback controller in the topologically less complex MRP space with the guarantee that its asymptotic and exponential stability properties directly translate to the attitude dynamics in the base space. Furthermore, the resulting interconnection is impervious to the unwinding phenomenon. The design and evaluation of an MRP-based controller demonstrate the application, practical relevance, and advantages of the proposed algorithm alongside the novel results for equivalence of stability between spaces. The solution renders the attitude space dynamics robustly globally asymptotically stable and robustly semi-globally exponentially stable, illustrating the potential of this novel approach.},

  abstract     = {Fundamental limitations or performance tradeoffs/limits are important properties and constraints of both control and filtering systems. Among various tradeoff metrics, total information rate that characterizes the sensitivity tradeoffs and time-averaged performance of control and filtering systems was conventionally studied by using the differential entropy rate and Kolmogorov–Bode formula. In this article, by extending the famous mutual information-minimum mean-square error (I-MMSE) relationships to the discrete-time additive white Gaussian channels with and without feedback, a new paradigm is introduced to estimate and analyze total information rate as a control and filtering tradeoff metric. Under this framework, we explore the tradeoff properties of total information rate for a variety of the discrete-time control and filtering systems, e.g., linear time-invariant, linear time-varying, and nonlinear, and propose an alternative approach to investigate total information rate via optimal estimation.},

For general population games, we prove that, on the one hand, strict Nash equilibria are asymptotically stable under the logit dynamics for low enough noise levels, on the other hand, a globally exponentially stable logit equilibrium exists for sufficiently large noise levels. This suggests the emergence of bifurcations in population games admitting multiple strict Nash equilibria, as observed in numerous examples. We then characterize a novel class of monotone separable population games for which globally asymptotically stable logit equilibria are proved to exist for every noise level. The considered class of monotone separable games finds applications, e.g., in routing games on series compositions of networks with parallel routes when there are multiple populations of users that differ in the reward function.},

A compositional framework based on continuous-time assume-guarantee contracts (AGCs) is developed to break the complex and large synthesis problem into subproblems of manageable sizes. We first show how to formulate the collaborative STL tasks as AGCs by leveraging the idea of prescribed performance control. The concept of contracts is used to establish our compositionality result, which allows us to guarantee the satisfaction of a global contract by the multiagent system when all agents satisfy their local contracts. Then, a closed-form continuous-time feedback controller is designed to enforce local contracts over the agents in a distributed manner, which further guarantees global task satisfaction based on the compositionality result. The effectiveness of our results is demonstrated by two numerical examples.},

Under a moderate interval excitation (IE) condition where the IE is fulfilled at the time strictly before the terminal time and we maintain the presence of IE in the estimator until the terminal time, even though the regressor may have lost the excitation, we redesign a new PT-LS estimator by introducing a novel term characterized by the blow-up function, online historical data and instant data, which not only ensures that the plant state is regulated to zero in PT, but also that the parameter estimation is strongly consistent in the same PT, i.e., the estimator PT-converges to the parameter's true value.

However, real-world scenarios often involve the presence of noise due to factors such as additive white Gaussian noise channels or probabilistic quantization of transmitted data. These sources of noise have the potential to degrade the performance of decentralized optimization algorithms if not effectively addressed. In this article, we focus on the noisy communication setting and propose an algorithm that bridges the performance gap caused by communication noise while also mitigating other challenges like data heterogeneity. We establish theoretical results of the proposed algorithm that quantify the effect of communication noise and gradient noise on the performance of the algorithm. Notably, our algorithm achieves the optimal convergence rate for minimizing strongly convex, smooth functions in the context of inexact communication and stochastic gradients.

Within the framework of a timed discrete event system that is partially observed by an intruder, a $K$-step opaque timed observation means that an intruder has observed the system with time stamps but is not able to deduce the secret information within the knowledge derived from the last $K$ steps of the timed observation. We propose an information structure called a partial modified state class graph with respect to a timed observation. Then, based on the particular graph, an algorithm is designed to construct a delayed marking estimator that is used for the verification of $K$-step opacity of a timed observation by solving a number of linear programming problems. Finally, when the timed observation is not $K$-step opaque, a strategy by adjusting the time horizons of transitions with soft time intervals is proposed for the opacity enforcement purpose.},

Unfortunately, adaptive identification based on both saturated observations and the $\ell _{1}$-optimization turns out to be a challenging nonlinear problem, and has rarely been explored in the literature. Motivated by this and the need to fit with the $\ell _{1}$-based index of prediction accuracy in, e.g., judicial sentencing prediction problems, we propose a two-step weighted $\ell _{1}$-based adaptive identification algorithm. Under certain excitation conditions much weaker than the traditional persistent excitation condition, we will establish the global convergence of both the parameter estimators and the adaptive predictors. It is worth noting that our results do not rely on the widely used independent and identically distributed assumptions on the system signals, and thus, do not exclude applications to feedback control systems. We will demonstrate the advantages of our proposed new adaptive algorithm over the existing $\ell _{2}$-based ones, through both a numerical example and a real-data-based sentencing prediction problem.},

A two-layer control framework is presented for each subsystem to steer its tracking error asymptotically to zero. In the upper layer, an error optimizer is designed to generate optimal error trajectory based on a local objective function that converges to zero. In the lower layer, with the aid of an auxiliary system, a trajectory-tracking fault-tolerant controller is given to adaptively accommodate the effects of parameteric uncertainties and actuator faults, where an adaptive high-gain approach is adopted to address the unknown strong interactions.

Moreover, the full state of the plant is available for feedback. A multiple model online identification scheme for the plant's state and input matrices is developed that guarantees the estimated parameters converge to the underlying plant model under the assumption of persistence of excitation. Using an exact matching condition, the parameter estimates are used in a control law such that the plant's states asymptotically track the reference signal generated by a state-space reference model. The control architecture is proven to provide boundedness of all closed-loop signals and to asymptotically drive the state tracking error to zero. Numerical simulations illustrate the stability and efficacy of the proposed MMRAC scheme, even in the presence of noise.

  abstract     = {This article considers distributed online convex optimization with time-varying constraints. In this setting, a network of agents makes decisions at each round, and then, only a portion of the loss function and a coordinate block of the constraint function are privately revealed to each agent. The loss and constraint functions are convex and can vary arbitrarily across rounds. The agents collaborate to minimize static network regret and network cumulative constraint violation. A novel distributed online algorithm with a vanishing stepsize is proposed and it achieves an $\mathcal {O}(T^{\max \lbrace c,1-c\rbrace })$ static network regret bound and an $\mathcal {O}(T^{1-c/2})$ network cumulative constraint violation bound, where $T$ is the number of rounds and $c\in (0,1)$ is a user-defined tradeoff parameter. When Slater's condition holds (i.e., there is a point that strictly satisfies the inequality constraints), the network cumulative constraint violation bound is reduced to $\mathcal {O}(T^{1-c})$. Moreover, if the loss functions are strongly convex, then static network regret bound is reduced to $\mathcal {O}(\log (T))$, and the network cumulative constraint violation bound is reduced to $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt{\log (T)T})$ and $\mathcal {O}(\log (T))$ without and with Slater's condition, respectively. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this article is the first to achieve tighter (network) cumulative constraint violation bounds for (distributed) online convex optimization with time-varying constraints under Slater's condition. Finally, the theoretical results are verified through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {State estimation for discrete-time linear systems with uniformly quantized measurements is addressed. By exploiting the set-theoretic nature of the information provided by the quantizer, the problem is cast in the set membership estimation setting. Assuming the possibility of suitably tuning the quantizer range and resolution, the optimal design of adaptive quantizers is formulated in terms of the minimization of the radius of information associated to the state estimation problem. The optimal solution is derived for first-order systems and the result is exploited to design adaptive quantizers for generic systems, minimizing the size of the feasible output signal set. Then, the number of sensor thresholds for which the adaptive quantizers guarantee asymptotic boundedness of the state estimation uncertainty is established. Threshold adaptation mechanisms based on several types of outer approximations of the feasible state set are also proposed. The effectiveness of the designed adaptive quantizers is demonstrated on numerical tests, highlighting the tradeoff between the resulting estimation uncertainty and the computational burden required by recursive set approximations.},

  abstract     = {For stabilizing stop-and-go oscillations in traffic flow by actuating a variable speed limit (VSL) at a downstream boundary of a freeway segment, we introduce event-triggered partial differential equation (PDE) backstepping designs employing the recent concept of performance-barrier event-triggered control (P-ETC). Our design is for linearized hyperbolic Aw–Rascle–Zhang (ARZ) PDEs governing traffic velocity and density. Compared to continuous feedback, ETC provides a piecewise-constant VSL commands—more likely to be obeyed by human drivers. Unlike the existing “regular” ETC (R-ETC), which enforces conservatively a strict decrease of a Lyapunov function, our performance-barrier (P-ETC) approach permits an increase, as long as the Lyapunov function remains below a performance barrier, resulting in fewer control updates than R-ETC. To relieve VSL from continuously monitoring the triggering function, we also develop periodic event-triggered (PETC) and self-triggered (STC) versions of both R-ETC and P-ETC. These are referred to as R/P-PETC and R/P-STC, respectively, and we show that they both guarantee Zeno-free behavior and exponential convergence in the spatial $L^{2}$ norm. With comparative simulations, we illustrate the benefits of the performance-barrier designs through traffic metrics (driver comfort, safety, travel time, fuel consumption). The proposed algorithms reduce discomfort nearly in half relative to driver behavior without VSL, while tripling the driver safety, measured by the average dwell time, relative to the R-ETC frequent-switching VSL schedule.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this article is to derive the essential invariance and contraction properties for the geometric periodic systems, which can be formulated as a category of differential inclusions, and primarily rendered in the phase coordinate, or the cycle coordinate. First, we introduce the geometric averaging method for this category of systems, and also analyze the accuracy of its averaging approximation. Specifically, we delve into the details of the geometrically periodic system through the tunnel of considering the convergence between the system and its geometrically averaging approximation. Under different corresponding conditions, the approximation on infinite time intervals can achieve certain accuracies, such that one can use the stability result of either the original system or the averaging system to deduce the stability of the other. After that, we employ the graphical stability to investigate the “pattern stability” with respect to the phase-based system. Finally, by virtue of the contraction analysis on the Finsler manifold, the idea of accentuating the periodic pattern incremental stability and convergence is nurtured in the phase-based differential inclusion system, and comes to its preliminary fruition in application to biomimetic mechanic robot control problem.},

However, designing the cost function and the constraints of the MPC to maximize closed-loop performance remains an open problem. To achieve optimal tuning, we propose a backpropagation scheme that solves a policy optimization problem with nonlinear system dynamics and MPC policies. We enforce the system dynamics using linearization and allow the MPC problem to contain elements that depend on the current system state and on past MPC solutions. Moreover, we propose a simple extension that can deal with losses of feasibility. Our approach, unlike other methods in the literature, enjoys convergence guarantees.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the maximum likelihood identification of models for offset-free model predictive control, where linear time-invariant models are augmented with (fictitious) uncontrollable integrating modes, called integrating disturbances. The states and disturbances are typically estimated with a Kalman filter. The disturbance estimates effectively provide integral control, so the quality of the disturbance model (and resulting filter) directly influences the control performance. We implement eigenvalue constraints to protect against undesirable filter behavior (unstable or marginally stable modes, high-frequency oscillations). Specifically, we consider the class of linear matrix inequality (LMI) regions for eigenvalue constraints. These LMI regions are open sets by default, so we introduce a barrier function method to create tightened, but closed, eigenvalue constraints. To solve the resulting nonlinear semidefinite program, we approximate it as a nonlinear program using a Cholesky factorization method that exploits known sparsity structures of semidefinite optimization variables and matrix inequalities. The algorithm is applied to real-world data taken from two physical systems: a low-cost benchmark temperature microcontroller suitable for classroom laboratories, and an industrial-scale chemical reactor at Eastman Chemical's plant in Kingsport, TN.},

  abstract     = {This work is dedicated to a less conservative observer-based controller design method using linear matrix inequality (LMI) for discrete-time quasi-linear systems with polynomial parameter dependencies subject to stochastic noise. While robust closed loop stability of the deterministic part of the closed loop is guaranteed by a Lyapunov-based approach, the performance is improved by a separate $\mathcal {D}_{\mathrm{R}}$ eigenvalue region for the controller and observer. In addition, input, process, and sensor noise is suppressed by solving an optimization problem with an objective function derived from the discrete-time Itô differential operator. Therefore, an iterative LMI method is utilized, which leads to less conservative optimization results. Polynomial parameter dependencies are treated by including the calculation of upper and lower bounds in the set of LMIs with the theorem of Ehlich and Zeller. Therefore, the polynomial nonlinearities are formulated by means of quasi-linear system representations, which are interpreted as polynomial matrices. Thus, the polynomial nonlinearities are treated in their original polynomial form, without using polytopic approximations. As a result, the optimization of the controller parameters is improved in contrast to conventional polytopic approaches. The results of the novel approach of polynomial uncertainty representations are discussed in detail in two examples, wherein the reproducibility is guaranteed and the practical applicability of the approach is demonstrated.},

Our main idea is to approximate the trajectory in Wasserstein space, which is the set of probability distributions equipped with the Wasserstein metric. Recent literature has demonstrated the successful application of optimal transportation for prediction and filtering problems. In this article, we derive an optimal transportation particle for solving the smoothing problem utilizing Mayne–Fraser's formula (Mayne, 1966; Fraser and Potter, 1969). Detailed convergence results are presented, and the proposed algorithms are tested on missing observation processes, showcasing their ability to solve hybrid data fusion problems.
