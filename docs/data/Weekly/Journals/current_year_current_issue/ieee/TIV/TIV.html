  abstract     = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress in decision-making and task automation for intelligent agents. However, multiple agents must cooperate to complete tasks in complex real-world applications, such as auto-annotating in autonomous driving. The primary challenges lie in how multiple agents effectively communicate and collaborate in a multi-modal environment and how to automatically refine annotating results to reduce human intervention. These challenges also hinder LLMs from fully evolving into embodied intelligent agents. Driven by these motivations, we propose ALGPT, a multi-agent cooperative framework for open-vocabulary multi-modal auto-annotation in autonomous driving. ALGPT dynamically assembles agent teams with different roles, and agents cooperate to complete annotation tasks according to requirements. By leveraging Chain of Thought (CoT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) techniques, ALGPT's reasoning capabilities are enhanced, allowing it to develop suitable plans autonomously without human intervention. Furthermore, drawing from project management standards, we introduce project management documents and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), which further align ALGPT's behavior with human expectations and mitigate the impact of GPT illusions caused by the cascading effects of multiple GPTs.},

  abstract     = {Automated driving has the potential to revolutionize personal, public, and freight mobility. Beside accurately perceiving the environment, automated vehicles must plan a safe, comfortable, and efficient motion trajectory. To promote safety and progress, many works rely on modules that predict the future motion of surrounding traffic. Modular automated driving systems commonly handle prediction and planning as sequential, separate tasks. While this accounts for the influence of surrounding traffic on the ego vehicle, it fails to anticipate the reactions of traffic participants to the ego vehicle's behavior. Recent methods increasingly integrate prediction and planning in a joint or interdependent step to model bidirectional interactions. To date, a comprehensive overview of different integration principles is lacking. We systematically review state-of-the-art deep learning-based planning systems, and focus on how they integrate prediction. Different facets of the integration ranging from system architecture to high-level behavioral aspects are considered and related to each other. Moreover, we discuss the implications, strengths, and limitations of different integration principles. By pointing out research gaps, describing relevant future challenges, and highlighting trends in the research field, we identify promising directions for future research.},

Firstly, for this kind of discrete-time MAS, a novel system transformation, which can not only solve the noncausal problem that exists in the backstepping method but also reduce the computational complexity, is proposed. Secondly, the algebraic-loop problem inherent in the conventional controller design is solved by compensating the dynamics and using the property of neural network (NN). Thirdly, the multi-gradient recursive (MGR) RL scheme is developed for the sake of designing the optimal controller. Finally, the stability analysis is presented, and all signals are ensured to be semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) in the Lyapunov's sense. Besides, this scheme is applied to the MMV which can be described in the non-strict feedback form to extend the application of the designed controller.

  abstract     = {Velocity of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) plays a significant role in the energy consumption of these vehicles, as well as their other capabilities, such as localization, maneuverability, and time to complete assigned missions. In this paper, for the first time, an online energy management strategy (EMS) is proposed for AUVs, which enables approaching the target in minimum time by adjusting the sub-optimal speed according to the amount of available energy. In this model-based energy management system, a framework is proposed that its output is the highest forward speed, so that the mission duration is minimized and the stored battery energy is used in the best possible way. In this field, existing efforts are mostly focused on reducing energy consumption, without considering other vehicle capabilities, but this method tries to reduce this gap. First, the architecture of an AUV propulsion is described and modeled, and a nonlinear equation is derived to generate the sub-optimal speed, which simultaneously minimize the amount of energy consumption and the time to reach the target. Then, for online implementation of this algorithm, a framework is proposed that generates the desired speed by using the battery state of charge (SOC), the voltage and the instantaneous Distance to destination. Illustrative simulation examples were conducted in MATLAB/Simulink to demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme and the hardware in the loop test is conducted to evaluate the computational complexity of algorithm. Finally, experimental results showed the practical effectiveness of the proposed EMS.},

The conventional inspection conducted by the skilled workers is highly expensive, time consuming and may cause the safety and heath problem. Nowadays, the emerging unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based techniques make it possible to replace human to do the periodical inspection in these environments. However, how to obtain the reliable, high accuracy and precise position information of the UAV becomes a challenging issue, as the GPS is unable to provide the accurate position information in these environments. In order to resolve this problem, an adaptive square-root cubature Kalman filter (ASRCKF) based low cost UAV positioning system is designed. Through the combination of the inertial measurement unit (IMU), ultra-wideband (UWB), the cubature rule, the adaptively estimated noise model and weighting factors, the potential degradation and oscillation for the system performance which caused by the linearisation process, the variation of the measurement noise and the manually adjusted noise model are solved. Finally, the 0.081m median localisation error, 0.172m 95$^{th}$ percentile localisation error and 0.045m average standard deviation (STD) can be attained, which can support the UAV to achieve the autonomous inspection in dark and GPS-denied environments.},

The goal is to improve collaborative operational efficiency for UAVs and UGVs engaged in reconnaissance, combat, relay, suicide, and electronic warfare tasks. The proposed approach validates through scenarios like urban search and rescue, counterterrorism, and disaster management. AD-GNN dynamically adjusts its depth based on scenario complexity, while biomimetic algorithms optimize task allocation by emulating natural processes. Existing methods often focus on static task allocation or separate enhancement of UAV and UGV capabilities, lacking adaptability and efficiency in unpredictable urban settings. The AD-GNN model addresses these limitations by adjusting its complexity in real-time, optimizing decision-making for task allocation. The integration of biomimetic algorithms enhances robustness and flexibility, adapting to changing operational demands. Simulations using real-world geographic information system (GIS) data in extensive urban settings demonstrate significant improvements in task allocation efficiency. UAVs and UGVs achieve operational efficiencies above 85% in search and rescue operations and 90–95% in disaster management scenarios after optimization. These results highlight the model's capability to manage and allocate tasks efficiently in dynamic and unpredictable urban environments. In conclusion, this paper contributes to autonomous systems by offering an innovative solution for DTA in urban settings, showcasing the potential of integrating advanced graph neural networks with biomimetic principles to enhance UAV and UGV fleet operations in complex environments.},

This approach enhances both the levitation stability and anti-interference capability of the maglev car system. Initially, a four-wheel dynamic model is established. The RBF neural network is then introduced to observe and mitigate disturbances caused by the temperature rise. An RBF-SMC control strategy is designed to improve the system's static levitation stability. The effectiveness of this control strategy is evaluated through simulations and experiments under various operating conditions. The research results indicate that, compared to the traditional PID control strategy, the proposed method reduces tracking error by 75.2%, compensates for the levitation force attenuation caused by the eddy current temperature rise of the conductive plate, and suppresses disturbances.},

  abstract     = {Owing to rapid developments in driverless technologies, vision tasks for unmanned vehicles have gained considerable attention, particularly in multimodal-based urban scene parsing. Although deep-learning algorithms have outperformed traditional models in such tasks, they cannot operate on mobile devices and edge networks owing to the coarse-grained cross-modal complementary information alignment, inadequate modeling of semantic-category relations, overabundance of parameters, and high computational complexity. To address these issues, a multilayer guided semantic graph network via knowledge distillation (MGSGNet-S*) is proposed for red-green-blue-thermal urban scene parsing. First, a new cross-modal adaptive fusion module adjusts pixel-level adaptive modal complementary information by incorporating additional deep modal information and residual cross-modal matrix fine-grained attention. Second, a novel semantic graph module overcomes the misclassification problems of objects of the same semantic class during low-level encoding by incorporating high-level information in the Euclidean space and modeling semantic graph relationships in the non-Euclidean space. Finally, to strike the balance between accuracy and efficiency, a tailored framework optimally utilizes effective knowledge of pixel intra- and inter-class similarity, fusion features, and cross-modal correlation. Experimental results indicate that MGSGNet-S* considerably outperforms relevant state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters and lower computational costs. The numbers of parameters and floating-point operations were reduced by 95.69% and 93.34%, respectively, relative to those for the teacher model, thus demonstrating stronger inferencing capabilities at 28.65 frames per second.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration (LCEC) is crucial for data fusion in intelligent vehicles. Offline, target-based approaches have long been the preferred choice in this field. However, they often demonstrate poor adaptability to real-world environments. This is largely because extrinsic parameters may change significantly due to moderate shocks or during extended operations in environments with vibrations. In contrast, online, target-free approaches provide greater adaptability yet typically lack robustness, primarily due to the challenges in cross-modal feature matching. Therefore, in this article, we unleash the full potential of large vision models (LVMs), which are emerging as a significant trend in the fields of computer vision and robotics, especially for embodied artificial intelligence, to achieve robust and accurate online, target-free LCEC across a variety of challenging scenarios. Our main contributions are threefold: we introduce a novel framework known as MIAS-LCEC, provide an open-source versatile calibration toolbox with an interactive visualization interface, and publish three real-world datasets captured from various indoor and outdoor environments. The cornerstone of our framework and toolbox is the cross-modal mask matching (C3M) algorithm, developed based on a state-of-the-art (SoTA) LVM and capable of generating sufficient and reliable matches. Extensive experiments conducted on these real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness of our approach and its superior performance compared to SoTA methods, particularly for the solid-state LiDARs with super-wide fields of view. Our toolbox and datasets are publicly available at https://mias.group/MIAS-LCEC.},

It examines the scenario where DoS attacks obstruct communication between neighboring agents. A novel neighbor output prediction strategy is introduced to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks. Upon detecting a DoS attack, subsystems affected by the compromised channel predict the output sequences of their upstream counterparts, updating these predictions at each time step based on receiver buffer contents and attack duration. Subsequently, a cost function incorporating the predicted output sequences and a terminal constraint tailored to DoS conditions is formulated to maintain system stability during attacks. The analysis thoroughly explores recursive feasibility and input-to-state practical stability (ISpS). Comparative tests underscore the proposed SDMPC algorithm's effectiveness and enhanced security in maintaining stability amid DoS attacks.},

Our objective was to evaluate error rates, physiological responses, and subjective workload across these control modalities. The results revealed that distraction significantly increases error rates and perceived workload across all models. Voice control exhibited the lowest error rates without distraction but was most affected by it, whereas Hand Gesture control showed the highest error rates and workload in both scenarios. Physical Button control demonstrated moderate error rates and the least impact from distraction. Physiological data supported these findings, with significant increases in heart rate under distraction for all models, particularly in the voice control model. The NASA Task Load Index scores indicated higher workload under distraction, with hand gesture control being the most demanding. Our findings suggest that a combination of Physical Button and Voice control may offer the most effective solution, with recommendations for adaptive and multimodal interaction designs to mitigate distraction effects and enhance overall user satisfaction.},

Based on the Lagrangian modeling method, a 6-DoF dynamical model of the pendulum drone is established. The strong coupling and under-actuated nature of the model pose significant control challenges. Controllers suitable for such system are proposed to stabilize the fully-actuated part and the two under-actuated parts of the dynamics, respectively. A theoretical stability analysis of the closed-loop dynamics is presented. Finally, in the simulation examples under static reference, dynamic reference, impulse disturbance and model uncertainties, the effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified, and its superior performance is demonstrated in comparative simulations.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous modular buses (AMB) are considered a promising solution to the challenges in public transportation, as they can reduce commute times, enhance transfer convenience, and address supply-demand imbalances in transportation systems. Nonetheless, current research mainly focuses on operational aspects, whereas the high precision required for in-transit docking remains a critical challenge for implementation. The accuracy of current autonomous driving perception systems is often limited due to errors introduced by multi-sensor fusion methods. To address this issue, this paper introduces an attention-based ensemble learning fusion method (AEfusion) which includes a supervision module that utilizes the more accurate depth information from LiDAR to guide the generation of image depth information. Additionally, the fusion module incorporates two enhanced channel attention blocks and a spatial attention block to strengthen feature learning and integration. Experiments on both the nuScenes dataset and a self-collected dataset demonstrate that our method is suited for full-range docking perception in AMBs and is superior to the existing approaches.},

To enhance forecasting accuracy, existing deep learning models often feature complex structures with large computational demands for deployment. To achieve seamless traffic system operations and prompt communication between vehicles and roadway infrastructure, the best solution is to deploy models on locally operating edge devices, which are limited in hardware resources. In this realm, we consider both efficiency and effectiveness in this paper with our newly proposed Lightweight Forecasting (LightCast) model. Specifically, we first design Spatio-temporal Global-local Former (STGLFormer) that introduces various self-attention mechanisms comprehensively considering both global and local spatio-temporal information in traffic data to offer state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, LightCast involves a mix-granularity pruning strategy to remove redundant components in STGLFormer at different granularities and an automated layer-matching distillation scheme to effectively restore the forecasting accuracy after pruning. The automated layer-matching distillation scheme resolves the issues of layer mismatching in the traditional feature distillation approach. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world public transportation datasets demonstrate that our approach can achieve near SOTA performance at a much higher computation efficiency.},

Furthermore, the widespread adoption of GPS-enabled devices over the last few decades has opened up exciting possibilities, particularly in the realm of data analysis, where motorcycle GPS data has emerged as a valuable resource for various applications. This article presents a novel methodology for estimating the travel duration of powered two-wheelers (PTWs) in heterogeneous traffic using GPS data generated by motorcycles on urban road networks. The proposed methodology has the potential to offer valuable insights into the behavior of PTWs in heterogeneous traffic environments. By analyzing Big Data generated by GPS-based trajectory data, researchers can identify areas with high motorcycle density and pinpoint potential bottlenecks that impact travel times. Temporal data storing with bearing information in hexagonal shards called “bubbles” enables researchers to utilize Big Data more efficiently. Spatial transformation, Kalman filtering, and map-matching of the trajectory data significantly enhance the quality of the data. In this study, the 10-minute interval is performed as optimal for estimating travel time with 4.3% MAPE. Furthermore, combining historical bubble data with a 0.35 scale factor improves MAPE by 9.6%. Despite the limitations, not only is the transferability of this methodology noteworthy, but it is also opening the door to broader applications in diverse urban settings.},

Secondly, a double-layer event-triggered platoon control design framework is proposed for the considered CAV platoon. In the upper-layer, an event-triggered platoon controller is designed to generate desired platoon trajectory for CAV. A compensation signal is properly defined such that the platoon controller allows the spacing policy of the CAVs switching among constant spacing, constant time-headway, and variable time-headway policies. In the lower-layer, an adaptive neural network sliding-mode controller is developed to force the CAVs to track desired trajectory. An event-triggering condition that made up of data transmission error and vehicle consensus error is designed to determine data transmission sequence, such that a balance can be achieved between data transmission and platoon control performance. Finally, theoretical analysis is presented to illustrate CAV state stability and platoon string stability, and simulation studies are carried out to further demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness of the scheme.},

  abstract     = {Communication plays a role in multi-UAV to perform formation tracking missions. In complex environments, UAV communication is often subject to jamming attacks, affecting the formation process. Therefore, studying the formation tracking control problem in jamming attacks is of great significance. Typically, the actions of the UAV consist of two fundamental modules: mobility strategy and communication strategy. In this paper, we design an anti-jamming attack mixed strategy for formation tracking control of the multi-UAV system. In practical scenarios, multi-UAV systems not only require the accomplishment of formation maneuvers but also necessitate effective mitigation of jamming attacks caused by other UAVs. Therefore, we suppose there are three types of UAVs: leaders, followers, and jammers. To illustrate the interactions between multiple UAVs of the formation tracking process under jamming attack, a three-layer Stackelberg game is constructed. Leaders and followers need to resist interference from jammers during the formation tracking process with a leader-follower structure. Leaders and followers achieve formation tracking through cooperation. The interactions between jammers and the other UAVs form a non-cooperative game. Moreover, the utility functions of a mixed strategy, which contain mobility and communication strategies, are designed for the three-layer Stackelberg game. The Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium of the designed game model is proven to exist. For seeking the Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium, a tri-level actor-critic (Tri-AC) reinforcement learning algorithm is designed. The convergence of the designed algorithm is also proved theoretically. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed method is verified by various simulation experiments.},

Specifically, one group of UAVs is employed to support AGVs in data transmission, while another group of UAVs equipped with computational resources, functions as aerial base stations (ABSs) for receiving and processing the collected data. Following this, we explore the collaborative deployment between AGVs and UAVs, and propose a highly efficient, low-interference, and energy-efficient uplink data transmission framework based on distributed collaborative beamforming. Correspondingly, we formulate a high-performance and low-interference transmission multi-objective optimization problem (HLTMOP) to reduce the transmission time and operation energy consumption of the AGVs and UAVs, while minimizing the total sidelobe levels toward the directions of all non-current receiving ABSs. Due to the NP-hardness of the HLTMOP, we propose a swarm intelligence algorithm, namely, improved multi-objective ant lion optimization (IMOALO), with three improved operators. Simulation results show that the proposed IMOALO algorithm performs better and can generate more excellent solutions than other benchmark algorithms.},

However, compared to the current studies focusing on the single video-based trajectory extraction, the long-distance trajectory extracted from multiple aerial videos still suffer from trajectory unrealistic and discontinuity problems. Existing long-distance trajectory construction method can be categorized into two classes: trajectory-based and video-based methods. The former significantly changes the original trajectory data, leading to trajectory distortion and cannot restore vehicle travel videos with corresponding trajectories, thus falling short of meeting research demands in traffic filed. The trajectory data extracted by the latter approach still exhibit noticeable discontinuity at videos stitching area, leading to the biases of vehicle motion parameters, which further cause the errors of studies such as vehicle model calibration and safety evaluation. Therefore, this study introduces a novel long-distance trajectory construction method which can extract long-distance trajectories from multiple aerial videos and mitigate the discontinuity problem in video stitching area. The proposed method contains four modules which are multi-video registration, vehicle detection and tracking, long-distance trajectory connection and fusion, trajectory smoothing and parameters extraction. Experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain more continuous motion parameters in spatiotemporal distribution, and have more advantages in traffic-related studies.

A relaxed barrier function (RBF) is designed as a penalty term in the cost function to replace the inequality constraints, thus achieving constraints on the system state. By resorting to neural network (NN) approximation of the nonlinear dynamics, an optimal control framework is established via the dual method, combined with the Lagrange multipliers on the RBF. Within this framework, the Lagrangian multipliers are employed to balance the optimisation of control performance and state constraints. The convergence of value iteration algorithms is revealed through rigorously mathematical analysis. Furthermore, by using the Lyapunov stability theory, the desired observer gain is calculated via a set of matrix inequalities, and sufficient conditions for the relevant parameters and learning rates are derived such that the weight estimation errors of both the observer's NNs and the actor-critic NNs are ultimately bounded. Finally, simulations of both vessel systems and numerical examples are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Early and accurate hazard detection is crucial for enhancing the safety of automated driving systems (ADS) by allowing them to anticipate and react to imminent accidents. While current research focuses on classifying safe and hazardous scenes, simply identifying a hazard class does not provide sufficient information for an appropriate response. This gap underscores the need for an effective language model to describe hazards and enable downstream ADS planning of evasive manoeuvres. Such a model could also be integrated into a warning system for human-driven vehicles and assist developers and regulators in interpreting system responses. Motivated by this need, we propose HazardVLM, a novel video language model designed for real-time hazard description. Conventional approaches leverage generic large language models but are computationally expensive and known to generate inconsistent and inaccurate information in specific tasks. To this end, HazardVLM is a task-specific small language model which reduces complexity through 1) a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture, 2) a custom tokenizer with only relevant vocabulary to create a task-specific problem space and 3) adaptive sampling using optical flow to reduce the complexity of video analysis. To evaluate HazardVLM, we introduce a new dataset of over 7,901 real-world road collision scenes with detailed descriptions. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that HazardVLM outperforms state-of-the-art models (SOTA) by 9.59% in hazard description accuracy, achieving a BLEU-4 score of 0.714 and reducing the critical false negative rate (missed hazards) by 26.9% compared to the SOTA.},

  abstract     = {Efficient monitoring and early warning of hazards on transmission lines are crucial for the safety of both the lines themselves and the surrounding personnel. Among them, real-time distance monitoring of construction machinery and other vehicles approaching power lines is an effective and cost-efficient method of hazard detection. This paper proposes a novel architecture named D-LDRNet for all-weather distance monitoring based on monocular vision, which can obtain three-dimensional information of hazardous objects using only a monocular camera. Firstly, an innovative feature extraction network is constructed to reduce redundant convolutional calculations and parameters, coupled with new upsampling operators and optimized detection head networks using Involution. Then, an improved low-light enhancement network is introduced to enhance the recognition performance of the detection model in nighttime scenarios. Finally, leveraging the pose matching relationship between images and point clouds, a ranging module for hazardous objects is designed and integrated into the constructed hazard detector. Experimental results conducted on surveillance images from different transmission line scenarios demonstrate that D-LDRNet not only possesses a more lightweight network structure but also exhibits optimal hazard detection performance in nighttime construction scenes. Experiments conducted on surveillance videos further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed ranging scheme and its industrial application significance.},

To counteract malicious attacks, a network recovery mechanism is implemented to repair the spanning tree destroyed by DoS attacks. Switching topologies containing the spanning-tree-retained cases and the spanning-tree-destroyed cases are utilized to depict cyber states during DoS attacks and recovery mechanism. To reduce data transmission in V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) communication, based on the switching topology model, the event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is further implemented to schedule the information transmission over the Vehicle Ad Hoc Network (VANET) effectively. In the absence of disturbances and leader inputs, the sufficient conditions are derived for CVSs employing the event-triggered V2V communication to achieve internal stability under DoS attacks. The constraints on the duration and frequency of the spanning tree being destroyed by the DoS attacks are derived. Furthermore, the propagation of external disturbances and unknown leader inputs along the platoon is proven to meet the prescribed $H_\infty$ attenuation level by the Lyapunov-based methods.

First, a ground constraint module based on the principal normal of the planar ground is proposed to avoid vertical drift. To address the lack of geometrical features in corridors and environments with large-scale featureless walls, intensity features combined with geometrical features are adopted for scan-to-map registration. Finally, a joint optimization module integrates the feature correlation, the IMU pre-integration, and the ground constraint into a factor graph to perform low-drift SLAM. Extensive experiments are conducted on the GroundRobotDataset, which include challenging degradation scenarios such as long corridor, obstacle crossing and unstructured outdoor environment with large-size walls in weak texture.

An automatic sensor calibration function is essential for safe autonomous driving, responding to the sensor's geometric change. In this paper, background knowledge of sensor calibration is explained, and related papers are referenced. Depth estimation and semantic segmentation models are learned to detect significant regions from the camera using open and custom datasets. This paper describes the online calibration procedures based on motion-based calibration between the camera and LiDAR. Motion-based calibration faces a challenge for lack of roll and pitch variation, and our method overcomes this challenge by estimating a camera 3D ground plane from semantic segmentation and depth estimation and simultaneously detecting a 3D LiDAR ground plane. LiDAR-to-camera roll, pitch, and z values are then extracted using the camera and LiDAR ground plane, and the motion-based calibration problem is solved and optimized using those values as constraints.

Though reinforcement learning (RL) has shown tremendous potential in solving decision-making problems in autonomous driving, existing research often overlooks the heterogeneity of CAVs. Moreover, current RL methods lack robust safety guarantees, especially in mixed traffic scenarios where HDVs are often non-cooperative and uncontrollable. To address challenges of the cooperative driving among heterogeneous CAVs in dynamic and mixed traffic, we have developed a novel heterogeneous cluster safe algorithm and hybrid-critic training framework. Specifically, to overcome the limitations of existing methods primarily designed for homogeneous agents, we introduce a cluster policy-sharing mechanism. Additionally, we propose a safe policy update method with a high sample utilization rate, which combined with the cluster policy-sharing mechanism leads to the HCP4O algorithm. Furthermore, we have designed an innovative hybrid-critic training framework to enhance the safety driving performance of heterogeneous CAVs under various conditions. Finally, we train our model in hundreds of random and dynamic scenarios to validate the generalization ability of agents. The experimental results show that, compared to current advanced Multi-Agent RL algorithms and rule-based methods, our approach demonstrates significant advantages in safety and efficiency, especially in scenarios with a large number of agents.},

A mixed multi-scale attention module (MMSA) is designed to equilibrate parameter counts across various scales and bolster the network's capacity to learn incomplete features.

Nevertheless, these approaches, rooted in traditional centralized computing paradigm, grapple with conflicts related to data needs versus privacy protection, robustness versus personalization, and transferability versus accuracy. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel decentralized federated transfer learning (FTL) method, named P2P-PerFTL, which aggregates local SOH estimation models into a global model using peer-to-peer communication while preserving battery data locally, combining federated learning and transfer learning to realize personalization and transferability within various working conditions and batteries. This algorithm utilizes a domain-shift-based weighted aggregation mechanism for global model formulation, and constructs a personalized and transferable neural network architecture by assigning part layers as personalization layers and incorporating domain shift loss. Through a comprehensive case study with four FTL scenarios, it is demonstrated that the proposed P2P-PerFTL can train a highly proficient SOH estimation model with a limited volume of data from local clients across diverse operational conditions and battery types, and outperforms alternative training frameworks.},

Safe maneuvers, especially in urban traffic, are characterized by frequent lateral motions, such as lane changes, overtakes and turning along curved roads. Motivated by our previous work which shows a $3\!-\!10 \%$ increase in energy consumption due to lateral motion when an electric vehicle changes its lane once every kilometer while following standard drive cycles, we incorporate vehicle lateral dynamics in the modeling and control synthesis, which is in contrast with most prior works. In the context of safety, we leverage past data of obstacle motion to construct a future occupancy set with probabilistic guarantees, and formulate robust collision avoidance constraints with respect to such an occupancy set using convex programming duality. Consequently, we formulate a finite-horizon optimal control problem subject to robust collision avoidance constraints while penalizing resulting energy consumption, and solve it in a receding horizon fashion. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing energy consumption and collision avoidance via numerical simulations involving curved roads and multiple obstacles. A detailed analysis of energy consumption along different components of EV motion highlights appreciable improvement under the proposed approach.},

Traditionally, most algorithms handle these tasks in sequential steps, detecting objects based on appearance features in video frames, and then analyzing their behavior through frame tracking. This study presents a novel deep learning-based object and motion detection method that uniquely combines spatial and temporal information into a single framework. The motion pattern of objects is uniform across different object classes and appears as traces in the spatial-temporal domain. These object movements can be interpreted from motion profile images even in complex driving environments. Unlike two-stage methods that rely on detection and tracking, our approach directly learns object motion from a vast dataset of driving videos, demonstrating its efficiency and practicality. It is specifically designed to address the challenges encountered in dynamic driving scenarios, proving its effectiveness and relevance in practical applications. The goal is to quickly identify objects and their motion in the driving context. Our method excels in real-time performance with interpretable motion detection in the spatial-temporal domain. It also demonstrates high mean average precision, $\mathbf {78\%}$, and low mean average error, $\mathbf {3.09^\circ }$, on a publicly available dataset, further validating its effectiveness and reliability.},

  abstract     = {Task-specific data-fusion networks have marked considerable achievements in urban scene parsing. Among these networks, our recently proposed RoadFormer successfully extracts heterogeneous features from RGB images and surface normal maps and fuses these features through attention mechanisms, demonstrating compelling efficacy in RGB-Normal road scene parsing. However, its performance significantly deteriorates when handling other types/sources of data or performing more universal, all-category scene parsing tasks. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces RoadFormer+, an efficient, robust, and adaptable model capable of effectively fusing RGB-X data, where “X” represents additional types/modalities of data such as depth, thermal, surface normal, and polarization. Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid feature decoupling encoder to extract heterogeneous features and decouple them into global and local components. These decoupled features are then fused through a dual-branch multi-scale heterogeneous feature fusion block, which employs parallel Transformer attentions and convolutional neural network modules to merge multi-scale features across different scales and receptive fields. The fused features are subsequently fed into a decoder to generate the final semantic predictions. Notably, our proposed RoadFormer+ ranks first on the KITTI Road benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance in mean intersection over union on the Cityscapes, MFNet, FMB, and ZJU datasets. Moreover, it reduces the number of learnable parameters by 65% compared to RoadFormer. Our source code is publicly available at mias.group/RoadFormerPlus.},

  abstract     = {The active anti-roll system is capable of rapidly applying a counter roll torque to the vehicles when a roll tendency occurs, suppressing the degree of body roll and maintaining vehicle stability. However, the anti-roll system of a vehicle is a complex nonlinear system, where modeling errors, real-time changes in vehicle parameters, and uncertainties from external disturbances may affect its performance. Sliding mode control (SMC) has been widely applied in various fields owing to its effectiveness in handling the aforementioned issues. Nonetheless, conventional SMC requires knowledge of upper bound of disturbances, and the controller gain is typically set higher than the upper bound of disturbances to ensure convergence of tracking errors. To address this issue, the barrier function adaptive sliding mode control (BFASMC) is introduced, which can quickly converge the sliding variable to a predetermined domain without the need to know the upper bound of disturbances, and it can also avoid excessive actuator outputs. Based on this, a novel property adjustable barrier function adaptive sliding mode control (PABFASMC) strategy has been set to adapt to the application of the actuators. It is possible to balance the convergence time of sliding variable and control input, while also avoiding singularity problems of the control law. Co-simulation was conducted using the MATLAB/Simulink controller model and the CarSim vehicle model to evaluate the performance of PABFASMC. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed controller exhibits the aforementioned performance, while also proving the effectiveness of the active anti-roll system in enhancing vehicle stability and ride comfort.},

  abstract     = {Multi-object tracking (MOT) is an essential technique for navigation in autonomous driving. In tracking-by-detection systems, biases, false positives, and misses, which are referred to as outliers, are inevitable due to complex traffic scenarios. Recent tracking methods are based on filtering algorithms that overlook these outliers, leading to reduced tracking accuracy or even loss of the object's trajectory. To handle this challenge, we adopt a probabilistic perspective, regarding the generation of outliers as misspecification between the actual distribution of measurement data and the nominal measurement model used for filtering. We further demonstrate that, by designing a convolutional operation, we can mitigate this misspecification. Incorporating this operation into the widely used unscented Kalman filter (UKF) in commonly adopted tracking algorithms, we derive a variant of the UKF that is robust to outliers, called the convolutional UKF (ConvUKF). We show that ConvUKF maintains the Gaussian conjugate property, thus allowing for real-time tracking. We also prove that ConvUKF has a bounded tracking error in the presence of outliers, which implies robust stability. The experimental results on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets show improved accuracy compared to representative baseline algorithms for MOT tasks.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential in addressing intricate control and decision problems such as vehicle tracking control and obstacle avoidance. Nonetheless, the control policies acquired through RL often lack smoothness even in the presence of minor noises or disturbances, which may induce oscillations, overheating, and even damage to the system in real-world applications. Existing methods handle this issue from temporal or spatial domains and are often tightly coupled with specific tasks. This paper studies the smoothness of control policy from the frequency domain perspective. We propose a class of neural networks with low-pass filtering ability, named Smonet, to alleviate the non-smooth issue by learning a low-frequency representation within hidden layers. Smonet features with serial filtering layers responsible for low-pass filtering of the input signal. Each filtering layer contains multiple inertia cells, one adaptive cell, and one activation layer. To facilitate the filtering ability of Smonet, we further proposed a Smonet-based RL training method by integrating an extra regularization term relating to filtering factors to standard RL loss. Finally, we assess the efficacy of Smonet through diverse simulated robot control tasks and a real-world mobile robot obstacle avoidance experiment, comparing its performance with two commonly utilized networks, multi-layer perceptron and gated recurrent unit. Results indicate that Smonet consistently enhances policy smoothness under various observation noises without compromising control performance. Notably, it achieves up to a 72.7% reduction in the action fluctuation ratio compared to traditional network structures.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a technology that is widely used in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD) applications for tasks such as perception, localization, and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). For LiDAR to function appropriately, it is necessary to calibrate the rotation extrinsic parameters that define the orientation relationship between the LiDAR and vehicle coordinates. These parameters include roll, pitch, and yaw, initially calibrated during manufacturing. However, they may change over time due to vibration, heat, loading, or accidental impact during long-term vehicle operation. Using parameters that do not reflect these changes can drastically degrade the performance of ADAS and AD applications. This paper proposes a precise online calibration process to detect and correct LiDAR rotation parameter changes. The precise online calibration system utilizes standard on-road driving data to estimate the LiDAR-vehicle rotation extrinsic parameters online. The proposed process consists of two parts: roll-pitch parameter estimation and yaw parameter estimation. The system estimates the roll-pitch relative to the ground plane in the roll-pitch estimation. In estimating the yaw parameter, a simplified hand-eye calibration approach is used, which leverages vehicle and LiDAR odometry to estimate the yaw of the LiDAR calibration parameter. To improve the accuracy and stability in the yaw estimation, a fault data exclusion algorithm is introduced to identify and exclude faulty inputs based on the difference between the vehicle and LiDAR odometry. The proposed system's effectiveness, robustness, and accuracy are verified in various environments, including urban roads and highway scenarios.},

The output weights and deep reservoir parameters of the DTVRP-ESN are synchronously updated based on the approximation and tracking errors to accelerate the computational process. Secondly, actuator faults are addressed by the proposed ISCA method, which considers both the direction of change and the cost of reaching saturation boundaries for unsaturated actuators. By sequentially saturating the most easily saturated actuators along the direction specified by the PID controller, matrix inversion calculations are avoided, and simple algebraic computations are used to quickly obtain optimal solutions.

  abstract     = {Intelligent connected vehicles integrate smart systems and network communication to enhance safety and efficiency, making them widely applicable for formation control in diverse scenarios. Current mainstream methods typically split formation control tasks into independent functional modules and establish relationships for transmitting information, which results in a fixed number of vehicles in the fleet and limited flexibility in formation configurations. In this paper, we propose a cooperative integrated decision and control (CIDC) framework for formation control in diverse scenarios. This framework splits the driving task into three modules: static trajectory planning, order allocation, and dynamic optimal tracking. First, in the static trajectory planning module, static traffic elements are considered to generate a set of candidate trajectories, freeing up higher-level constraints and enhancing trajectory planning efficiency. Second, in the order allocation module, reasonable and safety preceding vehicles for following are selected, determining the configuration of the connected vehicle fleet in real-time. Finally, in the dynamic optimal tracking module, a multi-objective optimal tracking problem is designed to track the optimal path while considering dynamic obstacles, thereby improving vehicle autonomy and achieving cooperative formation control with variable vehicle numbers and flexible formation configurations. Simulation and real vehicle experiment results demonstrate that the proposed CIDC framework can achieve automatic formation adjustment, making it suitable for various formation control tasks such as convoy driving, deliver and platoon driving.},

We begin with fully-actuated MVs, characterized as a second-order strict-feedback system. This structure enables us to employ the recursive backstepping design method by introducing a virtual control law. To avoid identifying the complex kinetic model of MVs, we establish a data-based closed-loop representation for the error system of the tracking problem. Leveraging this representation and the backstepping technique, a data-driven tracking controller is derived by solving a semidefinite program with pre-collected noisy data. The proposed controller ensures the global uniform ultimate boundedness of solutions of the closed-loop system by approximately canceling the system's nonlinearity. Next, we tackle the more challenging under-actuated MVs that possess fewer control inputs than generalized coordinates, making direct nonlinearity cancellation inapplicable. To address this issue, we solve the tracking problem by stabilizing a new error system derived through a coordinate transformation. Notably, this new error system shares a similar structure with that of fully-actuated MVs but with a reduced dimension. This similarity enables us to seamlessly extend the results of fully-actuated MVs to under-actuated MVs.

However, most current ITS applications rely on a centralized training approach where users upload source data to a cloud server with high computing power for management and centralized training. This approach has limitations such as poor real-time performance, data silos, and difficulty in guaranteeing data privacy. To address these limitations, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a promising solution.

Conventional visibility-based moving object segmentation (MOS) methods that check free space by using LiDAR beams have been facing issues related to false predictions owing to the large incidence angle of the beam, inaccurate sensor pose, and overlapping views of slowly moving objects. To address these issues, we propose the AWV-MOS-LIO system, which performs adaptive window visibility-based MOS with LiDAR inertial odometry (LIO). The AWV-MOS-LIO consists of AWV-MOS with Object Scale Test (OST) and AWV-LIO. The AWV-MOS with OST, which utilizes adaptive window-based point-to-window comparison and object-level false prediction check, improves the MOS performance by preventing the false predictions resulting from large incidence angle and inaccurate sensor pose. In addition, AWV-MOS utilizes keyframes to check free space in various views. AWV-LIO minimizes pose ambiguity through scan-to-submap matching by utilizing static scans and static weights, and it corrects point distortion by using IMU odometry. We evaluate the online MOS performance of the proposed system on the KITTI Raw dataset and its odometry estimation performance on the UrbanLoco dataset. The proposed method achieves 6.3% higher online MOS performance (IoU) than the deep learning-based method, and 14.4% higher odometry estimation performance (ATE) than the baseline LIO method.

Initially, an auxiliary controller is designed to provide guidance and reference for regulating the system damping ratio. Subsequently, leveraging the Lyapunov comparison principle, the auxiliary control law is transformed into corresponding inequality constraints. Simultaneously, the paper introduces a function-adaptive law to compensate for model uncertainty and disturbance inherent in actual systems. The stability analysis of both the model predictive controller and the function-adaptive law is conducted utilizing the Lyapunov stability criterion.

  abstract     = {Point cloud segmentation (PCS) plays an essential role in robot perception and navigation tasks. To efficiently understand large-scale outdoor point clouds, their range image representation is commonly adopted. This image-like representation is compact and structured, making range image-based PCS models practical. However, undesirable missing values in the range images damage the shapes and patterns of objects. This problem creates difficulty for the models in learning coherent and complete geometric information from the objects. Consequently, the PCS models only achieve inferior performance. Delving deeply into this issue, we find that the use of unreasonable projection approaches and deskewing scans mainly leads to unwanted missing values in the range images. Besides, almost all previous works fail to consider filling in the unexpected missing values in the PCS task. To alleviate this problem, we first propose a new projection method, namely scan unfolding++ (SU++), to avoid massive missing values in the generated range images. Then, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, namely range-dependent $K$-nearest neighbor interpolation ($K$NNI), to further fill in missing values. Finally, we introduce the Filling Missing Values Network (FMVNet) and Fast FMVNet. Extensive experimental results on SemanticKITTI, SemanticPOSS, and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that by employing the proposed SU++ and $K$NNI, existing range image-based PCS models consistently achieve better performance than the baseline models. Besides, both FMVNet and Fast FMVNet achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of the speed-accuracy trade-off. The proposed methods can be applied to other range image-based tasks and practical applications.},

  abstract     = {The construction of an online vectorized high-definition map is critical for downstream planning and decision-making in autonomous driving. Existing methods have established solid baselines for this task by modeling map elements as a collection of points that describe their shapes. However, the complex geometric relationships between map elements have not been thoroughly investigated, resulting in significant errors when dealing with issues such as multiple pedestrian crossings. In this paper, HoMap, an end-to-end online vectorized high-definition map construction framework that effectively captures complex relationships between instances is proposed. Specifically, the concept of high-order modeling is introduced for the map construction task, which involves partitioning each instance in a high-dimensional space and computing high-order statistics to capture the correlations between map elements. Then, statistical attention is incorporated as a Bird's Eye View enhancement module to reinforce semantic and geometric information. Additionally, instance queries are used as input for the decoder, which improves query capabilities and avoids inconsistencies in instance information. HoMap achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets while maintaining good mapping results in complex driving environments.},

  abstract     = {Freeway on-ramp merging is a challenging task for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) due to the complex traffic environment. The emergence of reinforcement learning (RL) has accelerated the development of driving strategies for CAVs by leveraging its capability to learn from interactions with the environment. However, the difficulty in achieving convergence in the training process poses challenges for applying RL to driving tasks effectively. Moreover, most RL-based merging strategies are developed in highly parameterized and oversimplified simulation environments, resulting in poor performance in real scenarios. To address this, this study introduces a novel merging policy training framework for CAVs, which includes a merging environment reconstruction method and a two-stage policy training approach. Firstly, the empirical merging scenarios are extracted from the NGSIM dataset and augmented using the calibrated Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), creating a more interactive and realistic training environment for the merging CAV. Then, a two-stage training approach is proposed, where the merging CAV first imitates human behavior under sparse rewards in the first stage and is further optimized under dense rewards in the second stage. The experiment results indicate that the proposed method effectively enhances traffic efficiency by reducing the average merging time of CAVs by 3.6 s and increasing the merging speed by 3.6 ft/s, in comparison to Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs). The sensitivity analysis also validates the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven-based State of Charge (SOC) estimation methods have garnered extensive attention as they do not need to consider the complex reaction mechanism inside batteries. In the case of the data-driven-based SOC estimation, there are only limited measurable variables to be used for modeling. So, it is challenging for conventional data-driven-based SOC estimation methods to obtain accurate estimation results in different application environments without having a larger amount of modeling data. This work proposes a novel data-driven-based SOC modeling method by constructing some input features related to open circuit voltage and terminal voltage. The objective is to offer more valuable information to conventional data-driven-based SOC modeling methods and enhance their interpretability. Then, by following the changing trends of the constructed features, a battery online SOC estimation method based on feature point sampling is designed to ensure the stability of SOC estimation results. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of these newly constructed features. Besides, the proposed method can obtain accurate SOC estimation results in different application environments and is robust against current noise, inaccurate SOC initial values, etc.},

  abstract     = {Due to the mobility of intelligent vehicles, limited performance of communication devices, and distributed deployment, the integrity and authenticity of accessible information cannot be ensured during traditional digital vehicle forensics in the event of a vehicle collision. For this reason, we propose a new attribute-based access control model. Meanwhile, to reduce insurance disputes after a vehicle collision and complicate the investigation of criminal activities by law enforcement, we classify different user behaviors according to the definition of accident rights and responsibilities in real situations based on traditional insurance methods, and provide different renewal discounts for different categories of users respectively based on the incentive mechanism of reputational value creation, to encourage users' participation and reduce insurance disputes. Considering the resource constraints of real communication devices, we implemented a dual channel for converged data and deployed the corresponding smart contracts separately. We use Raspberry Pi simulations to implement resource-constrained light nodes and implement the proposed framework as multiple machines built on multiple devices in the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. In addition, we conduct a series of experiments to test the incentives and the performance of the blockchain and verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme. Comprehensive evaluation and analysis results show that the framework promotes user participation while ensuring the integrity and authenticity of evidence, bridging the gap of user participation in embedded digital forensics.},

Based on the Lyapunov function, an adaptive neural network finite-time control algorithm is designed. A signal compensation tracking error system based on command filtering technology is developed to prevent “complexity explosion” and singularity problems caused by the repeated differentiation.
