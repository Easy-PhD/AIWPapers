  abstract     = {It is a common control issue that the input signal of the system is quantized in the controller-to-actuator channel via the communication network, but few results are available in considering adaptive tracking control problem for nonstrict-feedback nonlinear system with both state and input quantization. The control problem is figured out in our article by developing an adaptive neural network control method for nonstrict-feedback nonlinear system with quantized input and states. In addition to overcoming the difficulty that the virtual control signal cannot be defined by quantized states in backstepping-based design approach, our work also surmounts the influence of the coexistence of nonstrict-feedback structure and state discontinuity resulted from quantization, and gives the construction of adaptive law for the weight vector of approximation system based on neural network. Elaborate simulation examples are depicted to verify the effectiveness of our depicted quantized control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rough set theory is an important approach for analyzing data uncertainty. However, the model lacks adaptive learning capabilities and cannot fit labeled data effectively in classification tasks. This study aims to introduce an adaptive learning mechanism into fuzzy rough set theory to enhance its data-fitting capability. To this end, this study seamlessly integrates fuzzy rough set theory with neural networks and proposes a novel fuzzy rough neural network model. This model adaptively learns fuzzy similarity relations in rough set models using the backpropagation algorithm. The proposed network model comprises five layers: the input, membership, fuzzy lower approximation, fully connected, and output layers. The fuzzy similarity relations between the input samples and training samples are computed in the membership layer. These relations are utilized in the fuzzy lower approximation layer to describe the degree to which the samples belong to different classes. The fuzzy rough lower approximations of the input samples are finally fused in the fully connected layer using feature weight coefficients. In the backpropagation stage, the gradient of the objective function is used to correct the fuzzy similarity relations and feature weight coefficients. This study theoretically proved that the proposed fuzzy rough network has a generalized function approximation property and can approximate any decision function. Experimental analysis showed that the proposed method is effective and performs better than most of the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.},

First, the dynamic manipulator with two degree-of-freedom joint driving by hydraulic servo valve is setup via Lagrangian method. Then, a sliding mode disturbance observer is designed to approximate uncertain nonlinearity to ensure the lumped uncertainties convergence in a practical finite time. Furthermore, a parametric adaptive estimation is used to estimate unknown shutoff deadzone parameters. According to backstepping technique, a fixed-time convergence control is adopted to ensure all the system state errors converge into a zero neighborhood in a constant time not related to any initial condition.

  abstract     = {Evolutionary many-task optimization (EMaTO) endeavors to solve more than three optimization tasks simultaneously by leveraging similarities among tasks. While existing algorithms have shown promising results, they face significant challenges in low-similarity scenarios. First, existing transfer techniques, which rely on population location and distribution, become ineffective. Second, the difficulty of selecting appropriate knowledge increases significantly. To address these challenges, we introduce a new concept: distribution direction knowledge, i.e., the evolutionary direction (ED) of elite solutions. It enables the target task to learn the search experience of source tasks with similar evolutionary trends. To utilize this knowledge effectively, an EMaTO algorithm with distribution direction-assist two-stage knowledge transfer (DTSKT) is proposed. First, an ED-based multisource selection strategy is proposed to obtain appropriate knowledge in different circumstances. Second, we design a two-stage knowledge transfer (TSKT) strategy to search promising regions, consisting of exploration-oriented and exploitation-oriented knowledge transfer. In addition, to directly obtain distribution direction knowledge, the estimation of distribution algorithm is applied as the basic optimizer, explicitly revealing the ED of populations by employing probability distributions. Afterward, to validate the ability of DTSKT to handle tasks with different similarities, we utilize a test problem generator to create a more challenging many-task benchmark suite, named STOP. The results on the WCCI20 and STOP benchmark suites, along with a real-world application, demonstrate that DTSKT generally outperforms seven state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Unlike the previous game research neglecting the practical kinematic constraints, a coupled nonlinear system is formulated to elucidate the interaction dynamics between the players. After that, the optimal control strategies are derived by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equation linked to a special nonquadratic cost function. The Nash equilibrium analysis and finite-time capturability are conducted. To learn the optimal pursuit–evasion strategy pair, a fixed-time convergent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed, which leverages a novel residual design to facilitate weight updates by collecting and evaluating current and historical data based on information quality. Compared with the existing RL methods that suffer from sluggish convergence due to an asymptotic learning rule and the stringent persistent excitation (PE) condition, the proposed RL relaxes the PE to an easily achievable and online verifiable finite excitation (FE) condition, allowing rapid weight convergence within a fixed period. Simulations and comparisons validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, showing a 61% reduction in convergence time in contrast to the prevailing RL schemes.},

  abstract     = {Rehabilitation exoskeletons have been demonstrated to benefit mobility-limited patients; however, accessibility is hindered by several challenges, and interaction evaluation of coupled human–exoskeleton systems remains critically understudied. In this pioneering study, “assistive normality (AN)” is introduced to characterize the cross-stage spatiotemporal features of exoskeleton-assisted gait in hemiplegic patients, and a multidimensional, low-data-cost metric framework is developed to quantify AN. Three subdivided metrics, including gait restoration (GR), phase-deviation weighting (PDW) and multijoint coordination (MJC), are proposed to assess coupled system interaction behavior across different intervention stages during rehabilitation. A homologous difference evaluation paradigm (HDEP) is introduced to capture pathological differences between healthy and hemiplegic subjects on the basis of the reusability of experimental data, providing an approach for the nominal assistance calibration and assessment of specific exoskeleton devices. In a pilot study with eight healthy individuals and nine hemiplegic patients, between-group metric differences were analyzed to determine the calibrated AN of an exoskeleton. The results provide calibration references for quantitative metrics and demonstrate the ability of framework to characterize the temporal dynamics of human–exoskeleton interactions. The proposed AN framework offers a generalizable approach to assistive robotics, potentially enhancing evaluation of human-robot interaction and advancing clinical rehabilitation applications.},

  abstract     = {Texture surface anomaly detection finds widespread applications in industrial settings. However, existing methods often necessitate gathering numerous samples for model training. Moreover, they predominantly operate within a closed-set detection framework, limiting their ability to identify anomalies beyond the training dataset. To tackle these challenges, this article introduces a novel zero-shot texture anomaly detection method named global-regularized neighborhood regression (GRNR). Unlike conventional approaches, GRNR can detect anomalies on arbitrary textured surfaces without any training data or cost. Drawing from human visual cognition, GRNR derives two intrinsic prior supports directly from the test texture image: local neighborhood priors characterized by coherent similarities and global normality priors featuring typical normal patterns. The fundamental principle of GRNR involves utilizing the two extracted intrinsic support priors for self-reconstructive regression of the query sample. This process employs the transformation facilitated by local neighbor support while being regularized by global normality support, aiming to not only achieve visually consistent reconstruction results but also preserve normality properties. We validate the effectiveness of GRNR across various industrial scenarios using eight benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superior detection performance without the need for training data. Remarkably, our method is applicable for open-set texture defect detection and can even surpass existing vanilla approaches that require extensive training.},

Since the control protocol directly affects control performance, there is definitely a close relationship between the consensus performance of the agents and the control protocols. To this end, a nonaffine nonlinear relationship of consensus error regarding the control protocol is established. Then, to deal with the unknown nonlinearity, a dynamic linear input–output relationship between two triggered batches is established by an event-triggering linearly parametric data model (ET-LPDM) where a triggering mechanism is designed along the iteration axis. Furthermore, both the event-triggered control law and the event-triggered parameter estimation law are derived from two objective functions, respectively, by using the ET-LPDM, where the values at nontriggering iteration remain unchanged from the latest triggering iteration to reduce the consumption of system resources. The proposed ET-DirDDILC does not rely on the MAS dynamical formulation. The convergence is proved and simulation study verifies the effectiveness of the presented ET-DirDDILC for MASs with both fixed and switching topologies.},

To play out full performance of integrated chassis, this study proposes a novel extended stability envelope analysis method to quantify the effect of different chassis actuator combinations on vehicle lateral dynamic. In energy phase plane, the state change direction with influence of control inputs are employed to judge whether a given state will go beyond the tire’s grip limit. Accordingly extended stability envelopes of some typical actuator combinations, i.e., active front steering (AFS) and active rear steering (ARS), AFS and torque vectoring control (TVC), ARS and TVC, are determined. Meanwhile, principle to quantify the overlapping effectiveness range and unique effectiveness range between ARS and TVC is introduced, accordingly effectiveness factors used for coordination control are discussed. In summary, the proposed method in this article has considerable potential for coordination control of integrated chassis, by providing comprehensive analysis method to estimate the extended stability boundary and quantify the effectiveness range with influence of actuators taken into account.},

This study investigates the impacts of introducing blockchain technology on the information-sharing strategy and equilibrium choice. We find that, in the scenario of blockchain technology, information sharing may not occur when the product quality is higher since sharing may benefit the upstream and hurt the downstream. When the quality is lower, information sharing can be better off for all members given the conditions: 1) the market dispersion is larger or 2) the market dispersion is smaller and the cost is higher. In the scenario of no information-sharing, the implementation of blockchain technology is always better off for the supplier due to the increase in the wholesale price and order quantity, while conditionally benefiting the retailer if the implementation cost of blockchain technology is lower. We also find that consumer surplus is lowest in the case of no information-sharing and no blockchain because of the higher price and nontraceability of information.},

  abstract     = {Recently emerged label noise-resistant graph representation learning (LNR-GRL) has received increasing attention, which aims to enhance the generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) in semi-supervised node classification with noisy and limited labels. Most of the existing LNR-GRL tend to introduce more complex sample selection strategies developed in nongraph areas to distinguish more noisy nodes to alleviate their misguidance. However, these proposed methods neglect the importance of inaccurate graph structure relationships rectification, and information collaboration between inaccurate graph structure relationships and noisy node label rectification in improving the quality of noisy node identification and its rectified node labels. To solve the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel multiplex experts governance collaboration (MEGC) framework for LNR-GRL. Specifically, an unsupervised graph structure governance expert is first designed to rectify inaccurate graph structure relationships. Based on the rectified graph structure, a simple label noise governance expert is proposed to accurately identify noisy node labels and further improve the quality of noisy nodes’ rectified labels and unlabeled nodes’ pseudo-labels. Finally, the above-proposed governance experts can be effectively combined with GNNs to jointly guide their training via the introduced cross-view graph contrastive loss and cross-entropy loss, which can maximally limit the effect of noisy node labels and discover more effective supervision guidance from data itself for GNNs optimization. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, two label noise types, four noise rates, and four training label rates demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to the existing LNR-GRL methods.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the $H_{\infty }$ control problem for switched systems with dynamic event-triggering and quantization schemes subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, the resilient event-triggering and quantization schemes against DoS are developed, allowing the triggering parameter and quantization density to be dynamically adjusted. Subsequently, we introduce a time-dependent piecewise Lyapunov function that remains nonincreasing at discontinuity points. This function, along with an auxiliary functional, is dedicated to establishing criteria for the stability with $L_{2}$ gain property of switched systems, under which the frequency of DoS attacks no longer directly impacts the exponential stability decay rate. In contrast to the general min-switching rule, the min-derivative switching strategy in this article is formulated based on the derivative of Lyapunov function and serves to make the time-dependent Lyapunov function decrease. Moreover, the switching law ensures that switches occur only at discrete sampling instants, thereby avoiding Zeno behavior. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to illustrate the feasibility and superiority of our approaches.},

  abstract     = {Formal verification becomes increasingly critical to ensure system functionality, reliability and safety as they grow in complexity. Existing methods tend to focus on a single dimension of system aspects—such as control flow, data flow or timing constraints—or, at most, consider two of these perspectives without integrating all three. In addition, data flow models generally represent high-level data abstraction without including operational details within underlying contexts. The inability of these models to capture system behavior undermines their reliability, ultimately increasing the likelihood of the corresponding systems malfunctioning. To address these issues, we propose a formal verification method based on a timed Petri net with database tables (TPDT-net). First, we model the system using TPDT-net and generate its state reachability graph (SRG). Next, we extend timed computation tree logic (TCTL) by introducing database-related data element operators, thus proposing a database-oriented TCTL (DTCTL) model checking method. In addition, we formalize the system correctness problem as corresponding DTCTL formulas, which are analyzed based on the SRG. This approach transforms correctness verification into a satisfiability problem of DTCTL formulas within the SRG. Finally, we validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method through case studies and experiments.},

  abstract     = {DNN have demonstrated vulnerability to adversarial attacks in object detection tasks. While significant progress has been made in single-spectrum attacks, cross-spectral adversarial attacks remain challenging due to the complex tradeoffs between visible and infrared domains. To address this, an evolutionary multiobjective cross-spectral attack (MoXAttack) framework, for developing adversarial patches in closed-box cross-spectral scenarios is proposed. MoXAttack incorporates a multipopulation constraint-handling technique, which uses both penalty functions and feasibility rules to guide the search process. Spectrum-aware genetic operators are introduced to enhance solution diversity and feasibility. The framework automatically optimizes the smooth to cross-spectral shared patch shape using curvature energy. In addition, MoXAttack utilizes singular value decomposition for visible spectrum texture perturbations and adjustable thermal shielding material thickness for infrared spectrum control. Experiments on the LLVIP dataset demonstrate that MoXAttack achieves competitive performance across multiple object detection models. Ablation studies reveal the positive impact of improved components on attack effectiveness. The multipatch strategy improves attack success rates by at least 17%, while optimized patch shapes outperform conventional geometric shapes by at least 25% in terms of mean average precision drop. In the physical world test, the proposed method shows stability in different viewing angles.},

There are three main contributions in SADE-SS: first, a novel parameter adaptation strategy is incorporated into the framework of SADE to improve its scalability by leveraging information from approximated fitness values. Second, a search space tightening strategy is proposed to strengthen the local exploitation capacity by identifying promising local search spaces. Third, a switching strategy is proposed to manage the global and local surrogate-assisted searches, aiming to balance exploration and exploitation capacities. Experiments on expensive benchmark functions with dimensions ranging from 30 to 400 were conducted to verify the effectiveness of SADE-SS for HEOPs. Moreover, ablation experiments were conducted to validate each proposed component. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that SADE-SS can secure highly competitive performance over state-of-the-art SAEAs for HEOPs.},

First, we employ the adaptive control technique to design a distributed observer, which provides an estimation of the leader for partial agents, thereby eliminating the need for the global information. Then, we propose a novel data-based adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) approach, associated with a double-integrator operator, to develop an online data-driven learning algorithm for learning the optimal control policy. However, existing optimal control strategy learning algorithms rely on the persistent excitation conditions (PECs), the full-rank condition, and the offline storage of historical data. To address these issues, our proposed method learns the optimal control policy online by solving a data-driven linear regression equations (LREs) based on an online-verifiable interval excitation (IE) condition, instead of relying on PEC. In addition, the uniqueness of the LRE solution is established by verifying the invertibility of a matrix, instead of satisfying the full-rank condition related to PEC and historical data storage as required in existing algorithms. It is demonstrated that our proposed learning algorithm not only guarantees optimal tracking with unknown dynamics but also relaxes some of the strict conditions of existing learning algorithms.

The complete interaction relationship in the HDI matrix is essential to deal with various problems such as pattern recognition in industrial applications. Therefore, estimating the missing data in the HDI matrix is crucial. latent factor analysis (LFA) models have achieved advanced results in solving such problems. However, the existing LFA models cannot model the nonlinear structure hidden in the HDI matrix. neural networks (NNs) can handle the nonlinearity in the HDI data, but their high estimation accuracy relies on high computation cost and storage burden. To address the aforementioned problems, this article proposes a novel NNLFA model. It contains the following primary ideas: 1) it can model the nonlinear structure of the HDI matrix efficiently through NNs and 2) it incorporates the NNs into the LFA model to improve estimation accuracy while maintaining high computational and storage efficiency. To validate the superiority of the NNLFA model, experiments with six state-of-the-art models are conducted on six practical industrial application datasets. The experimental results indicate that the NNLFA model enhances estimation accuracy by up to 33.3%. In addition, NNLFA model shows strong competitiveness in terms of both time and storage efficiency when compared to baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI)-based multiplayer systems have attracted increasing attention across diverse fields. While most research focuses on simultaneous-move multiplayer games to achieve Nash equilibrium, there are complex applications that involve hierarchical decision-making, where certain players act before others. This power asymmetry increases the complexity of strategic interactions, especially in the presence of mismatched uncertainties that can compromise data reliability and decision-making. To this end, this article develops a novel event-triggered reinforcement learning (RL) approach for hierarchical multiplayer systems with mismatched uncertainties. Specifically, by establishing an auxiliary augment system and designing appropriate cost functions for the high-level leader and low-level followers, we reformulate the hierarchical robust control problem as an optimization task within the Stackelberg–Nash game framework. Furthermore, an event-triggered scheme is designed to reduce the computational overhead and a neural-RL-based method is developed to automatically learn the event-triggered control policies for hierarchical players. Theoretical analyses are conducted to 1) demonstrate the stability preservation of the designed robust-optimal transformation; 2) verify the achievement of Stackelberg–Nash equilibrium under the developed event-triggered policies; and 3) guarantee the boundedness of the impulsive closed-loop system. Finally, the simulation studies validate the effectiveness of the developed method.},

It can be solved that both control gains and actuator failure parameters are unknown in considered MASs, which enhances the practicability of optimal consensus control. First, a reinforcement learning-based distributed optimal control law is designed by constructing the identifier-critic-actor learning networks. Furthermore, by utilizing the distributed optimal control law as an auxiliary variable, an adaptive fault-tolerant controller is proposed to effectively compensate for actuator failures. Meanwhile, a co-design scheme is proposed for the construction of an event-triggered control input with the fault-tolerant property. It is proven that the designed control input ensures the boundedness of closed-loop systems through rigorous stability analysis. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed approach can be illustrated via simulations of numerical nonlinear MASs and a group of autonomous underwater vehicles.},

  abstract     = {This work addresses the flexible job shop scheduling with finite skilled workers, extending classical flexible job shop scheduling by incorporating operation decomposition, finite worker, and worker transfer. These new problem features significantly increase the complexity of solving, as several operations requiring multiple workers can lead to worker competition, causing delays in other operations that depend on the same workers. Previous studies focused on either operation decomposition or worker transfer but did not address the issue of worker competition. To tackle this challenging optimization problem, we propose a knowledge-guided hierarchical evolutionary algorithm (KHEA) with multiview cooperative neighborhood search. The key contributions of this work are as follows: 1) a hierarchical solving framework is proposed to reduce the solving difficulty. This problem is decomposed into three levels. The first level ignores the worker assignment and the second level starts optimizing it. The final level then refines the global solution; 2) a knowledge-guided crossover operator with a feedback schema is designed to improve the efficiency of crossover operations; and 3) a multiview cooperative neighborhood search strategy is proposed to reduce the idle time caused by worker competition. This involves designing a new disjunctive graph that accounts for worker competition to identify the critical path. The information from both machine-view and worker-view Gantt charts is cooperatively utilized to minimize idle time. Our method, KHEA, was tested on two benchmarks across 28 instances and 16 large-scale instances, with equal running time for comparisons. Compared to state-of-the-arts, KHEA obtains significant superiority.},

  abstract     = {decision transformer (DT), as a conditional sequence modeling (CSM) approach, learns the action distribution for each state using historical information, such as trajectory returns, offering a supervised learning paradigm for offline reinforcement learning (Offline RL). However, due to the fact that DT solely concentrates on an individual trajectory with high returns-to-go, it neglects the potential for constructing optimal trajectories by combining sequences of different actions. In other words, traditional DT lacks the trajectory stitching capability. To address the concern, a novel DT (PCDT) for Offline RL is proposed. Our approach begins by pretraining a standard DT to explicitly capture behavior sequences. Next, we apply the sequence importance sampling to penalize actions that significantly deviate from these behavior sequences, thereby constructing a pessimistic critic. Finally, Q-values are integrated into the policy update process, enabling the learned policy to approximate the behavior policy while favoring actions associated with the highest Q-value. Theoretical analysis shows that the sequence importance sampling in pessimistic critic decision transformer (PCDT) establishes a pessimistic lower bound, while the value optimality ensures that PCDT is capable of learning the optimal policy. Results on the D4RL benchmark tasks and ablation studies show that PCDT inherits the strengths of actor–critic (AC) and CSM methods, achieving the highest normalized scores on challenging sparse-reward and long-horizon tasks.

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art brain–computer interfaces can carry out neural recording from hundreds of channels with high resolution. Such massive data makes it easy to study the brain better than ever before, but on the flip side, it leads to increased chip size, power consumption, heat dissipation and risk for patient safety. As such, compression of the data prior to transmission from the implant could be key to improving reliability and usability of such microsystems. In recent years, starting from sparsifying transforms all the way to compressive autoencoders (AEs), this compression has been offered by substantial arithmetic on the implant side, which in turn incurs its own inevitable costs. In this work, we analyze spike waveforms to prioritize subintervals by their importance. Thereupon, we design a temporal undersampling pattern matching the importance of each subinterval for compressive sensing of spikes. Following such sensing, we reconstruct spikes using a deep neural network (DNN) trained to capture spike representation from the undersampled measurements, with possible adaptation to individual subjects. This approach offers what we believe is the first spike compression-reconstruction framework that imposes no arithmetic on the compressing side, yet on the restoration side, performs at least on par with most on-chip arithmetic-heavy techniques. For instance, given a spike length of $N=64$ at eightfold compression, the famed symmlet-4 method yields a mean signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 7.14 dB at a total compression arithmetic cost of $16N$ sums and products per spike, while for the proposed method, the figure is 8.38 dB at 0 sums and products.},

  abstract     = {The machine downtime occurring during routine production (MDT_RP) because of recessive disturbances (RecDs) can cause huge economic losses and slow down production. In modern industries, condition monitoring, prognosis, and maintenance policies are widely applied to minimize machine failures caused by dominant disturbances (DomDs). However, MDT_RP, because of RecD, has rarely been explored. RecD multivariate time series data faces the challenge of changing information with many noisy and abnormal data points, making it difficult for sequential methods (SMs) to forecast MDT_RP accurately. To address this gap, a novel smoothing and matrix decomposition (MD) based stacked bidirectional gated recurrent unit (STMD_SBiGRU) is proposed for MDT_RP forecasting. Existing SMs have disadvantages in that they are highly affected by noisy data, which significantly affects their feature information extraction capability. The generated error gets amplified during forward propagation, thus interfering with the parameter’s optimization. The proposed STMD_SBiGRU has the advantage of capturing the maximum variance in the dataset by using various MD methods, as well as reducing abnormalities by applying various smoothing factors. This dual innovation of integrating MD and smoothing facilitates the effective distribution of parameters across multiple stacked layers and directions in a proposed model, thus avoiding complexity and overfitting problems of conventional SMs while improving network generalization performance. The extensive experimental work demonstrates that STMD_SBiGRU can forecast MDT_RP with better performance and is highly robust to noisy data compared to other data-driven methods.},

Adjustable threshold parameters are involved to flexibly adjust the data transmission times depending on the network bandwidth occupation. It is proved that with the motion controller and the proposed adjustable threshold triggered mechanism, all the closed-loop system signals are globally bounded, and the hydraulic system output achieves asymptotic tracking to the reference trajectory by virtue of the adaptive technique, the Nussbaum-type and sign functions.

To tackle issues arising from the neutral term, we introduce a special auxiliary system (AS) that is not a neutral system, and is distinct from existing literature [41]. Utilizing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach and the iterative method, the stability criterion for the AS is given, which consists of the bound of three delay functions and the duty-cycle. If the stability criterion is satisfied, the AS will achieve mean-square exponentially stability, offering a viable APIC design scheme for non-NSDSs. Additionally, employing the equivalence technique (ET), this article obtains an additional bound for the system delay function, denoted by $\tau ^{*}$ . When the system delay function $\tau (t)\lt \tau ^{*}$ , we demonstrate that the NSDS with intermittent feedback is mean-square exponentially stable if the non-neutral AS is stable. This method is called as AS method based on non-neutral type (ASMbNT). With one comparison, this article reveals that the ASMbNT proposed in this article not only addresses the problem considered in [41], but also yields improved results.

  abstract     = {Model-based reinforcement learning (RL), which learns an environment model from the offline dataset and generates more out-of-distribution model data, has become an effective approach to the problem of distribution shift in offline RL. Due to the gap between the learned and actual environment, conservatism should be incorporated into the algorithm to balance accurate offline data and imprecise model data. The conservatism of current algorithms mostly relies on model uncertainty estimation. However, uncertainty estimation is unreliable and leads to poor performance in certain scenarios, and the previous methods ignore differences between the model data, which brings great conservatism. To address the above issues, this article proposes a mildly conservative model-based offline RL algorithm (DOMAIN) without estimating model uncertainty, and designs the adaptive sampling distribution of model samples, which can adaptively adjust the model data penalty. In this article, we theoretically demonstrate that the Q value learned by the DOMAIN outside the region is a lower bound of the true Q value, the DOMAIN is less conservative than previous model-based offline RL algorithms, and has the guarantee of safety policy improvement. The results of extensive experiments show that DOMAIN outperforms prior RL algorithms and the average performance has improved by 1.8% on the D4RL benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Handwriting movements can be leveraged as a unique form of behavioral biometrics, to verify whether a real user is operating a device or application. This task can be framed as a “reverse Turing test” in which a computer has to detect if an input instance has been generated by a human or artificially. To tackle this task, we study ten public datasets of handwritten symbols (isolated characters, digits, gestures, pointing traces, and signatures) that are artificially reproduced using seven different synthesizers, including, among others, the Kinematic Theory ( $\boldsymbol {\Sigma \Lambda }$ model), generative adversarial networks, Transformers, and Diffusion models. We train a shallow recurrent neural network that achieves excellent performance (98.3% Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) score and 1.4% equal error rate on average across all synthesizers and datasets) using nonfeaturized trajectory data as input. In few-shot settings, we show that our classifier achieves such an excellent performance when trained on just 10% of the data, as evaluated on the remaining 90% of the data as a test set. We further challenge our classifier in out-of-domain settings, and observe very competitive results as well. Our work has implications for computerized systems that need to verify human presence, and adds an additional layer of security to keep attackers at bay.},

However, existing research works neither consider the time limits of timed dynamic relations (TDRs), nor analyze the delayed time of activities caused by shared users. In this article, we propose a new approach to analyzing secure collaboration plans of multiple workflow processes with TDRs and user conflicts: 1) we propose the computing patterns for basic structures in workflow processes with TDRs and shared users; 2) we develop the next-generation parametric sprouting graph (NPSG) based on the above patterns; and 3) we obtain the optimal secure collaboration plan based on NPSG. Compared with the existing methods, our approach can effectively deal with the problem of collaboration plans with TDRs and shared users. Furthermore, our approach is more efficient, because NPSG of multiple workflow processes can be constructed in parallel and its recommendation ability is improved by deleting invalid paths in advance.},

  abstract     = {Imaging systems working under poor lighting conditions often suffer from poor visibility, compromising the reliability of vision-based systems. To address this problem, recent studies have developed data-driven low-light image enhancement (LIE) techniques to improve visibility. However, these LIE methods typically require large amounts of training samples, and the learned representation may not be valid for real-world scenes due to data discrepancies. In this work, we propose DP-LIE, an unsupervised LIE method driven by both data and priors. Unlike the existing methods that learn unexplainable high-dimensional features for end-to-end mapping, DP-LIE focuses on learning prior-guided parametric maps with definite meanings, enabling the low-light images to be brightened from an interpretable prior-based perspective. To this end, we design a simple yet effective prior-guided network-assisted LIE formulation, which elaborately bonds the data-driven representations with the traditional priors. The embedded priors narrow the solution space of the LIE model, allowing it to be efficiently trained with fewer samples. Notably, even trained with just a single low-light input image, the proposed method (denoted as DP-LIE-S) achieves comparable performances with existing unsupervised LIE methods. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed DP-LIE method exhibits excellent generalization performance across diverse imaging devices and promises better detection results for vision-based detection systems in nighttime scenes.},

This work proposes a method of processing module (PM) two-layer configuration. First, one PM configuration is made for each wafer type, i.e., the suitable number of PMs is selected for processing wafers, ensuring that the natural workload is balanced at each step for a type of wafers. Then, the other PM configuration is made, i.e., adopt a virtual module method for balancing the natural workload at bottleneck processing steps of different types of wafers. Based on two-layer PM configuration, this work derives necessary and sufficient conditions for a CT’s schedulability, which are less restrictive than the current state-of-the-art ones. It proposes a polynomial-time algorithm for computing its minimum periodic schedule when it is schedulable. Several examples are given to show our algorithm’s superiority over existing ones.},

Many existing approaches involve offline training and classifiers or depend on prefabricated models, lacking the adaptability needed to support diverse users and real-time scenarios with varying gait cycles. Meanwhile, balancing intervention on human limbs between compliance and assistance during learning is still an open problem. To address these issues, this article proposes a real-time learning method for walking assistance without classifiers, automatically adapting to alterations in motion patterns. The control law, based on adaptive admittance control and the equilibrium state, ensures stable assistance during learning with intuitive parameter tuning and allows for switching of gait during assistance. Utilizing selective memory recursive least squares in a neural network enables rapid learning and precise prediction of human users’ motion intention, without pretraining. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a prediction error within 6° after half a minute of learning with a prediction ahead time of 120 ms, outperforming classic approaches. The assistance performance is consistent despite varied control parameters, indicating a certain level of robustness.},

Subsequently, a novel offline policy iteration (PI) algorithm is introduced, highlighting its convergence and reinforcing the substantive proof of the existence of Nash equilibrium points. Moreover, a novel action-dependent Q-function is established to facilitate entirely model-free learning, representing the initial foray into the mixed $H_{2}/H_{\infty }$ control problem involving coupled players.

The proposed regulative learning rate strategy outperforms traditional fixed-rate gradient descent approaches found in existing works. With the objective of minimizing the performance index, the optimal value function and the optimal controller are derived from the approximate solution of the HJB equation. To alleviate the resource demand and enhance the flexibility of the threshold function, an adaptive event-triggered (AET) scheme integrating the idea of sampling control and event-triggered strategy is applied to the optimal control initially. Compared with the static event-triggered strategy, the AET method contains increasing engineering value. A piecewise Lyapunov function is constructed based on optimal value function, estimated error introduced by neural network (NN) weight, and the classic Lyapunov-Krasovskii function. Thus, uniform ultimate boundedness for tracking error is proven theoretically. Moreover, the maximum tolerable strength of cyberattacks is provided from the stability analysis.

Different from previous methods that focus on single-step transition changes, the HTI framework improves decision-making by inferring multistep environmental variations. Specifically, this framework constructs a probabilistic graphical model for Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) in latent space and utilizes the variational lower bound of hidden states for policy improvement. Furthermore, this work theoretically proves the convergence of the HTI framework, ensuring its effectiveness in handling nonstationary environments. The proposed framework is integrated with the state-of-the-art MCTS-based algorithm sampled MuZero and evaluated on multiple control tasks with different nonstationary dynamics transitions.

By introducing a first-order filter, a mapping relationship between sensor faults and actuator faults is established, and an augmented system is constructed by integrating system state and filter output. Through the incorporation of robust adaptive terms, an output-based fault observer is developed to online identify sensor fault information, ensuring that observation errors converge asymptotically to zero. For optimal STC realization, an augmented tracking system is constructed by integrating the dynamics of tracking error, reference trajectory, and filter output. A modified cost function is designed to explicitly include sensor fault estimation and a discount factor based on the augmented tracking system. Then, the optimal STC strategy is derived by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation using an adaptive critic structure with two tuned laws cooperatively. The application of the Lyapunov stability theorem demonstrates that the closed-loop system converges within a small neighborhood of the equilibrium point. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed OFSTC method.},

  abstract     = {In order to solve the insufficient redundancy problem and slow convergence in multiple end-effector tasks, a piecewise varying-gain dual-criterion optimization (PVDO) method is proposed for motion planning of insufficient redundant manipulators. To achieve this, the convergence coefficients are designed to be piecewise varying, and the end-effector task is divided into two phases. In the initial phase, only the end-effector position task is considered and the fixed coefficient convergence method is adopted, which can take into consideration both end-effector task and secondary task optimization. In the second phase, the end-effector position and orientation are taken into account concurrently, and time-varying coefficients are used for end-effector task. The convergence coefficients are time varying to enhance the convergence speed, particularly when the errors are small in the later phase of task planning. This can ensure the optimization of secondary tasks when the manipulator is insufficient-redundant, and accomplish the end-effector task planning in a relatively fast speed. Finally, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PVDO method in obstacle avoidance and joint limits avoidance.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the problem of bipartite synchronization (BS) for coupled coopetitive memristive neural networks (MNNs) using a switching event-triggered gain-scheduled control strategy. First, a mathematical model of coupled MNNs exhibiting both cooperative and competitive interactions is formulated based on directed signed graph theory. To handle the antagonistic nature of these interactions, an orthogonal transformation is employed to develop a formally unified error system. Then, a switching event-triggered scheme (SETS) is designed, which leverages the coopetitive relationships among nodes to reduce communication costs. Meanwhile, a gain-scheduled controller, which incorporates the cooperative-competitive relationships is designed to achieve the BS. Specifically, the controller consists of both linear and nonlinear components: the linear component ensures system stability, while the nonlinear component compensates for residual terms arising from the heterogeneous structure of MNNs. Furthermore, the nonlinear control gains are scheduled via a function that depends on the error state, its derivative, and the sampled error, thereby reducing the conservatism of the synchronization conditions. A piecewise interval-dependent Lyapunov functional tailored to the characteristics of SETS is constructed. By employing inequality techniques, sufficient conditions for BS are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), enabling the joint design of the linear control gains and the triggering matrix. To validate the proposed method, both a numerical example and a potential practical application are provided. In addition, two comparative studies are conducted to highlight the advantages of the proposed SETS and the interval-dependent Lyapunov functional, respectively.},

However, despite the prevalence of job-to-product assembly process in industrial fields, the investigation of distributed assembly welding shop scheduling problem (DAWSP) remains unexplored. Meanwhile, given the energy-intensive characteristic of welding operations, addressing energy consumption in welding shop is crucial for achieving environmental sustainability. Thus, this study investigates the energy-efficient DAWSP (EDAWSP), focusing on minimizing total energy consumption (TEC) and makespan. The proposed approaches include a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model and a knowledge-guided co-evolutionary algorithm (KCEA). In KCEA, a knowledge coefficient is defined to build a bridge that connects the welding part and assembly part. By incorporating knowledge coefficient and weight-sum approach, an effective initialization strategy is proposed for producing a superior initial population. To effectively complete evolutionary process, a co-evolutionary operator is devised based on bi-population strategy. To improve KCEA’s exploitation capability, a local search is developed within the variable neighborhood search (VNS) framework, utilizing six critical-path-based neighborhood structures. Besides, an energy-saving strategy is presented to further minimize TEC without increasing makespan. Finally, a series of comparison experiments are executed. The experimental results illustrate that all improved components of KCEA contribute to its performance, and KCEA outperforms other six optimization algorithms in solving EDAWSP.},

By constructing a new time-dependent multiple Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (TDMLF), sufficient conditions are then developed to ensure the strict $(\mathscr {X}_{1}, \mathscr {X}_{2},\mathscr {X}_{3})$ - $\gamma $ dissipativity for the considered SDNNs, even in cases where all subnetworks are nondissipative. Subsequently, the proposed approach is implemented for the synchronization of SDNNs, where a bumpless transfer proportional-integral-like (PI-like) control approach is first adopted. In addition, the corresponding criterion is also proposed, which guarantees that the resultant closed-loop synchronization error systems (SESs) not only satisfy strict dissipativity but also achieve a certain bumpless transfer performance (BTP). Ultimately, the practicability and superiority of the proposed design approach are thoroughly substantiated through two simulation examples.},

First, a flexible job shop lot-splitting scheduling model with the optimization objectives of total energy consumption, makespan, and total processing cost is formulated. Second, a hybrid approach of the KLSM and the IMOEA is designed to solve the model. The solution space of the problem is fully explored based on the moth-flame operator. Co-evolutionary operators are performed to promote information interaction among populations, hence both the population diversity and the convergence effect of the algorithm are improved. Moreover, a post-adjustment strategy based on adjacent processes is developed to reduce unnecessary fixture changes. Finally, extended experiments between some KLSM-based well-known and novel algorithms, including the proposed IMOEA, MOEA/D, NSGA-II, MOPSO, SGECF, SCEA, and SLMEA are conducted in benchmark problems and a real-world case of machine tool plant. The results show that the proposed method outperforms its competitors on co-optimization of lot-splitting, machine allocation, operation sequencing, and fixture assignment of the $\gamma $ -shop scheduling, which can effectively reduce total energy consumption, makespan, and total processing cost.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity is a critical task in BMSs. However, existing multisource domain adaptation methods often ignore the different contributions of each source domain, focusing solely on aligning the global distributions of source and target domains. This limitation can result in negative transfer. To address this issue, this article proposes a multisource feature separation and weighted (MFSW) network for lithium-ion battery capacity estimation. First, private and common features of both source and target domains are disentangled through feature separation. An adversarial mechanism is employed to guide the common feature extractor to learn domain-invariant features. Then, the features are further aligned using a multiorder metric. Finally, a multisource dynamic weighting method is introduced to adaptively adjust the weight of each source domain. Compared with other multisource domain adaptation methods, the proposed method reduces the average MSE and MAE by 56.3% and 28.8% on the MIT dataset, and by 44.0% and 38.6% on the XJTU dataset, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates negative transfer and exhibits superior performance and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Complex industrial processes often run under varying operating conditions. Learning-based control methods are difficult to adapt to these unknown variations. Therefore, it is necessary to update the model and control strategy adaptively. However, in traditional control frameworks, due to the limitation of computational and storage resources of edge devices, control strategies are difficult to update once deployed, which leads to model mismatch after operating condition change and seriously reduces the control performance. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel cloud-edge collaborative control method. Specifically, a cloud-assisted parallel subspace identification method is proposed, which fully utilizes the powerful computational capability of the distributed cluster in the cloud to achieve fast and accurate model identification. Then, an explicit control strategy is proposed, which solves the control law as a piece-wise affine function offline. The process model and explicit control law are sent down to the edge, enabling fast and precise control under limited resource constraints. An operating condition change detection method based on the process model is proposed, and the edge detects the emergence of new operating conditions by the prediction error. Meanwhile, to fully excite new operating condition characteristics, a joint control and excitation signal generator (JCESG) is designed. JCESG ensures accurate identification of new operating condition model under limited data, which in turn greatly shortens the operation condition switching process and ensures fast modeling and precise control in new operating conditions. Notably, considering that the proposed method can adaptively realize model identification and control law update, it is capable of adapting to the continuous change of operating conditions, and the sufficient excitation of JCESG greatly reduces the data volume requirement for model update, which further ensures that the method adapts to the full range of operating conditions. Finally, extensive experiments verified the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Group decision-making (GDM) is a crucial approach to ensuring the scientific nature and impartiality of decisions. However, strategic manipulative behaviors driven by self-interested motives often undermine the fairness and effectiveness of decision outcomes, leading to results that deviate from expectations. While most prior studies have focused on theoretical analysis, there remains a significant gap in effective measures to prevent such manipulative behaviors. Moreover, current consensus models predominantly emphasize cost optimization, with less attention paid to the acceptability of feedback. To address these challenges, this study introduces an optimal consensus adjustment mechanism based on the Nash bargaining (NB) solution, aiming to prevent manipulation and self-interested behaviors in GDM. Specifically, we first analyze the opinion manipulation problem within the framework of the minimum adjustment consensus model (MACM). We then construct the Nash product to mitigate the risk of weight manipulation. Subsequently, we examine the nonuniqueness issue in the allocation of minimal total consensus adjustments from the perspective of cooperative game theory. Building on this, we incorporate regret theory to characterize the risk aversion and loss sensitivity of decision-makers (DMs) and propose a consensus adjustment mechanism based on the NB game. Finally, we establish three novel optimization methods to allocate optimal individual consensus adjustments. Case studies and comparative experiments demonstrate the superiority of these methods.},

To deal with this challenge, by applying the adding a power integrator method, a decentralized adaptive controller is built with a switching parameter to compensate unknown parameters. Based on fixed-time control framework, a logic-based switching rule is established to tune the switching parameter online, in which the Lyapunov-like boundary functions are utilized to replace the Lyapunov function containing inexact values brought by unmodeled dynamics. Then, with the aid of Lyapunov stability theorem, it is proved that the system output never violates the prespecified constraints and all state variables converge to zero within a fixed time.

Subsequently, the identified dynamic knowledge is expressed and stored using constant RBFNNs. To mitigate the issue of partial knowledge failure due to deviations between the actual and learned trajectories, we introduce a RL framework for dynamic compensation.

However, the robustness of SCN is significantly reduced when processing the data disturbed by outliers.

Such a robust decorrelated ensemble framework adopts weighted negative correlation learning (WNCL) and a robust regularization technique, which can guarantee the generalization performance for noisy data processing. Specifically, we first present a WNCL framework based on kernel density estimation (KDE) to build SCNs ensemble model, so that the negative effects of noise can be suppressed through KDE to calculate penalty weights of each training sample for the computation of ensemble weights. Meanwhile, $l_{1}$ norm loss function combined with $l_{2}$ regularization technique is employed as the objective function of base components. This approach is designed to process outliers with sparse characteristics and alleviate the over-fitting phenomenon. Then, augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) method is used to calculate the objective function. Experimental results over some regression datasets with Gaussian outliers demonstrate that the proposed RDSCNE model has better robustness than the various SCN variants.},

This study proposes a novel asynchronous consensus evolution mechanism (ACEM) designed to enhance large group emergency decision-making (LGEDM) under uncertainty, with specific application to the EV SoCSC. Unlike traditional synchronous approaches, ACEM enables decision makers (DMs) to contribute asynchronously, reducing wait times and accelerating consensus formation. The mechanism integrates uncertain scenario analysis with an optimization framework that dynamically allocates decision steps with relative weights, ensuring adaptability to complex and dynamic environments. We further develop a time-aware adaptive clustering (TAAC) algorithm to segment DMs based on decision quality and response speed, enhancing both the speed and the accuracy of consensus building. Simulation results indicate that ACEM significantly reduces decision latency and improves consensus efficiency under uncertain disruption scenarios. This work provides a robust framework for agile decision-making, enabling manufacturers to enhance SoCSC resilience in uncertain disruptions.},

Data oversampling constitutes one of the potential solutions. Nonetheless, there are certain inherent limitations of current oversampling techniques. Traditional oversamplers are inadequate in ascertaining the quantity of new samples and can not mitigate the impact of noise on new samples. To solve these two problems theoretically, we propose an optimization framework for imbalance-ratio and position (OIRP). OIRP constructs two optimization models utilizing data on feature distribution, class ratio, quantity, and dimensionality to determine the optimal quantity to generate and the optimal position of new samples. These two models are demonstrated to possess optimal solutions. OIRP is employed to enhance current oversampling algorithms. It is adaptive, devoid of parameters, and universally applicable. The experiments are based on dozens of datasets with different quantities, imbalance ratios, noise rates, classical and sota comparison algorithms. The experimental results show that OIRP significantly improves existing oversamplers.

To address these challenges, this article proposes a constrained multimodal multiobjective differential evolution algorithm, which incorporates a similar-niching-based reproduction operator and a novel environmental selection mechanism. The proposed algorithm initiates by segregating the population into distinct niches, thereby promoting independent evolution within each niche. This segmentation enhances the exploration of multiple discrete feasible regions, thus improving the capacity to find diverse Pareto optimal solutions. Moreover, the algorithm selects the most similar niche to collaboratively generate solutions, further enhancing its ability to generate effective feasible solutions. To improve the diversity within the population, the proposed environmental selection mechanism gives preference to solutions that enhance the distribution of the next-generation population. By considering the diversity in both two spaces, the population retains more pareto optimal solutions. Based on the Friedman test results of the comparison experiment with other representative algorithms and the champion algorithm of the CEC2023 CMMOPs competition, the proposed algorithm attained the top ranking, thereby reinforcing its demonstrated superiority.

By blending the modified shifting function and the barrier Lyapunov function, the presented control scheme only needs to adjust n parameters to achieve full errors prescribed-time convergence. Besides, the dead-zone input is divided into a linear term and an interference-like term. A disturbance observer is devised to estimate and compensate the compounded perturbations, including external perturbations, fuzzy approximation errors and interference-like term, which significantly enhances the accuracy of the feedback compensation mechanism.

In this article, the development of the “Spacecraft early analysis model” (SEAM) is detailed and the current version is presented. The SEAM is a model-based framework developed by the authors to define, execute and analyze spacecraft structure and behavior during preliminary design. The SEAM comprises multiple modules (Project, Requirements, Mission, System, Operations) that enable the definition of the spacecraft and its supporting systems, and enables each to be updated independently. The SEAM incorporates a novel behavioral pattern that structures the modes and functions of the spacecraft using state machines and activities. Using this pattern, the behavior itself is not prescribed, as is common in similar model-based representations of spacecraft. The user defines individual functions and modes, and the user then simulates the behavior of the spacecraft in response to a concept of operations (ConOps). In this article, the need for the SEAM, the development approach, the SEAM composition and the limitations of the SEAM are presented and discussed.},

  abstract     = {Motion platforms are integral to enhancing user immersion in vehicle simulators by reproducing vehicle accelerations through virtual reality. A key challenge in this domain is ensuring that users perceive critical motion cues accurately. Due to the physical limitations of motion platforms, Motion Cueing algorithms (MCA) often fail to transmit specific acceleration signals that are important for the purpose of the simulator (e.g., training), leading to a loss in motion fidelity. This gap, widely acknowledged but insufficiently addressed in prior research, directly impacts the user’s perception of realism. To address this issue, we propose a heuristic-based enhancement to the classical washout algorithm (CWA) that prioritizes the retention of these critical signals while maintaining system stability. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, an experimental study was conducted with 40 participants who tested the system with and without the proposed heuristics. Participants provided real-time feedback and completed post-test questionnaires. The results indicate that the heuristic-enhanced CWA significantly improves users’ ability to perceive signals that were previously lost, thus bridging the identified research gap and advancing the state of motion simulation.},

  abstract     = {We consider the optimal inventory control problem of a periodically reviewed supply chain with perishable goods. The deterioration process is characterized by an unknown decay factor time-varying over a given arbitrarily large uncertainty subset of all admissible values. In this context we face the problem of defining an effective inventory control policy reconciling control requirements like maximizing the satisfied customer demand, avoiding overstocking, attenuating the bullwhip effect. The conflict of these requirements and the uncertainty on the time varying decay factor define a highly involved problem that necessarily calls for an optimal and robust control synthesis approach. To define a general synthesis procedure of the inventory control policy, we take into account the time varying uncertainty on the decay factor through weak “a priori” assumptions that are verified in the vast majority of practical cases, regardless of the actual dynamics of the deterioration process. To reduce the conservatism of any robust optimization procedure we propose a novel approach based on a data driven reconfigurable min-max model predictive control (MPC). In brief, the synthesis procedure consists of the following steps: 1) the whole set of possible values assumed by the time-varying decay factor is partitioned into a family of small subintervals; 2) the subinterval containing the current and unknown decay factor is identified on the basis of a data-driven test; 3) a supervisor exploits this information to instantly update the current configuration of a reconfigurable min-max MPC strategy. We provide theoretical guarantee of asymptotic stability and satisfaction of the hard constraints on the inventory control policy. The numerical simulations confirm the validity of the proposed method.},

The growth conditions for the uncertain nonlinearities are more inclusive compared to those found in most previous studies. The exponents of high-order systems can take arbitrary rational numbers, which can be represented by two positive odd integers, and they are not all exactly larger than 1. Based on the conventional backstepping idea, the method of adding a power integrator is adopted to design an adaptive controller that renders the closed-loop system stochastically finite-time stable (SFTS). Due to the general nonlinearities, high-order exponents, and stochastic characteristics, the design process requires more effort, so domination instead of cancellation techniques is used.

  abstract     = {Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have been widely utilized to support the decisions made by cardiologists when detecting and classifying arrhythmia from electrocardiograms. However, forming a CDSS for the arrhythmia classification task is challenging due to the varying lengths of arrhythmias. Although the onset time of arrhythmia varies, previously developed methods have not considered such conditions. Thus, we propose a framework that consists of 1) local and global extraction and 2) local-global information fusion with attention to enable arrhythmia detection and classification within a constrained input length. The framework’s performance was evaluated in terms of 10-class and 4-class arrhythmia detection, focusing on identifying the onset and ending point of arrhythmia episodes and their duration using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB) and the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database (AFDB). Duration, episode, and Dice score performances resulted in overall F1-scores of 96.45%, 82.05%, and 96.31% on the MITDB and 97.57%, 98.31%, and 97.45% on the AFDB, respectively. The results demonstrated statistically superior performance compared to those of the benchmark models. To assess the generalization capability of the proposed method, an MITDB-trained model and MIT-BIH malignant ventricular arrhythmia database-trained model were tested AFDB and MITDB, respectively. Superior performance was attained compared with that of a state-of-the-art model. The proposed method effectively captures both local and global information and dynamics without significant information loss. Consequently, arrhythmias can be detected with greater accuracy, and their occurrence times can be precisely determined, enabling the clinical field to develop more accurate treatment plans based on the proposed method.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel haptic feedback-based cooperative control strategy that enhances the surgeon’s command of laparoscopic field of view (FOV) movement in robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. Specifically, we first established a dynamic model of the laparoscope-holding robot, which serves as a link between the movement of the laparoscopic FOV and the surgical instruments to deliver haptic feedback to the surgeon. Next, a motion observer was developed to transform 30 Hz visual feedback into 1 kHz haptic feedback by integrating visual tracking data with kinematic information, ensuring smoother and more continuous haptic feedback. Finally, we propose two distinct collaboration modes: the plane tracking mode (PTM) ensures instruments remain within the laparoscopic image, and the space tracking mode (STM) synchronizes the laparoscope with instrument movement. The laboratory experiments validated the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing the cooperative performance of robot-assisted laparoscope systems while animal experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the PTM design.},

  abstract     = {Multimode motion capability in self-reconfigurable wheeled mobile robots (SRWMRs) can be achieved by designing various control modes and the corresponding switching strategies adapted to different motion objectives. While SRWMR is capable of strong traction and moving at a fast speed by utilizing robot creeping (RC) and wheel rolling (WR) modes, respectively, the autonomous RC mode control is challenging due to the parameter definition of mode-switching control (MSC). Therefore, to obtain the main control parameters in an SRWMR, an ROSTDyn Vortex platform is developed to analyze the traction, slippage, and sinkage variation of the modes on varied soil terrains. To autonomously activate the RC mode while the robot is in WR mode, an MSC method is proposed by utilizing fuzzy logic algorithms, taking into account the slip ratio of wheels and their change in rate. Furthermore, for RC mode, to enhance the motion efficiency by adaptively changing the wheelbase length on different types of soil terrains, the control indices on energy consumption and forward movement are presented with the consideration of the defined slip ratio indices. According to the results of simulation experiments, including climbing slopes and escaping from the wheel sinking on the designed soil terrains with varied sloping degrees and stiffness, the autonomous RC control was effectively achieved by the proposed MSC, leading to body traction enhancement. In addition, a 31% reduction in energy consumption was achieved by RC mode with adjustable parameters, compared to the regular RC control.},

However, traditional approaches are constrained by factors, such as the reliance on accurate dynamic models and the risk of operator fatigue during prolonged tasks. Additionally, while data-driven intelligent approaches reduce the need for prior knowledge, they have yet to adequately address the time delay issues inherent in these systems. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the belief state actor-critic (BSAC) method, the first deep reinforcement learning approach tailored for space teleoperation capture tasks within a bilateral control framework. We first establish a generalized agent-based architecture for space teleoperation, shifting decision-making from human operators to autonomous agents. Following a comprehensive analysis of the time delay challenges, we propose the BSAC algorithm, which integrates state augmentation and belief state techniques to mitigate the effects of delays in teleoperated Markov decision processes. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MuJoCo simulation platform, modeling a real hardware system across various scenarios. The learned policies are then successfully transferred and validated in a real-world setup, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of BSAC. In summary, our results support the feasibility of agent-based frameworks capable of overcoming time delay challenges in space teleoperation.},

  abstract     = {Ever since the reinforcement learning (RL) method was proposed, the optimal control problem for multiagent systems (MASs) has been intensively explored in light of the limitation of the control resource. However, most of the consequences have overlooked the denial-of-service (DoS) attacks which are often encountered in engineering scenarios. Thus, the current investigation makes the first attempt to explore the optimized containment control issue with a dynamic event-triggered mechanism for heterogeneous stochastic MASs subject to DoS attacks. For the purpose of achieving optimal control, the optimized backstepping technique is developed by resorting to a simplified RL algorithm based on the identifier-critic–actor structure. Then, a novel dynamic event-triggered mechanism is put forward to update the control input signals only at triggering instants so as to reduce the communication burden. Furthermore, by means of stochastic Lyapunov stability theory, it is verified that all signals in the closed-loop system are cooperatively semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded in probability, in the simultaneous presence of disturbances and DoS attacks. Finally, the validation of the presented strategy is demonstrated via a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {This work develops an output feedback adaptive tracking control method based on dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) for discrete-time uncertain parameter systems. A piecewise DREM estimator is designed for the uncertain parameters under conditions strictly weaker than the persistently excited condition, exhibiting the ability to capture the actual system dynamics in finite time. Accurate parameter estimation guarantees the performance of the controller utilizing the DREM estimator. Then, an adaptive optimal controller for any given reference trajectory is designed within the framework of receding horizon control. The system state and control input are theoretically guaranteed to remain bounded during tracking. The adaptive controller is restructured in a nonminimal state space to achieve output feedback without a state estimator. The proposed output feedback adaptive controller is fully consistent with its state-feedback counterpart. Simulation results for tracking different reference signals demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the prescribed-time formation control in the task space of multirobot systems (MRSs), which is subject to the uncertain nonlinear dynamics and the position requirements. The strategy constructs a cascade system consisting of control and reference layers by connections of coupled prescribed-time control units, which separately guarantee the convergence of coordination errors, accuracy of states, and synchronization between layers. Meanwhile, the transformation from task space to joint space is built based on the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobi matrix, which avoids the singular value problem brought by computing the inverse kinematics. The adaptive control method utilizes parameter estimation to eliminate the inaccuracy problem brought by the pseudo-inverse of Jacobi matrix transformation. Then, this article provides solutions to the formation control and the formation along the trajectory control. Correspondingly, the Lyapunov analysis process proves the system’s stability and the parameter estimation’s boundedness, which confirms the sufficient conditions for realizing the prescribed-time formation control of the MRSs. Finally, this article presents examples of time-varying formation and along-trajectories formation, thereby demonstrating the effect of the controller.},

  abstract     = {With the growing demand for robots in emerging fields, such as smart medical and home services, their ability to interact with soft environments has received increased attention. Nevertheless, an overlooked issue is that the inadequate description of soft environments using a linear model may significantly diminish the accuracy of interaction control. In this article, a neural-network-based impedance control framework is proposed for robots to physically interact with soft environments and optimize interaction performance. Specifically, a nonlinear definition of soft environments is introduced based on the Hunt–Crossley (HC) model, with parameter identification utilizing a data-driven technique. Regarding system performance evaluated by a cost function, the determination of interaction behavior described by the impedance model is transformed into an optimal control problem. Moreover, to address model uncertainties, the original optimal control problem is redefined using a modified cost function with a constructed auxiliary system. Then, a critic network is employed to approximate the nonlinear optimal solution, thereby avoiding complicated mathematical derivations. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed impedance adaptation strategy is validated through both simulations and experiments. Numerical results indicate that both the convergent cost and total cost are significantly reduced based on the proposed method compared to the linear-model-based impedance control, particularly for materials with viscoelastic properties, achieving a reduction of up to 30%.},

  abstract     = {Multiple quadrotor aircraft system has significant advantages for performing complex tasks in dangerous environments, but it is still challenging for formation with external disturbance or internal model uncertainty. This article establishes a hierarchical distributed robust formation strategy for multiple quadrotor aircrafts, in which trajectory tracking and attitude formation are, respectively, controlled in different layers. An upper trajectory tracking controller is proposed to generate desired position for lower anti-disturbance attitude formation controller, where a bi-level adaptive terminal sliding mode controller with disturbance observers are, respectively, designed. In lower control layer, the desired velocity is generated by velocity control part to ensure quadrotor aircraft to track desired position while maintaining certain formation shape, whereas the acceleration control part is responsible for driving actual velocity of each quadrotor aircraft to desired velocity. Stability analysis shows that the prescribed formation can be realized if unknown disturbance is bounded and time constants in different layers are selected appropriately. Compared with existing results, the proposed strategy enables multiple complex tasks to be realized in different layers to improve formation accuracy and achieve interference suppression. The effectiveness is verified through both Gazebo simulation and actual experiment.},

  abstract     = {In industrial processes, the optimization and control processes operate on different time scales. Neglecting the multitime scale characteristics can lead to an optimized control law that fails to guarantee the control performance of the controlled nonlinear system. To address this problem, a data-knowledge-driven multitime scale integrated optimal control (DK-MTSIOC) strategy is proposed for the nonlinear system in this article. First, a multitime scale integrated optimal control (MTSIOC) framework, including a time scale collaborative objective function, is established. Then, multitime scales of nonlinear systems are coordinated to the fast time scale to ensure real-time optimization and control. Second, to address the problem of low accuracy in predicting fast time scale model driven by the slow time scale data information, a data-knowledge-driven prediction model is introduced to predict the future dynamics of the system at the fast time scale. Furthermore, a knowledge compensation strategy is designed to supplement missing fast time scale specific information. Third, a collaborative optimization algorithm is utilized to solve the setpoints and control laws simultaneously. Besides, the convergence of the data and knowledge-driven prediction model and stability of DK-MTSIOC are proved. Finally, the proposed DK-MTSIOC is tested on a conventional nonlinear system and a benchmark example of the wastewater treatment process to validate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {The global polynomial synchronization (GPS) is investigated for memristive competitive neural networks (MCNNs) with proportional delays and uncertain parameters. First, via drawing support from differential inclusion theory and adopting the time-variant state feedback controllers, their error systems are synthesized into a vector form MCNNs. Then, a new proportional delay differential inequality (PDDI) is established through norm definition and Lipschitz condition for the vector form MCNNs mentioned-above. Several algebraic forms of synchronization criteria for the system proposed are achieved by applying the new PDDI. Each of these criteria is represented by only one inequality, rather than in the form of components, which facilitates validation. Compared to the commonly used method for constructing Lyapunov functionals in studying MCNNs, it is more concise. Ultimately, numerical examples are used to inspect the results acquired, and the GPS of one example is applied in image encryption and decryption. The empirical outcomes demonstrat the efficacy of the employed synchronization control approach, exhibiting robust resilience and heighten security in secure communication applications.},
