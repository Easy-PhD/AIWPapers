  abstract     = {Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are gaining attention as a promising foundation for next-generation machine learning. However, the practical deployment of QNNs, particularly in vision tasks, remains limited due to hardware constraints such as qubit scarcity. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN)-based object detection framework designed for the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. The proposed method introduces four key components, patch processing, channel uploading, hybrid channel construction, and heterogeneous knowledge distillation, to enable efficient multi-channel object detection with a limited number of qubits. Furthermore, the knowledge distillation strategy facilitates the transfer of knowledge from a classical region proposal network (RPN) to its quantum counterpart, thereby enhancing detection accuracy despite the limitations of early-stage quantum machine learning. The evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed quantum object detection model, which can be effectively applied to complex vision tasks within existing quantum hardware limitations.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of parallel and distributed computing paradigms has brought great revolution in computing. Thanks to the intrinsic parallelism of evolutionary computation (EC), it is natural to implement EC on these systems. On the one hand, the high computing power can significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of EC. On the other hand, distributed data bring new challenges and development to EC. In this paper, a systematic review on distributed EC (DEC) is given. First, this paper provides an overview of DEC from a broader perspective, including not only the work of improving the efficiency of EC in parallel and distributed platforms, but also the work of applying DEC to solve distributed optimization problems derived from modern distributed environments like the Internet of Things and multi-agent systems. A new taxonomy to review DEC is proposed according to problems, implementation environments, communication models, and algorithms. Based on this taxonomy, problems solved by DEC are categorized into centralized optimization problems and distributed optimization problems according to the information owner. Correspondingly, two major purposes, improving efficiency through parallel processing for centralized optimization and cooperating distributed individuals/sub-populations with partial information for distributed optimization can be distilled. Noting that the latter is an emerging and attractive trend, a systematic definition of distributed optimization is given, including dimension distributed-, data distributed-, and objective distributed-optimization problems. Various DEC studies for these problems are surveyed. Furthermore, challenges, and potential research directions are discussed to enlighten the design of DEC and pave the way to future developments.},

  abstract     = {Histopathological images contain rich information that can be used to diagnose and monitor disease progression and to predict patient survival. Accurate morphological segmentation, in particular nuclear segmentation, of these images is a critical task, where many deep learning (DL) based methods have been widely used. This article provides a thorough review of these methods from three different aspects: nuclear semantic segmentation, nuclear instance segmentation, and joint nuclear segmentation and classification. It also summarizes the process of whole-slide image nuclear segmentation, followed by an extensive compilation of publicly available datasets and evaluation metrics that have been widely used to evaluate the DL based methods. Finally, the challenges and future directions in this field are discussed. This survey is expected to serve as a practical guide for researchers interested in using and improving DL-based models for histopathological nuclear segmentation.},

  abstract     = {The field of text-to-image generation has undergone significant advancements with the introduction of diffusion models. Nevertheless, the challenge of editing real images persists, as most methods are either computationally intensive or produce poor reconstructions. This paper introduces SAGE (Self-Attention Guidance for image Editing)—a novel technique leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for image editing. SAGE builds upon the DDIM algorithm and incorporates a novel guidance mechanism utilizing the self-attention layers of the diffusion U-Net. This mechanism computes a reconstruction objective based on attention maps generated during the inverse DDIM process, enabling efficient reconstruction of unedited regions without the need to precisely reconstruct the entire input image. Thus, SAGE directly addresses the key challenges in image editing. The superiority of SAGE over other methods is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations and confirmed by a statistically validated comprehensive user study, in which all 47 surveyed users preferred SAGE over competing methods. Additionally, SAGE ranks as the top-performing method in seven out of 10 quantitative analyses and secures second and third places in the remaining three.},
