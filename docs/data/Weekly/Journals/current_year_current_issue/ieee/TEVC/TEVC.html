It demonstrates that commonly used performance metrics do not properly account for such errors, and proposes two alternative performance metrics that do account for such errors by adapting the popular R2 and ${\mathrm { IGD}}^{+}$ metrics.},

Although they require different inputs (free-text versus input/output examples) their goal is the same—program synthesis. Therefore, in this work, we compare how well GitHub Copilot and GP perform on common program synthesis benchmark problems. We study the structure and diversity of the generated programs by using well-known software metrics. We find that GitHub Copilot and GP solve a similar number of benchmark problems (85.2% versus 77.8%, respectively). We find that GitHub Copilot generated smaller and less complex programs as GP, while GP is able to find new and unique problem solving strategies. This increase in diversity of solutions comes at a cost. When analyzing the success rates for 100 runs per problem, GitHub Copilot outperforms GP on over 50% of the problems.},

Constraint violation (CV) has been a building block in designing evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms for solving CMOPs. However, in certain scenarios, constraint functions might be unknown or inadequately defined, making CV unattainable and potentially misleading for the conventional constrained EMO algorithms. To address this issue, we present the first of its kind evolutionary optimization framework, inspired by the principles of the alternating direction method of multipliers that decouples objective and constraint functions. This framework tackles CMOPs with unknown constraints by reformulating the original problem into an additive form of two subproblems, each of which is allotted a dedicated evolutionary population. Notably, these two populations operate toward complementary evolutionary directions during their optimization processes. In order to minimize discrepancy, their evolutionary directions alternate, aiding the discovery of feasible solutions. Comparative experiments conducted against the five state-of-the-art constrained EMO algorithms on 120 benchmark test problem instances with varying properties as well as two real-world engineering optimization problems demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed framework. Its salient features include faster convergence and enhanced resilience to various Pareto front shapes.},

  abstract     = {Subset selection, a fundamental problem in various domains, is to choose a subset of elements from a large candidate set under a given objective or multiple objectives. Pareto optimization for subset selection (POSS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for addressing subset selection problems. Recently, some POSS variants have been proposed to further improve its performance. In this article, we propose a new POSS variant, named targeted POSS (TPOSS). TPOSS differs from POSS in four aspects: 1) problem formulation; 2) population initialization; 3) mutation; and 4) environmental selection. The main idea of TPOSS is to focus the search on the target region of subset selection with respect to the subset cardinality in order to improve the search efficiency. We conduct comprehensive experiments to compare TPOSS with six state-of-the-art algorithms on three subset selection tasks (i.e., sparse regression, unsupervised feature selection, and hypervolume subset selection) where the size of the candidate sets ranges from 20 to 400. Experimental results show that with respect to the objective value of the best feasible subset, TPOSS outperforms the other algorithms on all the three tasks, which suggests the potential of TPOSS to enhance subset selection in various domains.},

  abstract     = {Efficient truck dispatching is crucial for optimizing container terminal operations within dynamic and complex scenarios. Despite good progress being made recently with more advanced uncertainty-handling techniques, existing approaches still have generalization issues and require considerable expertise and manual interventions in algorithm design. In this work, we present deep reinforcement learning-assisted genetic programming hyper-heuristics (DRL-GPHHs) and their ensemble variant (DRL-GPEHH). These frameworks utilize a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to orchestrate a set of auto-generated genetic programming (GP) low-level heuristics, leveraging the collective intelligence, ensuring advanced robustness and an increased level of automation of the algorithm development. DRL-GPEHH, notably, excels through its concurrent integration of a GP heuristic ensemble, achieving enhanced adaptability and performance in complex, dynamic optimization tasks. This method effectively navigates traditional convergence issues of deep RL (DRL) in sparse reward and vast action spaces, while avoiding the reliance on expert-designed heuristics. It also addresses the inadequate performance of the single GP individual in varying and complex environments and preserves the inherent interpretability of the GP approach. Evaluations across various real port operational instances highlight the adaptability and efficacy of our frameworks. Essentially, innovations in DRL-GPHH and DRL-GPEHH reveal the synergistic potential of RL and GP in dynamic truck dispatching, yielding transformative impacts on algorithm design and significantly advancing solutions to complex real-world optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {In the design of multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithms, swarm leaders, i.e., the personal best (pbest) and global best (gbest), are expected to guide the particles toward Pareto-optimal solutions. However, most existing MOPSO algorithms focus on selecting such leaders from the archive of candidate solutions to approximate the Pareto front (PF) that may not yield good approximations of the Pareto set (PS). To address this challenge, this work proposes to predict both pbest and gbest for each particle by explicitly approximating the manifold structure of the PS, following the regularity property of multiobjective optimization problems. Thus, we design a leader prediction-based MOPSO (PPSO) algorithm. In our algorithm, a self-organizing mapping (SOM) method is adopted at each iteration to capture the manifold structure from the current swarm to predict leaders. Specifically, pbest is pinpointed by mapping the particle onto the neuron of SOM, while gbest is estimated by randomly selecting from the neighborhood neurons. In this way, the particles of a swarm in PPSO are guided by the predicted pbest and gbest to approximate the Pareto-optimal solutions. The developed PPSO is empirically verified with several representative algorithms, on several benchmark test instances and real-world problems. Experimental results have demonstrated the advantages of leader prediction for MOPSO over other approaches.},

Addressing these vulnerabilities is pivotal, leading to a significant area of study focused on developing attack algorithms capable of generating potent adversarial images. In scenarios where access to gradient information is restricted (black-box scenario), many existing methods introduce optimized perturbations to each individual pixels of an image to cause trained DNNs to misclassify. However, due to the high-dimensional nature of this approach, current methods have inherent limitations. In contrast, our proposed approach involves the construction of perturbations by concatenating a series of overlapping semi-transparent shapes. Through the optimization of these shapes’ characteristics, we generate perturbations that result in the desired misclassification by the DNN. By conducting a series of attacks on state-of-the-art DNNs trained of CIFAR-10 and Imagenet datasets, our method consistently outperforms existing attack algorithms in terms of both query efficiency and success rate.},

After formulating scheduling of medical tests as a distributed scheduling problem in heterogeneous, flexible job shop environment, we establish a mixed integer programming model to minimize mean test turnaround time. Preliminary landscape analysis sustains that these clinics-orientated scheduling instances are difficult to solve under the same search strategy. The search difficulty motivates the search for a syntactic problem solver where relatedness between domain’s syntactic features and search strategies help identify effective strategies. The challenge in designing a syntactic problem solver—which landscape features to choose as domain’s syntactic features to accurately reflect instance hardness under different search strategies—are addressed. Under various local search move operators, we investigate the changes in instance landscape structures and find that the single-move size for local search operators, local-global optima connectivity, landscape ruggedness, and plateau size fairly predict the efficacy of the local searches. The above relationship is refined into a deterministic association between instance size and local search, thereby forming the syntactic problem solver. When faced with new instances, the solver automatically instantiates the best local search algorithm for various scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed syntactic solver excels not only in clinical laboratory scheduling problems but also in publicly available benchmark.},

  abstract     = {There are many real-world applications with uncertainties that can be modeled as the dynamic interval multiobjective optimization problems (DI-MOPs). However, it is challenging for the traditional algorithms to converge rapidly before time-varying parameters change to obtain optimal solutions under interval objectives. So far, there is a lack of studies on the evaluation methods for interval optimal solutions in dynamic problems. Therefore, a fast evaluation framework is proposed in this article to tackle these issues. In this framework, we first derive a new hash function based on the Canberra distance and provide a theoretical proof of the validity and local sensitivity of the hash function, from which a Canberra locality sensitive hashing (CLSH) is constructed. The CLSH accelerates the search for interval evaluation objects in uncertain environments. Further, we propose an adaptive interval crowding distance (AICD) with relaxed constraints to obtain a global improvement in the quality of the solutions. The candidate solutions in the above framework are generated by the environment awareness and directed migration of the mutiobjective bacteria colony chemotaxis (MOBCC) algorithm. This complete algorithm is called the dynamic interval MOBCC (DI-MOBCC). In addition, the theoretical proofs of the validity and local sensitivity of hash functions are also provided. Computational results on the eight benchmark optimization problems and a path planning of the mobile robots in uncertain environments validate that the DI-MOBCC is more competitive than the other state of the art algorithms in tackling DI-MOPs.},

However, the search efficiency of these SAEAs is not yet satisfactory. More efforts are needed to further exploit useful information from the real FEs in order to better guide the search process. Facing this challenge, this article proposes a hyperbolic neural network (HNN)-based preselection operator to accelerate the optimization process based on the limited evaluated solutions. First, the preselection task is modeled as a multilabel classification problem where solutions are classified into different layers (ordinal categories) through the $\epsilon $ -relaxed objective aggregation. Second, in order to resemble the hierarchical structure of candidate solutions, a HNN is applied to tackle the multilabel classification problem. The reason for using HNN is that hyperbolic spaces more closely resemble hierarchical structures than the Euclidean spaces. Moreover, to alleviate the data deficiency issue, a data augmentation strategy is employed for training the HNN. In order to evaluate its performance, the proposed HNN-based preselection operator is embedded into two SAEAs. Experimental results on the two benchmark test suites and three real-world problems with up to 11 objectives and 150 decision variables involving seven state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Particularly, solution-based ESTO (S-ESTO) that transfers task solutions has been receiving much popularity due to its ease of implementation and optimizer independency. However, the existing S-ESTO algorithms put much emphasis on utilizing source optimized solutions standing for global search experience without being aware of the potential of intermediate solutions that represent local optimization experience. Besides, most of them cannot take full advantage of the solution data from evolutionary search. In the light of the above, this study aims to develop a global and local search experience-based solution transfer technique to maximally release the potential of optimization experience hidden in the source tasks. First, a novel transferability metric named landscape encoding-based rank correlation (LERC) is developed. Then, we propose to divide the optimization experience into two classes: 1) global and 2) local search experience. Accordingly, by instantiating LERC into global and local versions, we develop two distinct transfer methods to exploit the global and local search experience, respectively. Finally, by combining the two transfer methods, we propose an S-ESTO algorithm that can transfer the global and local search experience simultaneously for maximum performance enhancement for the target task. Experiments conducted on a set of benchmark problems and a practical case study verify the efficacy of the proposed methods. The source code of our algorithm is available athttps://github.com/ccm831143/GL-LERC.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of evolutionary multiobjective optimization, the hypervolume (HV) indicator serves as a crucial metric for assessing the quality of solution sets. Due to the high costs in HV computation, HV-based optimization algorithms always meet the challenge of finding a certain number of points in a given point set to maximize the HV indicator, especially when there are many objectives. In response, the greedy decremental algorithm for HV subset selection problem (gHSSD) has emerged as a noteworthy alternative. This article introduces a general algorithm for gHSSD, applicable in any dimensionality above two. The proposed algorithm leverages a space partition tree and incorporates a once-build-multiple-use strategy, effectively reducing time complexity. We prove that the proposed algorithm has a time complexity of $O((n-k+\sqrt {n})n^{{}({d-1}/{2})}\log n)$ where n is the number of points, k is the number of points to be reserved, and d the dimensionality. Theoretically, this complexity is competitive with the current best algorithms for $d=3, 4$ and better than them for all $5\le d\le 7$ . To validate our algorithm, we have conducted extensive tests on various random point sets and multiobjective optimization benchmarks. Experimental results suggest that our implementation is more efficient than or competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms on many instances as n increases for $d=3,4$ .},

  abstract     = {Point cloud registration (PCR) is an important task for other point cloud tasks. Feature-based methods are widely adopted for their speed and efficiency in PCR. The descriptive capability of features extracted by a single geometric descriptor is limited. Descriptive capabilities can be improved by concatenating features extracted from multiple descriptors. However, due to the existence of redundant and irrelevant features, the correct corresponding points are difficult to match, which further affects the registration effect. We propose an evolutionary multitasking point cloud descriptor optimization method. Integrate existing descriptors to optimize descriptors with stronger description ability. Labeling features to calculate the feature importance for the registration and generating multitasks. In optimized processing, approximate evaluation which is calculated by prior correspondence saved in the database replaces the expensive searching correspondences process in the entire point cloud. Finally, a multiscale filter is developed to remove error correspondences by the geometric information from multiple scale descriptor features. Experimental demonstrate that the proposed approach can optimize a feature subset with higher-descriptive capability compared to other methods and show superior PCR performance on 14 point cloud models. This is the first paper on point cloud descriptor optimization, which provides a new idea for PCR research.},

  abstract     = {Quality indicators play an essential role in evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO). Most likely the most often used quality indicator in EMO is hypervolume, due to its strict monotonicity with respect to the dominance relation. However, hypervolume is not free of some weak points. For example, a number of recent papers pointed out its high sensitivity to the specification of the reference point. Furthermore, hypervolume is based on fully geometric reasoning which may lead to some undesired results. Thus, it is worth to consider also other quality indicators. In this article, we prove that another well-known $R2$ quality indicator is also strictly monotonic with respect to the dominance relation when calculated exactly and the reference point strongly dominates any solution in the evaluated set. Furthermore, we adapt the improved quick hypervolume algorithm to the exact calculation of $R2$ indicator. To our knowledge, this is the first exact algorithm for $R2$ calculation with publicly available implementation. In addition, through both theoretical analysis and computational experiments, we show that $R2$ performs consistently for Pareto fronts with different shapes. We discuss also differences of Pareto fronts representations generated by an indicator-based EMO with hypervolume and $R2$ , where the latter tends to generate solutions having a high chance to be preferred by the decision maker, not necessarily uniformly distributed in geometric sense. All of these results make $R2$ a sound alternative or a complement to hypervolume in EMO.},

The optimization performance of the algorithm decreases due to the negative transfer when the number of tasks is large.

First, the bi-space similarity metric is designed to characterize intertask similarity quantitatively. The decision space similarity and objective space similarity are considered simultaneously in the bi-space similarity metric. Second, a task selection strategy based on evolutionary state is proposed to select the optimal source task from the source task library accurately. The source task library based on bi-space similarity metric is built for storing source tasks. Finally, a dynamic knowledge transfer strategy is proposed to improve the efficiency of knowledge positive transfer in the many-task optimization. Parameters of the knowledge transfer strategy are adjusted according to bi-space similarity metric adaptively. In addition, the experimental results show that MaTDE-BSS is able to evaluate the intertask similarity more comprehensively.

  abstract     = {Most of the current research on dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) assumes that environmental changes can be detectable. However, undetectable changes are frequently encountered in real-world applications, which pose a serious challenge for the existing methods. Because undetectable changes can lead to the failure of change detection techniques, thereby making it difficult to adapt to environmental changes for most algorithms. Therefore, to effectively deal with DMOPs with undetectable changes, this work proposes a dual mutation-based dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (DM-DMOEA). The proposed DM-DMOEA incorporates the following two main components. First, based on the exploration level of the population, an adaptive selection strategy is proposed, which enables the adaptive identification of individuals for mutation. Second, a dual mutation scheme is developed, utilizing both the polynomial mutation and the Gaussian mutation. These mutation operations are applied on the selected individuals to generate the mutated individuals, allowing for diverse exploration in the search space. After conducting the above two strategies, the population will evolve by the evolutionary criterion of multiobjective optimization. As a result, the algorithm can effectively adapt to undetectable changes in the environment. Comprehensive empirical studies are conducted on different benchmark functions and a real-world application to evaluate the performance of DM-DMOEA. Experimental results have demonstrated that DM-DMOEA is competitive in tracking the Pareto front over time when facing undetectable changes.},

  abstract     = {Since severe environmental problem in manufacturing industries is becoming increasingly prominent, energy-efficient production scheduling has gained more and more attentions. This article studies an energy-efficient distributed fuzzy hybrid blocking flow-shop scheduling problem (EEDFHBFSP), where processing time and setup time are uncertain. The objective is to minimize fuzzy makespan and total fuzzy energy consumption simultaneously. To solve such problem, a mixed-integer linear programming model is first presented to format it. Then, a meta-Q-learning-based multiobjective metaheuristic (MQL-MM) is proposed. In MQL-MM, a machine-position-based dispatch rule is designed as the decoding scheme. A decomposition-based constructive heuristic (DCH) is employed to generate the initial population with high quality and diversity. Several problem-specific search operators are developed to explore and exploit the solution space. A meta-Q-learning-based multiobjective search framework is presented to guide the using of search operators, which includes a meta-training phase and an adaptive search phase. The meta-training phase is employed to train the search operators to construct the Q-learning model. The adaptation search phase utilizes such model to conduct the automatic selection of the search operators. Moreover, an energy-saving strategy is designed to improve the candidate solutions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results show that the designs of MQL-MM are effective, and MQL-MM performs better than several well-performing methods on solving EEDFHBFSP.},

Three core search components and an evaluation component are proposed in BBCEA, which are crafted to be problem-specific. In the exploration search component, a probability model sampling method and crossover collaborate to generate offspring with high quality and diversity. In the exploitation search component, five knowledge-based operators collaborate with a knowledge-guided operator selection strategy, which is designed by fully utilizing the problem properties and feedback information. In the exact search component, a branch-and-bound method is designed to solve the bottom layer subproblem precisely, which can greatly improve the effectiveness of the algorithm. In the evaluation component, a look-up table method is proposed to reduce computation effort by avoiding duplicate calculations. Numerical experimental results validate the superiority of the BBCEA in addressing the HSSWH, which can obtain the best solution on 95% of the instances compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

In CPPD, when comparing two solutions, in terms of each original objective, we design a new objective for each solution, which is the negative product of two probabilities calculated based on the predicted fitness mean values and uncertainty information provided by Kriging models: 1) the probability that this solution satisfies all constraints, denoted as Probability of Feasibility (PoF) and 2) the probability that this solution is better than the other on the original objective, denoted as PoB. It is evident that for each solution, PoF and PoB indicate its feasibility and its optimality on the corresponding original objective, respectively. Then, Pareto dominance based on new objectives is executed. As a result, both competitive feasible solutions and promising infeasible solutions with good diversity can be preserved by CPPD. These two kinds of solutions can help the population to exploit the located feasible parts and to explore new feasible parts, respectively. Further, based on CPPD, we develop a Pareto-based Kriging-assisted constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (called PEA) to deal with expensive CMOPs with two or three objectives. Finally, PEA is generalized to solve expensive constrained many-objective optimization problems, named $\textrm {PEA}^{+}$ . The effectiveness of CPPD, PEA, and $\textrm {PEA}^{+}$ is verified by comprehensive experiments.},

  abstract     = {Symbolic regression (SR) searches for analytic expressions that accurately describe studied phenomena. The main promise of this approach is that it may return an interpretable model that can be insightful to users, while maintaining high accuracy. The current standard for benchmarking these algorithms is SRBench, which evaluates methods on hundreds of datasets that are a mix of real-world and simulated processes spanning multiple domains. At present, the ability of SRBench to evaluate interpretability is limited to measuring the size of expressions on real-world data, and the exactness of model forms on synthetic data. In practice, model size is only one of many factors used by subject experts to determine how interpretable a model truly is. Furthermore, SRBench does not characterize algorithm performance on specific, challenging subtasks of regression, such as feature selection and evasion of local minima. In this work, we propose and evaluate an approach to benchmarking SR algorithms that addresses these limitations of SRBench by 1) incorporating expert evaluations of interpretability on a domain-specific task, and 2) evaluating algorithms over distinct properties of data science tasks. We evaluate 12 modern SR algorithms on these benchmarks and present an in-depth analysis of the results, discuss current challenges of SR algorithms and highlight possible improvements for the benchmark itself.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) are often scaled to large-scale scenarios in real-world applications, which inevitably must face the triple challenges of massive search space, dynamic environmental changes and multiobjective conflicts simultaneously. This article proposes an adversarial autoencoder-based large-scale dynamic multiobjective evolutionary framework. It integrates deep generative modeling techniques and large-scale multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (LMOEAs) to solve large-scale DMOPs effectively and efficiently. Specifically, an adversarial autoencoder-based deep generative network training architecture is proposed for high-dimensional decision variables in large-scale DMOPs. It can transfer a generative model trained on Pareto-optimal solutions in the current environment to a new environment using only the auxiliary information exhibited through the movement trajectories of historical Pareto-optimal solutions, resulting in the generation of quality initial populations for the new environment. Meanwhile, any proven LMOEA can be integrated into the proposed framework without extensive modifications. Experimental results on a typical dynamic multiobjective test suite with problem settings from 30 to 1000 dimensions demonstrate that the optimization performance of the proposed framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art designs. Especially in large-scale scenarios, the proposed framework is considered superior in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This article examines various methods of computing uncertainty and diversity for active learning in genetic programming. We found that the model population in genetic programming can be exploited to select informative training data points by using a model ensemble combined with an uncertainty metric. We explored several uncertainty metrics and found that differential entropy performed the best. We also compared two data diversity metrics and found that correlation as a diversity metric performs better than minimum Euclidean distance, although there are some drawbacks that prevent correlation from being used on all problems. Finally, we combined uncertainty and diversity using a Pareto optimization approach to allow both to be considered in a balanced way to guide the selection of informative and unique data points for training.},

  abstract     = {With increasing energy concerns and development of globalization, energy-aware scheduling and distributed scheduling have become significant topics in modern manufacturing. However, realistic manufacturing scenarios, such as collaborative scheduling of distributed shops and limited transportation resources, are rarely taken into account. To bridge the gap, this article addresses the energy-aware distributed flexible job-shop with transportation constraints (EDFJSP-T) and proposes a feedback learning-based memetic algorithm (FLMA) to minimize makespan and total energy consumption simultaneously. First, a mathematical model is formulated to represent the relationship between different subproblems. Additionally, an encoding and decoding method based on forward insertion is designed to reduce the search space and obtain high-quality schedules. Second, various problem-specific operators are designed to focus on different subproblems and objectives to enrich search patterns. Third, memetic search with feedback learning is proposed via introducing observer indexes for both population state and individual state to adaptively match appropriate operators for individuals. Besides, local intensification search with multiple operators is incorporated for low-density regions to further improve exploitation ability. The parameter setting is investigated and experimental tests are carried out using different types of instances. The comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the feedback learning mechanism and the superiority of the FLMA over existing algorithms for solving the EDFJSP-T.},

In this article, we first introduce a new set of HDB-MOPs characterized by various shapes of Pareto fronts and scalable HDB sizes. We then systematically analyze the capabilities of several representative existing MOEAs in handling HDB-MOPs and reveal their strengths and weaknesses in solving this type of problem.

  abstract     = {Data-efficient image classification, which focuses on achieving accurate classification performance with limited labeled data, has garnered significant attention. Genetic programming (GP) has achieved impressive progress in image classification, particularly in scenarios involving small amounts of labeled data. GP research typically focuses on designing tree-based model representations to learn useful image features for classification. However, most GP methods are proposed for gray-scale images and ignore the color features. Furthermore, the existing GP methods typically learn features on a single scale/resolution, restricting potential accuracy enhancements. To address these issues, this article proposes a new multitree GP representation for image feature learning and classification. In each individual, three trees are included to extract discriminative features from the red, green, and blue channels of the image. With the new image resizing layer in the tree representation, the proposed approach can achieve multiscale feature extraction, i.e., flexibly learning fine-grained details and coarse-grained structures in the image, improving the classification performance. In addition, since a limitation of GP is premature convergence due to a decline in population diversity, this article develops a hybrid parent selection method consisting of tournament and lexicase selection to increase population diversity, find the best individual, and improve classification accuracy. The experiments on six image classification datasets indicate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art neural network-based and GP-based methods in almost all comparisons. Further analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and the potentially high interpretability of the proposed approach.},

However, most of them are tailored for inexpensive optimization problems. Extending variable grouping method to expensive optimization problems poses many challenges. One of the greatest challenges is that most grouping approaches require additional function evaluations (FEs) to discover interactions among decision variables, which is intolerable for expensive optimization problems as it incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address this issue, an adaptive variable grouping method is proposed in this article, which can achieve relatively accurate grouping results without additional FE consumption. Specifically, variables are grouped based on the contrasts between well-converged solutions and poorly converged solutions. Furthermore, the grouping scheme is adjusted dynamically during the optimization process to improve the grouping accuracy. Besides, an adaptive environmental selection-based sampling strategy is suggested, which attempts to provide the currently required solutions for reevaluation according to the demands of different optimization stages. The proposed algorithm is compared with the other five state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms on both benchmark and real-world problems. The experimental results demonstrate the promising performance and the superior computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm in tackling high-dimensional expensive multiobjective optimization problems.},

Even though ML models, such as neural networks (NNs), have been shown to identify faults effectively, root cause identification (RCI) is becoming more difficult due to their black-box structures and the tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. In order to improve performance while maintaining interpretability, we propose a new framework named Feature Extraction for finding Root causes for Manufacturing Applications with Tree-based algorithms (FERMAT), which enhances the performance of height-limited decision trees (DTs) (C4.5) through dimensionally aware genetic programming for feature extraction. Especially in FERMAT, only interpretable features are extracted to prevent DTs from delivering uninterpretable expressions to practitioners. In the present study, FERMAT’s applicability to RCI was verified with both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing datasets with different imbalance ratios. The experimental results showed that FERMAT outperformed the other single-tree-based models by extracting good features and delivered performance comparable to the black-box models.},

Despite empirical success, the theoretical study of these methods remains difficult. In this work, we introduce a new framework, based on divergence-decrease conditions, to study and design black-box global optimization algorithms. Our approach allows to establish and quantify the improvement of sampling distributions at each iteration, in terms of expected value or quantile of the objective. We show that the information-geometric optimization approach fits within our framework, yielding a new approach for its analysis. We also establish sampling distribution improvement results for two novel algorithms, one related with the cross-entropy approach with mixture models, and another one using heavy-tailed sampling distributions.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is a very important technique for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, as successfully selecting informative features can significantly increase the learning performance while reducing the computational cost. However, most of the existing FS methods tend to treat the HSI as a whole for FS, which does not fully consider the unique characteristics of HSIs and disregards the fact that different feature classes possess varying preferences for features. Thus, this article proposes a superpixel segmentation-based evolutionary multitasking (EMT) algorithm for FS of HSIs, called SS-EMT. First, the superpixel segmentation method is used to partition the original HSI into several superpixel blocks, which can preserve well the information of different classes of the original image. Second, in order to explore each superpixel block efficiently, an EMT algorithm using particle swarm optimization is designed, which treats each superpixel block as a subtask and then optimizes these subtasks collaboratively by transferring useful knowledge among related subtasks. In addition, a new individual evaluation mechanism is devised to obtain multiple high-quality feature subsets with different numbers of features simultaneously in a single run, thus reducing the computational cost. Finally, extensive experimental results on four common HSI datasets under three classifiers validate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art FS methods.},

To solve this problem and further balance the objective optimization and constraint satisfaction, we propose an indexes-based and partial restart-based constrained multiobjective optimization (IRCMO) algorithm. In IRCMO, a two-stage (i.e., development and enhancement) and tri-population framework is designed. IRCMO adopts the aggregative indexes-based evaluation and adaptive collaborative partial restart strategy to assist the evolution of the first and second populations. The third population is obtained by directed sampling, which is mostly located at the boundary of the feasible region and enhances the exploration ability of extreme solutions. At the end of each generation, a progressive dual-archive strategy is designed to screen the solutions distributed uniformly from three populations. Experimental results demonstrate that IRCMO is superior to the other six state-of-the-art CMOEAs on several constraint benchmark suites and real-world problems.},

With few parameters and fast search, particle swarm optimizer (PSO) variants that have certain grouping capability have been applied to address multisource location problems (MSLPs) by dividing a swarm such that every source has robots to locate. However, they are difficult to predetermine the exact number of groups, require a big number of robots, and are easily trapped in the no-signal areas when the proportion of no-signal areas is high. This work proposes a virtual-source and virtual-swarm-based PSO (VVPSO) to divide a search area into multiple cells equally, each of which has a virtual source in its center. Then, instead of robots grouping, only one group of robots is employed to traverse all virtual sources, and search their corresponding cells to locate real sources by a new PSO called real-virtual mapping PSO (RMPSO). RMPSO asymmetrically maps a robot into a particle swarm with multiple virtual particles to perform PSO, which greatly reduces the requirements for the number of robots. Experimental results show that VVPSO has great search scalability and can solve large-scale MSLPs than two state-of-the-art grouping methods and three representative multimodal PSO variants, even with only one robot. Hence, this work greatly advances the field of multisource location by using mobile robot swarm.},

To alleviate this challenge, this article proposes a DMOEA with a learnable prediction for tackling DMOPs. Specifically, a neural network is designed to effectively capture diverse change patterns of the environment. Based on the change patterns learned, a directional improvement prediction (DIP) is developed to guide the evolutionary search toward promising directions in the decision space. In this way, a superior initial population with good convergence and diversity is predicted by DIP, which can be more effective for solving various DMOPs. Comprehensive empirical studies show that the proposed DIP is effective and the proposed algorithm has some advantages over five competitive DMOEAs when solving three commonly used benchmarks and one real-world problem.},

  abstract     = {In recent decades, various surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been proposed to solve computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problems (EMOPs). Nevertheless, designing an SAEA to handle high-dimensional EMOPs and balance convergence, diversity, and computational complexity remains challenging. Here, we propose a two-phase SAEA (TP-SAEA), which follows the idea of convergence first and diversity second, for solving high-dimensional EMOPs. In Phase I, a surrogate-assisted problem reformulation method is proposed to fast-track the Pareto optimal set in association with some reference solutions. Specifically, the high-dimensional EMOP is reformulated into an expensive single-objective one with low-dimensional decision space. Then, the surrogate-assisted optimization is utilized to obtain well-converged solutions. In Phase II, the high-dimensional EMOP is decomposed into two subproblems to explore subregions of the decision space that can effectively promote the diversity of the solutions. The two subproblems are optimized independently via surrogate-assisted optimization, aiming to push the population toward different regions of the Pareto optimal front. Experiments are conducted on EMOPs with 100 to 500 decision variables compared with four state-of-the-art SAEAs. The proposed TP-SAEA obtains well-converged and diverse solutions with only 509 real function evaluations. Moreover, its superiority is examined in six real-world instances with up to 12 000 decision variables.},

  abstract     = {Distributed optimization has attracted lots of attention in recent years. Thanks to the intrinsic parallelism and great search capacity, evolutionary computation (EC) has the potential for black-box and nonconvex distributed optimization. However, due to the decentralization of local objective functions, it is challenging to optimize the global objective function with efficient communication and guaranteed system consensus. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multiagent swarm optimization method with adaptive internal and external learning (MASOIE). In MASOIE, each agent evolves a swarm of particles by internal learning and external learning. Internal learning enables agents to optimize their local objectives, while external learning enables agents to cooperate to achieve a consensus toward the global objective. To improve the consensus ability, we design a special velocity setting of external learning for particle evolution. We provide the theoretical analysis of the system consensus of deterministic MASOIE. To improve communication efficiency, we design an adaptive communication mechanism to adjust the communication interval, enabling agents to explore at the early stage and reach system consensus at the later stage. Empirical studies show that the proposed algorithm achieves stable consensus performance, competitive solution quality and lower communication cost on benchmark functions compared with existing black-box distributed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Recent theoretical works have shown that the NSGA-II efficiently computes the full Pareto front when the population size is large enough. In this work, we study how well it approximates the Pareto front when the population size is smaller. For the OneMinMax benchmark, we point out situations in which the parents and offspring cover well the Pareto front, but the next population has large gaps on the Pareto front. Our mathematical proofs suggest as reason for this undesirable behavior that the NSGA-II in the selection stage computes the crowding distance once and then removes individuals with smallest crowding distance without considering that a removal increases the crowding distance of some individuals. We then analyse two variants not prone to this problem. For the NSGA-II that updates the crowding distance after each removal [Kukkonen and Deb (2006)] and the steady-state NSGA-II [Nebro and Durillo (2009)], we prove that the gaps in the Pareto front are never more than a small constant factor larger than the theoretical minimum. This is the first mathematical work on the approximation ability of the NSGA-II and the first runtime analysis for the steady-state NSGA-II. Experiments also show the superior approximation ability of the two NSGA-II variants.},

The analysis is based on the established dynamical systems approach. To this end, the self-adaptation response (SAR) function is derived in the limit of large populations, which are necessary to achieve high success rates. Furthermore, steady-state conditions on Rastrigin are discussed and compared to the sphere function. Then, a relation for the learning parameter $\tau $ is derived to tune the sampling process of the self-adaptive ES, improving its efficiency on Rastrigin. The obtained result is compared to default $\tau $ -values. Furthermore, expected runtime experiments are conducted varying $\tau $ and population parameters of the ES. Theoretical and experimental results regarding $\tau $ are compared in terms of efficiency and robustness showing good agreement.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) with a changing number of objectives (NObjs) may have Pareto-optimal set (PS) manifold expanding or contracting over time. Knowledge transfer has been used for solving DMOPs, since it can transfer useful information from solving one problem instance to solve another related problem instance. However, we show that the state-of-the-art transfer approach based on heuristic lacks diversity on problem with extremely strong bias and loses convergence on problems with multimodality and variable correlation, after the NObjs increases and decreases, respectively. Therefore, we propose a novel transfer strategy based on learning, called learning to expand and contract PS (denoted as LEC) for enhancing diversity and convergence after NObj increases and decreases, respectively. It first learns potentially good directions for expansion and contraction separately via principal component analysis. Then, the most promising expansion and contraction directions are selected from their candidates according to whether they help diversity and convergence, respectively. Finally, PS is learned to be expanded and contracted based on these most promising directions. Comprehensive studies using 13 DMOP benchmarks with a changing NObjs demonstrate that our proposed LEC is effective on improving solution quality, not only right after changes but also after optimization of different generations, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained image classification (FGIC) is an important computer vision task with many real-world applications. However, FGIC is challenging due to intraclass variations and interclass similarities, especially when there is limited training data. To address these challenges, a new genetic programming approach with flexible region detection (GP-RD), is proposed for different FGIC tasks, i.e., flower and fish classification tasks. The proposed GP-RD approach can automatically highlight the object, detect regions of interest, extract effective features, and combine global, local, and/or color features for classification. The performance of GP-RD is evaluated on flower and fish classification tasks within the FGIC domain, utilizing datasets with varying classes. In comparison with seven benchmark methods, GP-RD achieves significantly better performance in most comparisons. Further analysis demonstrates the interpretability, effectiveness, and efficiency of the proposed approach.},
