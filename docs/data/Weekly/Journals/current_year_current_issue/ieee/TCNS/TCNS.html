In the proposed model, the intrapopulation dynamics is given by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and the strategic interaction occurs among agents who are homogeneous within the same population. A stochastic aggregative game takes place in the intrapopulation game problem. The interpopulation dynamics is given by the aggregative behavior of each population and an ordinary differential equation (ODE). The other strategic interaction occurs among different heterogeneous populations in either a noncooperative or cooperative way. In addition, the interaction for the different populations is performed in a distributed manner over a graph that might also be considered time-varying. We provideconditions to compute the solution by means of dynamic programming, and providesemi-explicit solutions for the linear-quadratic case by solving the emerging Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman partial differential equation (PDE) and postulating an appropriate ansatz for the value functional. A numerical example illustrates the presented results.},

  abstract     = {In transmission networks, power flows and network topology are deeply intertwined due to power flow physics. Recent literature shows that a specific more hierarchical network structure can effectively inhibit the propagation of line failures across the entire system. In particular, a novel approach named tree partitioning has been proposed, which seeks to bolster the robustness of power networks through strategic alterations in network topology, accomplished via targeted line-switching actions. Several tree-partitioning problem formulations have been proposed by considering different objectives, among which power flow disruption and network congestion. Furthermore, various heuristic methods based on a two-stage and recursive approach have been proposed. The present work provides a general framework for tree-partitioning problems based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). In particular, we present a novel MILP formulation to optimally solve tree-partitioning problems and also propose a two-stage heuristic based on MILP. We perform extensive numerical experiments to solve two tree-partitioning problem variants, demonstrating the excellent performance of our solution methods. Lastly, through exhaustive cascading failure simulations, we compare the effectiveness of various tree-partitioning strategies and show that, on average, they can achieve a substantial reduction in lost load compared to the original topologies.},

  abstract     = {Assuming agents possess sensing capabilities and dynamics relative to their body coordinate frames, this article addresses a displacement-based strategy for discrete-time formation control through attitude synchronization. Unlike the Eulerian approximation, the first challenge lies in developing discrete-time models that capture both position and attitude motions, thereby complementing existing continuous-time systems with a discretized version. Then, two leader-following control protocols are designed, incorporating a jointly connected topology to relax the connectivity requirements. The analysis of these systems often relies on the Lyapunov function, the existence of which may be hard to guarantee. Consequently, the geometric properties of several polytopes are explored under the dynamic topologies and time-varying parameters. By extending the ergodicity results to leader-following scenarios, these properties are characterized as positively invariant sets. This invariance, which is independent of the existence of the Lyapunov function or the solvability of its associated criteria, provides a beneficial tool for analyzing time-variant systems. Utilizing this invariance and some mathematical techniques, the desired formation shape can be achieved in cases where the attitudes of the followers synchronize with the leader. Finally, a numerical simulation validates the results.},

The normally radial (tree) topology of a distribution network induces a spatially recursive structure in ac power flow, which enables a class of efficient solution methods—backward/forward sweep (BFS). In this article, we revisit BFS from the perspective of its convergence, which was rarely addressed before. We introduce three variants of BFS algorithms: the first one calculates voltages and line currents in a single-phase network model; the second algorithm extends the first one to an unbalanced three-phase network with $Y$ and $\Delta$ configurations; the third one calculates voltages and line power flows in the classical dist-flow model. We prove a sufficient condition, under which the first algorithm is a contraction mapping on a closed set of voltages and thus converges geometrically to a unique solution. This proof is extended to the second algorithm for three-phase networks. We then use the monotone convergence theorem to prove convergence of the third algorithm. We verify the convergence conditions, solution accuracy, and computational efficiency of BFS algorithms through simulations in IEEE test systems.},

Due to resource limitations or defensive countermeasures, the adversary can only modify data packets transmitted through unreliable channels. Meanwhile, the attack should be synthesized with sophistication to deceive an anomaly detector. To investigate the vulnerabilities of such estimation systems without feedback links and enhance security performance, the optimal attack policy is derived by formulating and explicitly solving a convex optimization problem, with the goal of maximizing the sum of estimation errors. Subsequently, a novel attack detection and resilient state estimation algorithm is proposed to ensure an acceptable level of estimation accuracy.

Existing literature on the design of ETSs for packet drops deals with the issue of non-Gaussianity of the a posteriori distribution in the system state. On the one hand, the Gaussian assumption only derives an approximate result, while on the other hand, exact results can be obtained by numerical integration but with excessive computational complexity. To this end, in this article, we propose a stochastic ETS based on acknowledgment information for remote state estimation with smart sensors and packet drops. The transmission decision is jointly driven by the holding time at the remote end and the accumulated innovative information. Then, we inductively derive the exact probability density function of the augmented innovative information vector by the Bayesian rule, which is used to obtain the explicit form of the estimation error covariance. These exact theoretical results mean that the design of scheduling parameter sequences no longer relies on experience. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate that the empirical results agree with the theoretical results.},

Auxiliary variables are constructed to seek the NE point within the prescribed time and serve as reference signals for the tracking control part. Then, state feedback control is designed to drive the strategies of all the players to the expected NE point in the prescribed time. Furthermore, the approximation theory is introduced to deal with unknown nonlinear uncertainties. Exponential parameters are involved in the designed estimates to accelerate the convergence rate. The Lyapunov method is utilized to show the prescribed-time convergence property of the algorithms.

The gradient estimations easily become biased, for example, when gradients are compressed or clipped, when data are shuffled, and in meta-learning and reinforcement learning. In this work, we establish worst-case bounds on parallel momentum methods under biased gradient estimation on both general nonconvex and $\mu$-Polyak–Łojasiewicz problems. Our analysis covers general distributed optimization problems, and we work out the implications for special cases where gradient estimates are biased, i.e., in meta-learning and when the gradients are compressed or clipped.

In this work, we present primal decomposition schemes for hierarchically structured strongly convex quadratic programs. These schemes offer high degrees of feasibility in a small number of iterations in combination with global convergence guarantees. We benchmark their performance against the centralized off-the-shelf interior-point solver Ipopt and ADMM on problems with up to 300 000 decision variables and constraints. We find that the proposed approaches solve problems as fast as Ipopt, but with reduced communication and without requiring a full model exchange.

  abstract     = {In this article, a unified influence network model incorporating differential privacy mechanisms (DPMs), called the differentially private opinion dynamics (DPODs) model, is proposed. In this model, each individual uses protected opinions rather than the private opinions of his/her neighbors to update his/her private opinions, where the protected opinion of an individual is a blend of private opinions and random noise following Laplace distribution. Building on stochastic analysis techniques and matrix theory, we show that the influence network under consideration converges under specific conditions governing individual sensitivities and interaction weights. In addition, the statistical properties related to convergence accuracy are established by utilizing the Markov inequality to estimate a lower bound on the probability of all individuals' final opinions converging to a neighborhood formed by their initial opinions' convex hull. We further conduct a differential privacy analysis to validate the efficacy of the proposed DPMs in safeguarding the private opinions of all individuals. Finally, two examples, including one of the Karate-Club networks, are provided to shed new light on the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Multiagent consensus algorithms have emerged as foundational tools across a spectrum of applications, and matrix-weighted consensus ones are capable of characterizing cross-dimensional interdependence. Yet, their potential is often shadowed by a pressing concern: the privacy of agents' initial values, which frequently represent sensitive data or proprietary information. A computationally light privacy-preserving mechanism for matrix-weighted average consensus (MAC) algorithms is proposed in response to the concern of agents' privacy. In the mechanism, agents' states are first perturbed and then multiplied by the matrix weights before being sent to their neighbors. Both the perturbation and the matrix weight are neighbor-dependent, i.e., they may be selected to be different for different neighbors, and they can be selected independently to mask the true state of an agent. The proposed mechanism can simultaneously guarantee the privacy of initial values and accurate average consensus. The additional computational burden that an agent bears is only the addition of vectors in the same dimension as its state compared to the original MAC algorithm. Through practical case studies with a peer-to-peer transactive energy system, we demonstrate the tangible implications of safeguarding initial value privacy with the proposed mechanism.},

  abstract     = {We introduce an innovative approach for analyzing strategic interactions in transportation networks featuring mobility-on-demand (MoD) services. This study focuses on achieving company–traveler equilibria, whereby a single company optimizes pricing and routing decisions to maximize profitability while considering travelers' mode choices, modeled via a multinomial logit model (MNL). Although profit maximization problems have been extensively studied in the field of revenue management across various domains, their application to transportation networks poses unique challenges, such as the influence of network topology and additional constraints (e.g., flow conservation, rebalancing, etc.). To address the inherent nonlinear relationship arising from endogenous travel demand, we shift our domain space from price to market share. Subsequently, we derive prices using a direct one-to-one correspondence within the MNL. This work is the first effort in leveraging such novel techniques in the context of transportation network analysis. Remarkably, the proposed reformulation results in an equivalent problem exhibiting convexity, offering computational efficiency and interpretability. By solving the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, we characterize user equilibrium with the generalized route cost, which incorporates the operating cost by rebalancing and travelers' disutility caused by congestion. Our approach is empirically validated through a numerical analysis conducted on the widely recognized Sioux Falls network. The results underscore the effectiveness and practical applicability of our method in analyzing transportation networks featuring MoD services and open the stage for important future investigations.},

  abstract     = {External disturbances and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks pose significant challenges to the quantized control of multiagent systems (MASs). Most of the existing quantized control strategies primarily focus on designing scaling factors and constructing auxiliary systems without considering external disturbances. Note that these strategies require a highly accurate system model and will lead to the saturation of the quantizer if there exist external disturbances. To overcome the aforementioned shortcomings, a new scaling function is developed in this article by incorporating robustness factors into the scaling function design, significantly enhancing the robustness of the quantization mechanism. Based on this, a robust quantized control strategy is designed to achieve the bounded consensus of linear MASs in the presence of disturbance and DoS attacks, where the tradeoff among quantization level, consensus performance, and resilience to DoS attacks is explored. Besides, the robust design framework shows significant flexibility and efficiency in addressing the resilient control of nonlinear MASs subject to DoS attacks.

Each agent in a multiagent system (MAS) is equipped with a timer mechanism that generates intermittent measurement and control update events, which may occur asynchronously between agents. Between consecutive event times, as determined by the corresponding timer mechanism, the controller of each agent is held constant. These controllers are shown to drive the configuration of the MAS into a neighborhood of the set of centroidal Voronoi configurations, i.e., the minimizers of the standard locational cost. The combination of continuous-time dynamics with intermittently updated control inputs is modeled as a hybrid system. The coverage objective is posed as a set attractivity problem for hybrid systems, where an invariance-based convergence analysis yields sufficient conditions that ensure maximal solutions of the hybrid system asymptotically converge to a desired set.

  abstract     = {The optimal power flow (OPF) problem is one of the most fundamental problems in power system operations. The nonlinear ac power flow equations that model different physical laws (together with operational constraints) lay the foundation for the feasibility region of the OPF problem. While significant research has focused on convex relaxations, which are approaches to solve an OPF problem by enlarging the true feasibility region, the opposite approach of convex restrictions offers valuable insights as well. Convex restrictions, including polyhedral restrictions, reduce the true feasible region to a convex region, ensuring that it contains only feasible points. In this work, we develop a sequential optimization method that offers a scalable way to obtain (bounds on) solutions to OPF problems for distribution networks. To do so, we first develop sufficient conditions for the existence of feasible power flow solutions in the neighborhood of a specific (feasible) operating point in distribution networks; second, based on these conditions, we construct a polyhedral restriction of the feasibility region. Our numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the sequential optimization method as an alternative to existing approaches to obtain (bounds on) solutions to OPF problems for distribution networks. By construction, the optimization problems within the defined restrictions can be solved in polynomial time and are guaranteed to have feasible solutions.},

The serial consensus design will guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system under the minimum requirement of the underlying communication graph containing a directed spanning tree, which is not generally true for conventional consensus. As our main result, we show that the serial consensus design gives bounds on the worst-case transient behavior of the formation, which is independent of the number of vehicles and the underlying graph structure. In particular, this shows that the serial consensus design guarantees the string stability of the formation and is, therefore, suitable for directed formations and communication topologies. We show that serial consensus can be implemented through message passing or measurements to neighbors at most two hops away. We illustrate our results through numerical examples.},

Although this problem has been studied in the literature, existing research has some limitations. This article presents two new theoretical results that address these limitations: the synthesis of unrealistic high-gain control parameters due to the lack of a systematic way to incorporate the lower and upper bounds on the control parameters, and the performance sensitivity to the communication delay due to inaccurate Taylor series approximation. To be more precise, taking advantage of the well-known Padé approximation, this article proposes a constrained CAV platoon controller synthesis that systematically incorporates the lower and upper bounds on the control parameters, and significantly improves the performance sensitivity to the communication delay. The effectiveness of the presented results is verified through conducting extensive numerical simulations. The proposed controller effectively attenuates the stop-and-go disturbance—a single cycle of deceleration followed by acceleration—amplification throughout the mixed platoon (consisting of CAVs and human-driven vehicles). Modern transportation systems will benefit from the proposed CAV controls in terms of effective disturbance attenuation as it will potentially reduce collisions.},

Different from existing algorithms that neglect adaptive momentum methods, the Q-DADAM algorithm incorporates these adaptive momentum methods, contributing to improved convergence and superior performance. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the Q-DADAM algorithm with appropriate step size and quantization level can reduce communication traffic and achieve sublinear dynamic regret. Simulation experiments validate the practicality and effectiveness of the Q-DADAM algorithm.

  abstract     = {It has long posed a challenging task to optimally deploy multiagent systems (MASs) to cooperatively coverage poriferous environments in real cooperative detection applications. In response to this challenge, this article proposes a hierarchical coverage control (HCC) protocol for MASs to perform sector-based coverage operations. First, a distributed Voronoi partition-based sweep-and-assign protocol, combined with a sectorial partition method, is developed, enabling the segmentation of a whole poriferous region into multiple sectorial sub-subregions. Following this procedure, an extreme search scheme is developed to determine the optimal amount of agents for each subregion. After this allocation, a distributed controller is proposed to deploy the agents, considering nonholonomic constraints, into designated niche positions. In addition, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the asymptotical stability of the present HCC. The analytical challenge of the present study stems from the nonconvex characteristics inherent in the loss function induced by porous environments. This nonconvexity renders the task of globally optimizing the assignment of MASs intractable. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the present coverage control approach.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates a distributed time-varying optimization problem with inequality constraints, aiming to find finite-time and fixed-time convergent solutions free from initialization. A nonsmooth optimization algorithm for state consensus achieving within a finite or fixed time is presented by designing a projection-based log-barrier penalty cost function to meet the constraints and introducing integral sliding mode subsystems to guarantee zero-gradient-sum. With the use of the projection idea, the penalized functions are always well defined (i.e., satisfying the logarithmic definition) for any system states, which avoids initializing of certain parameters. An adaptive gain scheme without any extra global information is presented. The time-varying zero-gradient-sum method here is feasible for cost functions with nonidentical Hessian matrixes, and applicable to finite-time or fixed-time optimal consensus tracking. The effectiveness and superiority of our algorithms are verified with numerical simulations.},

In order to improve the resource utilization of the networked control system while maintaining satisfactory system performance, a memory term and a dynamic triggering threshold are introduced into the existing SET scheme. Thus, a dynamic memory-based SET (DMSET) scheme is newly designed. To analyze the stability of the controlled system, a useful lemma is established in which an interval-appointed looped-functional is constructed, and a combined Lyapunov method is developed accordingly to derive a relaxed stability criterion. This method contributes to discarding the positive definiteness of certain Lyapunov matrices in the interval-appointed looped-functional and lays a groundwork for the stability analysis of other SET-based saturated control systems. As an application, an LMI-based less conservative stability criterion for DMSET control systems is then derived. Two optimization algorithms are given to maximize the estimates of the region of attraction and the permissible length of the sampling period, respectively. In the end, the advantages of the interval-appointed looped-functional approach and the DMSET scheme are demonstrated by two illustrative examples.},

A new strategy update rule (SUR) with randomly mixed two-level reasoning is proposed. The idea behind two-level reasoning is that each player predicts his/her neighbors' strategies based on the second-order neighbors' information if available, and then updates his/her own strategy accordingly. Since this information is only available randomly, the induced SUR is a mixed SUR based on one-level and two-level reasoning. The algebraic form of the profile dynamical system is derived, and the profile's transition probability matrix is calculated. Based on these, necessary and sufficient conditions for a Nash equilibrium (NE) stability are proposed. In addition, it is proved that under mild probability conditions, if an NE of an NEG with one-level reasoning is stable, then it is also stable for the NEG with the induced randomly mixed two-level reasoning.

Unlike existing methods that rely on a perturbed version of the push-sum algorithm, the proposed algorithm does not require any specific initialization. As a result, it is capable of handling strongly connected networks with sporadically varying sizes. We show that the proposed network flow is guaranteed to converge to the global minimizer of a sum of convex functions, provided that the local objective functions are strongly convex and have Lipschitz-continuous gradients. In addition, by considering a class of admissible time-varying gains/step-sizes, our analysis substantiates an explicit sublinear rate of convergence for the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we consider dynamic influence maximization games over social networks with multiple players (influencers). At the beginning of each campaign opportunity, individuals' opinion dynamics take independent and identically distributed realizations based on an arbitrary distribution. Upon observing the realizations, influencers allocate some of their budgets to affect their opinion dynamics. Then, individuals' opinion dynamics evolve according to the well-known DeGroot model. In the end, influencers collect their reward based on the final opinion dynamics. Each influencer's goal is to maximize their own reward subject to their limited total budget rate constraints, leading to a dynamic game problem. We first consider the offline and online versions of a single influencer's optimization problem where the opinion dynamics and campaign durations are either known or not known a priori. Then, we consider the game formulation with multiple influencers in offline and online settings. For the offline setting, we show that the dynamic game admits a unique Nash equilibrium policy and provide a method to compute it. For the online setting and with two influencers, we show that if each influencer applies the same no-regret online algorithm proposed for the single-influencer maximization problem, they converge to the set of $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium policies where $\epsilon =\mathcal {O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ scales in average inversely with the number of campaign times $K$ considering the influencers' average utilities. Moreover, we extend this result to any finite number of influencers under more strict requirements on the information structure.},

We assume that the only available information is the zero–nonzero structure of system matrices, and approach this problem within a structured system model. We revisit the concept of state and input observability for structured systems, providing refined necessary and sufficient conditions for placing dedicated sensors via the Dulmage–Mendelsohn decomposition. Based on these conditions, we prove that determining the minimum number of dedicated sensors to achieve generic state and input observability is NP-hard, which contrasts sharply with the polynomial-time complexity of the corresponding problem with known inputs. We also demonstrate that this problem is hard to approximate within a factor of $(1-o(1))\mathrm{{log}}(n)$, where $n$ is the state dimension. Notwithstanding, we propose nontrivial upper and lower bounds that can be computed in polynomial time, which confine the optimal value of this problem to an interval with length being the number of inputs. We further present a special case for which the exact optimal value can be determined in polynomial time. In addition, we propose a two-stage algorithm to solve this problem approximately. Each stage of the algorithm is either optimal or suboptimal and can be completed in polynomial time.},

Given this problem setting, the author first presents a method for converting the communication graph into a neural network, where an agent can be represented by a unique node of the communication graph but multiple neurons of the corresponding neural network. The author then applies a mass-centric strategy to train time-varying communication weights of the neural network in a decentralized fashion. This implies that the observation zone of every follower agent is independently assigned by the follower based on positions of its in-neighbors. By training the neural network, the author can ensure safe and decentralized multiagent coverage control.

However, this service brings along the issue of ensuring a synchronized video playback among geographically distributed users. Users leave comments and reactions to an online live event on social networks. As a consequence, an unsynchronized video playback can be easily noticed and be detrimental to users' feelings of togetherness. In this work, we propose a distributed control approach to achieve synchronization among users. In particular, the well-known consensus problem of first-order integrators with saturated inputs is employed to design a distributed playback synchronization framework. Furthermore, we propose a leader–follower approach to ensure a controlled synchronization among users in order to obtain the least possible delay with respect to the video content provider. Finally, an event-triggered control is introduced as an enhancement to the previously developed control with the aim of reducing the information exchanged among users. Simulations on different network topologies confirm that the proposed approach is effective at enforcing asymptotic synchronization.},

Under the condition of jointly connected topologies, it is proven that by properly selecting the step coefficient, the estimates of states can converge to the true states with a convergence rate as the reciprocal of the recursion times.

  abstract     = {In this work, we pursue the problem of distributed distance-based formation control with prescribed transient and steady-state behavior under connectivity and collision avoidance constraints. In addition to the distance-based formation, a subset of agents is enforced to reach a desired distance from a dynamic virtual leader with bounded velocity under prescribed transient and steady-state constraints while preserving connectivity with the virtual leader and a desired safety distance. We show that the aforementioned objectives can be ensured when the communication graph is an undirected tree and a single agent has access to the virtual leader's state information. Under these conditions, we propose a model-free control law for known nonlinear systems as also an adaptive controller when the nonlinear dynamics of the agents are considered unknown and approximated using neural networks. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller both for known and unknown dynamics.},

In this scheme, the advertiser incentivizes mobile users (MUs) to watch advertisement (ads) and, in return, receive a reward in the form of mobile data. In this work, we model the interaction between an advertiser who has asymmetric information about MUs and MUs who are connected to each other under a network, using the contract theory approach. We obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for an optimal and practical contract to motivate MUs to participate in the data rewarding scheme and encourage them to declare their private information truthfully. The formulation of this contract is a nonconvex-constrained optimization problem. Using lemmas and propositions, we reformulate the initial optimization problem that is challenging to solve as an optimization problem with convex constraints and prove that these two problems are equivalent. Then, with the help of a distributed and nonconvex algorithm, we obtain the amount of ads demand and incentive reward.},

The stochastic denial of service attacks in the case of an imperfect network are remodeled. An semi-Markov chain is introduced in this article to provide a suitable description of random attacks. On this basis, the double-layer stochastic process is constructed, which consists of an attack sequence and an observation one. Second, since the attack modes are inaccessible, a controller is constructed based on the observation sequence by virtue of the emission probability to stabilize the system under random attacks. Due to the complexity of the network, the probability that an observer can accurately detect an attack when it occurs is considered unknown. Based on the introduced double-layer stochastic process, a mode-associated Lyapunov function is constructed to facilitate the stability analysis. Building on this foundation, sufficient conditions that can ensure the $\delta$-error mean-square stability of the closed-loop system are derived. In the end, a simulation of the autonomous ground vehicle is presented, showcasing the feasibility and validity of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Most multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods are limited in the scale of problems they can handle. With increasing numbers of agents, the number of training iterations required to find the optimal behaviors increases exponentially due to the exponentially growing joint state and action spaces. This article tackles this limitation by introducing a scalable MARL method called distributed multiagent reinforcement learning with one-hop neighbors (DARL1N). DARL1N is an off-policy actor–critic method that addresses the curse of dimensionality by restricting information exchanges among the agents to one-hop neighbors when representing value and policy functions. Each agent optimizes its value and policy functions over a one-hop neighborhood, significantly reducing the learning complexity, yet maintaining expressiveness by training with varying neighbor numbers and states. This structure allows us to formulate a distributed learning framework to further speed up the training procedure. Distributed computing systems, however, contain straggler compute nodes, which are slow or unresponsive due to communication bottlenecks, software problems, or hardware problems. To mitigate the detrimental straggler effect, we introduce a novel coded distributed learning architecture, which leverages coding theory to improve the resilience of the learning system to stragglers. Comprehensive experiments show that DARL1N significantly reduces training time without sacrificing policy quality and is scalable as the number of agents increases. Moreover, the coded distributed learning architecture improves training efficiency in the presence of stragglers.},

First, the reference generator is constructed for each follower agent to generate the virtual tracking signal, confining to the convex hull spanned by the leaders. Meanwhile, the unmeasurable state variable of each follower is estimated by adopting the $K$-filters based on the available output/input signals and known system function matrices. Then, a distributed adaptive output feedback controller with only one updating parameter is designed for each follower by introducing a logarithmic quantization to quantize the control inputs under the framework of prescribed performance control. The lack of a priori knowledge for the control gain and the quantization gain is counteracted effectively by employing the Nussbaum function method in the adaptive backstepping design process. It is proved that the outputs of followers can enter into the convex hull of multiple leaders and the relevant tracking errors satisfy the prescribed performance index. Finally, the validity of the proposed schemes is illustrated through simulation studies on robotic systems.},

  abstract     = {The Stackelberg game depicts a leader–follower relationship wherein decisions are made sequentially, and the Stackelberg equilibrium represents an expected optimal solution when the leader can anticipate the rational response of the follower. Motivated by control of network systems with two levels of decision-making hierarchy, such as the management of energy networks and power coordination at cellular networks, a networked multileader multifollower Stackelberg game is proposed. Due to the constraint of limited information interaction among players, a clustered information structure is assumed that each leader can only communicate with a portion of overall followers, namely, its direct subordinated followers, and also only with its local neighboring leaders. In this case, the leaders cannot fully anticipate the collective rational response of all followers with local information. To address Stackelberg equilibrium seeking under this partial information structure, we propose a distributed seeking algorithm based on implicit gradient estimation and network consensus mechanisms. We rigorously prove the convergence of the algorithm for both diminishing and constant step sizes under strict and strong monotonicity conditions, respectively. Furthermore, the model and the algorithm can also incorporate linear equality and inequality constraints into the followers' optimization problems, with the approach of the interior point barrier function. Finally, we present numerical simulations in applications to corroborate our claims on the proposed framework.},

This article delves into the problem of cooperative fault-tolerant control under state constraints for a specific class of nonlinear multiple-agent systems. To achieve an asymptotic estimation of states and faults, we propose a distributed state–fault observer that leverages the structural information of faults. Notably, this observer operates independently of the choice of control input, thus decoupling it from the controller design. Alongside estimates of states and faults, we develop a cooperative fault-tolerant controller to ensure that the constrained state difference remains within the prescribed range throughout the system's evolution, ultimately converging to the desired value. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach in the context of cooperative fault-tolerant cruise control for multiple high-speed trains, where we consider simultaneous constraints on train position and velocity.},

In this article, we propose new models of multiplex network games to capture the different modalities of interactions among strategic agents, and multilayer network games to capture their interactions over multiple action dimensions. We explore how the properties of the constituent networks of a multiplex/multilayer network can undermine or support the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the game's Nash equilibria. Notably, we highlight that both the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the constituent networks (reflecting their connectivity and two-sidedness, respectively) are instrumental in determining the uniqueness of the multiplex/multilayer network game's equilibrium.

To address this problem, we propose a computationally efficient and robust algorithm that builds on a probabilistic technique for stochastic gradient computation, which we believe will be applicable to a wide range of problems in decentralized information processing, learning, and control. Specifically, we show that the proposed method achieves an oracle complexity (computational complexity) of $O(1/\epsilon ^{2})$ for smooth and nonconvex functions with stochastic gradients, which is known to be sharp for its respective function class, and is an improvement over the computational cost obtained in previous works. In addition, we retain the $O(1/\epsilon ^{3})$ rate for the communication cost, which is at par with the communication cost obtained in previous works. We also show how the proposed algorithm has robust performance in environments with unreliable computational resources. Finally, the theoretical findings are validated via numerical experiments.},
