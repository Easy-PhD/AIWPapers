  abstract     = {South Korea’s educational system has faced criticism for its lack of focus on critical thinking and creativity, resulting in high levels of stress and anxiety among students. As part of the government’s effort to improve the educational system, the innovation school system was introduced in 2009, which aims to develop students’ creativity as well as their non-cognitive skills. To better understand the differences between innovation and regular school systems in South Korea, we propose a novel method that combines the latent space item response model with the Neyman–Scott point process model. Our method accounts for the heterogeneity of items and students, captures relationships between respondents and items, and identifies item and student clusters that can provide a comprehensive understanding of students’ behaviours/perceptions on non-cognitive outcomes. Our analysis reveals that students in the innovation school system show a higher sense of citizenship, while those in the regular school system tend to associate confidence in appearance with social ability. A comparison with exploratory item factor analysis highlights our method’s advantages in terms of uncertainty quantification of the clustering process and more detailed and nuanced clustering results. Our method is made available to an existing R package, lsirm12pl.},

  abstract     = {The advent of the information age has revolutionized data collection and has led to a rapid expansion of available data sources. Methods of data integration are indispensable when a question of interest cannot be addressed using a single data source. Record linkage (RL) is at the forefront of such data integration efforts. Incentives for sharing linked data for secondary analysis have prompted the need for methodology accounting for possible errors at the RL stage. Mismatch error is a common consequence resulting from the use of nonunique or noisy identifiers at that stage. In this paper, we present a framework to enable valid postlinkage inference in the secondary analysis setting in which only the linked file is given. The proposed framework covers a variety of statistical models and can flexibly incorporate information about the underlying RL process. We propose a mixture model for linked records whose two components reflect distributions conditional on match status, i.e. correct or false match. Regarding inference, we develop a method based on composite likelihood and the expectation-maximization algorithm that is implemented in the R package pldamixture . Extensive simulations and case studies involving contemporary RL applications corroborate the effectiveness of our framework.},

  abstract     = {With the precipitous decline in response rates, researchers and pollsters have been left with highly nonrepresentative samples, relying on constructed weights to make these samples representative of the desired target population. Though practitioners employ valuable expert knowledge to choose what variables X must be adjusted for, they rarely defend particular functional forms relating these variables to the response process or the outcome. Unfortunately, commonly used calibration weights—which make the weighted mean of X in the sample equal that of the population—only ensure correct adjustment when the portion of the outcome and the response process left unexplained by linear functions of X are independent. To alleviate this functional form dependency, we describe kernel balancing for population weighting ( kpop ). This approach replaces the design matrix X with a kernel matrix, K encoding high-order information about X ⁠ . Weights are then found to make the weighted average row of K among sampled units approximately equal to that of the target population. This produces good calibration on a wide range of smooth functions of X , without relying on the user to decide which X or what functions of them to include. We describe the method and illustrate it by application to polling data from the 2016 US presidential election.},

Unlike most SES assessment models proposed in the literature, the hierarchical nature of this model enables the use of census observations at the household level without needing to aggregate any information a priori . Therefore, it better accommodates the variability of the SES between census tracts and the number of households per area. The proposed model is used in the estimation of a socio-economic index using 10% of the 2010 Ghana census in the Greater Accra Metropolitan area. Out of the 20 observed variables, the number of people per room, access to water piping and flushable toilets differentiated high and low SES areas the best.},

  abstract     = {Disease surveillance data are used for monitoring and understanding disease burden, which provides valuable information in allocating health programme resources. Statistical methods play an important role in estimating disease burden since disease surveillance systems are prone to undercounting. This paper is motivated by the challenge of estimating mortality associated with respiratory infections (e.g. influenza and COVID-19) that are not ascertained from death certificates. We propose a Bayesian spatial–temporal model incorporating measures of infection activity to estimate excess deaths. Particularly, the inclusion of time-varying coefficients allows us to better characterize associations between infection activity and mortality counts time series. Software to implement this method is available in the R package NBRegAD . Applying our modelling framework to weekly state-wide COVID-19 data in the US from 8 March 2020 to 3 July 2022, we identified temporal and spatial differences in excess deaths between different age groups. We estimated the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the US to be 1,168,481 (95% CI: 1,148,953 1,187,187) compared to the 1,022,147 from using only death certificate information. The analysis also suggests that the most severe undercounting was in the 18–49 years age group with an estimated underascertainment rate of 0.21 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.25).},

From trial design perspective, operating characteristics including Type I error and power are particularly important and are assessed in our realistic simulation studies representing a variety of practical scenarios. Our proposed weighting estimators achieve significant power gain, while maintaining Type I error close to the nominal value of 0.05.

  abstract     = {Experiments studying get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts estimate causal effects of various mobilization efforts on voter turnout. However, there is often substantial noncompliance in these studies. A usual approach is to use an instrumental variable (IV) analysis to estimate impacts for compliers, here being those actually contacted by the investigators. Unfortunately, popular IV estimators can be unstable in studies with a small fraction of compliers. We explore poststratifying the data (e.g. taking a weighted average of IV estimates within each stratum) using variables that predict complier status (and, potentially, the outcome) to mitigate this. We present the benefits of poststratification in terms of bias, variance, and improved standard error estimates, and provide a finite-sample asymptotic variance formula. We also compare the performance of different IV approaches and discuss the advantages of our design-based poststratification approach over incorporating compliance-predictive covariates into the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator. In the end, we show that covariates predictive of compliance can increase precision, but only if one is willing to make a bias-variance trade-off by down-weighting or dropping strata with few compliers. By contrast, standard approaches such as 2SLS fail to use such information. We finally examine the benefits of our approach in two GOTV applications.},

  abstract     = {Paired comparison models are used for analysing data that involves pairwise comparisons among a set of objects. When the outcomes of the pairwise comparisons have no ties, the paired comparison models can be generalized as a class of binary response models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and their corresponding areas under the curves are commonly used as performance metrics to evaluate the discriminating ability of binary response models. Despite their individual wide range of usage and their close connection to binary response models, ROC analysis to our knowledge has never been extended to paired comparison models since the problem of using different objects as the reference in paired comparison models prevents traditional ROC approach from generating unambiguous and interpretable curves. We focus on addressing this problem by proposing two novel methods to construct ROC curves for paired comparison data which provide interpretable statistics and maintain desired asymptotic properties. The methods are then applied and analysed on head-to-head professional sports competition data.},

  abstract     = {Citizen science mobilizes many observers and gathers huge datasets but often without strict sampling protocols, resulting in observation biases due to heterogeneous sampling effort, which can lead to biased predictions. We develop a spatio-temporal Bayesian hierarchical model for bias-corrected estimation of arrival dates of the first migratory bird individuals at their breeding sites. Higher sampling effort could be correlated with earlier observed dates. We implement data fusion of two citizen-science datasets with fundamentally different protocols (Breeding Bird Survey, eBird) and obtain posterior distributions of the latent process, which contains four spatial components endowed with Gaussian process priors: species niche; sampling effort; position and scale parameters of annual first arrival date. The data layer consists of four response variables: counts of observed eBird locations (Poisson); presence–absence at observed eBird locations (Binomial); BBS occurrence counts (Poisson); first arrival dates (generalized extreme-value). We devise a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme and check by simulation that the latent process components are identifiable. We apply our model to several migratory bird species in the northeastern US for 2001–2021 and find that the sampling effort significantly modulates the observed first arrival dates. We exploit this relationship to effectively bias-correct predictions of the true first arrivals.},

As citizen science data often feature unequal sampling efforts across a spatial domain, prediction sets constructed with indirect methods that share information across counties may be used to improve precision. In this article, we present a nonparametric framework to obtain precise prediction sets for a multinomial random sample based on indirect information that maintain frequentist coverage for each county. We detail a simple algorithm to obtain prediction sets for each county using indirect information where the computation time does not depend on the sample size and scales nicely with the number of species considered. The indirect information may be estimated by a proposed empirical Bayes procedure based on information from auxiliary data. Our approach makes inference for under-sampled counties more precise, while maintaining area-specific frequentist validity for each county. Our method is used to provide a useful description of avian species abundance in North Carolina, USA based on citizen science data from the eBird database.},

  abstract     = {The global decline of biodiversity, driven by habitat degradation and climate breakdown, is a significant concern. Accurate measures of change are crucial to provide reliable evidence of species’ population changes. Meanwhile citizen science data have witnessed a remarkable expansion in both quantity and sources and serve as the foundation for assessing species’ status. The growing data reservoir presents opportunities for novel and improved inference but often comes with computational costs: computational efficiency is paramount, especially as regular analysis updates are necessary. Building upon recent research, we present illustrations of computationally efficient methods for fitting new models, applied to three major citizen science data sets for butterflies. We extend a method for modelling abundance changes of seasonal organisms, firstly to accommodate multiple years of count data efficiently, and secondly for application to counts from a snapshot mass-participation survey. We also present a variational inference approach for fitting occupancy models efficiently to opportunistic citizen science data. The continuous growth of citizen science data offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance our understanding of how species respond to anthropogenic pressures. Efficient techniques in fitting new models are vital for accurately assessing species’ status, supporting policy-making, setting measurable targets, and enabling effective conservation efforts.},
