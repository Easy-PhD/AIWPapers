  abstract     = {Colonization of new habitats is typically followed by divergent selection acting on traits that are immediately important for fitness. For example, differences between sensory environments are often associated with variation in sensory traits critical for navigation and foraging. However, the extent to which the initial response to novel sensory conditions is mediated by phenotypic plasticity, and the contribution of sensory or neural adaptation to early species divergence remains unclear. We took advantage of repeated cases of speciation in Heliconius butterflies with independent allopatric distributions in the west of the Colombian and Ecuadorian Andes. Using volumetric brain measurements, we analyzed patterns of investment in primary sensory processing areas of the brain across different localities and habitats. We find that a higher altitude species, Heliconius chestertonii , differs in levels of investment in visual and olfactory brain components compared with its lower altitude relative H. erato venus , mainly attributable to broad-sense heritable variation as inferred from comparisons between wild and common-garden-reared individuals. We provide evidence that this variation is consistent with divergent selection, and compare these shifts with those reported for another high-altitude species, H. himera , and its parapatric lowland counterpart, H. erato cyrbia , to demonstrate parallel reductions in the size of specific optic lobe neuropils. Conversely, for the antennal lobe, we detected different trait shifts in H. himera and H. chestertonii relative to their lowland H. erato neighbors. Overall, our findings add weight to the adaptive potential of neuroanatomical divergence related to sensory processing during early species formation. Repeated associations between trait variation and environmental shifts may indicate adaptation to local sources of natural selection. For instance, in sticklebacks, independent populations in separate freshwater habitats have evolved reduced armored plating, suggesting equivalent phenotypic responses to shared sources of natural selection. We compared independent cases of ecological divergence in Heliconius butterflies distributed along altitudinal gradients from sea level to mid-elevation in the west of the Colombian and Ecuadorian Andes. Shifts in altitude involve repeated, abrupt transitions from wet, large-leaved, warm forests to higher altitude scrub forests that are drier and more exposed. We tested hypotheses about the role of these ecological shifts in driving adaptive evolution in neuroanatomical traits during speciation. We showed that in Heliconius , independent changes in forest type have been accompanied by heritable, parallel patterns of divergence in investment in visual processing in the brain. We propose these differences likely facilitate species divergence in the face of ongoing gene flow.},

  abstract     = {Reversible plasticity, i.e., the ability to deconstruct phenotypic specializations based on environmental conditions, is widespread in nature. Despite its ubiquity, few mathematical models have explored the evolutionary selection pressures that favor trait reversibility. Therefore, many scenarios remain to be examined. In particular, existing theory has modeled trait development as an instantaneous process. These models do not capture the fact that trait development is often a constructive process, in which phenotypes incrementally adjust to local ecologies. Here, we present an optimality model of the evolution of reversible plasticity in which organisms build traits incrementally. In our model, organisms repeatedly sample cues to infer the environmental state—which can vary between generations but not within generations—and incrementally tailor their phenotypes to match their environments. Organisms also have the option to deconstruct phenotypic adjustments. We investigate two different modes of phenotypic deconstruction: Organisms can either deconstruct phenotypic adjustments incrementally or completely deconstruct all phenotypic adjustments in one time period. We highlight two results. First, early-life sensitive periods in construction precede mid-ontogeny sensitive periods in deconstruction. Intriguingly, although organisms typically only deconstruct toward the end of ontogeny, environmental cues in mid-ontogeny have the strongest impact on deconstruction. Second, in contrast to previous models, we find that reversibility often evolves in environments that are stable within generations. Thus, our model shows that reversibility does not require environmental change during development—as long as organisms are initially uncertain about environmental conditions. Our model provides new insights into the capacity for reversibility in species that have evolved in ontogenetically stable environments.},

  abstract     = {A particularly well-studied evolutionary model is the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster , a cosmopolitan insect of ancestral southern-central African origin. Recent work suggests that it expanded out of Africa ∼9,000 years ago, and spread from the Middle East into Europe ∼1,800 years ago. During its global expansion, this human commensal adapted to novel climate zones and habitats. Despite much work on phenotypic differentiation and adaptation on several continents (especially North America and Australia), typically in the context of latitudinal clines, little is known about phenotypic divergence among European populations. Here, we sought to provide a continent-wide study of phenotypic differentiation among European populations of D. melanogaster . In a consortium-wide phenomics effort, we assayed 16 fitness-related traits on a panel of 173 isofemale lines from 9 European populations, with the majority of traits measured by several groups using semi-standardized protocols. For most fitness-related traits, we found significant differentiation among populations on a continental scale. Despite inevitable differences in assay conditions among labs, the reproducibility and hence robustness of our measurements were overall remarkably good. Several fitness components (e.g., viability, development time) exhibited significant latitudinal or longitudinal clines, and populations differed markedly in multivariate trait structure. Notably, populations experiencing higher humidity/rainfall and lower maximum temperature showed higher viability, fertility, starvation resistance, and lifespan at the expense of lower heat-shock survival, suggesting a pattern of local adaptation. Our results indicate that derived populations of this tropical fly have been shaped by pervasive spatially varying multivariate selection and adaptation to different climates on the European continent.},

  abstract     = {The process by which species diverge from one another, gradually accumulate genetic incompatibilities, and eventually reach full-fledged reproductive isolation is a key question in evolutionary biology. However, the nature of reproductive barriers, the pace at which they accumulate, and their genomic distribution remain poorly documented. The disruption of co-adapted epistatic interactions in hybrids and the accumulation of selfish genetic elements are proposed contributors to this process, and can lead to the distortion of the Mendelian segregation of the affected loci across the genome. In this study we detect and quantify segregation distortion across the genomes of crosses produced from a diverse sampling of Arabidopsis lyrata and A. halleri populations, 2 species at the early stages of speciation and that can still interbreed. We observe no distortion loci in crosses with geographically and genetically similar parents, but both their frequency of occurrence and their magnitude become highly variable in more distant crosses. We also observe that distorter loci evolve rapidly, as they occur not only in interspecific hybrids, but also in intraspecific hybrids produced by crossing individuals from 2 isolated regions. Finally, we identify both genome-wide nonindependence and 2 specific genomic regions on different chromosomes where opposite distortion effects are repeatedly observed across multiple F1 individuals, suggesting negative epistasis is a major contributor to the evolution of hybrid segregation distortion. Our study demonstrates that pollen-acting segregation distortion is ubiquitous, and may contribute not only to the ongoing reproductive isolation between A. halleri and A. lyrata , but also between recently diverged populations of the same species.},

  abstract     = {Cell types are fundamental functional units of multicellular organisms. The evolutionary emergence of new cell types is underpinned by genetic changes, such as gene co-option and cis-regulatory evolution, that propel the assembly or rewiring of molecular networks and give rise to new cell types with specialized functions. Here, we integrate genomic phylostratigraphy with single-cell transcriptomics to explore the evolutionary trends in the assembly of the skeletal cell type-specific gene expression programs. In particular, we investigate how the emergence of lineage-specific genes contributed to this process. We show that osteoblasts and hypertrophic chondrocytes (HC) express evolutionary younger transcriptomes compared to immature chondrocytes that resemble the ancestral skeletogenic program. We demonstrate that the recruitment of lineage-specific genes resulted in subsequent elaboration and individuation of the ancestral chondrogenic gene expression program, propelling the emergence of osteoblasts and HC. Notably, osteoblasts show significant enrichment of vertebrate-specific genes, while HC is enriched in gnathostome-specific genes. By identifying the functional properties of the recruited genes, coupled with the recently discovered fossil evidence, our study challenges the long-standing view on the evolution of vertebrate skeletal structures by suggesting that endochondral ossification and chondrocyte hypertrophy may have already evolved in the last common ancestors of gnathostomes.},

  abstract     = {A key prediction of neutral theory is that the level of genetic diversity in a population should scale with population size. However, as was noted by Richard Lewontin in 1974 and reaffirmed by later studies, the slope of the population size-diversity relationship in nature is much weaker than expected under neutral theory. We hypothesize that one contributor to this paradox is that current methods relying on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) called from aligning short reads to a reference genome underestimate levels of genetic diversity in many species. As a first step to testing this idea, we calculated nucleotide diversity ( ⁠ π ⁠ ) and k -mer-based metrics of genetic diversity across 112 plant species, amounting to over 205 terabases of DNA sequencing data from 27,488 individuals. After excluding 14 species with low coverage or no variant sites called, we compared how different diversity metrics correlated with proxies of population size that account for both range size and population density variation across species. We found that our population size proxies scaled anywhere from about 3 to over 20 times faster with k -mer diversity than nucleotide diversity after adjusting for evolutionary history, mating system, life cycle habit, cultivation status, and invasiveness. The relationship between k -mer diversity and population size proxies also remains significant after correcting for genome size, whereas the analogous relationship for nucleotide diversity does not. These results are consistent with the possibility that variation not captured by common SNP-based analyses explains part of Lewontin’s paradox in plants, but larger scale pangenomic studies are needed to definitively address this question. Even after many revolutions in our ability to sequence and understand DNA, many important biological questions remain unsolved. One such problem is Lewontin’s paradox, named after Richard Lewontin who first described it in 1974. The core of the paradox is a simple idea: species with more individuals should be more genetically diverse. The reasoning is that more individuals means more replication of DNA, and thus more opportunities for mutation to create new variation. However, species that differ massively in population size often have similar diversity levels. Lewontin’s paradox has several potential, previously investigated mechanisms but what if one contributor is simply that our measurements of genetic diversity are off? Most studies estimate diversity by comparing sample genomes to a standard reference genome. While this approach is useful, it is impossible to measure variation in DNA that is not represented in the reference—a phenomenon known as reference bias. We estimate metrics of diversity that are free of reference-bias and re-investigate Lewontin’s paradox in plants. Overall, we find that reference-free diversity metrics scale more with population size, compared with the reference-biased approach. While it is unlikely that reference-bias fully explains Lewontin’s paradox and larger-scale pangenomic studies are needed, our analyses are consistent with reference-bias contributing to Lewontin’s paradox.},

  abstract     = {Determining the genetic architecture of traits involved in adaptation and speciation is one of the key components of understanding the evolutionary mechanisms behind biological diversification. Hybrid zones provide a unique opportunity to use genetic admixture to identify traits and loci contributing to partial reproductive barriers between taxa. Many studies have focused on the temporal dynamics of hybrid zones, but geographical variation in hybrid zones that span distinct ecological contexts has received less attention. We address this knowledge gap by analyzing hybridization and introgression between black-capped and Carolina chickadees in two geographically remote transects across their extensive hybrid zone, one located in eastern and one in central North America. Previous studies demonstrated that this hybrid zone is moving northward as a result of climate change but is staying consistently narrow due to selection against hybrids. In addition, the hybrid zone is moving ~5× slower in central North America compared to more eastern regions, reflecting continent-wide variation in the rate of climate change. We use whole genome sequencing of 259 individuals to assess whether variation in the rate of hybrid zone movement is reflected in patterns of hybridization and introgression, and which genes and genomic regions show consistently restricted introgression in distinct ecological contexts. Our results highlight substantial similarities between geographically remote transects and reveal large Z-linked chromosomal rearrangements that generate measurable differences in the degree of gene flow between transects. We further use simulations and analyses of climatic data to examine potential factors contributing to continental-scale nuances in selection pressures. We discuss our findings in the context of speciation mechanisms and the importance of sex chromosome inversions in chickadees and other species.},

However, the translation from patterns of allele frequency change to rapid adaptation of complex traits remains unresolved. We used abdominal pigmentation in Drosophila melanogaster as a model phenotype to address the nature, genetic architecture, and repeatability of rapid adaptation in the field. We show that D. melanogaster pigmentation evolves as a highly parallel and deterministic response to shared environmental variation across latitude and season in natural North American populations. We then experimentally evolved replicate, genetically diverse fly populations in field mesocosms to remove any confounding effects of demography and/or cryptic structure that may drive patterns in wild populations; we show that pigmentation rapidly responds, in parallel, in fewer than 15 generations. Thus, pigmentation evolves concordantly in response to spatial and temporal climatic axes. We next examined whether phenotypic differentiation was associated with allele frequency change at loci with established links to genetic variance in pigmentation in natural populations. We found that across all spatial and temporal scales, phenotypic patterns were associated with variation at pigmentation-related loci, and the sets of genes we identified at each scale were largely nonoverlapping. Therefore, our findings suggest that parallel phenotypic evolution is associated with distinct components of the polygenic architecture shifting across each environmental axis to produce redundant adaptive patterns.},

To understand and mitigate the negative effects of climate change on wild and cultivated species, recent research has focused on predicting the fitness of organisms or populations in future climates. The accuracy of these predictions is, however, seldom tested. To test such predictions, we grew a set of 800 genetic families of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana in the same field site located in Northern France for 2 consecutive years with contrasted climates. Despite observing, in both years, a clear association between fitness and climatic distance between our field site and the climate of origin of these genetic families, the diverse set of methods we used failed to accurately predict fitness from a year to another. This low accuracy can be explained by the fact that different climatic factors contributed to climate adaptation in different years, which impeded the definition of a meaningful climate descriptor across years. Our results also suggest that populations of A. thaliana from Northern France already suffer from an adaptational lag with respect to climate, and that vegetative growth seems to be a more important trait for climate adaptation than phenology. We discuss the implications of our results for predicting the fitness of wild organisms in future climates and for breeding programs.},

  abstract     = {When a species colonizes a new environment, it may encounter new parasites to which its immune system is poorly adapted. After an initial spike in infection rates in the naïve founder population, the host may subsequently evolve increased immunity, thereby reducing infection rates. Here, we present an example of this eco-evolutionary process in a population of threespine stickleback ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ) that was founded in Heisholt Quarry, a man-made quarry pond, in 1967. Marine stickleback rarely encounter Schistocephalus solidus tapeworms (which require freshwater to hatch), and so remain highly susceptible to infection. Initially, introduced marine fish were heavily infected by S. solidus . They exhibited low levels of fibrosis, a heritable immune trait that some genotypes activate in response to infection, thereby suppressing tapeworm growth and viability. By the 1990s, the Heisholt Quarry population exhibited high rates of fibrosis, which partly suppressed S. solidus infection. This increased immune response led to reduced infection rates, and the tapeworm was apparently extirpated by 2021. Because fibrosis has a strong genetic basis in other stickleback populations, we infer that the newly founded stickleback–parasite interaction exhibits an eco-evolutionary process of increased immunity that effectively reduced infection. The infection and immune dynamics documented here closely match those expected from a simple eco-evo dynamic model presented here.},
