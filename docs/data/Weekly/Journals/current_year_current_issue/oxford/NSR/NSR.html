  abstract     = {Aerogels are considered to be ideal thermal insulation materials due to their low thermal conductivity and highly porous structure, which can effectively reduce the energy consumption in aerospace, industry, and building applications. However, the anisotropic performance of most aerogels results in high thermal conductivity in the axial direction, and structures tend to collapse under the extreme temperature shock, leading to poor mechanical stability. Herein, we demonstrate a remarkable lightweight and isotropic thermal insulation aerogel material inspired by the wall–septa microstructure of cuttlebone. The cuttlebone-inspired MXene aerogel (CMA) is fabricated through freeze casting colloidal suspensions composed of Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene nanosheets, montmorillonite nanosheets, cellulose nanofibers, and polyvinyl alcohol. The CMA shows an ultralow thermal conductivity of 17.1 mW m −1 K −1 in the radial direction and 19.7 mW m −1 K −1 in the axial direction. Additionally, the CMA also exhibits a rapid sensing response, robust fire resistance/fire warning, and excellent electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding of ∼61 dB in both radial and axial directions. The structural integrity and EMI shielding performance remain stable over a wide temperature range (−196°C to 1300°C). This performance indicates the potential of CMA as a promising alternative to existing thermal insulation under extreme conditions.},

  abstract     = {Blinks controlled by ocular muscles and nerves can manifest as either involuntary physiological behaviors or volitional control actions, with the former serving spontaneous protective functions while the latter constitutes a biologically meaningful communicative signal. The encoding of blink information provides a novel eye–machine interaction (EMI) prototype within the realm of human–machine interaction, expanding human consciousness and capability boundaries. It facilitates motor and language rehabilitation, silent communication and even voluntary command execution. However, existing EMI devices face challenges related to wireless functionalities, ocular comfort and multi-route encoding/decoding orders. Here, we propose a wireless eye-wearable lens to encode conscious blink information via introduction of an RLC oscillating loop in the soft contact lens. The developed EMI contact lens incorporates a mechanosensitive capacitor, an inductive coil and the inherent loop resistance, generating characteristic resonance frequency for front-end capacitance signal transition or back-end control signal extraction. The EMI device delivers a sensitivity of 0.153 MHz/mmHg in the wide range of 0–70 mmHg for a normal intraocular pressure monitor and realizes conscious blink-based control command coding. A trial with participants having the EMI contact lens inserted demonstrates its wearability and biocompatibility. Finally, the five-route blink-based control command decoding mechanism is constructed via the EMI lens, linking blink counts to a drone's flight trajectory. The EMI contact lens offers an innovative prototype that transcends the capabilities of traditional brain–computer interfaces.},

  abstract     = {Electrochromic metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) combine advantages from both inorganic/organic electrochromic materials by enabling stable structures/performances as well as tunable functionalities. Their current design and synthesis, however, are inherently complicated, as they often involve amendments to the chromogenic components and/or MOF structures. Inspired by reticular chemistry, we herein demonstrate a multidirectional ‘color palette’ based on the colorful electrochromic behaviors across a total of 40 zirconium-based MOFs via systematically combining diverse naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based primary linkers (R-groups) and auxiliary linkers (X-groups), namely the NKM-908-R/NKM-906-R series ( csq / scu topology) and their corresponding NKM-908-R-TPDC-X/NKM-906-R-TPDC-X derivatives. A new broad color gamut over these robust MOF thin films was showcased via systematical crystal engineering and was thoroughly investigated. The benefits include enhancing the primary set of ‘colors’ from altering peripheral R-groups without redesigning the NDI core, introducing different X-groups as the secondary sets of ‘colors’ and topology adjustments to incorporate more X-linkers for intensification of the latter. Together, such designable color-mixing/changing sequences successfully mimicked the use of the routine color palette with molecular-level precision. This work not only holds great potential for further extension, but also provides unique insights into the development of next-generation electrochromic devices.},

  abstract     = {Reforestation and afforestation alter climate not only through biogeophysical processes such as changes in surface albedo, evapotranspiration and near‐surface turbulence, but also by modifying emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) that drive biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOA) formation. Using an Earth system model coupled with an advanced aerosol module, we quantify how biogeophysical feedback from vegetation change influences BVOC emissions, BSOA burden and aerosol radiative effects under future land‑use scenarios. Our results reveal that biogeophysical feedback either amplifies or offsets BSOA cooling, depending on regional climate–vegetation interactions. In regions where reduced surface albedo dominates, increasing temperature and BVOC emissions enhance BSOA burden and its radiative cooling. Conversely, in regions where updrafts and cloud formation are enhanced, reduced surface radiation suppresses BVOC emissions and offsets BSOA increases from vegetation changes alone. Globally, these types of feedback amplify BVOC emission changes in 52% of reforested areas but suppress them elsewhere, intensifying spatial heterogeneity in aerosol climate effects. These divergent feedback pathways introduce strong spatial heterogeneity and non-linearity into the BSOA–climate response. Incorporating such biogeophysical modulation of BSOAs is essential for designing reforestation strategies that maximize climate mitigation benefits.},

  abstract     = {Channelized thin seismic low-velocity zones (LVZs) are observed beneath subducting slabs, extending from the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary to the mantle transition zone (MTZ). While LVZs above slabs are well-explained by slab dehydration and flux melting, the origin and fate of these enigmatic subslab LVZs—persisting far deeper than expected—remain elusive. Here we use geodynamic modeling to show that subduction-induced wet upwellings from a water-bearing MTZ that generates dehydration melting feed the base of the lithosphere forming seismically detected LVZs. A similar process may occur when a pre-existing partially molten layer atop the 410-km discontinuity is displaced upward in response to subduction. These thin partially molten layers are successively entrained alongside the subducting slab and recycled back to MTZ depths. This mechanism supports a globally widespread scenario where subduction-induced upwelling of a water-rich MTZ can account for the observed mantle heterogeneities. Since minute quantities of melts may dramatically reduce viscosity, this process is likely to have non-negligible implications for the Earth's dynamics and recycling of the lithosphere into the deep mantle.},

This extreme flooding is fueled by the unprecedented warming in the Indian Ocean, with a decaying moderate El Niño in the Pacific contributing weakly. Alarmingly, similar pre-flood season flooding events have become increasingly frequent in southern China over recent decades, posing unexpected risks to local communities. We demonstrate that the recent rapid Indian Ocean warming enhances local convection efficiency, leading to more frequent intense pre-flood season rainfall. As sea surface temperature in the Indian Ocean continues to rise in a warming world, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its role in shaping regional extreme weather patterns for future climate adaptation and disaster management.},

This influence should be more pronounced during agricultural stages and periods of extreme solar activity. The late Joseon Dynasty of Korea serves as an ideal civilization sample of political continuity and stability, maintaining a 285-year-long meteorological diary and rainfall records with a temporal resolution of up to 2 hours, perfectly encompassing the Maunder Minimum (MM). Here we quantitatively reconstruct the rainfall patterns, revealing a rare, nearly century-long drought around the MM, accompanied by decadal climate fluctuations correlated to the sunspot cycle. Quantitative socio-environmental analyses further indicate that the convergence of cold, arid conditions and heightened climate instability ultimately precipitated cascading ecological and societal crises during the late Joseon Dynasty. Our findings offer new perspectives for understanding and addressing the impacts of future periods of extreme solar activity on modern civilization.},

  abstract     = {Anxiety disorders frequently accompany aggression, with their co-occurrence predicting greater functional impairment and poor prognosis. Nevertheless, the underlying neural mechanisms remain elusive, primarily due to a lack of appropriate animal models. Here, we designed a chronic conspecific outsider stress (CCS) model in which male mice underwent perceived social threats and exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviors accompanied by aggression. CCS led to Fos activation and hyperexcitability of GABAergic neurons in the medial preoptic area (mPOA). Inhibition of mPOA GABAergic (mPOA Gad2 ) neurons rescued CCS-induced anxiety-like and aggressive behaviors, whereas activating these cells induced susceptibility to CCS. Moreover, CCS upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of the sexual-dimorphic gene, cholecystokinin A receptor (CCKAR)-encoding Cckar gene in the mPOA. Importantly, the knock-down and overexpression of CCKAR in the mPOA Gad2 neurons had alleviating and promoting effects on anxiety-like and aggressive behaviors, aligning with decreased and increased excitability by the anxiolytic CCKAR antagonist MK-329 and the anxiogenic CCKAR agonist A71623 in mPOA Gad2 neurons, respectively. Overall, our study characterizes a novel mouse model of anxiety disorders accompanied by aggression and the neuronal subpopulation and molecular mediator of the aberrant behaviors provide potential targets of intervention for anxiety disorders with aggression.},
