  abstract     = {The heterogeneous treatment effect plays a crucial role in precision medicine. There is evidence that real-world data, even subject to biases, can be employed as supplementary evidence for randomized clinical trials to improve the statistical efficiency of the heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. In this paper, for survival data with right censoring, we consider estimating the heterogeneous treatment effect, defined as the difference of the treatment-specific conditional restricted mean survival times given covariates, by synthesizing evidence from randomized clinical trials and the real-world data with possible biases. We define an omnibus bias function to characterize the effect of biases caused by unmeasured confounders, censoring, and outcome heterogeneity, and further, identify it by combining the trial and real-world data. We propose a penalized sieve method to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effect and the bias function. We further study the theoretical properties of the proposed integrative estimators based on the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert space and empirical process. The proposed methodology outperforms the approach solely based on the trial data through simulation studies and an integrative analysis of the data from a randomized trial and a real-world registry on early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer.},

  abstract     = {Longitudinal data are often subject to irregular and informative visit times. Weighting generalized estimating equations by the inverse of the visit rate yields asymptotically unbiased estimates of regression coefficients provided that outcomes and visit times are conditionally independent, given the covariates in the visit model. Adding other covariates has no impact on the asymptotic bias of estimated regression coefficients, provided that conditional independence is maintained, but the impact on their variances is unknown. We show that variances are unchanged on adding variables associated with neither outcome nor visit process, and decrease on adding variables associated with outcome but not visit process. Adding variables associated with visits but not outcome may either increase or decrease variances of estimated outcome model regression coefficients, depending on the correlation structure of the covariates and the outcome. Application to a study of major depressive disorder found that the variances of estimated regression coefficients were of a similar magnitude when predictors of outcome but not visits were added to the visit rate model but consistently larger, in some cases by a factor of 2, on adding predictors of visits but not outcome. We recommend that visit process models include variables associated with outcome, but that those unassociated with the outcome be treated with caution.},

  abstract     = {The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) launched Project Optimus to shift the objective of dose selection from the maximum tolerated dose to the optimal biological dose (OBD), optimizing the benefit-risk tradeoff. One approach recommended by the FDA’s guidance is to conduct randomized trials comparing multiple doses. In this paper, using the selection design framework, we propose a Randomized Optimal SElection (ROSE) design, which minimizes sample size while ensuring the probability of correct selection of the OBD at pre-specified accuracy levels. The ROSE design is simple to implement, involving a straightforward comparison of the difference in response rates between two dose arms against a predetermined decision boundary. We further consider a two-stage ROSE design that allows for early selection of the OBD at the interim when there is sufficient evidence, further reducing the sample size. Simulation studies demonstrate that the ROSE design exhibits desirable operating characteristics in correctly identifying the OBD. A sample size of 15–40 patients per dosage arm typically results in a percentage of correct selection of the optimal dose ranging from 60% to 70%.},
