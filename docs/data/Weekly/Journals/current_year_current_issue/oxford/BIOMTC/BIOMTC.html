  abstract     = {The heterogeneous treatment effect plays a crucial role in precision medicine. There is evidence that real-world data, even subject to biases, can be employed as supplementary evidence for randomized clinical trials to improve the statistical efficiency of the heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. In this paper, for survival data with right censoring, we consider estimating the heterogeneous treatment effect, defined as the difference of the treatment-specific conditional restricted mean survival times given covariates, by synthesizing evidence from randomized clinical trials and the real-world data with possible biases. We define an omnibus bias function to characterize the effect of biases caused by unmeasured confounders, censoring, and outcome heterogeneity, and further, identify it by combining the trial and real-world data. We propose a penalized sieve method to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effect and the bias function. We further study the theoretical properties of the proposed integrative estimators based on the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert space and empirical process. The proposed methodology outperforms the approach solely based on the trial data through simulation studies and an integrative analysis of the data from a randomized trial and a real-world registry on early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer.},

  abstract     = {The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) launched Project Optimus to shift the objective of dose selection from the maximum tolerated dose to the optimal biological dose (OBD), optimizing the benefit-risk tradeoff. One approach recommended by the FDA’s guidance is to conduct randomized trials comparing multiple doses. In this paper, using the selection design framework, we propose a Randomized Optimal SElection (ROSE) design, which minimizes sample size while ensuring the probability of correct selection of the OBD at pre-specified accuracy levels. The ROSE design is simple to implement, involving a straightforward comparison of the difference in response rates between two dose arms against a predetermined decision boundary. We further consider a two-stage ROSE design that allows for early selection of the OBD at the interim when there is sufficient evidence, further reducing the sample size. Simulation studies demonstrate that the ROSE design exhibits desirable operating characteristics in correctly identifying the OBD. A sample size of 15–40 patients per dosage arm typically results in a percentage of correct selection of the optimal dose ranging from 60% to 70%.},
