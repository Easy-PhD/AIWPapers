  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to training data extraction attacks due to data memorization. This paper introduces a novel attack scenario wherein an attacker adversarially fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs to amplify the exposure of the original training data. Unlike prior TDE methods that mainly rely on post-hoc querying or prompt selection to elicit memorized content from a fixed model, our strategy directly alters the model’s parameters to intensify its retention of the pre-training dataset. To achieve this, the attacker needs to collect generated texts that are closely aligned with the pre-training data. However, without knowledge of the actual dataset, quantifying the amount of pre-training data within generated texts is challenging. To address this, we propose the use of pseudo-labels for these generated texts, leveraging membership approximations indicated by machine-generated probabilities from the target LLMusing DetectGPT. We subsequently fine-tune the LLM via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to favor generations with higher likelihoods of originating from the pre-training data, based on these membership probabilities. Our empirical findings indicate a remarkable outcome: LLMs with over 1B parameters exhibit a four to eight-fold increase in training data exposure. We discuss potential mitigations and suggest future research directions.},

  abstract     = {Neural network inference in cloud service offers tangible benefits to users, from individuals and small institutions to large companies. However, two crucial concerns must be addressed. The first arises in satisfying the privacy of the model, the input data, and the inference results throughout the inference process. The second pertains to verifying that the inferences are derived from the designated neural network model. Although Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) are typically adopted to mitigate such issues, the major challenge lies in achieving privacy preservation and verifiability simultaneously. In this study, we address both issues by proposing VSecNN, a verifiable and privacy-preserving neural network inference scheme. Specifically, we integrate MPC with the Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) protocol to achieve zero-knowledge proof generation for multiple parties. Subsequently, we perform adaptive optimizations on the multi-party proof generation approach to align with the neural network, thereby achieving both privacy-preserving capabilities and verifiability. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement in the efficiency. For example, the computation time for completing our multi-party proof generation could be as low as 1.7 times that of the single-party proof generation, while the verification requires only 169ms on the MNIST dataset.},

As such, security decision-making is of essential importance to maintain the operational security of critical industrial infrastructures. In this paper, we consider the problem of designing cost-effective defense strategies to minimize the risk of successful attack paths. To this end, we propose a non-Markovian security game framework on labeled attack graphs to simulate the attack-defense process in industrial control systems. Compared with existing methods, where the cost of exploiting a vulnerability is considered constant, we consider a more dynamic and realistic case where the exploitation cost is discounted with the number of exploitations. Moreover, a state-decomposition based multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to obtain the Nash equilibrium of the proposed non-Markovian security game. A case study on a simulated industrial control system is presented to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the discounting exploitation cost could greatly alter the attack and subsequently the defense strategies. In comparison to traditional static intrusion response approaches, our non-Markovian approach offers a more realistic and adaptive framework to anticipate evolving attack paths and allocate defense resources.},

  abstract     = {Passwords remain one of the most widely used forms of authentication in modern systems. However, their inherent predictability, stemming from common user behaviors in password creation, renders password-based authentication vulnerable to guessing attacks. To balance memorability and security, users often construct isomorphic variants of a base password by altering its structure, such as transforming 123abc into 1a2b3c. These variants pose significant challenges to traditional password guessing models. In particular, mainstream approaches such as Markov model and Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) model struggle to capture the structural relationships among these variants. To address this challenge, we propose PassGIN, a password guessing framework based on Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN). By modeling a password as a graph, PassGIN captures both local adjacency and character rearrangement patterns, enabling the model to distinguish subtle structural differences between base passwords and their isomorphic variants. To further enhance performance, we introduce PassCluster, a dynamic edge-weighting mechanism that leverages adjacency frequencies observed in large-scale password datasets. This allows GIN to more effectively learn structural variations and generate accurate guesses. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that PassGIN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both intra-site and cross-site password guessing scenarios, achieving relative improvements of 23.49% and 74.53%, respectively.},

To increase the scalability of TOR, researchers mainly utilize hop-by-hop routing during circuit extension. However, hop-by-hop routing has not been widely deployed since it suffers from route capture attacks, and most of the countermeasures require the source participate in the route extension indirectly, help verify the selection of next hop by intermediate nodes, thus introduces communication overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel routing scheme called Jump Routing. In jump routing, the route extension follows the jumping way, that each relay chooses the successor of the next hop rather than the next hop itself. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to route in the jumping way. In addition, to defend route capture attacks, enhance data privacy, and defend collusion attacks, we propose multiple schemes including jump verification, jump encryption, and corporative jump verification. Different from previous measures on route capture attacks, jump routing does not need the participation of the source, but deals with the attack by intermediate nodes only. We manage to realize the full jump routing prototype, and the evaluation results show that our jump routing is scalable, lightweight, and resilient.},

  abstract     = {Combating counterfeit products is crucial for maintaining a healthy market. Recently, Copy Sensitive Graphical Codes (CSGC) have garnered significant attention due to their high sensitivity to illegal physical copying. Copy Detection Patterns (CDP) and Two-Level QR Codes (2LQR code) are two representative methods. CDP offers high efficiency and low cost, enabling use in document authentication and product anti-counterfeiting, and has achieved broad commercial adoption. In contrast, 2LQR code, as a consumer-grade document authentication solution, provides additional private message sharing functionalities. We observe that both the CDP and 2LQR code can be synthesized using textured patterns. To this end, we propose a flexible framework that integrates the stochastic anti-counterfeiting properties of CDP with the private message sharing of 2LQR code. Specifically, we model CDP as a random noise image composed of multiple textured patterns similar to those in 2LQR code, where each pattern represents an informative digit. Thus, both codes can be generated through textured pattern design. We formulate this as a constrained optimization framework called Mixed-Bit Sampling Marking (MSM). The objective incorporates white pixel ratio and spatial randomness, with constraints defined by a flexible modulation function (e.g., DCT or Pearson similarity), customizable to user needs. A two-step sampling algorithm solves the optimization. We demonstrate CDP and 2LQR codes generated via MSM and validate their ability to inherit advantages from both approaches. Experiments show that MSM-generated texture patterns effectively synthesize both CDPs and 2LQR codes, preserving their advantages while offering a novel, flexible solution for document authentication.},

Creating the transitional domain is an effective approach, but existing models often have difficulty synthesizing transitional domains with sufficiently public features. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative approach named feature fusion transitional domain (F2TD-Reid), which comprises two essential components: the dictionary fusion module (DFM) and the transitional domain attention module (TDAM). Among them, the DFM utilizes a feature fusion to extract and reconstruct pedestrian images from instances, focusing on capturing the essential visual elements within the images. For the TDAM, it further refines the feature extraction of instance points through an innovative weighted attention mechanism. These two modules optimize the generation process of scaling factors, thereby facilitating the transfer of knowledge between the source domain and the target domain. Through a series of comparative experiments, we verify the superiority of the F2TD-Reid method in solving UDA Reid. The code is available at https://github.com/1x-x/F2TD-Reid.},

This severely hinders their application in security-critical domains. Therefore, the development of GCNs that are resilient to adversarial attacks has emerged as a prominent research focus. Despite this, most current defense models with complex network architectures and optimization objectives are typically designed based on specific feature assumptions or attack manifestations, and do not enhance the inherent robustness of GCNs. They also overlook the changes induced by perturbations of varying intensities and the difference in attack phenomenon across different datasets. In response to this, we have delved into the impact of adversarial attacks on the spectrum, and propose an effective adaptive robust spectrum filter GCN (ASF-GCN). This approach enhances the robustness of GCN models through adaptive filtering without introducing additional conditional assumptions. We theoretically analyze that graphs have different robust frequency intervals under different conditions, validating the necessity of adaptive filtering. Additionally, we elucidate the role of degree distribution and maximum eigenvalue in adaptation. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs reveal that our model surpasses other defense models in overall performance.},

  abstract     = {In Federated Learning (FL), clients share gradients with a central server while keeping their data local. However, malicious servers could deliberately manipulate the models to reconstruct clients’ data from shared gradients, posing significant privacy risks. Although such Active Gradient Leakage Attacks (AGLAs) have been widely studied, they suffer from two severe limitations: (i) coverage: no existing AGLAs can reconstruct all samples in a batch from the shared gradients; (ii) stealthiness: no existing AGLAs can evade principled checks of clients. In this paper, we address these limitations with two core contributions. First, we introduce a new theoretical analysis approach, which uniformly models AGLAs as backdoor poisoning. This analysis approach reveals that the core principle of AGLAs is to bias the gradient space to prioritize the reconstruction of a small subset of samples while sacrificing the majority, which theoretically explains the above limitations of existing AGLAs. Second, we propose Enhanced Gradient Global Vulnerability (EGGV), the first AGLA that achieves complete attack coverage while evading client-side detection. In particular, EGGV employs a gradient projector and a jointly optimized discriminator to assess gradient vulnerability, steering the gradient space toward the point most prone to data leakage. Extensive experiments show that EGGV achieves complete attack coverage and surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) with at least a 43% increase in reconstruction quality (PSNR) and a 45% improvement in stealthiness (D-SNR).},

This paper describes the development of a Bayesian network risk model to enhance the comprehension of observable cyber-events caused by malicious activity in OT environments. The core of the Bayesian network is a process model that characterizes the stages of adversary behavior. The remainder of the model leverages the MITRE ATT&CK® for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) taxonomy, which includes tactics and techniques that may be used by the adversary. The observables provide evidence for adversary behavior through the intermediary technique and tactic nodes. One challenge in constructing this model is a lack of open-source data from cyber-attacks on OT systems. This paper demonstrates the use of both historical data and expert knowledge to construct the Bayesian network. The historical data was obtained from open-source reporting of 27 cyber-attacks affecting OT systems. The expert knowledge was obtained from a panel of subject matter experts with experience in a variety of OT cybersecurity roles and responsibilities. Finally, the Bayesian network is demonstrated using two historical case studies: the Darkside ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline and the destructive cyber-attack targeting the Thyssenkrupp blast furnace. By using this approach, OT cybersecurity professionals can better identify and characterize adversarial behavior in their systems to enable risk-informed investigations and interruptions before impact occurs.},

However, the threshold searchable encryption based on the Shamir secret sharing mechanism cannot achieve flexible user dynamic since the Lagrange interpolation polynomial for recovering the secret value changes with the group user add or delete, resulting in the ciphertext or trapdoor containing Lagrange interpolation formula needs to be recreated. In this paper, the conjunctive keyword search with dynamic group-user scheme (CKSDGU) is proposed to realize group-user flexible addition and deletion. The proposed CKSDGU scheme can match successfully without the data owner resetting ciphertext and the original data user generating trapdoors. In addition, multi-keyword conjunctive retrieval is implemented in the CKSDGU scheme, and group users can search the target ciphertexts that contain all users’ query keyword sets.

These attacks are pernicious when attackers inject a trigger into the input data without altering its ground-truth label, known as clean-label backdoor attacks. The effectiveness and stealth of existing clean-label backdoor attacks rely on access to global training data, making them resource-intensive and impractical. This paper introduces a novel clean-label backdoor attack that achieves high attack success rates (ASR) while maintaining exceptional stealth under realistic constraints. Unlike prior approaches focused on spatial differences between clean and poisoned data, a key novelty of the new attack is the suppression of high-frequency components in the frequency domain, which minimizes human-detectable contrasts and enhances trigger imperceptibility. Moreover, we employ an affine combination of static and adaptive triggers, effectively balancing their strengths to maximize ASR. Surrogate models are designed to simulate victim model behavior and auxiliary models are applied to extract the spatial and frequency features of the static triggers, enabling trigger design with minimal knowledge of the victim model. Our attack achieves a higher ASR than state-of-the-art backdoor attacks while maintaining higher benign accuracy across various models and datasets. It also demonstrates strong resistance against the latest defense mechanisms, including STRIP, SentiNet, neural cleanse, fine-pruning, and ANP.},

These attacks can exploit minor perturbations to cause significant prediction errors, making it essential to enhance the resilience of DNNs. Traditional defense methods often rely on access to detailed model information, which raises privacy concerns, as model owners may be reluctant to share such data. In contrast, existing black-box defense methods fail to offer a universal defense against various types of adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce DUCD, a universal black-box defense method that does not require access to the target model’s parameters or architecture. Our approach involves distilling the target model by querying it with data, creating a white-box surrogate while preserving data privacy. We further enhance this surrogate model using a certified defense based on randomized smoothing and optimized noise selection, enabling robust defense against a broad range of adversarial attacks. Comparative evaluations between the certified defenses of the surrogate and target models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments on multiple image classification datasets show that DUCD not only outperforms existing black-box defenses but also matches the accuracy of white-box defenses, all while enhancing data privacy and reducing the success rate of membership inference attacks.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that facilitates model training across multiple devices without exposing private feature data. One of the primary challenges in FL is achieving a privacy protection guaranteed by theory often compromise computational and communication efficiency such as cryptographic-based methods. To address the trade-off between privacy preservation and efficiency, this paper introduces FedPN, a novel privacy-preserving approach that leverages periodic neuron technique, ensuring both enhanced privacy and efficient model training. Specifically, we propose a lightweight obfuscation mechanism integrated into the model’s input layer, where a specialized obfuscation layer is designed to ensure privacy, exploiting the synergistic interaction between convolutional operations and nonlinear activation functions to enhance feature extraction. We further integrate this privacy protection mechanism into FL model training, where the obfuscation layer is shared globally among all clients, aiming to achieve an optimal trade-off between the learnability and confidentiality of obfuscated features. In contrast to Homomorphic Encryption, our approach eliminates the need for heavy homomorphic operations, maintaining a practical level of training efficiency. Our theoretical analysis proves an exponentially negligible privacy guarantee against successful feature reconstruction attacks, with the success probability bounded by o(γ−m), where the frequency parameter γ > 1 and dimension of obfuscated vector m > 0. In addition, extensive experiments show that FedPN significantly enhances defence against feature reconstruction, while maintaining comparable efficiency and accuracy to existing approaches such as Differential Privacy.},

However, the accuracy of currently existing solutions suffer from multipath effects in practical scenarios. In this paper, we provide a robust RFF identification method that leverages channel state information (CSI) feedback to counteract the effect of the channel on the extracted RFF features. A straightforward zero-forcing (ZF) equalization fails to fully decouple RF impairments from the channel, making conventional approaches ineffective. To overcome this challenge, we utilize the potential of multi-antenna and introduce a new device-specific feature called Relative-RFF (R-RFF), which represents the relation between different RF chains in a multi-antenna transmitter. We propose an enhanced ZF post-equalization algorithm to eliminate the multipath channels and preserve the users’ R-RFF to the greatest extent. We evaluate the robustness of R-RFF under various channel conditions and noise levels and the performance of R-RFF in terms of identification accuracy under different channel scenarios. The results show that the proposed R-RFF method can achieve an identification accuracy of 91.2% for 70 devices in tapped delay line channel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 30 dB.},

Second, we detect potential detect potential collusive attackers via a joint similarity-based approach. Third, we apply an iterative low rank approximation-based anomaly detection to amplify discrepancies between benign and malicious clients and progressively filter out attackers.

To this end, we propose ARBiBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the adversarial robustness of BCNNs in the image classification task. The key contributions of ARBiBench include: 1) systematically evaluating the robustness of seven influential BCNN methods across various architectures; 2) rigorous validation of diverse adversarial attack methods; and 3) novel empirical findings showing that BCNNs exhibit weaker robustness than full-precision networks on small datasets but surprisingly stronger robustness on large-scale datasets. Leveraging Information Bottleneck theory, we further demonstrate how data scale and model capacity collectively determine BCNNs’ adversarial robustness. These findings not only challenge conventional assumptions about BCNN security, but also provide new insights for developing robust yet efficient neural network architectures.},

  abstract     = {The spatio-temporal (ST) mobility patterns derived from trajectory data are crucial for applications such as location-based services and urban analytics. However, releasing these mobility features raises significant privacy concerns, as they may expose sensitive personal location information. Differential privacy (DP) is widely used to safeguard individual privacy during data releases, but existing methods for releasing ST features often suffer from utility loss because their high dimensionality requires injecting substantial noise to meet privacy guarantees. Several recent approaches attempt to address this issue by reducing noise in differentially private spatio-temporal (DPST) features, but they either discard valuable information while compressing noisy data representations or rely solely on restrictive road network topology constraints, resulting in only modest utility improvements. In this paper, we present DPDeno, a post-processing framework designed to significantly enhance the utility of DPST features. First, DPDeno generates synthetic trajectory datasets using public information (e.g., road network data) and applies existing DP methods to create paired DPST (noisy) and ST (clean) features. It then trains a spatio-temporal graph autoencoder (STGAE), which models each feature as a graph, with road segments as nodes and transitions over time as edges. By minimizing node- and edge-level reconstruction losses between the noisy and clean pairs, STGAE learns to refine DPST inputs toward the structural consistency of their clean counterparts, thereby improving their practical utility. The trained model is then used to post-process real DPST features. Importantly, DPDeno preserves the original DP guarantee, as STGAE is trained solely on synthetic data generated from public sources without accessing any private information. Experimental results on two real-world trajectory datasets show that DPDeno significantly improves both the statistical accuracy and practical usability of released mobility features.},

We observe that it is a necessary condition for APT attackers to achieve their campaigns via controlling unknown Trojans to access and exfiltrate critical files. We present a theoretical model called Digital Scapegoat (abbreviated as DS-IDep) that constructs an Incentive Deception defense schema to hijack the attacker’s access to critical files and redirect it to avatar files without awareness. We propose a FlipIDep Game model (GF) and a Markov Game model (GM) to characterize completely the payoffs, equilibria, and best strategies from the perspective of the attacker and the defender respectively. We also design an exponential risk propagation model to evaluate the ability of DS-IDep to eliminate stealing impact when the risk is propagated between states. Theoretically, we can achieve the objective of stealing impact elimination (LK<0.001) when the ratio of incentive deception exceeds 0.7 (η>0.7) and the probability of an attack operation bypassing the defense surface is less than 0.1 (r* × μ <0.1) under Stackelberg strategies. We develop a kernel-level incentive deception defense surface according to the theoretical parameters of the DS-IDep. The experimental results show that DS-IDep can resist APT stealing attacks from unknown Trojans. We also evaluate the DS-IDep in five well-known software applications. It demonstrates that DS-IDep can address unknown attacks from compromised software with less than 10% performance overhead.},

  abstract     = {Strings (sequences of elements) are often disseminated to support applications, e.g., in bioinformatics, web analysis, and transportation. Unfortunately, this may expose sensitive patterns that model confidential knowledge. Concealing the occurrences of sensitive patterns in a string (e.g., by deleting some elements) while minimizing the associated quality loss has been the objective of several string sanitization methods. However, real-world attackers are likely to possess background knowledge about the string, e.g., an individual’s genome sequence is almost identical to a reference genome sequence. In addition, it is good security practice to assume that the attacker will know the algorithm that has been used to sanitize the string (Kerckhoffs’ principle). Yet, all existing methods fail to protect strings against such attackers, risking privacy breaches in critical applications. In our work, we consider for the first time how to defend against strategic attackers who possess such knowledge. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework to sanitize a string by probabilistically replacing carefully selected patterns. As part of this framework, we design three mathematical programming algorithms which compute the optimal replacement probabilities under different objectives and constraints, offering different privacy gain / quality loss tradeoffs. Our algorithms protect against strategic attackers using new concepts and measures, protect sensitive patterns of any length, and can construct one or more optimally sanitized strings that can be used in applications such as frequent pattern mining. Our experiments using five real-world datasets from different domains show that all our algorithms are substantially more effective than a natural baseline (e.g., they offer up to 2 times more privacy when they are configured to incur the same quality loss, and up to 3 times lower quality loss when they are configured to offer the same privacy). They also show that two “hybrid” algorithms that we propose, based on combining elements of the above algorithms, inherit the advantages of their constituent algorithms. These results, coupled with the generality of our approach, make our algorithms practical and beneficial for deployment.},

In this paper, a more general, theoretically sound, targeted attack is proposed, which resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance term, taking into account the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of the input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm (referred to as JMA) provides an optimal solution to a linearised version of the adversarial example problem originally introduced by Szegedy et al. The results of the experiments confirm the generality of the proposed attack which is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes. Noticeably, JMA is also effective in a multi-label classification scenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the labels in complex multi-label classification scenarios, a capability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a further advantage, JMA requires very few iterations, thus resulting more efficient than existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The identification of encrypted network traffic presents a pivotal challenge in detecting unknown malicious traffic. Unlike closed-set identification, which primarily classifies known traffic classes, detecting unknown malicious traffic necessitates both accurate classification of known traffic and the identification of previously unseen traffic classes. Existing methods often face difficulties in effectively constraining the distribution size of known classes in the representation space and frequently misclassifying unknown classes as known. To address these challenges, we propose Open-Detect, a robust theoretical framework for detecting unknown malicious traffic, which leverages advanced deep learning techniques, such as variational autoencoders and Gaussian prototypes. Open-Detect introduces two primary constraints: a generative constraint, which enhances intra-class compactness, and a discriminative constraint, which optimizes inter-class separation. These constraints collectively mitigate the risks of misclassifying known classes and failing to detect unknown classes. In Open-Detect, network flows are transformed into grayscale images, and each known traffic class is mapped to a unique Gaussian prototype in the latent space. This design ensures tight clustering of samples within the same class and clear separation of samples between different classes. The detection of unknown malicious traffic is performed based on the distance between samples and these prototypes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple publicly available datasets substantiate the efficacy of Open-Detect. The results reveal significant improvements in intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, enabling superior performance in both closed-world and open-world scenarios, particularly for detecting unknown malicious traffic.

  abstract     = {Software-defined networks (SDNs) face significant challenges from link flooding attacks (LFAs), where malicious bots flood towards a limited number of hidden hosts, known as decoys, at a low rate. Efficient decoy identification is crucial for mitigating LFAs and is more resource-efficient than traditional bot detection methods, given the smaller number of decoys compared to bots. This paper proposes a novel decoy identification mechanism (DIM) that utilizes the SDN controller to generate forwarding rules for critical switches, enabling them to classify and report decoy addresses effectively. DIM addresses the challenges of minimizing communication overhead between the controller and data plane while maintaining high classification accuracy. It optimizes critical switch selection by partitioning the network into smaller areas, which reduces communication costs while maximizing monitoring efficiency. Within each area, DIM pre-trains random forest (RF) models for the selected switches and generates their respective binary-encoded forwarding rules. These rules empower the switches to identify decoy addresses in LFA traffic at line speed. The identified addresses are then reported back to DIM for further analysis. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that DIM scales efficiently in terms of time and space complexity. Our evaluation with the NS-3 simulator—using real CAIDA traffic and a synthesized topology of over 30,000 nodes—shows DIM achieves 98.3% decoy identification accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art models like LSTM and CNN in both accuracy and speed. Tests under routing changes and moving target defense scenarios confirm DIM’s robustness and adaptability, highlighting its practical effectiveness against LFAs.},

The theoretical faster-than-local convergence guarantee is backed up by extensive numerical results showing that for a considered scenario with 200 agents from two or three classes the proposed approach indeed converges much faster than a fully local approach, and performs comparably to the ideal (all-data-public) case.

  abstract     = {Models with large-scale parameters and pre-training have been leveraged for encrypted traffic analysis. However, existing researches primarily focused on accuracy, often overlooking the role of large-scale pre-trained parameters in enhancing robustness. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models trained from scratch can achieve high accuracy, they exhibit limited robustness. When subjected to network noise in real-world, their identification results can fluctuate significantly, which is unacceptable. Unfortunately, current robustness evaluation methods neglect samples diversity and employ unreasonable noise settings. This field still lacks a reasonable quantitative description of models robustness. In this paper, we propose the PA-curve to display the distribution of sample’s correct-decision stability, which can simultaneously reflect the model’s accuracy and robustness. By calculating the area under the PA-curve, called PA-area, we enable the quantitative assessment of robustness for encrypted traffic analysis. Furthermore, we design a pre-trained model based on packet length sequence, and pre-trained it on TB-scale traffic. By fine-tuning on limited labeled training data, it can achieve downstream analysis tasks. We conduct experiments on five encrypted traffic datasets with different tasks. Besides accuracy, we analyzed the robustness of the pre-trained model and existing methods under common network disturbances, including packet loss, retransmission, and disorder. Experimental results demonstrated that, compared to ML-based and DL-based models trained from scratch, the pre-trained model can not only achieve high accuracy, but also exhibit greater resilience to network noise.

  abstract     = {Encryption technologies randomize network communication to protect user privacy. However, attackers exploit encrypted traffic to conceal malicious activities. The existing detection methods rely primarily on traffic content or interactive patterns. Nevertheless, static methods can be easily obfuscated by advanced attacks. Since the set of potential attacks is open and infinite, models regularly lose effectiveness against novel attacks. Robust encrypted malicious traffic detection remains a valuable research area. In this paper, we propose BSTS-Net, a robust unsupervised encrypted malicious traffic detection model based entirely on traffic relations. The key motivations are to construct a relation-based traffic contextual representation and to establish dynamic baselines for anomaly detection. To represent local relations within flows, we innovatively introduce the concept of traffic microelements, which capture fine-grained interaction pattern relations. To integrate the global relationships between flows, we construct a traffic microelement space based on the Siamese neural network. Three optimization functions are proposed to optimize the intraservice, interservice and internode relations. For robust detection, we introduce a reputation-enhanced dynamic encrypted traffic detection algorithm that constructs dynamic baselines and continuously detects novel anomalies. We evaluate BSTS-Net through extensive experiments on three datasets and compare it with seven SOTA methods. Our results demonstrate its superiority, with an F1 score of more than 99.63% across all the datasets in multiclassification scenarios. Additionally, we simulate three adversarial scenarios for robustness analysis. Although the baseline methods experience an F1 score degradation of 32.21%, BSTS-Net achieves high performance, with only 1% degradation.},

The proposed scheme is designed based on the unique time and frequency domain statistical characteristics of OFDM signals. In the time domain (TD), a likelihood ratio test (LRT)-based decision rule is derived as a function of the inherent correlation between the cyclic prefix (CP) samples and their counterparts in the OFDM symbol. In addition, in the frequency domain (FD), a closed-form joint jamming detection and channel estimation scheme is derived using the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) principle as a function of the statistics of the received pilots and virtual subcarriers (VSCs) signals, which is then re-expressed using the generalized MAP ratio test (GMAPRT). The system’s complexity is reduced by applying the two stages sequentially, where the possible implementation of the second stage is conditioned on the outcome of the first stage. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations, where the results demonstrate its effectiveness compared to the TD-only and FD-only approaches. The results confirm the superior performance of the proposed scheme compared to the cyclostationary feature (CF)-based technique under various operating scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Differential privacy (DP) is introduced into many fields of AI to preserve privacy. However, introducing DP into AI models is extremely error-prone. To verify whether DP AI models can provide privacy guarantee (quantified by privacy budget) as these models claim, existing methods utilize attack methods to audit whether privacy budget of these models is the same as these models claim. To further improve precision of privacy budget auditing, we propose a brand new way to audit privacy budget, namely directly utilizing the parameters of DP AI models to audit privacy budget. In particular, our method utilizes statistical characteristics variance of the output distribution of DP mechanism to audit privacy budget of DP mechanism. DP AI models are regarded as data samples from output distribution of DP AI model training method and are utilized to approximate the variance of output distribution. The approximated variance is leveraged to estimate the variance of noise distribution of DP mechanism and through the relationship between noise variance and privacy budget, our method calculates the audited privacy budget through estimated noise variance. In addition, to reduce computation overhead, our method constructs parameter selection strategy to identify position whose parameter is suitable for privacy budget auditing. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our auditing method. Comparison results of five competitive auditing methods demonstrate that our method decreases MAE by 18.29% and decreases MSE by 23.17% on experiment datasets.},

Specifically, a hybrid analog-digital MIMO architecture is adopted, and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is deployed for wideband communication over frequency-selective mmWave channels. The antenna array structure and frequency selectivity of the system under investigation inherently endow it with multi-dimensional channel characteristics spanning the space, frequency, and time domains, which can be efficiently processed with tensor-based multi-dimensional signal processing techniques. The problem, based on tensor modeling of the system, is decomposed into three subproblems, namely analog beamforming, digital beamforming, and AN precoding. A low-complexity two-stage procedure is proposed to conduct analog beamforming, where a Tucker2 tensor decomposition subproblem is formulated to determine the analog combiners and part of the analog precoding matrix, and the remaining part of the precoding matrix is composed of arbitrary vectors satisfying the constant modulus constraint. The block-diagonalization algorithm is employed to design the digital beamforming and combining matrices to mitigate interference. For the AN precoding part, a statistical null-space algorithm based on higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) is proposed. Multiple AN precoding matrices on all subcarriers can be obtained simultaneously, and the AN-induced interference to the potential eavesdropper is maximized statistically to improve the secrecy of the communication. Simulation results show that, compared with existing matrix-based AN-aided secure HBF designs in the literature, the proposed tensor-based joint HBF and AN design leveraging multi-dimensional tensor signal processing provides improved secrecy performance with moderate complexity.},

Therefore, to date, there is no effective approach to detecting such vulnerabilities in modern Java web applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, called PCFinder, which leverages multi-level semantics- and context-analysis to conduct accurate permission-check identifications against real-world Java web infrastructures for access-control vulnerability detection. PCFinder successfully discovered 58 high-risk broken access control vulnerabilities, with 30 having been assigned CVE identifiers thus far, in analyzing 50 popular, real-world Java web applications. We also evaluate PCFinder on manually constructed ground-truth data and show that PCFinder achieved a high level of accuracy, i.e., a precision of 94.12% and a recall of 96.97% in identifying permission checks.},

However, as the UAV swarm scales up, the large number of UAVs poses challenges in data consensus, which is essential for decision-making in UAV tasks. In particular, due to the limited resources of UAVs and complex environments, data consensus for swarms requires low energy consumption, high robustness, and high security. To this end, we design a lightweight data consensus mechanism suitable for large-scale UAV swarms. Firstly, considering the high mobility of UAVs, we cluster the UAV swarms based on motion similarity to maintain the stability of clustering. Subsequently, we propose a consensus algorithm named FHotStuff, which achieves low resource consumption by integrating HotStuff and flexible round-optimized Schnorr threshold signatures (Frost). Then, we develop a cross-cluster consensus mechanism. By cooperating with intra-cluster and inter-cluster consensus processes, the mechanism efficiently achieves data consensus in large-scale UAV swarms. Security analyses and performance evaluations show that the proposed scheme can resist common attacks against UAV networks, and validate its lightweight and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a physical layer key generation (PLKG) scheme that utilizes artificial randomness in extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) near-field multi-user communications to produce shared secret keys for legitimate users. Unlike traditional PLKG schemes, which rely on the variation of wireless channels, this approach introduces noise power via the precoding vectors to create dynamic fluctuations in the line-of-sight (LoS) channels, emulating the rapid changes typically observed in fast-fading channels. This artificial randomness ensures that the user equipment (UEs) can generate secret keys while effectively preventing potential eavesdropping from malicious eavesdroppers. In particular, a novel channel probing protocol is designed, enabling multiple UEs to simultaneously agree on secret keys with the base station (BS) using non-orthogonal pilots, which exploits the difference in the distances and spatial angles of UEs in near-field communications. Secondly, to maximize the secret key rate, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed, solving two sub-optimization problems. The first sub-problem employs the singular value decomposition (SVD) method to identify the legitimate space and its orthogonal subspace for generating secret keys and preventing eavesdropping attacks, respectively. Subsequently, a Dinkelbach method-based power allocation algorithm is developed to allocate noise power to these two spaces. The second sub-problem uses a water-filling algorithm to implement power allocation among multiple UEs. Finally, to address the issue of precoding noise not being considered in the alternating optimization problem, a deep learning-based method is introduced, which further improves the performance of the scheme. Simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed PLKG scheme over existing schemes.},

In this study, we propose CELEST (CollaborativE LEarning for Scalable Threat detection), a federated machine learning framework for global threat detection over HTTP, which is one of the most commonly used protocols for malware dissemination and communication. CELEST leverages federated learning in order to collaboratively train a global model across multiple clients who keep their data locally. Through a novel active learning component integrated with the federated learning technique, our system continuously discovers and learns the behavior of new, evolving, and globally-coordinated cyber threats. We show that CELEST is able to expose attacks that are largely invisible to individual organizations. For instance, in one challenging attack scenario with data exfiltration malware, the global model achieves a three-fold increase in Precision-Recall AUC compared to the local model. We also design a poisoning detection and mitigation method, DTrust, for federated learning in the collaborative threat detection domain. We deploy CELEST on two university networks and show that it is able to detect the malicious HTTP communication with high precision and low false positive rates. Furthermore, during its deployment, CELEST detected a set of 42 previously unknown malicious URLs and 20 malicious domains in one day, which were confirmed to be malicious by VirusTotal.},

In this paper, we propose an unlinkable avatar authentication scheme, UAVA, which leverages cryptographic group signatures to enable metaverse users to create and certify their avatars without interaction with service providers. These certified avatars can then be anonymously authenticated, ensuring unlinkability between multiple avatars belonging to the same user. UAVA maintains anonymity between users and their avatars, while allowing service providers to trace malicious avatars back to their users.

Vaccine, a recent alignment-stage defense, applies uniform perturbation to all layers of embedding to make the model robust to the simulated embedding drift. However, applying layer-wise uniform perturbation may lead to excess perturbations for some particular non-safety-critical layers, resulting in defense performance degradation and unnecessary memory consumption. To address this limitation, we propose a Targeted Vaccine (T-Vaccine), a memory-efficient safety alignment method that applies perturbation to only selected layers of the model. T-Vaccine follows two core steps: First, it uses the harmful gradient norm as a statistical metric to identify the safety-critical layers. Second, instead of applying uniform perturbation across all layers, T-Vaccine only applies perturbation to the safety-critical layers while keeping other layers frozen during training. Results show that T-Vaccine outperforms Vaccine in terms of both defense effectiveness and resource efficiency. Comparison with other defense baselines, e.g., RepNoise and TAR also demonstrate the superiority of T-Vaccine. Notably, T-Vaccine is the first defense that enables a fine-tuning-based alignment method for 7B pre-trained models trained on consumer GPUs with limited memory (e.g., RTX 4090).},

To address this, we propose a cross-modal driven object restoration framework that leverages 3D reconstruction to mitigate backdoor attacks. Specifically, we introduce a cross-modal semantic encoding module that projects 3D point clouds into multi-view depth maps and utilizes CLIP to extract aligned text-image features, providing semantic guidance for 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, we leverage cross-modal information as conditional guidance to drive dynamic diffusion-based 3D reconstruction and adaptively fuse semantic and geometric features through a gated self-conditioned modulator. This module dynamically selects features for fusion, effectively mitigating noise interference and distribution shifts during latent diffusion, significantly enhancing robustness to noise, and thereby achieving precise restoration of clean point clouds. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart datasets demonstrate that our method robustly defends against adaptive attacks under varying noise levels and significantly restores classification performance degraded by backdoor triggers.},

  abstract     = {Applying differential privacy (DP) to federated learning (FL) effectively safeguards participants’ training data against privacy threats, yet the stringent availability requirements of FL present a significant challenge in optimizing accuracy while ensuring privacy. Integrating differential privacy continuous data release (DPCR) into private FL mitigates the errors accumulating on intermediate parameter models securely, thereby enhancing accuracy, with performance gains driven by developing advanced DPCR models. In this context, we propose a k-ary Tree-based DPCR (kTCR) model to provide deeper and more flexible error optimization, thereby promoting a robust accuracy enhancement for private FL. Our kTCR model introduces Variance Optimal Estimation (VOE) and privacy budget allocation (PBA) methods to optimize accuracy, posing significant efficiency challenges simultaneously. With rigorous mathematical analysis, we reduce the computational complexity of VOE from O(t3) to O(lg t), then introduce a meta-factor method that transforms the challenging PBA issues into a convex optimization problem with significantly reduced variables (e.g., a 3-ary tree with 5.23 × 109 nodes requiring only 61 variables), thus yielding high efficiencies. Our experiments on classical datasets demonstrate that our kTCR model with appropriate k outperforms the state-of-the-art ABCRG by 0.7% ~ 2.0% in accuracy and traditional private FL by 5.5% ~ 18.7%. Further experiments demonstrate that adjusting the arity k effectively reduces the Pre-aggregation Error, leading to a further 2.09% accuracy gain. Our achievements both improve the accuracy of private FL and provide new insights into building high-availability FL with DP.},

  abstract     = {The flourishing online social networks provide natural and ideal channels for covert communication, especially image batch steganography, which is characterized by high capacity and efficiency. To address the challenges of covert and reliable messaging, an image robust batch steganography framework (Multi-Stega) is proposed. Utilizing separable steganalysis feature selection and difference measurement, Multi-Stega first designs an embedding sign function to describe steganographic distortion, aiming directly at improving resistance against steganalysis. Then, Multi-Stega applies a cover selection algorithm based on steganographic fitness and a payload distribution strategy based on multi-stage decision optimization, to realize message allocation with minimum embedding signs. On this basis, Multi-Stega can employ any image robust steganography algorithm and universal joint source-channel code to facilitate message embedding and extraction. To analyze its validity, instances are implemented and compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the separable feature selection provides strong support for precise embedding signs measurement, and Multi-Stega can enhance the detection resistance of representative robust steganography algorithms by 35.10% on average. Covert communication tests on Facebook and Weibo also indicate the concealment and reliability of Multi-Stega, which shows the prospect of practical applications.},

In this paper, we shall invent and analyze a new security primitive that is specifically designed for WPAN. For WPAN, wireless channel-based SKG has been proposed but was not widely deployed due to its critical dependence on the channel’s entropy which is uncontrollable. We formulate a different approach: We still exploit channel properties but mainly hinge on the reciprocity of the wireless channel and not on the channel’s entropy. The radio advantage comes from the use of full duplex communication. We show that in this situation both legitimate parties can agree on a common secret key even without ever probing the channel at all. At the core is a new bisparse blind deconvolution scheme for which we prove correctness and information-theoretic, i.e. perfect, security. We show that, ultimately, a secret key can be extracted and give a lower bound for the number of secret key bits which is then verified by experiments.},

  abstract     = {Leveraging recent advances in wireless communication, IoT, and AI, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) played an important role in reducing traffic congestion and enhancing user experience. Within ITS, navigational recommendation systems (NRS) are essential for helping users simplify route choices in urban environments. However, NRS are vulnerable to information-based attacks that can manipulate both the NRS and users to achieve the objectives of the malicious entities. This study aims to assess the risks of misinformed demand attacks, where attackers use techniques like Sybil-based attacks to manipulate the demands of certain origins and destinations considered by the NRS. We propose a game-theoretic framework for proactive risk assessment of demand attacks (PRADA) and treat the interaction between attackers and the NRS as a Stackelberg game. Specifically, we consider the case of local-targeted attacks, in which the attacker aims to make the NRS recommend the authentic users towards a specific road that favors certain groups. Our analysis unveils the equivalence between users’ incentive compatibility and Wardrop equilibrium recommendations and shows that the NRS and its users are at high risk when encountering intelligent attackers who can significantly alter user routes by strategically fabricating non-existent demands. To mitigate these risks, we introduce a trust mechanism that leverages users’ confidence in the integrity of the NRS, and show that it can effectively reduce the impact of misinformed demand attacks. Numerical experiments are used to corroborate the results and support our discussion of the Resilience Paradox, where locally targeted attacks can sometimes benefit the overall traffic conditions. Our framework not only assists risk assessment in automating the evaluation process and estimating potential impacts but also aligns with standards like ISO/IEC 27005, offering a proactive approach to managing risks in ITS.},

  abstract     = {With the deployment of the QUIC protocol, website fingerprinting attacks targeting QUIC traffic are becoming a growing concern. Since the deployment is incremental, attackers must continuously crawl the QUIC traffic of new QUIC-enabled websites to update their attack models. For the latency caused by data crawling and classifier training, existing few-shot website fingerprinting (FSWF) attacks rely on representation learning to mitigate data dependency. To further achieve zero-latency identification, TCP traffic can be applied to construct the attack model before QUIC deployment. However, the different protocol semantics of TCP and QUIC lead to differences in the latent features. As representation learning models cannot eliminate the website feature differences, classifiers trained on TCP-based features are difficult to adapt to QUIC traffic. To address the issue, we propose a novel cross-protocol FSWF attack method to fuse cross-protocol website features. The proposed method forces TCP features and QUIC features to be in the same feature space by sharing model parameters, and reduces cross-protocol website feature differences through inter-protocol adversarial representation learning. Meanwhile, it utilizes a non-linear classifier to fit the fused features. The proposed method enables zero-latency identification for QUIC traffic based on a few TCP traffic. We conducted comprehensive evaluation experiments on public datasets from both closed-world and open-world settings. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-latency identification.},

It is generally considered that asymmetric cryptographic primitives are indispensable to achieve security goals, which are burdensome for resource-limited devices. That is, the literature is being stuck with the security-efficiency tension. In this paper, we propose a 2FA protocol only resorting to symmetric primitives. Specifically, with the puncturable pseudorandom function, the proposed protocol hits three birds: it achieves three subtle security goals, i.e., resisting offline password guessing attacks, perfect forward secrecy and anonymity. It alleviates the long-standing security-efficiency conflict that is considered intractable in the literature. The proposed protocol is provably secure within the harshest adversary model to date. Furthermore, the evaluation results demonstrate that our protocol is the optimal choice when considering both security and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In the hard-label black-box setting, existing attack methods randomly select words for perturbation, generating invalid word replacement operations, resulting in low attack success rate. Recent works alleviate this problem by evaluating the impact of words on model predictions, but they can only evaluate the impact of words on model predictions, not the impact of words on attack. If the attacker replaces too many words that have significant impact on the text semantics during the attack process, the adversarial example has poor semantics and the attack behavior is easily detected. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a two-factor word scoring method, which uses the attention score output by the pre-attack model and the semantic similarity after word replacement to evaluate the impact of the word on attack. Based on the scoring method, this paper proposes a query-efficient hard-label black-box adversarial attack method called F2Attack. F2Attack uses the two-factors method to score words, and then replaces words have great impact on the model prediction but small impact on text semantics based on scoring results to generate the initialized adversarial example. Then, F2Attack adopts the simulated annealing algorithm to optimize the semantic similarity of the adversarial example. We conduct experiments on four representative natural language models, seven text classification datasets, two natural language inference datasets, and four commercial APIs, and compared them with baseline methods. When the number of queries is limited to 100, F2Attack increases the attack success rate by an average of 15.165%, and the semantic similarity by 0.067, which is significantly better than the baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Specific emitter identification (SEI) is a security authentication technology by utilizing radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) features. However, current mainstream RFF feature extraction methods based on neural networks (NNs) generally suffer from poor interpretability and difficulties in architecture optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel convolution-enhanced swin vision transformer (CoSwinVIT) that combines filter characteristics of NN architectures to achieve a uniform spectrum response. Specifically, we treat the NN used in SEI tasks as filters and investigate their filter characteristics by applying Fourier transforms to hidden vectors. Through spectral analysis, we found that different NN architectures exhibit significantly different responses to the signal spectrum. This affects the model’s sensitivity to specific frequency bands of the signal, thereby influencing its accuracy (Acc). Subsequently, by integrating the filtering properties of swin vision transformer (SwinVIT) and convolutional neural network (CNN), we achieve a uniform spectral response design. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the CoSwinVIT architecture, we design both a supervised learning algorithm and a contrastive learning-based self-supervised algorithm. Experimental results on a real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) dataset indicate that CoSwinVIT provides a more uniform spectrum response. Under supervised learning, the proposed CoSwinVIT obtains the accuracies of 98.6% and 99.8% on the ADS-B and WiFi datasets, respectively. Under self-supervised learning with 5% and 10% labeled data, the accuracies of 73.6% and 86.3% are achieved on the ADS-B dataset, and the accuracies of 81.6% and 91.5% are achieved on the WiFi dataset. These results surpass the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods used in the SEI tasks.},
