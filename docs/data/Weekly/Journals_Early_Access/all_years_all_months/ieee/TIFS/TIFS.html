  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to training data extraction attacks due to data memorization. This paper introduces a novel attack scenario wherein an attacker adversarially fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs to amplify the exposure of the original training data. Unlike prior TDE methods that mainly rely on post-hoc querying or prompt selection to elicit memorized content from a fixed model, our strategy directly alters the model’s parameters to intensify its retention of the pre-training dataset. To achieve this, the attacker needs to collect generated texts that are closely aligned with the pre-training data. However, without knowledge of the actual dataset, quantifying the amount of pre-training data within generated texts is challenging. To address this, we propose the use of pseudo-labels for these generated texts, leveraging membership approximations indicated by machine-generated probabilities from the target LLMusing DetectGPT. We subsequently fine-tune the LLM via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to favor generations with higher likelihoods of originating from the pre-training data, based on these membership probabilities. Our empirical findings indicate a remarkable outcome: LLMs with over 1B parameters exhibit a four to eight-fold increase in training data exposure. We discuss potential mitigations and suggest future research directions.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a security mechanism against inference attacks for industrial systems where an adversary with access to the states of a (linear or nonlinear) system attempts to infer the system model using the state values. Under an inference attack, an adversary with access to the sensor measurements of the system attempts to infer the system’s parameters. The proposed security mechanism consists of two components: (i) a collection of feedback control gains, (ii) a randomized gain selection policy. To mitigate the inference attack, the gain selection policy randomly selects a feedback gain from the set of available feedback control gains at regular intervals. We cast the optimal design of the gain selection policy as an optimization problem such that (i) quadratic control cost is minimized and (ii) the uncertainty level of the adversary about selected control gain is maximized. In our formulation, the uncertainty level of the adversary about the control gain is captured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between a uniform distribution and the posterior distribution of the feedback gains, given the history of the system states. We first derive the backward Bellman optimality equation for the gain selection problem and study the structural properties of the optimal gain selection policy. Our results show that the optimal gain selection policy only depends on the current state of the system, rather than the entire history of the states, which renders the optimal gain selection problem to a nonlinear Markov decision process. Next, we derive a policy gradient theorem for the gain selection problem, which provides an expression for the gradient of the objective function of the gain selection problem with respect to the parameter of a stationary (time-invariant) policy. The policy gradient theorem allows us to develop a stochastic gradient descent algorithm for computing an optimal policy. We finally demonstrate the effectiveness of our results for different linear and nonlinear systems. Our results indicate that the proposed security mechanism significantly decreases the inference ability of the adversary, while having a negligible impact on the control cost.},

  abstract     = {Backdoor attacks have become a security threat to deep neural networks (DNNs), in which an attacker embeds a secret behavior into a DNN by poisoning a few training data. To address the backdoor threat, some defense strategies employ outlier detection algorithms to identify poisoned samples in hidden representation space. However, these defenses remain vulnerable to adaptive attacks as their representation separability assumption could be broken. In this paper, we aim to boost existing defenses by leveraging insights from the label smoothing technique, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing poison from benign samples. Our analysis uncovers the role of label smoothing as a regularization technique that enhances hidden class separability in the penultimate layer of a model. Building on the label smoothing, we introduce Learning Speed-driven Label Smoothing (LS2): a simple yet novel approach that assigns an adaptive smoothing rate based on the model’s “learning speed” for each sample. Extensive results show that LS2 can bolster the discernibility between poison and benign samples, enhancing the efficacy of defenses relying on hidden separability. Incorporated with LS2, existing hidden-separation-based defenses achieve state-of-the-art poison sample removal rates (Prm) against adaptive attacks.

  abstract     = {The advent of blockchain technology has led to the development of decentralized storage networks, revolutionizing the way data are stored and accessed and offering advantages such as cost-effective services, improved data sovereignty, and resistance to censorship. However, nodes of decentralized storage networks cannot be fully trusted and data stored in them may not be as secure and intact as claimed. Therefore, how to guarantee the storage service quality in decentralized storage networks is still a major problem to be solved. In this paper, we propose DART, a distributed zero knowledge data auditing scheme for blockchain-based decentralized storage networks, periodically authenticating both the integrity and the retrievability of data in decentralized storage networks. We design an efficient integrity auditing protocol for decentralized nodes based on distributed zero knowledge protocols, which improves the performance of auditing whilst maintaining low cost with zero knowledge protocols. Furthermore, we introduce the erasure code in decentralized storage networks to support data retrievability across decentralized nodes. By leveraging accumulator techniques to design a dual accumulation strategy, we build a batch verification approach to improve the communication and computation efficiency in data retrieval checking. We analyze the security of DART under the random oracle model and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. Experimental results affirm that DART outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in decentralized storage networks, reducing the overhead in both the storage and verification phases by more than 70%. Moreover, this performance advantage becomes increasingly pronounced with larger file sizes, underscoring the scalability and practicality of DART.},

  abstract     = {Passwords remain one of the most widely used forms of authentication in modern systems. However, their inherent predictability, stemming from common user behaviors in password creation, renders password-based authentication vulnerable to guessing attacks. To balance memorability and security, users often construct isomorphic variants of a base password by altering its structure, such as transforming 123abc into 1a2b3c. These variants pose significant challenges to traditional password guessing models. In particular, mainstream approaches such as Markov model and Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) model struggle to capture the structural relationships among these variants. To address this challenge, we propose PassGIN, a password guessing framework based on Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN). By modeling a password as a graph, PassGIN captures both local adjacency and character rearrangement patterns, enabling the model to distinguish subtle structural differences between base passwords and their isomorphic variants. To further enhance performance, we introduce PassCluster, a dynamic edge-weighting mechanism that leverages adjacency frequencies observed in large-scale password datasets. This allows GIN to more effectively learn structural variations and generate accurate guesses. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that PassGIN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both intra-site and cross-site password guessing scenarios, achieving relative improvements of 23.49% and 74.53%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Including TOR, most of the anonymous communication systems adopt source routing, that the source has to share the globally consistent view of all relays and maintain the up-to-date information. To increase the scalability of TOR, researchers mainly utilize hop-by-hop routing during circuit extension. However, hop-by-hop routing has not been widely deployed since it suffers from route capture attacks, and most of the countermeasures require the source participate in the route extension indirectly, help verify the selection of next hop by intermediate nodes, thus introduces communication overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel routing scheme called Jump Routing. In jump routing, the route extension follows the jumping way, that each relay chooses the successor of the next hop rather than the next hop itself. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to route in the jumping way. In addition, to defend route capture attacks, enhance data privacy, and defend collusion attacks, we propose multiple schemes including jump verification, jump encryption, and corporative jump verification. Different from previous measures on route capture attacks, jump routing does not need the participation of the source, but deals with the attack by intermediate nodes only. We manage to realize the full jump routing prototype, and the evaluation results show that our jump routing is scalable, lightweight, and resilient.},

Specifically, model-hopping coding is designed to implement an enhanced method of semantic coding by adaptive model selection, boosting transmission reliability over multipath channels. Considering that semantic coding is a natural protection layer, a double-layer semantic encryption method is proposed, which can improve the encryption effects in severe information leakage scenarios. The experimental results show MHSCS increases legitimate receivers’ image recovery performance by up to 18.60% under strong multipath effects compared to baselines’ optimal performance and prevents up to 81.87% of privacy leakage in severe leakage scenarios.},

While current research has predominantly focused on data source analysis for identifying known attack patterns or anomalous behaviors, three critical challenges remain inadequately addressed: 1) APTs demonstrate sophisticated concealment capabilities, embedding malicious operations within legitimate business activities; 2) The sparse nature of APT attacks leads to low-frequency malicious activities that prove exceptionally challenging to detect within massive log datasets; 3) APTs employ multi-stage attack chains, whereas existing solutions exhibit limitations in reconstructing complete attack pathways to enable effective forensic analysis. In this paper, we address the detrimental effects of the sparsity of malevolent interactions and attack intent camouflaging on anomaly detection by introducing SAURONEYES, the pioneering APT detection system tailored to resolve these challenges. SAURONEYES constructs audit logs into both knowledge and interaction views, disentangling these to learn representations through graph learning enhanced with an attention-based neighbor allocation mechanism. Additionally, we incorporate self-supervised contrastive learning to discern the subtle similarities and distinctions among disentangled samples, facilitating a deeper understanding of the inherent structures within system interactions. SAURONEYES thus boasts heightened sensitivity and granular detection capabilities. Finally, SAURONEYES reconstructs the attack chain at the node level and presents an attack-chain that is more accessible for security analysis. Our evaluations in real-world scenarios and simulated attack environments demonstrate that SAURONEYES achieves outstanding accuracy, with an average detection rate of 99% and a false positive rate below 0.1%.},

However, its design does not include protections against attacks exploiting intermediate data leakage. Since Ravi and Bruinderink introduced schemes to forge Dilithium signatures, numerous works have leveraged power analysis attack to exploit vulnerabilities in Dilithium implementations. In this paper, we revisit previous attacks and identify promising optimization strategies for hints-oriented attacks. In such attacks, an adversary first utilizes side-channel leakage to derive hint equations related to the secret key and then solves for the secret key using these equations. Our new strategy enables each signature to generate more valid hint equations, significantly reducing the number of required signatures for a successful attack. By incorporating machine learning techniques, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we can efficiently detect hint equations with high accuracy. Furthermore, by combining a lattice-based algorithm with hybrid filtering methods, our scheme can further reduce the required number of hint equations. Additionally, our attack method is applicable to Dilithium security levels 2, 3, and 5. For Dilithium-2, the proposed attack successfully recovers the complete secret key even under low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions, requiring 395, 330, and 305 signatures at SNRs of 0.0167, 0.0210, and 0.0406, respectively.},

In order to reduce user overhead, the data owner stores the location information and text data on the cloud server, and the user completes the retrieval task with the help of the fog server. To protect the privacy of outsourced data, many secure spatial keyword retrieval schemes have been proposed. Most schemes use R-tree indexes to improve the efficiency of ciphertext retrieval, but the encrypted R-tree index is hard to update. Moreover, some indexes based on order-preserving encryption are vulnerable to frequency-revealing attacks. So how to balance efficiency and security is a problem. To solve the above problems, we propose an efficient and secure spatial keyword ciphertext retrieval scheme based on cloud-fog collaboration. First, we innovatively design the SK-tree. The Geohash algorithm and Simhash algorithm are used in SK-tree to compress information, achieving efficient retrieval. Secondly, our retrieval tree has the function of fuzzy order preservation, which can better hide the correspondence between plaintext and ciphertext compared to traditional index-based order-preserving encryption schemes. In addition, we design a cloud-fog-user interaction scheme for attribute-based encryption that can hide access control policies, which reduces the computational overhead for the user side. Finally, we prove through theoretical analysis that our scheme ensures cloud data security and query trap information privacy.

  abstract     = {Automated Program Repair (APR) repairs software bugs based on buggy code snippets automatically. It is instrumental in reducing the time and effort required for software maintenance. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been utilized for APR and demonstrated promising results. Existing APR approaches adopt an LLM learning paradigm of either prompt engineering or fine-tuning to perform APR tasks. However, these prompt-based approaches underutilize the extensive high-quality bug-fix datasets available in the APR community, missing out on valuable repair knowledge. Conversely, fine-tuning-based APRs rely on LLMs to autonomously understand the entire complex APR tasks without the benefit of natural language guidance through a prompt. Additionally, the crucial bug information the bug-triggering test suites provided remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, while existing APRs focus only on repair effectiveness, they neglect the patch ranking effectiveness that also matters in real-world program repair scenarios. To address the above limitations, we propose InstructRepair, an innovative APR framework that integrates self-supervised instruction tuning with rich bug information to guide LLMs in generating high-quality patches. InstructRepair instructs APR tasks through detailed instructions and enhances repair performance by training LLMs over the first instructional APR dataset we construct. InstructRepair also extracts rich bug information (e.g., buggy line, bug’s context, bug’s diagnostics, test suites and meta-information) to provide fix-relevant tokens and insights into the root causes of bugs for LLMs during both instruction tuning and the repairing process. The human domain knowledge initiated instruction template that integrates this bug information is refined through prompt tuning, which learns task-specific knowledge and unleashes the hidden power stored in pre-trained LLMs automatically. We evaluate InstructRepair on the widely adopted Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks with Java programming language, demonstrating that our work outperforms seven state-of-the-art APR approaches by successfully fixing a total of 122 bugs (10 more than the best baseline) and repairing 19 unique bugs that previous work cannot. In terms of patch ranking effectiveness, InstructRepair also achieves the best performance with a fixing rate of 95.9% (60.0% as the best baseline). The ablation study further validates the contributions of each component to overall repairing performance. We also apply InstructRepair to the Python programming language and beat four state-of-the-art APR approaches, which demonstrates our method’s cross-language generalization capability.},

To this end, this paper proposes a new physical layer authentication scheme that leverages the channel characteristics of cascaded channels in RIS-assisted systems. Specifically, we model the cascaded communication channel in the RIS-assisted communication system as an equivalent point-to-point Nakagami fading channel. Based on this model, we formulate the problem of physical layer authentication (PLA) as a binary hypothesis testing problem. To facilitate this, we employ the energy measurement of the received signal as the test statistic to achieve detecting the legality of the transmitter identity. We conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the false alarm probability and detection probability for single-channel and multi-channel scenarios to evaluate authentication performance, using statistical signal processing theory. Finally, we conducted extensive Monte Carlo simulations to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed authentication scheme.},

  abstract     = {With the growing complexity and diversity of network attacks, single defense methods are no longer sufficient to meet modern cybersecurity needs, necessitating comprehensive measures to manage the entire attack-defense landscape. Situational awareness systems address this by analyzing multi-source information to assess security postures and predict trends. Traditional methods suffer from low prediction accuracy due to data imbalance, reliance on expert experience, and information loss. To address these issues, this paper proposes a deep neural network-based model for cybersecurity situational awareness. The model first extracts situational elements using a variational self-encoder with an integration strategy, trained on normal data and optimized with random weight averaging to enhance robustness and identify anomalies. It then assesses the security posture by extracting features from heterogeneous data with a neural network and applying an attention-based feature fusion method, combined with one-dimensional convolutional neural networks to reduce reliance on expert knowledge. Finally, the model predicts the security posture using a sample convolution and interaction unit, capturing temporal dependencies while mitigating information loss with a cross-channel module. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in addressing key challenges in cybersecurity situational awareness, with a 14% improvement in accuracy compared to the baseline model.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for defending against presentation attacks in complex attack types and high-security scenarios. However, existing multi-modal FAS methods encounter two main limitations: (1) Most methods rely on classification supervision, which often fails to fully capture the distinctions between real faces and presentation attacks (PAs). (2) These methods depend solely on source domain data with limited PA types, leading to significant performance degradation when encountering unseen PA types and scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion framework called Fine-grained Textual Guidance Multi-Modal Face Anti-Spoofing (FTG-FAS), which aligns natural language descriptions with multi-modal fused features to guide learning. Specifically, we propose a textual-guided token dropout module to select semantic invariant patch tokens for multi-modal fusion, thereby enhancing the model’s generalization capability. In the testing phase, we propose FTG-FAS++, which leverages a self-distillation scheme with online source-free adaptation to further enhance model’s performance in unseen scenarios. Specifically, we establish a teacher-student distillation framework, where the teacher model is fed with the complete image while the student model only receives masked tokens. During adaptation, we minimize the prediction discrepancy between the teacher and student in a unidirectional manner. Meanwhile, we propose a class-balanced sample selection strategy for stable source-free adaptation to prevent the model from overfitting to either real or spoof during the tuning process. Experiments show that FTG-FAS and FTG-FAS++ outperform SOTA methods by 6.91% and 8.72% in AUC on the cross-dataset leave-one-out protocols.

  abstract     = {Reconstruction attackers can exploit facial features to recover the original user’s face, resulting in user privacy leakage. One new strategy to enhance the “Edge-Cloud” face recognition system’s privacy is to add adversarial perturbations to facial features, preventing the attackers from high-quality user image recovery. However, the existing works following this strategy suffer from unacceptable damage to face recognition accuracy. Achieving robust privacy enhancement and face recognition accuracy simultaneously is still challenging. To tackle this challenge, we propose an adversarial perturbation-based plug-and-play privacy-enhancing method (Patronus) with robustness against face image reconstruction attacks and near-lossless face recognition performance. The key insight is derived from our observation that the feature distance between two face images of the same person is significantly lower than the threshold set in the face recognition system. This leaves room for adding adversarial perturbations to the facial features without compromising face recognition accuracy. Our strategy limits the amount of adversarial perturbations in a fine-grained manner to ensure that they are within the range of not damaging face recognition accuracy. Our evaluation shows the superior performance of Patronus in robustness against reconstruction attacks and near-lossless face recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Patronus can be easily integrated into deployed face recognition systems as a plug-in privacy-enhancing module with low overhead.},

To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative approach named feature fusion transitional domain (F2TD-Reid), which comprises two essential components: the dictionary fusion module (DFM) and the transitional domain attention module (TDAM). Among them, the DFM utilizes a feature fusion to extract and reconstruct pedestrian images from instances, focusing on capturing the essential visual elements within the images. For the TDAM, it further refines the feature extraction of instance points through an innovative weighted attention mechanism. These two modules optimize the generation process of scaling factors, thereby facilitating the transfer of knowledge between the source domain and the target domain.

Despite this, most current defense models with complex network architectures and optimization objectives are typically designed based on specific feature assumptions or attack manifestations, and do not enhance the inherent robustness of GCNs. They also overlook the changes induced by perturbations of varying intensities and the difference in attack phenomenon across different datasets. In response to this, we have delved into the impact of adversarial attacks on the spectrum, and propose an effective adaptive robust spectrum filter GCN (ASF-GCN). This approach enhances the robustness of GCN models through adaptive filtering without introducing additional conditional assumptions. We theoretically analyze that graphs have different robust frequency intervals under different conditions, validating the necessity of adaptive filtering. Additionally, we elucidate the role of degree distribution and maximum eigenvalue in adaptation. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs reveal that our model surpasses other defense models in overall performance.},

  abstract     = {In Federated Learning (FL), clients share gradients with a central server while keeping their data local. However, malicious servers could deliberately manipulate the models to reconstruct clients’ data from shared gradients, posing significant privacy risks. Although such Active Gradient Leakage Attacks (AGLAs) have been widely studied, they suffer from two severe limitations: (i) coverage: no existing AGLAs can reconstruct all samples in a batch from the shared gradients; (ii) stealthiness: no existing AGLAs can evade principled checks of clients. In this paper, we address these limitations with two core contributions. First, we introduce a new theoretical analysis approach, which uniformly models AGLAs as backdoor poisoning. This analysis approach reveals that the core principle of AGLAs is to bias the gradient space to prioritize the reconstruction of a small subset of samples while sacrificing the majority, which theoretically explains the above limitations of existing AGLAs. Second, we propose Enhanced Gradient Global Vulnerability (EGGV), the first AGLA that achieves complete attack coverage while evading client-side detection. In particular, EGGV employs a gradient projector and a jointly optimized discriminator to assess gradient vulnerability, steering the gradient space toward the point most prone to data leakage. Extensive experiments show that EGGV achieves complete attack coverage and surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) with at least a 43% increase in reconstruction quality (PSNR) and a 45% improvement in stealthiness (D-SNR).},

These attacks are pernicious when attackers inject a trigger into the input data without altering its ground-truth label, known as clean-label backdoor attacks. The effectiveness and stealth of existing clean-label backdoor attacks rely on access to global training data, making them resource-intensive and impractical. This paper introduces a novel clean-label backdoor attack that achieves high attack success rates (ASR) while maintaining exceptional stealth under realistic constraints. Unlike prior approaches focused on spatial differences between clean and poisoned data, a key novelty of the new attack is the suppression of high-frequency components in the frequency domain, which minimizes human-detectable contrasts and enhances trigger imperceptibility. Moreover, we employ an affine combination of static and adaptive triggers, effectively balancing their strengths to maximize ASR. Surrogate models are designed to simulate victim model behavior and auxiliary models are applied to extract the spatial and frequency features of the static triggers, enabling trigger design with minimal knowledge of the victim model. Our attack achieves a higher ASR than state-of-the-art backdoor attacks while maintaining higher benign accuracy across various models and datasets. It also demonstrates strong resistance against the latest defense mechanisms, including STRIP, SentiNet, neural cleanse, fine-pruning, and ANP.},

Traditional defense methods often rely on access to detailed model information, which raises privacy concerns, as model owners may be reluctant to share such data. In contrast, existing black-box defense methods fail to offer a universal defense against various types of adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce DUCD, a universal black-box defense method that does not require access to the target model’s parameters or architecture. Our approach involves distilling the target model by querying it with data, creating a white-box surrogate while preserving data privacy. We further enhance this surrogate model using a certified defense based on randomized smoothing and optimized noise selection, enabling robust defense against a broad range of adversarial attacks. Comparative evaluations between the certified defenses of the surrogate and target models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments on multiple image classification datasets show that DUCD not only outperforms existing black-box defenses but also matches the accuracy of white-box defenses, all while enhancing data privacy and reducing the success rate of membership inference attacks.},

To address the trade-off between privacy preservation and efficiency, this paper introduces FedPN, a novel privacy-preserving approach that leverages periodic neuron technique, ensuring both enhanced privacy and efficient model training. Specifically, we propose a lightweight obfuscation mechanism integrated into the model’s input layer, where a specialized obfuscation layer is designed to ensure privacy, exploiting the synergistic interaction between convolutional operations and nonlinear activation functions to enhance feature extraction. We further integrate this privacy protection mechanism into FL model training, where the obfuscation layer is shared globally among all clients, aiming to achieve an optimal trade-off between the learnability and confidentiality of obfuscated features. In contrast to Homomorphic Encryption, our approach eliminates the need for heavy homomorphic operations, maintaining a practical level of training efficiency. Our theoretical analysis proves an exponentially negligible privacy guarantee against successful feature reconstruction attacks, with the success probability bounded by o(γ−m), where the frequency parameter γ > 1 and dimension of obfuscated vector m > 0. In addition, extensive experiments show that FedPN significantly enhances defence against feature reconstruction, while maintaining comparable efficiency and accuracy to existing approaches such as Differential Privacy.},

To overcome this challenge, we utilize the potential of multi-antenna and introduce a new device-specific feature called Relative-RFF (R-RFF), which represents the relation between different RF chains in a multi-antenna transmitter. We propose an enhanced ZF post-equalization algorithm to eliminate the multipath channels and preserve the users’ R-RFF to the greatest extent. We evaluate the robustness of R-RFF under various channel conditions and noise levels and the performance of R-RFF in terms of identification accuracy under different channel scenarios.

The key contributions of ARBiBench include: 1) systematically evaluating the robustness of seven influential BCNN methods across various architectures; 2) rigorous validation of diverse adversarial attack methods; and 3) novel empirical findings showing that BCNNs exhibit weaker robustness than full-precision networks on small datasets but surprisingly stronger robustness on large-scale datasets. Leveraging Information Bottleneck theory, we further demonstrate how data scale and model capacity collectively determine BCNNs’ adversarial robustness. These findings not only challenge conventional assumptions about BCNN security, but also provide new insights for developing robust yet efficient neural network architectures.},

  abstract     = {The spatio-temporal (ST) mobility patterns derived from trajectory data are crucial for applications such as location-based services and urban analytics. However, releasing these mobility features raises significant privacy concerns, as they may expose sensitive personal location information. Differential privacy (DP) is widely used to safeguard individual privacy during data releases, but existing methods for releasing ST features often suffer from utility loss because their high dimensionality requires injecting substantial noise to meet privacy guarantees. Several recent approaches attempt to address this issue by reducing noise in differentially private spatio-temporal (DPST) features, but they either discard valuable information while compressing noisy data representations or rely solely on restrictive road network topology constraints, resulting in only modest utility improvements. In this paper, we present DPDeno, a post-processing framework designed to significantly enhance the utility of DPST features. First, DPDeno generates synthetic trajectory datasets using public information (e.g., road network data) and applies existing DP methods to create paired DPST (noisy) and ST (clean) features. It then trains a spatio-temporal graph autoencoder (STGAE), which models each feature as a graph, with road segments as nodes and transitions over time as edges. By minimizing node- and edge-level reconstruction losses between the noisy and clean pairs, STGAE learns to refine DPST inputs toward the structural consistency of their clean counterparts, thereby improving their practical utility. The trained model is then used to post-process real DPST features. Importantly, DPDeno preserves the original DP guarantee, as STGAE is trained solely on synthetic data generated from public sources without accessing any private information. Experimental results on two real-world trajectory datasets show that DPDeno significantly improves both the statistical accuracy and practical usability of released mobility features.},

We present a theoretical model called Digital Scapegoat (abbreviated as DS-IDep) that constructs an Incentive Deception defense schema to hijack the attacker’s access to critical files and redirect it to avatar files without awareness. We propose a FlipIDep Game model (GF) and a Markov Game model (GM) to characterize completely the payoffs, equilibria, and best strategies from the perspective of the attacker and the defender respectively. We also design an exponential risk propagation model to evaluate the ability of DS-IDep to eliminate stealing impact when the risk is propagated between states. Theoretically, we can achieve the objective of stealing impact elimination (LK<0.001) when the ratio of incentive deception exceeds 0.7 (η>0.7) and the probability of an attack operation bypassing the defense surface is less than 0.1 (r* × μ <0.1) under Stackelberg strategies. We develop a kernel-level incentive deception defense surface according to the theoretical parameters of the DS-IDep. The experimental results show that DS-IDep can resist APT stealing attacks from unknown Trojans. We also evaluate the DS-IDep in five well-known software applications. It demonstrates that DS-IDep can address unknown attacks from compromised software with less than 10% performance overhead.},

  abstract     = {Strings (sequences of elements) are often disseminated to support applications, e.g., in bioinformatics, web analysis, and transportation. Unfortunately, this may expose sensitive patterns that model confidential knowledge. Concealing the occurrences of sensitive patterns in a string (e.g., by deleting some elements) while minimizing the associated quality loss has been the objective of several string sanitization methods. However, real-world attackers are likely to possess background knowledge about the string, e.g., an individual’s genome sequence is almost identical to a reference genome sequence. In addition, it is good security practice to assume that the attacker will know the algorithm that has been used to sanitize the string (Kerckhoffs’ principle). Yet, all existing methods fail to protect strings against such attackers, risking privacy breaches in critical applications. In our work, we consider for the first time how to defend against strategic attackers who possess such knowledge. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework to sanitize a string by probabilistically replacing carefully selected patterns. As part of this framework, we design three mathematical programming algorithms which compute the optimal replacement probabilities under different objectives and constraints, offering different privacy gain / quality loss tradeoffs. Our algorithms protect against strategic attackers using new concepts and measures, protect sensitive patterns of any length, and can construct one or more optimally sanitized strings that can be used in applications such as frequent pattern mining. Our experiments using five real-world datasets from different domains show that all our algorithms are substantially more effective than a natural baseline (e.g., they offer up to 2 times more privacy when they are configured to incur the same quality loss, and up to 3 times lower quality loss when they are configured to offer the same privacy). They also show that two “hybrid” algorithms that we propose, based on combining elements of the above algorithms, inherit the advantages of their constituent algorithms. These results, coupled with the generality of our approach, make our algorithms practical and beneficial for deployment.},

  abstract     = {Most of the approaches proposed so far to craft targeted adversarial examples against Deep Learning classifiers are highly suboptimal and typically rely on increasing the likelihood of the target class, thus implicitly focusing on one-hot encoding settings. In this paper, a more general, theoretically sound, targeted attack is proposed, which resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance term, taking into account the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of the input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm (referred to as JMA) provides an optimal solution to a linearised version of the adversarial example problem originally introduced by Szegedy et al. The results of the experiments confirm the generality of the proposed attack which is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes. Noticeably, JMA is also effective in a multi-label classification scenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the labels in complex multi-label classification scenarios, a capability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a further advantage, JMA requires very few iterations, thus resulting more efficient than existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The identification of encrypted network traffic presents a pivotal challenge in detecting unknown malicious traffic. Unlike closed-set identification, which primarily classifies known traffic classes, detecting unknown malicious traffic necessitates both accurate classification of known traffic and the identification of previously unseen traffic classes. Existing methods often face difficulties in effectively constraining the distribution size of known classes in the representation space and frequently misclassifying unknown classes as known. To address these challenges, we propose Open-Detect, a robust theoretical framework for detecting unknown malicious traffic, which leverages advanced deep learning techniques, such as variational autoencoders and Gaussian prototypes. Open-Detect introduces two primary constraints: a generative constraint, which enhances intra-class compactness, and a discriminative constraint, which optimizes inter-class separation. These constraints collectively mitigate the risks of misclassifying known classes and failing to detect unknown classes. In Open-Detect, network flows are transformed into grayscale images, and each known traffic class is mapped to a unique Gaussian prototype in the latent space. This design ensures tight clustering of samples within the same class and clear separation of samples between different classes. The detection of unknown malicious traffic is performed based on the distance between samples and these prototypes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple publicly available datasets substantiate the efficacy of Open-Detect. The results reveal significant improvements in intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, enabling superior performance in both closed-world and open-world scenarios, particularly for detecting unknown malicious traffic.

  abstract     = {Software-defined networks (SDNs) face significant challenges from link flooding attacks (LFAs), where malicious bots flood towards a limited number of hidden hosts, known as decoys, at a low rate. Efficient decoy identification is crucial for mitigating LFAs and is more resource-efficient than traditional bot detection methods, given the smaller number of decoys compared to bots. This paper proposes a novel decoy identification mechanism (DIM) that utilizes the SDN controller to generate forwarding rules for critical switches, enabling them to classify and report decoy addresses effectively. DIM addresses the challenges of minimizing communication overhead between the controller and data plane while maintaining high classification accuracy. It optimizes critical switch selection by partitioning the network into smaller areas, which reduces communication costs while maximizing monitoring efficiency. Within each area, DIM pre-trains random forest (RF) models for the selected switches and generates their respective binary-encoded forwarding rules. These rules empower the switches to identify decoy addresses in LFA traffic at line speed. The identified addresses are then reported back to DIM for further analysis. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that DIM scales efficiently in terms of time and space complexity. Our evaluation with the NS-3 simulator—using real CAIDA traffic and a synthesized topology of over 30,000 nodes—shows DIM achieves 98.3% decoy identification accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art models like LSTM and CNN in both accuracy and speed. Tests under routing changes and moving target defense scenarios confirm DIM’s robustness and adaptability, highlighting its practical effectiveness against LFAs.},

Two differential privacy mechanisms protecting the releases of each agent’s current sample mean and two data variance estimation schemes are proposed, and we provide a theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm for any bounded unknown distributions on the agents’ data, showing that collaboration provides faster convergence than a fully local approach where agents do not share data. Moreover, we provide analytical performance curves for the case with an oracle class estimator, i.e., the class structure of the agents, where agents receiving data from distributions with the same mean are considered to be in the same class, is known. The theoretical faster-than-local convergence guarantee is backed up by extensive numerical results showing that for a considered scenario with 200 agents from two or three classes the proposed approach indeed converges much faster than a fully local approach, and performs comparably to the ideal (all-data-public) case. This illustrates the benefit of private collaboration in an online setting.},

Specifically, a hybrid analog-digital MIMO architecture is adopted, and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is deployed for wideband communication over frequency-selective mmWave channels. The antenna array structure and frequency selectivity of the system under investigation inherently endow it with multi-dimensional channel characteristics spanning the space, frequency, and time domains, which can be efficiently processed with tensor-based multi-dimensional signal processing techniques. The problem, based on tensor modeling of the system, is decomposed into three subproblems, namely analog beamforming, digital beamforming, and AN precoding. A low-complexity two-stage procedure is proposed to conduct analog beamforming, where a Tucker2 tensor decomposition subproblem is formulated to determine the analog combiners and part of the analog precoding matrix, and the remaining part of the precoding matrix is composed of arbitrary vectors satisfying the constant modulus constraint. The block-diagonalization algorithm is employed to design the digital beamforming and combining matrices to mitigate interference. For the AN precoding part, a statistical null-space algorithm based on higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) is proposed. Multiple AN precoding matrices on all subcarriers can be obtained simultaneously, and the AN-induced interference to the potential eavesdropper is maximized statistically to improve the secrecy of the communication. Simulation results show that, compared with existing matrix-based AN-aided secure HBF designs in the literature, the proposed tensor-based joint HBF and AN design leveraging multi-dimensional tensor signal processing provides improved secrecy performance with moderate complexity.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, called PCFinder, which leverages multi-level semantics- and context-analysis to conduct accurate permission-check identifications against real-world Java web infrastructures for access-control vulnerability detection. PCFinder successfully discovered 58 high-risk broken access control vulnerabilities, with 30 having been assigned CVE identifiers thus far, in analyzing 50 popular, real-world Java web applications. We also evaluate PCFinder on manually constructed ground-truth data and show that PCFinder achieved a high level of accuracy, i.e., a precision of 94.12% and a recall of 96.97% in identifying permission checks.},

These certified avatars can then be anonymously authenticated, ensuring unlinkability between multiple avatars belonging to the same user. UAVA maintains anonymity between users and their avatars, while allowing service providers to trace malicious avatars back to their users.

However, applying layer-wise uniform perturbation may lead to excess perturbations for some particular non-safety-critical layers, resulting in defense performance degradation and unnecessary memory consumption. To address this limitation, we propose a Targeted Vaccine (T-Vaccine), a memory-efficient safety alignment method that applies perturbation to only selected layers of the model. T-Vaccine follows two core steps: First, it uses the harmful gradient norm as a statistical metric to identify the safety-critical layers. Second, instead of applying uniform perturbation across all layers, T-Vaccine only applies perturbation to the safety-critical layers while keeping other layers frozen during training. Results show that T-Vaccine outperforms Vaccine in terms of both defense effectiveness and resource efficiency. Comparison with other defense baselines, e.g., RepNoise and TAR also demonstrate the superiority of T-Vaccine. Notably, T-Vaccine is the first defense that enables a fine-tuning-based alignment method for 7B pre-trained models trained on consumer GPUs with limited memory (e.g., RTX 4090).},

To address this, we propose a cross-modal driven object restoration framework that leverages 3D reconstruction to mitigate backdoor attacks. Specifically, we introduce a cross-modal semantic encoding module that projects 3D point clouds into multi-view depth maps and utilizes CLIP to extract aligned text-image features, providing semantic guidance for 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, we leverage cross-modal information as conditional guidance to drive dynamic diffusion-based 3D reconstruction and adaptively fuse semantic and geometric features through a gated self-conditioned modulator. This module dynamically selects features for fusion, effectively mitigating noise interference and distribution shifts during latent diffusion, significantly enhancing robustness to noise, and thereby achieving precise restoration of clean point clouds. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart datasets demonstrate that our method robustly defends against adaptive attacks under varying noise levels and significantly restores classification performance degraded by backdoor triggers.},

In this context, we propose a k-ary Tree-based DPCR (kTCR) model to provide deeper and more flexible error optimization, thereby promoting a robust accuracy enhancement for private FL. Our kTCR model introduces Variance Optimal Estimation (VOE) and privacy budget allocation (PBA) methods to optimize accuracy, posing significant efficiency challenges simultaneously. With rigorous mathematical analysis, we reduce the computational complexity of VOE from O(t3) to O(lg t), then introduce a meta-factor method that transforms the challenging PBA issues into a convex optimization problem with significantly reduced variables (e.g., a 3-ary tree with 5.23 × 109 nodes requiring only 61 variables), thus yielding high efficiencies. Our experiments on classical datasets demonstrate that our kTCR model with appropriate k outperforms the state-of-the-art ABCRG by 0.7% ~ 2.0% in accuracy and traditional private FL by 5.5% ~ 18.7%. Further experiments demonstrate that adjusting the arity k effectively reduces the Pre-aggregation Error, leading to a further 2.09% accuracy gain.

Then, Multi-Stega applies a cover selection algorithm based on steganographic fitness and a payload distribution strategy based on multi-stage decision optimization, to realize message allocation with minimum embedding signs. On this basis, Multi-Stega can employ any image robust steganography algorithm and universal joint source-channel code to facilitate message embedding and extraction. To analyze its validity, instances are implemented and compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the separable feature selection provides strong support for precise embedding signs measurement, and Multi-Stega can enhance the detection resistance of representative robust steganography algorithms by 35.10% on average.

  abstract     = {Secret key generation (SKG) between authenticated devices is a pivotal task for secure communications. Diffie-Hellman (DH) is de-facto standard but not post-quantum secure. In this paper, we shall invent and analyze a new security primitive that is specifically designed for WPAN. For WPAN, wireless channel-based SKG has been proposed but was not widely deployed due to its critical dependence on the channel’s entropy which is uncontrollable. We formulate a different approach: We still exploit channel properties but mainly hinge on the reciprocity of the wireless channel and not on the channel’s entropy. The radio advantage comes from the use of full duplex communication. We show that in this situation both legitimate parties can agree on a common secret key even without ever probing the channel at all. At the core is a new bisparse blind deconvolution scheme for which we prove correctness and information-theoretic, i.e. perfect, security. We show that, ultimately, a secret key can be extracted and give a lower bound for the number of secret key bits which is then verified by experiments.},

However, existing methods cannot ensure feature stability under varying illumination and rely on inflexible paired data, remaining inadequate against real-world cross-time retrieval and modality-missing challenges. To solve these, we first propose diversity representation that augments illumination-sensitive images to simulate diverse lighting conditions via illumination augmentation and enriches instance features using modality-specific prototypes via multiple interaction modules. Secondly, we propose integrity reconstruction that leverages prototypes and available instance features to recover information, the reconstruction module effectively utilizes identity and modality cues to address unpredictable missing problems. In addition, we build a more comprehensive dataset (AllDay843) to alleviate the inadequate dataset diversity, which comprises 91,371 images of 843 identities captured by multi-modal cameras across various periods throughout the day, while incorporating numerous real-world challenges. By integrating diversity representation and integrity reconstruction, the proposed Prototype-Based Diversity and Integrity learning network (PDINet) establishes excellence on the AllDay843 dataset, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches.

  abstract     = {Leveraging recent advances in wireless communication, IoT, and AI, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) played an important role in reducing traffic congestion and enhancing user experience. Within ITS, navigational recommendation systems (NRS) are essential for helping users simplify route choices in urban environments. However, NRS are vulnerable to information-based attacks that can manipulate both the NRS and users to achieve the objectives of the malicious entities. This study aims to assess the risks of misinformed demand attacks, where attackers use techniques like Sybil-based attacks to manipulate the demands of certain origins and destinations considered by the NRS. We propose a game-theoretic framework for proactive risk assessment of demand attacks (PRADA) and treat the interaction between attackers and the NRS as a Stackelberg game. Specifically, we consider the case of local-targeted attacks, in which the attacker aims to make the NRS recommend the authentic users towards a specific road that favors certain groups. Our analysis unveils the equivalence between users’ incentive compatibility and Wardrop equilibrium recommendations and shows that the NRS and its users are at high risk when encountering intelligent attackers who can significantly alter user routes by strategically fabricating non-existent demands. To mitigate these risks, we introduce a trust mechanism that leverages users’ confidence in the integrity of the NRS, and show that it can effectively reduce the impact of misinformed demand attacks. Numerical experiments are used to corroborate the results and support our discussion of the Resilience Paradox, where locally targeted attacks can sometimes benefit the overall traffic conditions. Our framework not only assists risk assessment in automating the evaluation process and estimating potential impacts but also aligns with standards like ISO/IEC 27005, offering a proactive approach to managing risks in ITS.},

We present WuKong (WK), a data governance system that offers authenticated, privately verifiable, and traceable data feeds. WK enables a server to collect faithful data through an oracle committee and to prove computation correctness in zero-knowledge proofs, and empowers legal entities to trace a leakage source conditionally. We formally define and prove the security of WK in the universal composability framework. We implement three applications that seamlessly integrate with WK. Experimental results indicate that WK effectively liberates sensitive data from distributed, untrusted, and anonymous providers, making it accessible to various services and establishing trust in a decentralized world.},

  abstract     = {The combination of smart cards and passwords has given birth to one of the most prevalent two-factor authentication (2FA) approaches. Numerous 2FA schemes have been proposed, nevertheless, most of them either do not possess critical security properties or are not efficient for implementation on smart cards. It is generally considered that asymmetric cryptographic primitives are indispensable to achieve security goals, which are burdensome for resource-limited devices. That is, the literature is being stuck with the security-efficiency tension. In this paper, we propose a 2FA protocol only resorting to symmetric primitives. Specifically, with the puncturable pseudorandom function, the proposed protocol hits three birds: it achieves three subtle security goals, i.e., resisting offline password guessing attacks, perfect forward secrecy and anonymity. It alleviates the long-standing security-efficiency conflict that is considered intractable in the literature. The proposed protocol is provably secure within the harshest adversary model to date. Furthermore, the evaluation results demonstrate that our protocol is the optimal choice when considering both security and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In the hard-label black-box setting, existing attack methods randomly select words for perturbation, generating invalid word replacement operations, resulting in low attack success rate. Recent works alleviate this problem by evaluating the impact of words on model predictions, but they can only evaluate the impact of words on model predictions, not the impact of words on attack. If the attacker replaces too many words that have significant impact on the text semantics during the attack process, the adversarial example has poor semantics and the attack behavior is easily detected. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a two-factor word scoring method, which uses the attention score output by the pre-attack model and the semantic similarity after word replacement to evaluate the impact of the word on attack. Based on the scoring method, this paper proposes a query-efficient hard-label black-box adversarial attack method called F2Attack. F2Attack uses the two-factors method to score words, and then replaces words have great impact on the model prediction but small impact on text semantics based on scoring results to generate the initialized adversarial example. Then, F2Attack adopts the simulated annealing algorithm to optimize the semantic similarity of the adversarial example. We conduct experiments on four representative natural language models, seven text classification datasets, two natural language inference datasets, and four commercial APIs, and compared them with baseline methods. When the number of queries is limited to 100, F2Attack increases the attack success rate by an average of 15.165%, and the semantic similarity by 0.067, which is significantly better than the baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Specific emitter identification (SEI) is a security authentication technology by utilizing radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) features. However, current mainstream RFF feature extraction methods based on neural networks (NNs) generally suffer from poor interpretability and difficulties in architecture optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel convolution-enhanced swin vision transformer (CoSwinVIT) that combines filter characteristics of NN architectures to achieve a uniform spectrum response. Specifically, we treat the NN used in SEI tasks as filters and investigate their filter characteristics by applying Fourier transforms to hidden vectors. Through spectral analysis, we found that different NN architectures exhibit significantly different responses to the signal spectrum. This affects the model’s sensitivity to specific frequency bands of the signal, thereby influencing its accuracy (Acc). Subsequently, by integrating the filtering properties of swin vision transformer (SwinVIT) and convolutional neural network (CNN), we achieve a uniform spectral response design. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the CoSwinVIT architecture, we design both a supervised learning algorithm and a contrastive learning-based self-supervised algorithm. Experimental results on a real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) dataset indicate that CoSwinVIT provides a more uniform spectrum response. Under supervised learning, the proposed CoSwinVIT obtains the accuracies of 98.6% and 99.8% on the ADS-B and WiFi datasets, respectively. Under self-supervised learning with 5% and 10% labeled data, the accuracies of 73.6% and 86.3% are achieved on the ADS-B dataset, and the accuracies of 81.6% and 91.5% are achieved on the WiFi dataset. These results surpass the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods used in the SEI tasks.},
