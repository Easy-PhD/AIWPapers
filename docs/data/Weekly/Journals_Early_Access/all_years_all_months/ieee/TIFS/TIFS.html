  abstract     = {ML-KEM and ML-DSA are NIST-standardized lattice-based post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. In both algorithms, KECCAK is the designated hash algorithm extensively used for deriving sensitive information, making it a valuable target for attackers. In the field of fault injection attacks, few works targeted KECCAK, and they have not fully explored its impact on the security of ML-KEM and ML-DSA. Consequently, many attacks remain undiscovered. In this article, we first identify various fault vulnerabilities of KECCAK that determine the (partial) output by manipulating the control flow under a practical loop-abort model. Then, we systematically analyze the impact of a faulty KECCAK output and propose six attacks against ML-KEM and five attacks against ML-DSA, including key recovery, signature forgery, and verification bypass. These attacks cover the key generation, encapsulation, decapsulation, signing, and verification phases, making our scheme the first to apply to all phases of ML-KEM and ML-DSA. The proposed attacks are validated on the C implementations of the PQClean library’s ML-KEM and ML-DSA running on embedded devices. Experiments show that the required loop-abort faults can be realized on ARM Cortex-M0+, M3, M4, and M33 microprocessors with low-cost electromagnetic fault injection settings, achieving a success rate of 89.5%. Once the fault injection is successful, all proposed attacks can succeed with a probability of 100%.},

  abstract     = {The goal of unsupervised domain adaptation person re-identification (UDA Reid) is to achieve feature space alignment between the source domain and the target domain, so that the Reid model can effectively match pedestrians in the target domain. Creating the transitional domain is an effective approach, but existing models often have difficulty synthesizing transitional domains with sufficiently public features. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative approach named feature fusion transitional domain (F2TD-Reid), which comprises two essential components: the dictionary fusion module (DFM) and the transitional domain attention module (TDAM). Among them, the DFM utilizes a feature fusion to extract and reconstruct pedestrian images from instances, focusing on capturing the essential visual elements within the images. For the TDAM, it further refines the feature extraction of instance points through an innovative weighted attention mechanism. These two modules optimize the generation process of scaling factors, thereby facilitating the transfer of knowledge between the source domain and the target domain. Through a series of comparative experiments, we verify the superiority of the F2TD-Reid method in solving UDA Reid. The code is available at https://github.com/1x-x/F2TD-Reid.},

  abstract     = {Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are currently the most widely used method for processing graph-structured data. However, recent research has revealed that the performance of GCNs dramatically decreases when confronted with adversarial attacks. This severely hinders their application in security-critical domains. Therefore, the development of GCNs that are resilient to adversarial attacks has emerged as a prominent research focus. Despite this, most current defense models with complex network architectures and optimization objectives are typically designed based on specific feature assumptions or attack manifestations, and do not enhance the inherent robustness of GCNs. They also overlook the changes induced by perturbations of varying intensities and the difference in attack phenomenon across different datasets. In response to this, we have delved into the impact of adversarial attacks on the spectrum, and propose an effective adaptive robust spectrum filter GCN (ASF-GCN). This approach enhances the robustness of GCN models through adaptive filtering without introducing additional conditional assumptions. We theoretically analyze that graphs have different robust frequency intervals under different conditions, validating the necessity of adaptive filtering. Additionally, we elucidate the role of degree distribution and maximum eigenvalue in adaptation. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs reveal that our model surpasses other defense models in overall performance.},

  abstract     = {With the popularity of cross-chain transactions in heterogeneous blockchain systems, scalability has become a critical challenge. To overcome this, researchers propose to establish virtual channels, which move cross-chain transactions off the blockchain, enabling instant transaction confirmation between users and improving the system throughput. However, existing off-chain cross-chain transaction schemes encounter the following issues: (i) they are incompatible with non-Turing complete blockchain systems; (ii) they are incapable of accessing authentic information from blockchain systems. These issues have a dual impact on the cross-chain transaction, affecting its compatibility and dispute resolutions among mutually distrustful users. To alleviate these issues, this paper introduces SightCVC, a novel cross-chain payment protocol. The core of SightCVC is a new smart contract, which facilitates unrestricted off-chain transactions among mutually distrustful users in heterogeneous blockchain systems. It only requires off-chain protocol of the blockchain system involved in the transactions to support a Turing complete scripting language, which resolves the compatibility issue. Meanwhile, it can securely retrieve the real information from the blockchain systems, significantly improving the effectiveness of dispute resolution and enforcing the privacy of cross-chain transactions. We conduct a thorough security analysis within the Universal Composability framework to validate that SightCVC can achieve consensus at each stage. We implement and deploy SightCVC on the experimental networks of Ripple and Ethereum. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SightCVC is able to effectively handle the disputes and reduce the system costs by approximately 64% compared to existing solutions. Its superiority becomes more evidence when the number of transactions increases.},

  abstract     = {In Federated Learning (FL), clients share gradients with a central server while keeping their data local. However, malicious servers could deliberately manipulate the models to reconstruct clients’ data from shared gradients, posing significant privacy risks. Although such Active Gradient Leakage Attacks (AGLAs) have been widely studied, they suffer from two severe limitations: (i) coverage: no existing AGLAs can reconstruct all samples in a batch from the shared gradients; (ii) stealthiness: no existing AGLAs can evade principled checks of clients. In this paper, we address these limitations with two core contributions. First, we introduce a new theoretical analysis approach, which uniformly models AGLAs as backdoor poisoning. This analysis approach reveals that the core principle of AGLAs is to bias the gradient space to prioritize the reconstruction of a small subset of samples while sacrificing the majority, which theoretically explains the above limitations of existing AGLAs. Second, we propose Enhanced Gradient Global Vulnerability (EGGV), the first AGLA that achieves complete attack coverage while evading client-side detection. In particular, EGGV employs a gradient projector and a jointly optimized discriminator to assess gradient vulnerability, steering the gradient space toward the point most prone to data leakage. Extensive experiments show that EGGV achieves complete attack coverage and surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) with at least a 43% increase in reconstruction quality (PSNR) and a 45% improvement in stealthiness (D-SNR).},

OTAuth provides a more secure and convenient alternative to password-based and Short Message Service (SMS)-based authentication schemes. Consequently, the OTAuth service has been adopted by numerous Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) worldwide. However, a high severity vulnerability remains unaddressed in the OTAuth service, which allows an attacker to access a victim’s various app accounts, posing a significant risk to user privacy and data security. In this paper, we present LoadShow, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first security-enhanced OTAuth scheme to address this vulnerability. We propose a novel dynamic application identification technique that aims to address the root cause of this vulnerability, i.e., the inability of MNOs to distinguish between different applications on the same device. Specifically, application identification is based on the hardware load side-channel and captures the unique CPU and GPU load characteristics of applications through the sequence of timing values of fingerprinting functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of LoadShow by accuracy, False Positive Rate (FPR), and True Positive Rate (TPR). We also evaluate its multi-platform compatibility on devices with different architectures and models. LoadShow achieves over 90% accuracy, with a TPR exceeding 90% and an FPR below 1%. The evaluation results demonstrate LoadShow’s capability to effectively differentiate between applications on a device, defend against app impersonation attacks, and reliably identify legitimate applications.},

  abstract     = {Operational technology (OT) systems face increasing cybersecurity risks from adversarial behavior. This paper describes the development of a Bayesian network risk model to enhance the comprehension of observable cyber-events caused by malicious activity in OT environments. The core of the Bayesian network is a process model that characterizes the stages of adversary behavior. The remainder of the model leverages the MITRE ATT&CK® for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) taxonomy, which includes tactics and techniques that may be used by the adversary. The observables provide evidence for adversary behavior through the intermediary technique and tactic nodes. One challenge in constructing this model is a lack of open-source data from cyber-attacks on OT systems. This paper demonstrates the use of both historical data and expert knowledge to construct the Bayesian network. The historical data was obtained from open-source reporting of 27 cyber-attacks affecting OT systems. The expert knowledge was obtained from a panel of subject matter experts with experience in a variety of OT cybersecurity roles and responsibilities. Finally, the Bayesian network is demonstrated using two historical case studies: the Darkside ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline and the destructive cyber-attack targeting the Thyssenkrupp blast furnace. By using this approach, OT cybersecurity professionals can better identify and characterize adversarial behavior in their systems to enable risk-informed investigations and interruptions before impact occurs.},

However, the evil single users with search privileges bring heavy privacy threats to the system. Threshold searchable encryption provides a collaborative search service for group users; a single user cannot search for ciphertext. However, the threshold searchable encryption based on the Shamir secret sharing mechanism cannot achieve flexible user dynamic since the Lagrange interpolation polynomial for recovering the secret value changes with the group user add or delete, resulting in the ciphertext or trapdoor containing Lagrange interpolation formula needs to be recreated. In this paper, the conjunctive keyword search with dynamic group-user scheme (CKSDGU) is proposed to realize group-user flexible addition and deletion. The proposed CKSDGU scheme can match successfully without the data owner resetting ciphertext and the original data user generating trapdoors. In addition, multi-keyword conjunctive retrieval is implemented in the CKSDGU scheme, and group users can search the target ciphertexts that contain all users’ query keyword sets. The security analysis illustrates that the CKSDGU scheme can resist chosen keyword attacks and keyword guessing attacks. The performance analysis presents that our scheme has considerable overhead and efficient computational cost in the user dynamic stage.},

These attacks are pernicious when attackers inject a trigger into the input data without altering its ground-truth label, known as clean-label backdoor attacks. The effectiveness and stealth of existing clean-label backdoor attacks rely on access to global training data, making them resource-intensive and impractical. This paper introduces a novel clean-label backdoor attack that achieves high attack success rates (ASR) while maintaining exceptional stealth under realistic constraints. Unlike prior approaches focused on spatial differences between clean and poisoned data, a key novelty of the new attack is the suppression of high-frequency components in the frequency domain, which minimizes human-detectable contrasts and enhances trigger imperceptibility. Moreover, we employ an affine combination of static and adaptive triggers, effectively balancing their strengths to maximize ASR. Surrogate models are designed to simulate victim model behavior and auxiliary models are applied to extract the spatial and frequency features of the static triggers, enabling trigger design with minimal knowledge of the victim model. Our attack achieves a higher ASR than state-of-the-art backdoor attacks while maintaining higher benign accuracy across various models and datasets. It also demonstrates strong resistance against the latest defense mechanisms, including STRIP, SentiNet, neural cleanse, fine-pruning, and ANP.},

The perturbation detection module utilizes the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.

Traditional defense methods often rely on access to detailed model information, which raises privacy concerns, as model owners may be reluctant to share such data. In contrast, existing black-box defense methods fail to offer a universal defense against various types of adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce DUCD, a universal black-box defense method that does not require access to the target model’s parameters or architecture. Our approach involves distilling the target model by querying it with data, creating a white-box surrogate while preserving data privacy. We further enhance this surrogate model using a certified defense based on randomized smoothing and optimized noise selection, enabling robust defense against a broad range of adversarial attacks. Comparative evaluations between the certified defenses of the surrogate and target models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments on multiple image classification datasets show that DUCD not only outperforms existing black-box defenses but also matches the accuracy of white-box defenses, all while enhancing data privacy and reducing the success rate of membership inference attacks.},

The classification of tactics and techniques descriptions in CTI has been extensively studied to assist security experts in interpreting attack patterns. Although many recent studies have applied various deep learning methods to enhance classification performance, they mainly focus on improving performance from an average or top perspective. However, the imbalance between tactical and technical tag samples, as well as text sparsity, may lead to poor model performance, which has been under-explored. To address these issues, we propose a new tactics and techniques classification model based on adversarial contrastive learning and meta-path (TTC-ACLM). In TTC-ACLM, a novel text representation learning module is first designed. It includes pre-trained language model (PLM) and contrastive adversarial methods, which can better adapt to categories with smaller sample sizes while obtaining better text representations. Then, heterogeneous information networks are used to model the rich relationships between texts and labels (tactics and techniques), which can merge additional information, e.g., processes and tools, to address text sparsity. Next, we defined a meta-path based classifier learning module that maps text, tactics, and meta-path based context to a set of classifiers, which are applied to the text representation generated by the text representation module for better classification. Finally, the classification performance is further improved through the tactics and techniques correlation enhancement matrix. Through in-depth research, we demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively address the impact of sample imbalance and text sparsity. Extensive experimental results indicate that TTC-ACLM achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

To address the trade-off between privacy preservation and efficiency, this paper introduces FedPN, a novel privacy-preserving approach that leverages periodic neuron technique, ensuring both enhanced privacy and efficient model training. Specifically, we propose a lightweight obfuscation mechanism integrated into the model’s input layer, where a specialized obfuscation layer is designed to ensure privacy, exploiting the synergistic interaction between convolutional operations and nonlinear activation functions to enhance feature extraction. We further integrate this privacy protection mechanism into FL model training, where the obfuscation layer is shared globally among all clients, aiming to achieve an optimal trade-off between the learnability and confidentiality of obfuscated features. In contrast to Homomorphic Encryption, our approach eliminates the need for heavy homomorphic operations, maintaining a practical level of training efficiency. Our theoretical analysis proves an exponentially negligible privacy guarantee against successful feature reconstruction attacks, with the success probability bounded by o(γ−m), where the frequency parameter γ > 1 and dimension of obfuscated vector m > 0. In addition, extensive experiments show that FedPN significantly enhances defence against feature reconstruction, while maintaining comparable efficiency and accuracy to existing approaches such as Differential Privacy.},

  abstract     = {Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ARCGEN. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures.

  abstract     = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices generates substantial data that supports deep learning, significantly advancing intelligent specific emitter identification (SEI) technology. However, challenges such as labeling costs and privacy concerns limit the availability of labeled samples, thereby constraining deep model training. To address this problem, this paper focuses on enhancing the data manifold structure through deep feature information, proposing a semi-supervised SEI method named SSME. A well-structured manifold makes the model capture underlying patterns and relationships within the data more effectively, leading to more accurate and generalizable classification boundaries. First, to maximize the use of supervision information from limited labeled samples, we design a supervised cross-class contrastive (SCCC) loss, which increases the feature distance between anchor samples and cross-class samples based on their labels, achieving better manifold separation of different categories. Second, we propose an instance neighborhood matching regularization (INMR) loss that captures the neighborhood of weakly and strongly augmented samples of unlabeled instances within the feature space. By aligning these neighborhood representations, neighborhood-to-neighborhood consistency learning is achieved, enhancing the structural consistency and smoothness of local manifolds. Evaluated on ADS-B and XSRP datasets across diverse settings, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches. Notably, even with only five labeled samples per class, it surpasses supervised baselines by 24.82% and 12.55% on the respective datasets.},

An optimal control strategy, taking into account the system gain, is then implemented. The existence and stability of equilibria, and bi-stability between invasion threshold and persistence threshold are derived. Experiments on synthetic and empirical simplicial complexes reveal the dynamic behavior of the system with discontinuous phase transitions, backward bifurcation and periodic oscillations.

Reporting mechanism suppresses discontinuous phase transition. And the synergistic application of preventive and corrective strategies demonstrates superior cost-effectiveness in system control compared to their isolated implementation. Additionally, an identifiability analysis of the model is conducted. Finally, the model parameters are inversely estimated and the diffusion dynamics are predicted using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) across three instances, and the optimal control is subsequently performed, validating the effectiveness of both the proposed model and the control strategy.},

Our approach encompasses three key techniques: (1) capability analysis and attribute modeling of vulnerable object (2) extraction and filtering of target SSOs and (3) automatically augmenting PoCs with SSO-specific code to create exploitation capabilities. To evaluate our approach, we tested our prototype on 30 public CVEs, successfully parsing vulnerable object in 22 cases (73.3%) and achieving accurate SSO matches in 18 (60.0%).

However, the accuracy of currently existing solutions suffer from multipath effects in practical scenarios. In this paper, we provide a robust RFF identification method that leverages channel state information (CSI) feedback to counteract the effect of the channel on the extracted RFF features. A straightforward zero-forcing (ZF) equalization fails to fully decouple RF impairments from the channel, making conventional approaches ineffective. To overcome this challenge, we utilize the potential of multi-antenna and introduce a new device-specific feature called Relative-RFF (R-RFF), which represents the relation between different RF chains in a multi-antenna transmitter. We propose an enhanced ZF post-equalization algorithm to eliminate the multipath channels and preserve the users’ R-RFF to the greatest extent. We evaluate the robustness of R-RFF under various channel conditions and noise levels and the performance of R-RFF in terms of identification accuracy under different channel scenarios. The results show that the proposed R-RFF method can achieve an identification accuracy of 91.2% for 70 devices in tapped delay line channel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 30 dB.},

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an optimized k-sparse vector mean estimation scheme under Local Differential Privacy (LDP), ensuring that each user’s entire set of up to k private values from {−1, 1} satisfies ε-LDP. Specifically, our proposed scheme employs a seed mining technique in conjunction with PRNG Randomizer, which allows users to send their data only once while enabling the server to accurately estimate any value’s mean in the domain. Our scheme achieves an asymptotically optimal error of O( 1/ε√n ), equivalent to that of a 1-sparse case, while also ensuring efficient communication costs. The communication cost remains at a minimal level of O(1) (only 2 bytes per user’s report) for smaller k values and scales to O(k) for larger k, due to efficient binning strategies. Extensive experimental results confirm that our results align with theoretical expectations, demonstrating that our scheme not only preserves user privacy but also ensures higher accuracy compared to other schemes.},

To this end, we propose ARBiBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the adversarial robustness of BCNNs in the image classification task. The key contributions of ARBiBench include: 1) systematically evaluating the robustness of seven influential BCNN methods across various architectures; 2) rigorous validation of diverse adversarial attack methods; and 3) novel empirical findings showing that BCNNs exhibit weaker robustness than full-precision networks on small datasets but surprisingly stronger robustness on large-scale datasets. Leveraging Information Bottleneck theory, we further demonstrate how data scale and model capacity collectively determine BCNNs’ adversarial robustness.

However, AT suffers from significant computational overhead because it repeatedly generates adversarial examples (AEs) throughout the entire training process. In this paper, we demonstrate that such repeated generation is unnecessary to achieve robustness against transfer-based attacks. Instead, pre-generating AEs all at once before training is sufficient, as proposed in our new defense paradigm called Data-Centric Robust Training (DCRT). DCRT employs clean data augmentation and adversarial data augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset before training.

  abstract     = {The spatio-temporal (ST) mobility patterns derived from trajectory data are crucial for applications such as location-based services and urban analytics. However, releasing these mobility features raises significant privacy concerns, as they may expose sensitive personal location information. Differential privacy (DP) is widely used to safeguard individual privacy during data releases, but existing methods for releasing ST features often suffer from utility loss because their high dimensionality requires injecting substantial noise to meet privacy guarantees. Several recent approaches attempt to address this issue by reducing noise in differentially private spatio-temporal (DPST) features, but they either discard valuable information while compressing noisy data representations or rely solely on restrictive road network topology constraints, resulting in only modest utility improvements. In this paper, we present DPDeno, a post-processing framework designed to significantly enhance the utility of DPST features. First, DPDeno generates synthetic trajectory datasets using public information (e.g., road network data) and applies existing DP methods to create paired DPST (noisy) and ST (clean) features. It then trains a spatio-temporal graph autoencoder (STGAE), which models each feature as a graph, with road segments as nodes and transitions over time as edges. By minimizing node- and edge-level reconstruction losses between the noisy and clean pairs, STGAE learns to refine DPST inputs toward the structural consistency of their clean counterparts, thereby improving their practical utility. The trained model is then used to post-process real DPST features. Importantly, DPDeno preserves the original DP guarantee, as STGAE is trained solely on synthetic data generated from public sources without accessing any private information. Experimental results on two real-world trajectory datasets show that DPDeno significantly improves both the statistical accuracy and practical usability of released mobility features.},

  abstract     = {Information bottleneck (IB) is a promising defense solution against adversarial attacks on deep neural networks. However, these methods often suffer from spurious correlations. A correlation exists between the prediction and the non-robust features, yet it does not reflect the causal relationship well. Such spurious correlations induce the neural networks to learn fragile and incomprehensible (non-robust) features. This issue limits its potential for further improving adversarial robustness. This paper addresses this issue by incorporating causal inference into the IB-based defense framework. Specifically, we propose a novel defense method that use the instrumental variables to enhance the adversarial robustness. Our proposed method divides the features into two parts for causal effect estimation: robust and non-robust features. The robust features relate to understanding semantic information, and the non-robust features link to the vulnerable style information. By employing this framework, the IB method can mitigate the influence of non-robust features and extract the robust features linking to the semantic information of objects. We conduct a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our proposed method. Notably, the experiments on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the adversarial robustness against multiple adversarial attacks compared to previous methods. Our regularization method can improve adversarial robustness in both natural and adversarial training frameworks. Besides, CausalIB can be applied to both Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers as a plug-and-play module. Our code is available at https://github.com/HydrogenWasser/CausalIB.},

  abstract     = {Currently global features are usually extracted directly from local patterns in palmprint verification. Furthermore, sequence features for palmprint verification are only used as local features, but the properties of sequence features are not fully utilized. To solve this issue, this paper introduces Sequence Feature Fusion Network (SF2Net) for palmprint verification. SF2Net proposes a new paradigm: using stable and spatially correlated sequence features as an intermediate bridge to generate robust global representations. SF2Net’s core mechanism is to first extract fine-grained local features that are then converted into sequence features by a sequence feature extractor (SFE). Finally, the sequence features are used as a superior input to capture high-quality global features. By fusing multi-order texture-based local features with globally extracted sequence features, SF2Net achieves superior discrimination. To ensure high accuracy even with limited training data, a hybrid loss function is proposed, which integrate a cross-entropy loss and a triplet loss. Triplet loss effectively optimizes feature separation by explicitly considering negative samples. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available palmprint datasets demonstrate that SF2Net achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Remarkably, even with a small training-to-testing ratio (1:9), SF2Net achieves 100% accuracy, surpassing SOTA methods under several benchmark datasets. The code is released at https://github.com/20201422/SF2Net.},

  abstract     = {It is a challenging problem to resist unknown advanced persistent threats (APTs) on stealing data resources in an information system of critical infrastructures, because APT attackers have very specific objectives and compromise the system stealthily and slowly. We observe that it is a necessary condition for APT attackers to achieve their campaigns via controlling unknown Trojans to access and exfiltrate critical files. We present a theoretical model called Digital Scapegoat (abbreviated as DS-IDep) that constructs an Incentive Deception defense schema to hijack the attacker’s access to critical files and redirect it to avatar files without awareness. We propose a FlipIDep Game model (GF) and a Markov Game model (GM) to characterize completely the payoffs, equilibria, and best strategies from the perspective of the attacker and the defender respectively. We also design an exponential risk propagation model to evaluate the ability of DS-IDep to eliminate stealing impact when the risk is propagated between states. Theoretically, we can achieve the objective of stealing impact elimination (LK<0.001) when the ratio of incentive deception exceeds 0.7 (η>0.7) and the probability of an attack operation bypassing the defense surface is less than 0.1 (r* × μ <0.1) under Stackelberg strategies. We develop a kernel-level incentive deception defense surface according to the theoretical parameters of the DS-IDep. The experimental results show that DS-IDep can resist APT stealing attacks from unknown Trojans. We also evaluate the DS-IDep in five well-known software applications. It demonstrates that DS-IDep can address unknown attacks from compromised software with less than 10% performance overhead.},

  abstract     = {Far Field EM Side-Channel Attacks (FEM-SCAs) have emerged as a realistic security threat to widely deployed RF-integrated IoT edge devices. In mixed-signal chips, side-channel leakage may unintentionally couple with transmission signals and be emitted via the on-chip antenna, potentially allowing adversaries to extract sensitive information from the victim at long distances. However, in practical scenarios, far field EM traces captured at long distances usually suffer from noise and interference, which makes the attack less efficient or sometimes even unfeasible. In this paper, we propose a Domain-Adversarial ReFeature Nueral Network (DAR-NN) to facilitate “noisy-clean” adaptation for far field EM traces captured at long distances. By integrating a DAE model with two deep-learning classifiers as regularization terms, the proposed DAR-NN model can reconstruct features of traces obtained remotely in complex environments, thereby achieving a more efficient FEM-SCA. We first test our model by using a publicly available dataset and show that it is feasible to extract the AES key from 141 traces captured at 15 m distance to the victim, which is 58.7% more efficient than existing methods with 80% less profiling data. Afterwards, we set up a more complex experimental environment with a HackRF radio serving as an interference source. We show that the proposed model can still extract the key by using around 2K traces at 15 m even in the presence of 25% active interference, while the state-of-the-art model fails under same conditions.},

In response, the research community has mobilized, with numerous efforts dedicated to strengthening defenses against these threats. The primary goal of these techniques is to detect malicious software early, preventing attacks before any damage occurs. However, many of these methods either claim that packing has minimal impact on malware detection or fail to address the reliability of their approaches when applied to packed samples. Consequently, they are not capable of assisting victims in handling packed programs or recovering from the damages caused by untimely malware detection. To address these challenges, we propose VisUnpac, a static analysis-based data visualization framework for bolstering attack prevention while aiding recovery post-attack by unveiling malware patterns and offering more detailed information including both malware class and family. Our method includes unpacking packed malware programs, calculating local similarity descriptors based on basic blocks, enhancing correlations between descriptors, and refining them by minimizing noises to obtain self-analysis descriptors. Moreover, we employ machine learning to learn the correlations of self-analysis descriptors through architectural learning for final classification. Our comprehensive evaluation of VisUnpac based on a freshly gathered dataset with over 27,106 samples confirms its capability in accurately classifying malware programs with a precision of 99.7%. Additionally, VisUnpac reveals that most antivirus products in VirusTotal can not handle packed samples properly or provide precise malware classification information. We also achieve over 97% space savings compared to existing data visualization based methods.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for cross-device attack by incorporating the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to develop a generalized model. Additionally, an adaptive multi-task loss is employed to balance multiple training objectives that respectively focus on model generalization and precision. We evaluate our strategy on five cross-device SCA datasets. The experimental results show that, compared to baseline methods, our approach achieves significantly enhanced performance, as measured by the number of traces required to recover the secret key. Specifically, on a more challenging dataset obtained from three SAKURA-G evaluation boards, our method successfully recovers the secret key using approximately 300 traces, whereas baseline methods fail to guarantee a successful cross-device attack even with 5,000 traces. Furthermore, our method demonstrates remarkably enhanced attack efficiency, reducing attack time by over an hour compared to the baselines.},

  abstract     = {Strings (sequences of elements) are often disseminated to support applications, e.g., in bioinformatics, web analysis, and transportation. Unfortunately, this may expose sensitive patterns that model confidential knowledge. Concealing the occurrences of sensitive patterns in a string (e.g., by deleting some elements) while minimizing the associated quality loss has been the objective of several string sanitization methods. However, real-world attackers are likely to possess background knowledge about the string, e.g., an individual’s genome sequence is almost identical to a reference genome sequence. In addition, it is good security practice to assume that the attacker will know the algorithm that has been used to sanitize the string (Kerckhoffs’ principle). Yet, all existing methods fail to protect strings against such attackers, risking privacy breaches in critical applications. In our work, we consider for the first time how to defend against strategic attackers who possess such knowledge. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework to sanitize a string by probabilistically replacing carefully selected patterns. As part of this framework, we design three mathematical programming algorithms which compute the optimal replacement probabilities under different objectives and constraints, offering different privacy gain / quality loss tradeoffs. Our algorithms protect against strategic attackers using new concepts and measures, protect sensitive patterns of any length, and can construct one or more optimally sanitized strings that can be used in applications such as frequent pattern mining. Our experiments using five real-world datasets from different domains show that all our algorithms are substantially more effective than a natural baseline (e.g., they offer up to 2 times more privacy when they are configured to incur the same quality loss, and up to 3 times lower quality loss when they are configured to offer the same privacy). They also show that two “hybrid” algorithms that we propose, based on combining elements of the above algorithms, inherit the advantages of their constituent algorithms. These results, coupled with the generality of our approach, make our algorithms practical and beneficial for deployment.},

In this paper, a more general, theoretically sound, targeted attack is proposed, which resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance term, taking into account the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of the input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm (referred to as JMA) provides an optimal solution to a linearised version of the adversarial example problem originally introduced by Szegedy et al. The results of the experiments confirm the generality of the proposed attack which is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes. Noticeably, JMA is also effective in a multi-label classification scenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the labels in complex multi-label classification scenarios, a capability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a further advantage, JMA requires very few iterations, thus resulting more efficient than existing methods.},

However, the anonymity of Ethereum undermines market regulatory capabilities, leading to frequent malicious behaviors such as Ponzi Scheme, Money Laundering, and Phishing. Therefore, in the face of the diverse and continuously emerging malicious behaviors, implementing fine-grained detection is crucial for maintaining the prosperous development of the blockchain ecosystem. In this paper, we propose FiMAD, a fine-grained and class-incremental malicious account detection framework based on dynamic graph learning. Specifically, we first propose a general graph structure called Dynamic Account Relation Graph (DARG), which dynamically models Ethereum accounts from a continuous-time perspective. Then, we design a cascade graph feature extraction method to capture deep temporal evolution patterns and neighbor interaction features in DARG. Next, we construct a pre-training universal encoder to transform account features into high-dimensional embeddings, followed by fine-tuning the model classifier with a few labeled samples, enabling accurate fine-grained detection and rapid updates for incremental classes. We conduct extensive experiments using real Ethereum data. The results demonstrate that FiMAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in fine-grained detection across five typical scenarios: class-incremental, full data, new malicious accounts, imbalanced data, and binary classification. In the class-incremental scenario, FiMAD improves the Macro-F1 by up to 26.4% compared to SOTA methods.},

  abstract     = {The identification of encrypted network traffic presents a pivotal challenge in detecting unknown malicious traffic. Unlike closed-set identification, which primarily classifies known traffic classes, detecting unknown malicious traffic necessitates both accurate classification of known traffic and the identification of previously unseen traffic classes. Existing methods often face difficulties in effectively constraining the distribution size of known classes in the representation space and frequently misclassifying unknown classes as known. To address these challenges, we propose Open-Detect, a robust theoretical framework for detecting unknown malicious traffic, which leverages advanced deep learning techniques, such as variational autoencoders and Gaussian prototypes. Open-Detect introduces two primary constraints: a generative constraint, which enhances intra-class compactness, and a discriminative constraint, which optimizes inter-class separation. These constraints collectively mitigate the risks of misclassifying known classes and failing to detect unknown classes. In Open-Detect, network flows are transformed into grayscale images, and each known traffic class is mapped to a unique Gaussian prototype in the latent space. This design ensures tight clustering of samples within the same class and clear separation of samples between different classes. The detection of unknown malicious traffic is performed based on the distance between samples and these prototypes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple publicly available datasets substantiate the efficacy of Open-Detect. The results reveal significant improvements in intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, enabling superior performance in both closed-world and open-world scenarios, particularly for detecting unknown malicious traffic.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of blockchain technology, the widespread adoption of smart contracts—particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications—has introduced significant security challenges, such as reentrancy attacks, phishing, and Sybil attacks. To address these issues, we propose a novel model called TrxGNNBERT, which combines Graph Neural Network (GNN) and the Transformer architecture to effectively handle both graph-structured and textual data. This combination enhances the detection of suspicious transactions and accounts on blockchain platforms like Ethereum. TrxGNNBERT was pre-trained using a masked language model (MLM) on a dataset of 60,000 Ethereum transactions by randomly masking the attributes of nodes and edges, thereby capturing deep semantic relationships and structural information. In this work, we constructed transaction subgraphs, using a GNN module to enrich the embedding representations, which were then fed into a Transformer encoder. The experimental results demonstrate that TrxGNNBERT outperforms various baseline models—including DeepWalk, Trans2Vec, Role2Vec, GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, Zipzap and BERT4ETH—in detecting suspicious transactions and accounts. Specifically, TrxGNNBERT achieved an accuracy of 0.755 and an F1 score of 0.756 on the TrxLarge dataset; an accuracy of 0.903 and an F1 score of 0.894 on the TrxSmall dataset; and an accuracy of 0.790 and an F1 score of 0.781 on the AddrDec dataset. We also explored different pre-training configurations and strategies, comparing the performance of encoder-based versus decoder-based Transformer structures. The results indicate that pre-training improves downstream task performance, with encoder-based structures outperforming decoder-based ones. Through ablation studies, we found that node-level information and subgraph structures are critical for achieving optimal performance in transaction classification tasks. When key features were removed, the model performance declined considerably, demonstrating the importance of each component of our method. These findings offer valuable insights for future research, suggesting further improvements in node attribute representation and subgraph extraction.},

  abstract     = {As Ethereum confronts increasingly sophisticated fraud threats, recent research seeks to improve fraud account detection by leveraging advanced pre-trained Transformer or self-supervised graph neural network. However, current Transformer-based methods rely on context-independent, numerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account transactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings. Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive linguistic representations, and leverages language modeling to learn transaction semantics. To clearly characterize the semantic differences between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training objective, which, together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective, learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning, which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on reconstructing account node features rather than graph structure. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising training quality. Additionally, we initialize the account nodes in the graph with expert-engineered features to inject empirical and statistical knowledge into the model. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our method against 15 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on two of the datasets. Furthermore, we observe from three datasets that the proposed method demonstrates strong generalization ability compared to previous work.

  abstract     = {Software-defined networks (SDNs) face significant challenges from link flooding attacks (LFAs), where malicious bots flood towards a limited number of hidden hosts, known as decoys, at a low rate. Efficient decoy identification is crucial for mitigating LFAs and is more resource-efficient than traditional bot detection methods, given the smaller number of decoys compared to bots. This paper proposes a novel decoy identification mechanism (DIM) that utilizes the SDN controller to generate forwarding rules for critical switches, enabling them to classify and report decoy addresses effectively. DIM addresses the challenges of minimizing communication overhead between the controller and data plane while maintaining high classification accuracy. It optimizes critical switch selection by partitioning the network into smaller areas, which reduces communication costs while maximizing monitoring efficiency. Within each area, DIM pre-trains random forest (RF) models for the selected switches and generates their respective binary-encoded forwarding rules. These rules empower the switches to identify decoy addresses in LFA traffic at line speed. The identified addresses are then reported back to DIM for further analysis. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that DIM scales efficiently in terms of time and space complexity. Our evaluation with the NS-3 simulator—using real CAIDA traffic and a synthesized topology of over 30,000 nodes—shows DIM achieves 98.3% decoy identification accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art models like LSTM and CNN in both accuracy and speed. Tests under routing changes and moving target defense scenarios confirm DIM’s robustness and adaptability, highlighting its practical effectiveness against LFAs.},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in numerous domains, yet they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks that can compromise their performance and ethical application. The detection of these attacks is crucial for maintaining the reliability and security of GNN classification tasks, but existing methods are often inflexible, relying on single metrics that fail to capture the full range of backdoor behaviors. Recognizing the challenge in detecting such intrusions, we devised a novel detection method that creatively leverages graph-level explanations. By extracting and transforming secondary outputs from GNN explanation mechanisms, we developed seven innovative metrics for effective detection of backdoor attacks on GNNs. Additionally, we develop an adaptive attack to rigorously evaluate our approach. We test our method on multiple benchmark datasets and examine its efficacy against various attack models. Our results show that our method can achieve high detection performance, marking a significant advancement in safeguarding GNNs against backdoor attacks.},

In particular, we provide a method based on hypothesis testing coupled with differential privacy and data variance estimation. Two differential privacy mechanisms protecting the releases of each agent’s current sample mean and two data variance estimation schemes are proposed, and we provide a theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm for any bounded unknown distributions on the agents’ data, showing that collaboration provides faster convergence than a fully local approach where agents do not share data. Moreover, we provide analytical performance curves for the case with an oracle class estimator, i.e., the class structure of the agents, where agents receiving data from distributions with the same mean are considered to be in the same class, is known. The theoretical faster-than-local convergence guarantee is backed up by extensive numerical results showing that for a considered scenario with 200 agents from two or three classes the proposed approach indeed converges much faster than a fully local approach, and performs comparably to the ideal (all-data-public) case. This illustrates the benefit of private collaboration in an online setting.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing has become the predominant platform for data sharing due to its adaptability, cost-effectiveness, and ability to scale resources according to user demand. Ensuring secure and efficient data sharing has long been a central research focus, with attribute-based encryption (ABE) serving as a key cryptographic primitive. In real-world scenarios, user attributes often change, necessitating timely revocation of access rights. Common user revocation methods include direct and indirect revocation. Direct revocation is controlled by the data owner, who adds revocation information to a list and embeds it into ciphertext to revoke permissions. Indirect revocation is managed by an authorized authority or delegated third party, dynamically publishing revocation information and generating new keys and ciphertexts. Conventional direct and indirect revocation methods incur substantial communication and computation overheads, limiting their practical effectiveness, particularly in environments with frequent user access terminations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel puncturable ciphertext-policy ABE scheme based on lattice cryptography for user revocation, eliminating the need for key regeneration and revocation-list maintenance. The proposed approach effectively resists collusion, quantum, and chosen-plaintext attacks, and experimental evaluations demonstrate its advantages in storage consumption, communication cost, and computational overhead.},

  abstract     = {As a collaborative framework designed to safeguard privacy, Federated Learning (FL) seeks to protect participants’ data throughout the training process. However, the framework still faces security risks from poisoning attacks, arising from the unmonitored process of client-side model updates. Most existing solutions address scenarios where less than half of clients are malicious, i.e., which leaves a significant challenge to defend against attacks when more than half of participants are malicious. In this paper, we propose a FL scheme, named FedAMM, that resists backdoor attacks across various data distributions and malicious client ratios. We develop a novel backdoor defense mechanism to filter out malicious models, aiming to reduce the performance degradation of the model. The proposed scheme addresses the challenge of distance measurement in high-dimensional spaces by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve clustering effectiveness. We borrow the idea of critical parameter analysis to enhance discriminative ability in non-iid data scenarios, via assessing the benign or malicious nature of models by comparing the similarity of critical parameters across different models. Finally, our scheme employs a hierarchical noise perturbation to improve the backdoor mitigation rate, effectively eliminating the backdoor and reducing the adverse effects of noise on task accuracy. Through evaluations conducted on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior backdoor defense across diverse client data distributions and different ratios of malicious participants. With 80% malicious clients, FedAMM achieves low backdoor attack success rates of 1.14%, 0.28%, and 5.53% on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, respectively, demonstrating enhanced robustness of FL against backdoor attacks.},

In this paper, we propose a secure beamforming design framework for integrated sensing, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication and over-the-air computation (AirComp) networks, which can provide multi-functional intelligent services for communication-intensive, computation-intensive, delay-sensitive and security-sensitive applications. In the considered network, each dual-functional intelligent device engages in NOMA information transmission and AirComp. Meanwhile, the triple-functional base station conducts target sensing, NOMA signal decoding and data aggregation simultaneously. Our aim is to maximize the sum secrecy rate (SSR) of NOAM devices while ensuring that the quality of service requirements for both sensing and AirComp are met within the transmit power constraints imposed on all nodes. The formulated optimization problem involves coupled variables and logarithmic determinant, thus it is highly non-convex. To solve it, we propose an efficient matrix-extended generalized Lagrangian dual transformation based algorithm with penalty method, which can obtain the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution to the original problem with low-complexity and convergence guarantee. Additionally, the well-known successive convex approximation based algorithm is also employed to address the formulated SSR maximization problem. However, its computational complexity significantly exceeds that of our proposed algorithm.

However, existing researches primarily focused on accuracy, often overlooking the role of large-scale pre-trained parameters in enhancing robustness. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models trained from scratch can achieve high accuracy, they exhibit limited robustness. When subjected to network noise in real-world, their identification results can fluctuate significantly, which is unacceptable. Unfortunately, current robustness evaluation methods neglect samples diversity and employ unreasonable noise settings. This field still lacks a reasonable quantitative description of models robustness. In this paper, we propose the PA-curve to display the distribution of sample’s correct-decision stability, which can simultaneously reflect the model’s accuracy and robustness. By calculating the area under the PA-curve, called PA-area, we enable the quantitative assessment of robustness for encrypted traffic analysis. Furthermore, we design a pre-trained model based on packet length sequence, and pre-trained it on TB-scale traffic. By fine-tuning on limited labeled training data, it can achieve downstream analysis tasks. We conduct experiments on five encrypted traffic datasets with different tasks. Besides accuracy, we analyzed the robustness of the pre-trained model and existing methods under common network disturbances, including packet loss, retransmission, and disorder. Experimental results demonstrated that, compared to ML-based and DL-based models trained from scratch, the pre-trained model can not only achieve high accuracy, but also exhibit greater resilience to network noise.

  abstract     = {Encryption technologies randomize network communication to protect user privacy. However, attackers exploit encrypted traffic to conceal malicious activities. The existing detection methods rely primarily on traffic content or interactive patterns. Nevertheless, static methods can be easily obfuscated by advanced attacks. Since the set of potential attacks is open and infinite, models regularly lose effectiveness against novel attacks. Robust encrypted malicious traffic detection remains a valuable research area. In this paper, we propose BSTS-Net, a robust unsupervised encrypted malicious traffic detection model based entirely on traffic relations. The key motivations are to construct a relation-based traffic contextual representation and to establish dynamic baselines for anomaly detection. To represent local relations within flows, we innovatively introduce the concept of traffic microelements, which capture fine-grained interaction pattern relations. To integrate the global relationships between flows, we construct a traffic microelement space based on the Siamese neural network. Three optimization functions are proposed to optimize the intraservice, interservice and internode relations. For robust detection, we introduce a reputation-enhanced dynamic encrypted traffic detection algorithm that constructs dynamic baselines and continuously detects novel anomalies. We evaluate BSTS-Net through extensive experiments on three datasets and compare it with seven SOTA methods. Our results demonstrate its superiority, with an F1 score of more than 99.63% across all the datasets in multiclassification scenarios. Additionally, we simulate three adversarial scenarios for robustness analysis. Although the baseline methods experience an F1 score degradation of 32.21%, BSTS-Net achieves high performance, with only 1% degradation.},

In addition, in the frequency domain (FD), a closed-form joint jamming detection and channel estimation scheme is derived using the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) principle as a function of the statistics of the received pilots and virtual subcarriers (VSCs) signals, which is then re-expressed using the generalized MAP ratio test (GMAPRT). The system’s complexity is reduced by applying the two stages sequentially, where the possible implementation of the second stage is conditioned on the outcome of the first stage. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations, where the results demonstrate its effectiveness compared to the TD-only and FD-only approaches.

To verify whether DP AI models can provide privacy guarantee (quantified by privacy budget) as these models claim, existing methods utilize attack methods to audit whether privacy budget of these models is the same as these models claim. To further improve precision of privacy budget auditing, we propose a brand new way to audit privacy budget, namely directly utilizing the parameters of DP AI models to audit privacy budget. In particular, our method utilizes statistical characteristics variance of the output distribution of DP mechanism to audit privacy budget of DP mechanism. DP AI models are regarded as data samples from output distribution of DP AI model training method and are utilized to approximate the variance of output distribution. The approximated variance is leveraged to estimate the variance of noise distribution of DP mechanism and through the relationship between noise variance and privacy budget, our method calculates the audited privacy budget through estimated noise variance. In addition, to reduce computation overhead, our method constructs parameter selection strategy to identify position whose parameter is suitable for privacy budget auditing. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our auditing method. Comparison results of five competitive auditing methods demonstrate that our method decreases MAE by 18.29% and decreases MSE by 23.17% on experiment datasets.},

  abstract     = {Person Re-identification (ReID) primarily involves the extraction of discriminative representations derived from morphological characteristics, gait patterns, and related attributes. While camera-based Person ReID methods yield notable results, their reliability diminishes in scenarios involving long distances and limited illumination. LiDAR enables the precise acquisition of human point cloud sequences across extended distances, unaffected by variations in lighting or similar factors. Nevertheless, current LiDAR-based Person ReID techniques are limited to static measurements, rendering them susceptible to perturbations from attire variations, occlusions, and similar confounding factors. To address these issues, this manuscript introduces MOJO, which is applied to 4D LiDAR point clouds to extract unique motion patterns specific to individuals. To characterize the motion patterns across two consecutive point cloud frames, MOJO employs optimal transport to compute point-wise motion vectors, thereby enabling the identification of discriminative implicit motion information. To mitigate the attenuation of point cloud density induced by self-occlusion during dynamic motion, MOJO leverages inverse point-wise flow information to integrate forward frames, thereby yielding a comprehensive representation, whilst concurrently ameliorating the effects of heterogeneous density distribution within localized regions of the 4D point cloud data. Additionally, the inherent unordered nature and sparsity of 4D point clouds present significant obstacles to capturing discriminative features. We develop the 3D joint graph to extract scalable fine-grained traits and employ the joint pyramid pooling module to conduct hierarchical spatiotemporal aggregation across the 4D point clouds. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that MOJO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on the LReID dataset (for LiDAR-based Person Re-identification) and SUSTech1k dataset (for LiDAR-based Gait Recognition) without any pre-training while exhibiting robust performance across various point cloud densities.

Specifically, a hybrid analog-digital MIMO architecture is adopted, and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is deployed for wideband communication over frequency-selective mmWave channels. The antenna array structure and frequency selectivity of the system under investigation inherently endow it with multi-dimensional channel characteristics spanning the space, frequency, and time domains, which can be efficiently processed with tensor-based multi-dimensional signal processing techniques. The problem, based on tensor modeling of the system, is decomposed into three subproblems, namely analog beamforming, digital beamforming, and AN precoding. A low-complexity two-stage procedure is proposed to conduct analog beamforming, where a Tucker2 tensor decomposition subproblem is formulated to determine the analog combiners and part of the analog precoding matrix, and the remaining part of the precoding matrix is composed of arbitrary vectors satisfying the constant modulus constraint. The block-diagonalization algorithm is employed to design the digital beamforming and combining matrices to mitigate interference. For the AN precoding part, a statistical null-space algorithm based on higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) is proposed. Multiple AN precoding matrices on all subcarriers can be obtained simultaneously, and the AN-induced interference to the potential eavesdropper is maximized statistically to improve the secrecy of the communication. Simulation results show that, compared with existing matrix-based AN-aided secure HBF designs in the literature, the proposed tensor-based joint HBF and AN design leveraging multi-dimensional tensor signal processing provides improved secrecy performance with moderate complexity.},

The detection of access-control vulnerabilities in Java web applications poses unique challenges, because heuristics used in the past, e.g., access-control specifications or format-specific runtime logs, may not exist in modern Java web applications using web frameworks. Therefore, to date, there is no effective approach to detecting such vulnerabilities in modern Java web applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, called PCFinder, which leverages multi-level semantics- and context-analysis to conduct accurate permission-check identifications against real-world Java web infrastructures for access-control vulnerability detection. PCFinder successfully discovered 58 high-risk broken access control vulnerabilities, with 30 having been assigned CVE identifiers thus far, in analyzing 50 popular, real-world Java web applications. We also evaluate PCFinder on manually constructed ground-truth data and show that PCFinder achieved a high level of accuracy, i.e., a precision of 94.12% and a recall of 96.97% in identifying permission checks.},

However, as the UAV swarm scales up, the large number of UAVs poses challenges in data consensus, which is essential for decision-making in UAV tasks. In particular, due to the limited resources of UAVs and complex environments, data consensus for swarms requires low energy consumption, high robustness, and high security. To this end, we design a lightweight data consensus mechanism suitable for large-scale UAV swarms. Firstly, considering the high mobility of UAVs, we cluster the UAV swarms based on motion similarity to maintain the stability of clustering. Subsequently, we propose a consensus algorithm named FHotStuff, which achieves low resource consumption by integrating HotStuff and flexible round-optimized Schnorr threshold signatures (Frost). Then, we develop a cross-cluster consensus mechanism. By cooperating with intra-cluster and inter-cluster consensus processes, the mechanism efficiently achieves data consensus in large-scale UAV swarms. Security analyses and performance evaluations show that the proposed scheme can resist common attacks against UAV networks, and validate its lightweight and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a physical layer key generation (PLKG) scheme that utilizes artificial randomness in extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) near-field multi-user communications to produce shared secret keys for legitimate users. Unlike traditional PLKG schemes, which rely on the variation of wireless channels, this approach introduces noise power via the precoding vectors to create dynamic fluctuations in the line-of-sight (LoS) channels, emulating the rapid changes typically observed in fast-fading channels. This artificial randomness ensures that the user equipment (UEs) can generate secret keys while effectively preventing potential eavesdropping from malicious eavesdroppers. In particular, a novel channel probing protocol is designed, enabling multiple UEs to simultaneously agree on secret keys with the base station (BS) using non-orthogonal pilots, which exploits the difference in the distances and spatial angles of UEs in near-field communications. Secondly, to maximize the secret key rate, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed, solving two sub-optimization problems. The first sub-problem employs the singular value decomposition (SVD) method to identify the legitimate space and its orthogonal subspace for generating secret keys and preventing eavesdropping attacks, respectively. Subsequently, a Dinkelbach method-based power allocation algorithm is developed to allocate noise power to these two spaces. The second sub-problem uses a water-filling algorithm to implement power allocation among multiple UEs. Finally, to address the issue of precoding noise not being considered in the alternating optimization problem, a deep learning-based method is introduced, which further improves the performance of the scheme. Simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed PLKG scheme over existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Complex environments pose significant challenges to the consensus estimation of ground targets by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) with limited sensing capabilities. This paper addresses the design of an H∞ consensus fuzzy filter over a finite-time horizon, that is subject to selective network attacks and stochastic incomplete measurements. First, a novel selective-data-based (SDB) network attack model is proposed. Unlike conventional models, this model is constructed from the attacker’s perspective to mimic attacks that target high-value data, thereby maximizing its destructive potential. Second, incomplete measurements, arising from factors such as limited UAV sensing ranges and target motion, are modeled by using a set of random variables to characterize the stochastic nature of data loss. Furthermore, an H∞ consensus fuzzy filter is developed to achieve precise consensus estimation of the target with finite-time performance, thereby forming a unified attack-defense architecture. Sufficient conditions for the existence of such a filter are established in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), from which the filter gains can be derived. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed design are validated through both numerical simulations and physical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Specific emitter identification (SEI) is a security authentication technology by utilizing radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) features. However, current mainstream RFF feature extraction methods based on neural networks (NNs) generally suffer from poor interpretability and difficulties in architecture optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel convolution-enhanced swin vision transformer (CoSwinVIT) that combines filter characteristics of NN architectures to achieve a uniform spectrum response. Specifically, we treat the NN used in SEI tasks as filters and investigate their filter characteristics by applying Fourier transforms to hidden vectors. Through spectral analysis, we found that different NN architectures exhibit significantly different responses to the signal spectrum. This affects the model’s sensitivity to specific frequency bands of the signal, thereby influencing its accuracy (Acc). Subsequently, by integrating the filtering properties of swin vision transformer (SwinVIT) and convolutional neural network (CNN), we achieve a uniform spectral response design. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the CoSwinVIT architecture, we design both a supervised learning algorithm and a contrastive learning-based self-supervised algorithm. Experimental results on a real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) dataset indicate that CoSwinVIT provides a more uniform spectrum response. Under supervised learning, the proposed CoSwinVIT obtains the accuracies of 98.6% and 99.8% on the ADS-B and WiFi datasets, respectively. Under self-supervised learning with 5% and 10% labeled data, the accuracies of 73.6% and 86.3% are achieved on the ADS-B dataset, and the accuracies of 81.6% and 91.5% are achieved on the WiFi dataset. These results surpass the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods used in the SEI tasks.},
